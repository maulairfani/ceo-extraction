We have successfully expanded our gross margin by 180 bps to 38.2% and delivered a healthy free cash flow of EUR 586 million, representing 8.7% of sales. Despite adverse market conditions, our teams have worked particularly hard to achieve this result and put Signify in a strong financial position for the year ahead.\n\nWhile the consumer connected segment continued to be squeezed by the double impact of inflation and reduced disposable incomes, business and public customers demonstrated readiness to invest in energy efficiency measures that lend protection from volatile energy markets and help them stay in step with emissions reduction targets. As a result, we are gaining ground in connected professional systems and\n\nservices, with connected lighting and growth platforms reaching 30% of sales and LED now making up 85% of sales.\n\nWith challenging conditions set to continue through 2024, we announced in December that we will continue our transformation to enable us to execute our strategy at speed and work more closely in line with customers' fast-changing needs. Our new operating model will be organized around four vertically integrated businesses. Three of these will focus on customers: Professional, OEM, and Consumer. The fourth will be dedicated to conventional lighting technologies. Aligned to this new verticalized, customer-centric structure, we will adjust the size of our central organization and further reduce our structural costs. Already started in Q4 2023, these changes will be implemented through 2024, with the majority achieved in Q2, and are expected to generate annualized savings in excess of EUR 200 million.",

Signify continued to build on the strong foundation of our Brighter Lives, Better World sustainability program that addresses climate action, circularity, and our impact on society.\n\nIn 2023, we reported our full scope Green House Gas emissions, including the full Scope 3. We are proud to have achieved a cumulative carbon reduction of 334 million tonnes CO2e more than required by the Paris Agreement 1.5\u00b0C pathway since 2019. We received reasonable assurance for this achievement which is an unprecedented milestone for a multinational manufacturing company like Signify with tens of thousands of products in our portfolio. With accurate emissions data at the product level, we are driving transparency of the environmental impact of our products, and enabling our customers to make informed decisions on sustainable products.\n\nSignify has powered its operations with 100% renewable electricity since 2020. This year, we secured our access to renewable electricity in Europe for the next ten years through a Virtual Power Purchase Agreement in partnership with Philips, HEINEKEN, and Nobian. We surpassed our Circular revenues target and are within one percentage point of our Brighter Lives revenue targets, which I encourage you to read about in detail later in this report.\n\nThe strength of our commitment to sustainability was recognized once again with top independent ratings including S&P's Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment, the EcoVadis Platinum Medal, placing us in the top 1% of all companies assessed, and inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for a seventh consecutive year.\n\n## Innovation beyond illumination\n\nInnovation is in our DNA and is essential to keep pace with the demands of this rapidly changing world. Our intellectual property portfolio continues to expand. Signify holds more intellectual property with the European Patent Office than any other lighting company\n\nand we are in the top ten of all companies headquartered in Europe by number of patents.\n\nIn 2023, we invested 4.2% of our sales in research and development, successfully targeting key strategic technologies. We further expanded our Ultra Efficient portfolio which is 50-60% more energy efficient than first-generation LED light sources. We continued to develop our 3D printing business under the Philips MyCreation brand, opening a fifth facility in Australia and delivering the first bio-circular based 3D-printed housings. For consumers, we extended our home connected proposition, launching deeply integrated lighting and home monitoring solutions under the umbrella of our trusted Philips Hue and WiZ brands.\n\nOur innovation team rose to the lighting industry's ultimate challenge this year, winning in both tracks of the Prototype Phase of the US Department of Energy's prestigious L-Prize competition. This accolade joins eight Red Dot Design Awards and eight iF Awards in 2023 for excellence in design.\n\n## Prioritizing customer satisfaction\n\nThe past three years have been marked by supply chain disruptions that impacted our deliveries and our customers. Managing this issue has been a top priority across our business, to the extent that in 2023, we made order and delivery customer satisfaction scores part of annual incentive KPIs for everyone in our organization. We implemented a centrally driven program including systemic running LEAN improvements and Kaizens in cross-functional teams, steadily improving our order and delivery customer satisfaction over eight consecutive quarters. In 2023, our satisfaction score doubled versus 2022. While there is more work to be done, I am confident that we will maintain a fast rate of progress and bring customers' order and delivery satisfaction fully in line with the excellence we strive to achieve in every aspect of the customer experience.\n\n## A digital future\n\nOur digitalization roadmap charts our progress in creating future-ready processes, customer interfaces, and products. Investing in core data science competencies has",

All global customer care centers are now powered by generative AI, which has significantly improved customer experience. AI has also been deployed in the design of our 3D-printed luminaires, where an end-to-end fine-tuned text to image model generates texture images.\n\nOn customer interfaces, we launched an enhanced digital platform for our professional customers that has increased our agent engagement and enabled e-commerce in the United States. Our global e-commerce platform resulted in an increase in our B2B online revenue generation.\n\n## Building an inclusive performance culture\n\nIt is our ambition to build an inclusive culture and work environment where people can express their talents and grow personally and professionally in an environment that is guided by our values. In 2023, our focus has been on building a performance culture, strengthening our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and developing internal talent. Our initiatives included enhanced leadership programs to benefit new and existing leaders, now including focused training on inclusivity. This focus on learning extends throughout the organization, filling our internal talent pipeline and creating a workplace where people can thrive and develop. Our Inclusivity Index, measured as part of the team survey, is 84%, which is higher than the industry benchmark.\n\nAs we move to a new operating model that will unleash talent across the company, bringing us closer to our customers and driving faster decision-making with greater autonomy and ownership, we must also undertake significant change. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our employees who have contributed to make Signify what it is today. I am grateful for their unwavering professionalism and commitment to take us through this new phase of our development.\n\nI would like to extend my appreciation and gratitude to Maria Letizia Mariani, CCO and Division Leader for Conventional Lighting, and to Javier van Engelen, CFO, who will leave the company in the first half of 2024. As members of our Board of Management, their guiding influence has played an important role in ensuring our strong operational position today. I wish them every success for the future.\n\nIn the coming months, the Supervisory Board will be evaluating candidates for the role of Chief Financial Officer. As Signify moves to the new operating model announced in December, it has been agreed not to renew the role of Chief Commercial Officer.\n\n## Toward a brighter future\n\nEverything we achieved in 2023 was made possible by the talent, foresight, and diligence of our Signify teams around the world. For this, they have my sincere admiration and gratitude. I would also like to thank our customers and shareholders, whose trust in our company and brands makes progress possible. Although we will undoubtedly face challenges in the year ahead, I go into it with pride in what we continue to achieve in difficult circumstances, and with great confidence that the organization we are building is ready with the smart lighting solutions the world needs for a brighter future.\n\n## Eric Rondolat\n\nCEO Signify\n\n<!-- image -->",

With more than 31,900 employees, a presence in 74 countries and sales covering a global market, our purpose is to unlock the extraordinary potential of light for brighter lives and a better world.\n\nWe have pioneered many key breakthroughs in lighting over the past 130 years and have been a driving force behind several leading technological innovations. Signify continues to innovate in LED lighting and is leading the industry's expansion to lighting systems in both the professional and consumer markets. Our position as industry leader in connected lighting, makes Signify the lighting company for the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\n## Strategic context\n\nThe global landscape continued to evolve this year, marked by ongoing political and economic shifts. Building on the previous year's challenges, despite an easing of resource scarcity and supply chain normalization, higher interest rates, weaker economic outlooks and increased geopolitical uncertainties had a marked impact. These factors influenced both consumer and business spending. The trend towards energy-efficient solutions continues to be of importance, fueled by the desire to mitigate rising costs and adopt sustainable practices.\n\nAnnually, Signify engages in a Strategic Review Process, alongside a comprehensive Sustainability Materiality Assessment (detailed in chapter 4, Brighter Lives, Better World). These initiatives, encompassing a broad spectrum of internal and external stakeholders, are instrumental in forecasting future trends and assimilating global and local stakeholder insights. This strategic approach is crucial in navigating the risks and opportunities that affect our sustainable long-term value creation potential.\n\nFollowing our 2023 review, despite a demanding environment that necessitated expedited actions in certain domains, our commitment to the 5 Frontiers strategy and the advancement of our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 goals remains as pertinent as ever.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Since the grand opening in April 2023, over 200,000 cyclists and pedestrians have used the tunnel. The unique light also enhances the blue running floor throughout the tunnel, which has become a popular location to exercise.\n\nThe project is a collaboration between Bybanen Utbygging, architect AFRY, Light Bureau, LOS Elektro, and Signify Norway.\n\n'The user groups of the pedestrian and bicycle tunnel were the main focus of the project. The lighting system helps to substantiate that the tunnel is perceived as safe, clear, welcoming, and comfortable. A good collaboration between lighting designer, installation contractor, lighting supplier and client has provided good solutions, which has led to the project also receiving considerable international attention. The tunnel is widely used, both for commuting to and from work, and for fitness training for sports teams and individuals.'\n\nSvein Arvid Oppedal, Construction manager, Bybanen Utbygging\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<\n\n\u2261\n\n>",

Now, Philips Hue and WiZ customers can make their connected lighting system work smarter with home monitoring products and features, accessed directly from their smartphone.\n\nBeyond smart lighting with Philips Hue Secure\n\nPhilips Hue Secure cameras feature a clear 1080p HD video feed with night vision to help you monitor your home in real time and trigger instant motion notifications. You can help deter intruders by triggering the unique combination of Philips Hue lights and sound alarms, or you can activate two-way talk to tell a delivery person to leave the package or just say 'Hi!' to a friendly face. Philips Hue cameras feature superior end-to-end encryption using keys that never leave the user's device, ensuring any video clips, snapshots, and live view remain strictly private. Specifically, the capability to recognize whether a notification is triggered by a person, a pet or a package runs on the camera itself instead of the cloud, which means end-to-end encryption is always enabled.\n\nContact sensors trigger an alert when a window, door, cabinet, or safe opens, and can even activate lights.\n\nThe Security Center in the Philips Hue app gives access to light alarms, camera controls, presence mimicking, real-time alerts, and more. Annual subscription plans unlock advanced features like video history and the ability to divide your space into discrete zones.\n\nAccessible home monitoring from WiZ With indoor and outdoor lights that mimic presence or trigger light alarms, and cameras with night vision and motion detection, WiZ keeps an eye on your entire home. With unique SpaceSense technology, every WiZ light becomes a motion sensor. SpaceSense makes use of disturbances in Wi-Fi waves to detect a person's presence.\n\nCameras can be triggered with motion, sound, or the WiZ app. And by upgrading to a WiZ security subscription service, users can unlock additional camera features to detect unexpected activity, deter intruders, and keep up to date with real-time alerts. With end-to-end encryption by default, customers can be confident that content from the camera remains private.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<\n\n\u2261\n\n>",

The eye-catching luminaire features a transparent sleeve in the club's distinct green color, embossed with the Werder diamond. Most of the materials used in the luminaire are from biocircular materials such as biomass and natural waste, which are processed into polycarbonate to be used in the 3D printing process. And as a circular lighting solution, the shade and its transparent sleeve can be recycled at the end of their useful life.\n\nThis unique item is an extension of a premium partnership between Signify and Werder Bremen dating back to 2022. In the first phase of its partnership with Signify, the club installed UV-C air disinfection lighting in team areas, meeting rooms, and offices to permanently neutralize viruses and pathogens using ultraviolet light, improving health and well-being at the club. This was followed by VIP area lighting, LED aisle lighting, and e-sports room lighting. 3D-printed pendant and table lamps extend the green and white theme through the VIP areas.\n\n\"In a soccer stadium, many different requirements for modern lighting come together. We are very happy to have found a partner in Signify who was able to respond to our individual wishes and even make the hearts of our fans beat faster with a branded Werder luminaire from the 3D printer.'\n\nKlaus Filbry, CEO SV Werder Bremen GmbH & Co KG aA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is achieved with state-of-the-art Philips flood lights accentuating the pylons and 20,000 Philips RGB direct view nodes along the cable stay. The concentrated areas can be used to run media images, logos, messages, and light shows for special occasions, while the use of energy-efficient LED keeps running costs and emissions in check.\n\nThis was no simple feat. The fixtures were specially engineered for extreme conditions to withstand high wind pressure, sun rays, dust, rain, and the salty environment. All the direct view node light fixtures and accessories were specifically designed and manufactured for this project.

The city set out to upgrade its street lighting to LED to take advantage of the substantial cost-saving benefits, but quickly identified an opportunity to advance its smart city plan and unlock greater value for its citizens. This effort aimed to deliver free Wi-Fi connectivity to citizens, enabling digital equity, supporting community safety, and complementing Dark Sky efforts.\n\n30,000 street lights were upgraded with connectivity, and divided into four distinct zones, each with their own dimming patterns based on the area's requirements. By strategically dimming the street lights, the city can also reduce energy use. All lights are designed to minimize upward reflection, helping to preserve the area's famous clear desert skies. Signify's Interact control system allowed the city to have access to diagnostic and energy data. With Interact, city managers know instantly when a light goes out, so they can efficiently deploy a maintenance team to fix it. By extending its street lighting infrastructure with connected technology, Mesa laid the foundation to unlock even more value for its city and citizens.\n\nMesa also saw an opportunity to advance digital equity within the city by providing reliable public Wi-Fi coverage across the 26 km sq downtown area. Signify BrightSites offered a scalable solution through which the city could install broadband communication nodes by upgrading its street lights on existing city poles, creating a wireless mesh network and enabling wireless fiber connectivity.\n\nThe sleek BrightSites aesthetic blended seamlessly into the downtown area without visible wiring. The city's wireless broadband solution also powers cameras and sensors to provide real-time smart city support.\n\nWith this infrastructure in place, so much more is possible. Mesa continues to evolve its street lighting plans to meet the changing demands of a growing smart city, including sensors to monitor traffic, air quality, and noise, and further drive quality of life improvements for its people.\n\n\"With Signify's technology, our street lighting network has evolved into a multipurpose smart city platform. It supports our sustainability efforts, has allowed us to expand broadband access into key neighborhoods, and gives us parking analytics and so much more.'\n\nHarry Meier, Deputy CIO for Innovation, City of Mesa\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

With actionable, easyto-access data, building owners can analyze their space, environmental conditions, and occupancy more effectively to create attractive buildings for potential tenants.\n\nEnvironmental sensors distributed around the office space monitor temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide levels, levels of volatile organic compounds, and atmospheric pressure. People sensors count the number of people in a room or floor to avoid overcrowding and improve productivity. Combining data from both sensors helps tenants and owners adjust working conditions to create the best conditions for employees. With a full picture of how space is used, building managers can implement energy efficient measures for reduced energy costs and a lower carbon footprint.\n\nWith this intelligence on board, property managers can create human centric workplaces and healthier building environments, plus advance goals to achieve healthy building standard certification such as the WELL Building Standard, which links design, policies, and built environment strategies to health and well-being outcomes. This standard, in turn, can attract high-quality tenants and secure longer, more valuable lease contracts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The site's managers were all too familiar with the limitations of this system. Metal halide bulbs degrade over time, creating color inconsistencies across the space. The bulbs had a 15,000-hour lifespan, so needed to be frequently replaced. With ceiling heights upwards of 30 meters in parts of the center, maintenance hours and costs quickly stacked up. And even when the system was in good repair, the lighting required a 15-minute warm-up period to get up and running and produced an audible humming sound.\n\nThe building's management knew that something had to change, but they were not yet ready to replace the center's existing lighting controls. Working with partner Reflex Lighting, BCEC selected a retrofit solution featuring Metalux Benchmark LED High Bay fixtures from Cooper Lighting Solutions. 378 fixtures were installed in three phases so that exhibition halls could remain open while the work was underway.\n\nResults were visible from the outset. Warm-up time and color inconsistency are a thing of the past, since the LEDs switch on immediately and bring events to life with quiet, clean, consistent lighting. The new lights are durable and longer lasting, with low maintenance needs, and consume far less electricity than the metal halide bulbs that were previously in place. And when the BCEC is ready to upgrade its lighting control system, the future-ready fixtures can be easily reconfigured to work with the new system.\n\n'We host the bar exam here for the Massachusetts lawyers. They always complained that they couldn't focus on their test because of the noise. There are no longer any complaints about that. Many of our clients like certain light fixtures turned on over booths. With the old fixtures, we had to turn off the whole section, and now we have control to shut off individual lights. And that is not to mention the 56% energy savings. We couldn't be happier.'\n\nTom Finn, Electrical Foreman, BCEC\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<\n\n\u2261\n\n>",

They wanted a solution that would provide high-quality lighting in areas that are difficult to reach through the electrical grid, with minimal impact on the area's sensitive natural landscape.\n\nThe solution was found in Philips Smartbright All-in-one Solar Street Light. These fully autonomous lights do not require cabling, so they could be installed easily without damaging nature or scenery. And with a lighting system that operates on 100% solar energy, there are no electricity costs or carbon emissions during the product's use phase.\n\nWith 200 of the lights in place along the 11km stretch of road, people can travel with a greater sense of security, which in turn opens up economic opportunities for local businesses. Motorists can pass safely along the route for improved distribution of local plantation products.\n\nSignify's solar public street lighting on the Aek Natolu road not only ensures traveler safety day and night but also aligns with the government's goals for carbon neutrality by 2060 and Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. This stands as a shining example of the global 'Green Switch' campaign launched in Indonesia in the same year, urging a shift towards energy-efficient LED and connected lighting, including scaling up the use of renewables through solar street lighting, as the simplest and most often overlooked paths to reduce carbon emissions.\n\n'The Aek Natolu Road is part of the government's program to support Toba Regency as a national tourism strategic area. One of the challenges of building this road is the complex electrical installation that requires an off-grid system. Therefore, we decided to use Signify's Solar Public Street Lighting (PJUTS) solution, which is easy and fast to install. We are also excited because the LED PJUTS technology can provide maximum lighting so that it can increase safety for motorists to pass through the route without worry.\"\n\nEllys Denny Loan Aruan, Field Supervisor of PPK 2.6 North Sumatra Province, Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The normative integration period is two years. Divestitures completed before December 31, 2023 are excluded from environmental and social reporting.\n\n## 4.1.4 Materiality assessment\n\nOur commitment to sustainability holds significance and influence when directed towards addressing the most relevant issues. Long-term success hinges on a comprehensive understanding and consideration of our societal and environmental impacts, recognizing the potential effects of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors on our business. It is imperative to gauge the perspectives of our stakeholders on these ESG issues and align our focus accordingly. This section outlines the approach and outcome of our double materiality assessment that was conducted in 2023. The gathered insights play a pivotal role in defining our sustainability objectives, priorities and framework; and shape our key performance indicators, targets, reporting and strategy.\n\n## Assessment approach\n\nIn preparation for the upcoming European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), our double materiality assessment was conducted using the guidance and interpretation of the CSRD guidelines ESRS 1: General requirements and\n\nESRS 2: General disclosures (draft version November 2022), as the full CSRD legislation was not yet finalized at the time of this assessment. This assessment was conducted in partnership with an independent, external third-party sustainability consultancy with expertise and guidance on how to best align with relevant standards and best practices.\n\nOur double materiality assessment was carried out considering the impact that Signify's activities have on the environment and stakeholders (outward -impact materiality) and the impact that the environment, people and stakeholders have on Signify's business activities (inwardfinancial materiality).\n\n## Identify ESG Topics\n\nIt is crucial that our materiality assessment relies on a comprehensive list of ESG topics, encompassing all areas potentially relevant to Signify. As a starting point, desk research was conducted consisting of a review of internal and external documentation. The internal analysis was performed by analyzing strategic documents, previous materiality analyses and stakeholder dialogues and linking the contents with the 10 ESG topics and various underlying sub-topics described in the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) which form the backbone of the CSRD. The internal analysis indicated that Signify reports on the majority of ESG-topics, with a primary emphasis on climate mitigation through energy efficiency.\n\nNext, external analysis was performed for our peers, suppliers and customers. The external analysis demonstrated that most external actors are actively reporting on and engaged in similar sustainability topics, while the importance and focus varies slightly.\n\n## Stakeholder perspectives\n\nWe engaged with the stakeholders considered most relevant to our company including customers, employees, suppliers, investors and analysts, governments, and civil society organizations. These stakeholders are most likely to be impacted by our activities and have the most influence on achieving our commitments.

Stakeholders were engaged namely through one- on-one interviews and an online survey. Stakeholders were asked to reflect on the outcomes of our last materiality assessment, particularly focusing on the definitions and assessment of topics; to reflect on the list of topics included in last year's assessment and discussing potential changes to be incorporated in the new long list; and to explore the negative and positive impacts of Signify's own operations and its value chains.\n\nUsing the insight from the internal analysis, external analyses, and the interviews, our shortlist of ESG topics was drafted. The interviews and the survey were conclusive, both from an impact and a financial materiality perspective, Climate action and Circular economy were viewed as the most material topics .\n\n## Assessing outward and inward impacts\n\nAs a final step, in line with the principles of double materiality, we held workshops with internal subject matter experts to determine the potential impacts that our ESG topics could have on Signify's performance and business overall, in terms of risks and opportunities which could have an impact on our ability to create value and the impact of Signify on people, environment and society.\n\nThe assessment of materiality followed the logic prescribed by the CSRD. For impact materiality, the assessment was based on 'severity;' which looks at scale, scope and remediability; and 'likelihood', stemming from the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Human Rights. For the scoring of the financial impacts two factors were applied: financial magnitude and likelihood.\n\nOur materiality matrix serves as a solid foundation on which our sustainability actions and non-financial reporting will be shaped going forward. We have started by identifying the applicable standards and indicators as set forward in the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), describing the management approach of the identified material issues, updating policies and procedures and reviewing and setting targets for each of the material topics. Additionally, in the next year we will further integrate and register the associated risks and opportunities of the material issues into our Enterprise Risk Management process allowing us to manage and mitigate potential impacts, on the business.\n\nWe plan to conduct a comprehensive sustainability materiality assessment every two years, however, will continue to engage stakeholders annually on ESG topics to ensure we remain focused on the most material topics.\n\n## 2023 Conclusions\n\nThe outcome of our double materiality assessment confirmed that Climate action and Circular Economy are the two most material topics. Human Rights, Diversity, equity and inclusion, Health & safety at work, Talent & development, Cybersecurity and privacy, Digitalization and Responsible mineral sourcing are also identified as material topics\n\non the basis of CSRD, and therefore included in our strategic focus and this chapter. We will continue to report on Business ethics, as our Integrity code sets the standard for business conduct of our employees and for the company itself and underpins related material policies. The result of the materiality assessment has been reviewed and approved by the Leadership Team and the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Double materiality matrix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our 2023 people strategic initiatives centered around leveraging diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) as our competitive edge, strengthening our performance culture, and developing our internal talent.\n\nWe reinforced our commitment to drive equitable and inclusive practices in the organization and increased representation on both on gender and generational diversity. In 2023, we particularly focused on hiring 400+ campus hires which is also inline with our talent strategy to hire at the entry level of our organization and promote from within. We filled more than 50% of our vacancies in all the levels of our\n\norganization with internal talent. We continued to focus on key developmental interventions like our upskilling program, Basics & Beyond, for Commercial Leaders, and P EDGE for our plant managers. The inclusive leadership model has been integrated into the iEDGE leadership program, targeting our new people leaders. In 2023, we introduced an Inclusion Index, incorporating it into our team survey to gauge the level of inclusivity experienced by our employees and ensure every voice is heard.\n\nWe further built on Unlock Performance practices through constructive checkins, feedforward, continuous learning, and a culture of appreciation. Our Employee Share Purchase Plan expanded covering more than 70% of our employees fostering ownership. Our transformation continues with changes in our operating model. In order to leverage the full power of our new operating model, we are sharpening our definition of our values and behaviors which will be required for us to perform and win.\n\nI am proud of the resilience and adaptability of our employees in the face of complexities and challenges. I have a lot of confidence that we will continue to be Greater Together in the face of continuing business challenges in 2024.\"",

The data provided in subsections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 excludes contingent workers and employees that have not been fully integrated in our human resources system which represents 28% of our FTEs.\n\n## Employees in FTEs\n\n|               | 2021                       | 2022   | 2023   |\n|---------------|----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Signify total | 36,824    34,619    31,920 |        |        |\n\nApproximately 57% of our employees were employed by one of our three divisions, focusing on manufacturing, offer development and research and development. 28% were employed in one of our commercial organizations, focusing on sales and marketing. The remaining 15% worked in corporate functions. During 2023, the overall number of employees (in FTEs) decreased with a majority of the reduction in the direct workforce. This is in line with the ongoing external workforce changes and digital transformation, and we expect the nature of the current workforce will continue to evolve.\n\nIn 2023, Signify's adjusted employee turnover was 17% (2022: 17%). On a reported basis, the total turnover was 37% (2022: 48%) including the specifics of the Mexican labor law, which prohibits contingent labor and\n\n## Employee turnover breakdown in 2023 in %\n\n|                      | Staff (majority  in factory)   | Professional   | Mid-Level  Professional   | Senior-Level  Professional   | Leadership   | Grand Total   |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Total adjusted  1    | 5%                             | 9%             | 2%                        | 1%                           | -%           | 17%           |\n| Total                | 27%                            | 8%             | 1%                        | 1%                           | -%           | 37%           |\n| of which voluntary   | 16%                            | 4%             | 1%                        | -%                           | -%           | 21%           |\n| of which involuntary | 11%                            | 5%             | 1%                        | -%                           | -%           | 16%           |\n\n- 1 Excluding manufacturing population from Mexico\n\ntherefore causes a significant impact on a consolidated basis. Signify applies high standards in its factories around the world to ensure its competitiveness in highly dynamic labor markets, while continuously improving employee satisfaction and reducing turnover.\n\n## Talent management\n\nWith close to 32,000 employees worldwide, our people are central to the effective execution of our strategy, and we will continue with the implementation of our new operating model. We believe that we will maintain our position as the leader in lighting by being a talent-builder, developing and growing people from within. We want our employees to have a challenging and rewarding work experience; one where they can grow and make an impact, and where they gain new experiences and develop themselves.\n\nOur approach to talent is to continuously build and develop employees' functional and leadership skills, whilst attracting new, diverse talent where critical capabilities are needed to strengthen our talent pool. Retaining our talent remained a key priority in the course of 2023 and we have been focusing on fostering internal mobility by supporting the match of our talents with internal opportunities.\n\nIn 2023, next to our acquisitions, we welcomed 6,878 external talents to help bring our business vision to life, most of whom were employed in manufacturing functions. In line with our people philosophy to promote talent from within the organization, close to 60% of our senior management and leadership roles were filled internally.\n\n## A robust global employer brand\n\nIn 2023, we continued to build on our Employer Value Proposition (EVP): while our pillars remained the same, as an innovative, sustainable industry leader with an essential focus on continuous learning as well as on DE&I, we laid the groundwork for strengthening our EVP to stay relevant in the talent marketplace.\n\nIn 2023, we received recognition for being an employer of choice in various countries, for example: Certification as Top Employer in China, (Top Employer\u00ae Institute), Great Place to work (The Great Place to Work\u00ae Institute) in Turkey, India and Panama. In the US, the Campus Program won the Handshake's Early Talent award and was recognized as a best place to work for Gen Z, and Sabrina Madsen received the Emerging Talent, Rising Star award from RippleMatch Campus Recruiting Choice Awards. Globally, Kiran Brar was\n\nincluded in Mogul's list of Top 100 People Leaders and CHRO's.\n\nWe directed our recruitment marketing campaigns at the most critical segments, to drive our transformation and growth and build talent pipelines. In 2023, we focused on reaching diverse candidates in technology, marketing, finance and sales with relevant messaging, customized per region reflecting our EVP. We activated an early careers campaign on social media to attract new graduates and early careers talents.\n\nAs part of our global talent acquisition strategy, we continue to attract talent from proven high-quality sources:\n\n- \u00b7 Internal - Over the last few years we have filled approximately 50% of our vacancies internally.\n- \u00b7 Employee referral - 14% of total external hires came from employee referrals.\n- \u00b7 Signify careers website - Via our content strategy on social media \"Humanizing our employer brand\", we saw high engagement rates on social media driven by our employees sharing content and our stories on why Signify is a great place to work, in alignment with our values and EVP.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our company purpose and values provide employees with direction about why we exist, what we value, and how we work.\n\nWe believe that our achievements are collective, and by working closely together, our impact is greater. Our workplace principles were designed to foster inspiration, cooperation, and a sense of belonging: three essential ingredients to achieve our purpose. The workplace principles reinforce our commitment to further build an inclusive work environment that offers employees flexibility to work from home when needed and set reasonable boundaries for conducting the company's business.\n\nThroughout 2023, we have been enhancing our performance culture to improve execution and ownership for a more competitive business. This performance culture is reinforced by our performance practices, where both employees and people managers take an active role, together, to drive individual and company performance. It starts with a steadfast commitment to regular, open, forward-thinking performance conversations between employees and managers.\n\nDuring these conversations, employees can share their progress against goals and their learning and development priorities. Managers demonstrate support through active listening and coaching to enable employees to break through performance obstacles and grow. We promote the\n\npractice of feedforward, which is future focused and aims to identify potential opportunities for growth. In our latest Team survey, quarter 4, 2023, 83% of our employees responded positively to having had constructive conversations with their manager within the last three months about their performance and development goals. In addition, 80% of our employees responded positively to being empowered and supported in their professional and career development.\n\nAs we look to 2024 and beyond, we will continue to reinforce these practices and enhance our processes, as we move to a new operating model. Through coaching our employees, strengthening feedforward and building capability in our managers, we plan to embed the change and further unlock performance at Signify. To emphasize the focus on our customers and speed in decision-making, we will be refreshing the behaviors that underpin our values, and root these in the way we work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee engagement & well-being\n\nEmployee engagement and well-being are key to our competitive performance and integral to our people vision: creating a workplace where people belong, have impact and take pride in the company we build\n\ntogether. Engaged employees are committed to our company. They help us to meet our business goals and sustainability commitments, whilst contributing to a dynamic, high-performance workplace.\n\nIn 2023, we continued our grassroots initiatives across the globe to create awareness about employee engagement & well-being:\n\n- \u00b7 Coffee Corners and global webcasts, to reinforce the connection between our people and our leaders.\n- \u00b7 Well-being Webinar Program (online webinars) and activity clubs.\n- \u00b7 Health checks in Greater China, for employees to get personal feedback on their health and specific suggestions on follow up.\n- \u00b7 Employee Assistance Program in India, with monthly webinars offering free teleconsultation support to all employees and their family for any kind of wellness query and support.\n- \u00b7 Broaden time-off policies in the US to focus on well-being, making specific mention of mental and emotional health and evaluated medical leave of absence procedures to ensure they are inclusive and cover mental health issues appropriately.\n\nSustainability is central to our company strategy, we have engaged our employees on the topic of sustainability since 2019. We do this with quarterly employee engagement themes and challenges that help employees reflect on and connect personal values with the business practices of Signify.\n\nOur Signify Team survey poses questions in line with our company purpose and values,\n\nand it has proven to be a positive driver of employee engagement to increase team effectiveness. As a result, we have continued to run the Team survey every quarter to monitor employee engagement and take corrective actions when needed. In 2023, we have updated the questions to stay on top of the trends around employee engagement. Furthermore, insights into the inclusivity in teams and the impact of our managers are provided. In 2023, 90% of our employees said that we truly put our Customer First (2022: 92%); 88% of our employees acknowledged that we are Greater Together (2022: 89%); 88% of our employees felt that we are a Game Changer (2022: 86%) and 87% of our employees agreed that we have Passion for Results (2022: 89%). We noted that we need to continue improving in the areas of processes and systems. Initiatives to address our improvement points are driven at a team level via our Team dialogues, and we continue to track progress on these questions during our Quarterly Performance Reviews.\n\nTo measure employee satisfaction, the Net Promoter Score (NPS) methodology is used as part of our Team survey. Employees are asked to rank how likely it is that they would recommend our company as a great place to work. In 2023, the Team survey had an average employee response rate of 83% (2022: 83%). At the end of 2023, we recorded an average annual NPS score of 26 across the Signify population (2022: 36).\n\n## Learning & development\n\nLearning continues to be a competitive advantage at Signify and plays an important role in attracting and retaining talent. In 2023, people connected virtually on our knowledge exchange platforms to consume\n\n<!-- image -->",

We updated our methodology to calculate the rate of active learners only focused on voluntary training (in 2022 mandatory courses were included). On average in 2023, the learning experience platform Learning@Signify reached an active learner rate of 63%. The average number of hours spent on training and development per FTE was 20.5 hours during 2023 (2022: 24). Multiple Subject Matter Experts created learning pathways around critical areas to share their knowledge with others bringing our vision 'everyone is a student; everyone is a teacher' to life.\n\nSignify employees are 'the driver of their own career'. This year we deployed the Learning Week in July and October and the #OwnYourdevelopment newsletter to strengthen the learning agility of our employees. In July's edition, we focused on self-reflection. Masterclasses on career development, harnessing your strengths, and empowerment were offered to our employees. In October, the focus has been on Future in-demand skills such as Workplace curiosity, Agile and Problem-solving. This initiative has been a success with over 12.500 attendees.\n\n## Upskill for greater customer impact\n\nThis year our focus remained on strengthening our commercial skills and we launched the \"Basics & Beyond\" program for commercial leaders. The program focused on 3 skills: P&L management, Strategic thinking, and People management. In total 129 leaders got involved in the seven month training program.\n\nFor a third year in a row, we delivered our \"Impact program\" for Key account managers. It introduces a consultative and innovative approach to selling, with a greater emphasis on relationship building and trust .\n\n## Upskill for digitalization\n\nWe continued to invest in digital reskilling and skill assessments for skills like Robotic process automation (RPA), Data and analytics (AI / Machine learning / Data analytics), Cloud computing, Information and cyber security, Programming languages, and IT architectures.\n\n## Leadership development\n\nWe continued to ensure that our leadership development experiences are aligned with our manager framework of lead, develop, and inspire and with our talent philosophy. We have piloted interventions to increase the effectiveness of first-time people managers in 2023, by covering the essentials of people management; emotional intelligence and situational leadership. In 2024, this will be continued as a new, global program for all people managers.\n\nIn 2023, the program included 105 participants. We have also launched a specific program for 31 leaders in manufacturing. This ensured that our people leaders continued to get support in their roles for Signify to build a pipeline of future-ready leaders who can further drive excellence and sustainable growth. In 2024, we will continue to improve the leadership offerings ensuring our leaders are equipped to lead, develop, and inspire our people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## D iversity, equity & inclusion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt Signify, we believe that a diverse workforce and an inclusive work environment are essential to a thriving innovative business and long-term value creation. We are an equal opportunity employer committed to Diversity, equity & inclusion (DE&I) in the workplace. This means we celebrate and foster an environment in which all ideas, perspectives, experiences and styles are highly valued and where all individuals are treated fairly with equal access to opportunities and resources.\n\nDiverse representation in our workforce is critical for our long-term success as a company. It enables us to understand, connect and communicate with our customers, end-users and stakeholders while helping us to attract and retain people who want to be part of our purpose to unlock the extraordinary potential of light for brighter lives and a better world. Our DE&I roadmap reinforces our Greater Together value, enabling us to make better decisions, boost innovation, create growth, and strengthen our culture.\n\nIn 2021, we signed the United Nations (UN) Women Empowerment Principles, which underpins our commitment to double the percentage of women in leadership to 34% by the end of 2025, and is another step towards ensuring equal opportunities, fairness, and impartiality for all.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn March, honoring International Woman's Day, colleagues from across the world organized events celebrating the achievements and acknowledging the challenges within the topic #Embrace Equity.\n\n## DE&I governance practices\n\nOur commitment to creating and sustaining an inclusive workplace culture is evidenced in our Diversity Committee, DE&I Champions network, and our eight Connection Point Groups. Empowered, employee-led and selfgoverning, these employee groups continue to champion our commitment to ensuring a sense of belonging and well-being.\n\nFounded in 2019, our DE&I Board continues to drive our strategic initiatives and the ongoing development and refinement of our multi-year DE&I roadmap. We continued to emphasize our existing '2+1' approach i.e., global focus on two specific diversity dimensions of gender (increasing representation of women) and generation (increasing early career talents) with space for markets, divisions, and functions to locally implement additional important and relevant initiatives.\n\nWe published our inaugural DE&I report in 2022.

In this report, we announced we achieved gender pay equity within Signify. Our most recent DE&I report is available on our website: https:// www.signify.com/global/our-company/ about-us/diversity-inclusion.\n\nIn 2023, we continued to drive positive actions to increase diversity recruitment and internal mobility at all levels (inclusive job posting, diverse shortlist, diverse hiring panel). We set up plans to address gaps and accelerate our progress, so that our talent pipeline reflects all aspects of diversity in the markets in which we operate. To strengthen these efforts, we established a 'licenses to hire' training for all people managers to enhance their skills and knowledge during recruitment around DE&I (e.g., fairness of\n\nprocess, fair decision-making, candidate experience, equity).\n\nIn partnership with Harvard Business Publishing, we continue to focus on ensuring DE&I is a cornerstone of our culture through a learning and education series available to all Signify employees.\n\nWe focus on topics such as unconscious bias, microaggressions, generational diversity, psychological safety and inclusive leadership. We have embedded the inclusive Leadership Model into the iEDGE leadership program, which targets our new people leaders. We remain committed to a culture imbued with equitable access for everyone and make the course material available to all employees on Learning@Signify.\n\nIn 2023, 40% of Signify employees were women (2022: 41%) and 29% of leadership\n\nn\n\nroles (positions graded H22+ on the Hay grading scale) across the company were held by women (2022: 28%). We are slightly off track to reach our 2025 target of 34% women in leadership positions. We will continue to focus on external hiring for senior positions by actively pipelining and ensuring equal slates before hiring for positions. Additionally, we will focus on increasing the succession health through career development opportunities. This will be enabled through transition toolkits and mentoring for women moving into new roles to enable them to succeed.\n\nIn 2023, 49% of our new hires were women (2022: 50%). From a generational perspective, 16% of employees were 30 years old or under (2022: 17%). We have the ambition to attract and retain more earlycareer talents to build a sustainable talent pipeline.\n\nAs a company, we are naturally diverse, operating in 74 countries with more than 99 nationalities represented in our workforce. Globally, we recognize that we need a more diverse workforce, especially in management and executive positions. Therefore, over the last two years, we have intensified our efforts on increasing the representation of women and early-career talents in our company. We are committed to improving diversity at all levels, attracting candidates from more diverse pipelines, and driving development and internal mobility to increase representation across our company.\n\nAs part of our strategy to attract early career talent, we expanded our campus hiring and our internship program. We partner with many colleges and universities and have amplified our employer brand on a variety of social media channels.",

This award recognizes Signify as an Employer of Choice among GenZ job seekers.\n\nGlobally, we recognize the need for a more diverse representation in the areas of gender and age, and we continually monitor related data to support our aim of reaching greater diversity representation in our organization. We plan to further improve our generational diversity in the future by increasing the inflow of early career talents and campus hires.\n\n## Equal remuneration\n\nSignify's commitment to equity and inclusion includes a policy for equal pay for equal, or substantially similar, work. Signify establishes formal pay policies and practices that govern hiring, benefit entitlements, annual merit, and promotional guidelines to ensure equity.\n\nFurthermore, Signify performs regular reviews designed to ensure compliance with our policy of equal pay for equal work and meet local legal requirements in countries in which we operate. Our annual review process includes a comprehensive statistical analysis of pay to employees across the world. Any statistically significant variance within any employee group is promptly addressed. More details can be found in our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Report.\n\n## Supplier Diversity\n\nTo ensure an inclusive business model, Signify collaborates with key strategic suppliers to drive better DE&I performance across its value chain. In 2023, we engaged with key\n\nsuppliers to exchange best practices via a dedicated online program and we included the topic of DE&I in our Tritium program (see more in subsection 4.3.3) to reward suppliers already adopting practices promoting DE&I.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.3.3 Human rights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our approach\n\nRespecting human rights is a central foundation of the way we work. Our commitment to respecting and promoting human rights extends beyond our own operations, across our wider sphere of influence, including our supply chain. To that end, we integrate human rights considerations into our policies, processes, and practices. Our Human Rights policy is based on the International Bill of Human Rights, the United Nations Global Compact Ten Principles, and the International Labor Organization's declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at work. Signify carries out continuous research and stakeholder engagement activities to identify the most salient ethical and social principles that govern our relationship with stakeholders worldwide.\n\nIn 2023, we strengthened our process for identification of new salient human right issues, by introducing a quarterly review of the cases raised through our Ethics line with our compliance team. This allowed us to understand if there were any issues that were not properly covered by our policy and how to drive corrective actions. As result of\n\nthis review, we have decided to create a specific Anti-Discrimination and AntiHarassment policy in 2024.\n\nIn addition, we held a meeting with our CEO, to gain his perspective on possible risks in our operations, but also to ensure alignment at the highest level of the organization on how to drive Human Rights, in line with EU Taxonomy Minimum Social Safeguards (MSS).\n\nIn 2023, we also held our annual Human Rights Committee meeting, formed by senior leaders of the company, where the objective is to sign-off on the selection of the salient human rights issues and agree on the corrective actions in case of any finding through our different assessment processes. The table on the following page shows, in random order, the salient issues identified and the stakeholders they affect, as well as references to the subsections of this report that contain the progress Signify made in addressing these issues.\n\n## Human rights risk assessment\n\nCompliance with the Human Rights policy is governed through our Integrity code processes, combined with dedicated steps that help ensure adherence. In 2023, employees were requested to complete elearnings that helped interpret our Integrity Code. Dedicated communication campaigns urged everyone to speak up and report concerns of possible violations. In those campaigns, the availability of our Ethics hotline was also highlighted. This initiative is an integrated and ongoing activity we have embedded in our business and business principles, which we redeploy on a regular basis and share with our new employees as part of their on-boarding program.\n\nBased on a country risk assessment, multiple manufacturing locations were considered to have an increased likelihood of policy violations. We currently have 19 sites located in 'highest or high risk' countries. Since 2017, these locations are requested to periodically fill in a dedicated self-assessment on human rights. In 2023, we made a profound revision of our assessment, to ensure that it reflected the latest developments on human rights. As result, we added 20 new questions and revised the wording of 15, to ensure we covered as many human rights risks as possible.\n\nAdditionally, in 2023, we ran an internal audit regarding 'Adherence to our Human Rights policy.\" The onsite audit was conducted in three locations; India, Mexico and China. The audit focused on 2 aspects: 1) Do sampled organizations adhere to the Human Rights Policy? What is the control effectiveness?; and 2) Checking the quality of the selfassessment questionnaires and corresponding improvement actions.\n\nAs result of the audit there were two improvement areas identified: a) In two sites, non-adherence to the requirement that employees are not allowed to work more than 6 days in a row; b) Improvement of the process governing the Human Rights Policy, by, for example, clarifying the roles and responsibilities concerning the policy's control activities towards the sites and clarifying some questions of the self assessment questionnaire.\n\nAs result, seven improvement actions were identified and agreed, out of which, six have been completed and one is still due execution in 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->",

By ensuring good working conditions, Signify not only aims to provide a fair, safe, and respectful work environment, but also an inspiring place to work and grow. Fair remuneration is considered a precondition for our employees to flourish. Signify provides total compensation that is in line with the industry practices in the markets in which we operate.\n\nIn addition, we are committed to providing our employees with a living wage, ensuring that their everyday needs are met. The\n\nguiding principles of our pay policy include providing competitive compensation relative to all labor markets, ensuring equity, and providing a living wage to our employees. As such, to ensure compliance against our guiding principles, Signify launched its Living Wages program in 2017.\n\nRegularly, Signify performs an analysis of salaries and benefits for employees globally with respect to a living wage, covering the necessary living costs. We focus on employees who have a higher risk of not receiving a living wage by analyzing 35 regions in 6 different countries (representing 70% of the overall Signify population). We compare\n\nour wages to the Wage Indicator Foundation database.\n\nThe 2023 results show that company standards exceed the living wage standards in all regions examined, except four, which together represent 1.16% of the population analyzed in the six principal countries. We are developing remediation actions to close the gaps identified in these four regions. Two new regions were identified with living wages issues, which represent 20% and 18% of the total employees analyzed in those regions.\n\nOne region identified during the 2022 analysis had 47% of the population not\n\nmeeting the living wage standard, while in 2023 the same region had 9% of the population not meeting the living wage standard due to a 20% increase in the national minimum wage. Four other regions identified during the 2022 analysis no longer have employees below the living wage, due to increases in wages.\n\nDuring the 2022 analysis, it was identified that another region had a population below the living wage standard, with 23% of the population not meeting this standard. In this region, it is common practice for employees' wages to be adjusted once they successfully complete their probationary period. Therefore, this is only a temporary issue for new employees, which is resolved as they progress beyond their probationary period.\n\n## Responsible supply chain\n\nWe have a direct business relationship with more than 3,000 product and component suppliers. Responsible procurement practices and management of our supply chain require a structured and innovative approach due to the wide variety of stakeholders. Signify has developed programs over the years to prevent human rights violations in its supply chain. These programs cover the assessment and development of supplier sustainability performance (audits and training) and responsible minerals sourcing.\n\nAs part of our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 sustainability program, we commit to execute an on-site audit program that covers our high-risk, high-spend suppliers.\n\nWe track our supplier's maturity rate through on-site assessments against the RBA Code of\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Conduct. In 2023, 88% of our suppliers (with a spend over 1 million Euros) are either from low-risk countries or of high maturity (score at least 70 initial points out of 100 points during the audit).\n\nOur Tritium program helps us develop a strong supply base with best-in-class suppliers and is based on selection and rewards criteria against our strategic priorities. The Tritium rating strongly drives continuous improvement of our supplier sustainability performance. Sustainability maturity and initiatives on Human rights, Working conditions, Climate action and DE&I are rewarded in the Tritium system with reward points. Non-compliance is penalized and needs to be corrected or will result in consequences for the business relation.\n\nOur targets are periodically reviewed by senior management. In case of deviations from our targets, we set up corrective measures. Through these efforts, we foster decent work and economic growth by improving the safety and well-being of suppliers and directly contribute to SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth.\n\n## Supplier sustainability performance\n\nThe core of our supplier sustainability performance program is the Supplier Sustainability Declaration (SSD). This declaration forms an integral part of our supplier contracts and can be found on our website. We expect all Signify's suppliers providing products, components, parts, subassemblies, materials, packaging, services, or solutions to or on behalf of Signify to comply with our Supplier Sustainability Declaration.\n\nThe SSD is derived from the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct and sets out the standards and behaviors we require from our suppliers and their suppliers. It covers labor, health and safety, environment, ethics and management systems. This applies to all workers including temporary, migrant, student, contract, direct employees, and any other type of worker.\n\nWe continue our DE&I program in our supply chain. Through our audit program, we have identified that more than 33% of our suppliers have already set DE&I targets and/ or signed a DE&I pledge. (2022: 29%).\n\nOur audit program consists of full audits performed by an independent audit firm for selected suppliers in risk countries with a spend threshold of EUR 1 million per year. The audit program also covers new suppliers introduced by our recent acquisitions (with a spend threshold on anticipated spend over 100k Euro). To improve sustainable practices in our supply chain, we want to increase the number of our suppliers that either are low risk or implement mature sustainability practices and good performance. We encourage suppliers to certify against SA8000, ISO14000 and ISO 45001 standards or to become member of the Responsible Factory Initiative (RFI), a program offered by RBA experts.\n\nIn 2022, we introduced a 1-year audit frequency for suppliers that score below 70 points, This turned out to be very effective as we noticed in 2023 that the suppliers in this group made significant progress (from a typical audit score of 40 to 82 points). For suppliers that score well but require corrective actions, we keep the three-year\n\naudit cycle. Suppliers that pass the audit with no need for corrective action will be exempted from the audit program until a complaint or an issue is raised by internal stakeholders or from external sources.\n\nAt the end of 2023, 280 suppliers were part of our audit program (66% of Signify's total spend). Among them, 271 suppliers (97%) are compliant by passing the audit or by resolving identified non-conformities. 9 suppliers (3%) were considered non-compliant, either due to overdue corrective action plan or overdue audit date, and are being followed up with our consequence management process. At the end of 2023, our compliance rate was 97%, well above our annual target of 95%. In 2023, we audited 157 suppliers (including supplier onboarding audits) on-site and reached close to 50,000 workers employed at the sites audited. Most of Signify suppliers are based in China (78%), followed by Mexico (8%) and India (5%).\n\nThe following table shares our supplier sustainability performance and indicates the compliance rate from the audit prior to supplier corrective actions. Overall, the compliance rate is 88%, which is slightly lower than last year due to the introduction of many new supplies from our recent acquisitions (Klite and LeiFei). We saw progress in the areas of labor (young workers, non-discrimination) and ethics (privacy and non-retaliation). Attention points for the coming year will be industrial hygiene (working environment) and the storage and handling of hazardous substances.\n\nIn the RBA Code of Conduct and in our SSD, special attention is given to the prevention of human slavery as referred to in the United Kingdom (UK) Modern Slavery Act Disclosures and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. The formal statement on these laws can be found on our website.\n\nThe assurance of freely chosen employment in our supply chain is a key element of our sustainability objectives. Forced and Child labor is considered a zero-tolerance issue and Signify's policy requires immediate remediation if observed. We closely follow the implementation of the US's Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) and Bill S-211 Fighting Against Forced Labor and Child Labor in Supply Chains Act. Our forced labor working group are implementing due diligence mechanisms including inquiry of Tier 1 suppliers and putting in place upstream traceability of raw materials at risk. In addition, we expect our suppliers to allow all workers the freedom to associate. This includes channels for workers and/or their representatives to openly communicate and share ideas and concerns with management regarding working conditions and management practices without fear of discrimination, reprisal, intimidation, or harassment. This is verified during our RBA audits by direct interviews with supply chain workers; and is also aligned with our company Integrity Code.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<\n\n\u2261\n\n>",

In addition, since 2017, we have organized training sessions for our suppliers to share our learnings to support and foster sustainable best practices. In 2023, we organized a webinar on RBA Code of Conduct focusing on the top 20 most frequent non-conformities found in our audit\n\nprogram. 35 suppliers joined, with a total of 67 attendees.\n\nIn cooperation with our 3rd party auditor, we also organized face-to-face training for 10 selected suppliers with development needs in the areas of working hours and fire safety (19 attendees). We continued our Supplier Carbon Disclosure Program with 73 suppliers attending the training sessions.\n\n## Responsible mineral sourcing\n\nOur commitment to sustainable development extends to issues further down the supply chain, to prevent human rights abuses and financing of conflicts in the extractive sector. Global supply chains in the lighting industry are long and complex, typically with more than seven tiers between the finished product and the source of raw materials used for manufacturing. However, we believe\n\nthat through strong multi-stakeholder partnerships we can make a difference.\n\nAs part of the Signify Conflict Minerals program, we implement measures in our supply chain to ensure that our products are not directly or indirectly funding atrocities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). We support and follow the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-\n\n<!-- image -->",

The full description of our due diligence process and Signify's position on Conflict Minerals are available on our website.\n\nWe are an active member of the Responsible Mineral Initiative (RMI) which runs the audit program to verify the smelters' conflict-free status and to identify sources of 3TG and cobalt in our supply chain. We use the tools and programs developed by the RMI, especially the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT), the Extended Minerals Reporting Template (EMRT) and the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). Once a year in June, we update our list of smelters using the CMRT and/or the EMRT information provided by our Tier 1 suppliers.\n\nThe smelters identified through this process are included in the Signify smelter list published in our Signify Conflict Minerals Declaration. We increased the number of conformant smelters to 268 in 2023. And we successfully cooperated with 5 Tier 1 suppliers to become conflict free. Unfortunately, we observed a reduced interest in support for the RMI assessment program: 11 smelters rejected participation in the program, 27 smelters rejected reassessment and 6 smelters did not close their corrective action plan. RMI had to suspend assessments in Russia due to the war. More details can be found on our website in the responsible minerals section.\n\nCobalt is present in our battery supply chain only for emergency lighting and remote controls. To enhance transparency in the cobalt supply chain, in 2018 we co-founded\n\nthe Fair Cobalt Alliance (FCA) with Fairphone, Huayou and Impact Facility.\n\nThis multi-stakeholder action platform offers actors across the cobalt supply chain a precompetitive environment for collaboration to help strengthen and professionalize DRC's artisanal cobalt mining sector and contribute to local economic development at large. For more on the FCA program: https:// www.faircobaltalliance.org/.\n\n## 4.3.4 Safety at work\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Health & Safety performance\n\nThe health and safety of our employees is a top priority. We commit to provide a safe working environment for our employees and we contribute to the achievement of SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth,\n\nThe total recordable cases (TRC) rate is the central indicator through which we measure our overall safety performance. Targets for this indicator are set and managed at a company-wide level, and for the individual divisions, manufacturing sites and distribution centers.\n\nAs part of our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 sustainability program, we continue to commit to a safe and healthy workplace with a TRC target of 0.30 by the end of 2025, and the ambition for each single site to reach it.\n\nIn 2023, we focused on increasing Environmental Health and Safety (EHS)\n\ncapabilities at a site level by launching a dedicated qualifications campaign with NEBOSH International General Certificate in Occupational Health and Safety (IGC) courses and examinations for site EHS managers. We continued digitalization of the EHS reporting process that will allow deeper and more effective analysis of workplace hazards and related risks. In our operations, we prioritized a standardization effort in five domains: ergonomic safety, personal protective equipment, equipment safety, mobile equipment, and EHS resources.\n\nAt a corporate level, we strengthened the management of high-risk activities by deploying 25 global standards that describe the minimum Signify requirements when confronted with such risks. Our annual Safety Week campaign was dedicated to the topic of 'Health and Well-being'. As part of this campaign, we held a global competition for 'Health & Well-being Champions'. This campaign was very successful with over 200 submissions from our sites across the globe.\n\n## Recordable cases\n\n|                             |   2021 |   2022 |   2023 |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total recordable  case rate |   0.17 |   0.16 |   0.19 |\n| Severe injuries             |  18    |   7    |  14    |\n| Severity rate               |   0.05 |   0.02 |   0.05 |\n| Lost workday  cases rate    |   0.12 |   0.09 |   0.12 |\n| Fatalities                  |   0    |   0    |   0    |\n\nIn 2023, we continued our drive to improve equipment safety, warehousing safety, and\n\nbehavioral safety through our cross-site Safety Alerts process. Our injury prevention framework has been further strengthened in the operational Lean framework, the Manufacturing Standards platform and the Signify Quality System.\n\nOn our journey to a zero-injury workplace, we faced some challenges in controlling residual risk and maintaining an injury prevention mindset. To counter this challenge, we intend to re-design our behavior observation process in 2024, to reinforce our capability to identify and eliminate these residual risks. Going forward, we will continue the development of global and local EHS competencies and the strengthening of site adherence to our minimum set of global EHS requirements. To close our continuous improvement program, we will launch our site EHS maturity assessment process in 2024. This will not only provide a standardized and effective measure to identify improvement opportunities at individual site level but will also enable the exchange of best practices across our manufacturing sites.\n\nWe recorded 49 TRC cases in 2023 (2022: 47) and had no fatality incidents. The TRC rate increased to 0.19 per 100 FTEs, compared to 0.16 in 2022. In 2023, 62% of our reported industrial sites had no recordable injuries. There were 18 industrial sites that have had no recordable injuries over the last 3 years, while 27 sites had achieved more than 500 injury-free days.\n\n## Management system\n\nWe have reinforced our program to ensure all Signify manufacturing sites are certified\n\n<!-- image -->",

The remaining manufacturing sites have procedures in place to foster compliance with local regulations and Signify policies.\n\n## 4.3.5 Business ethics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Signify's Integrity code\n\nOur Integrity code serves as our code of conduct. This code embodies our commitment to always act with integrity, both in our internal and external interactions. The code sets the standard for business conduct of our employees and for the company itself and also gives more information on how to speak up or raise concerns. Translations of our Integrity code are available in 26 languages. For a description of Integrity code processes and policies, refer to chapter 13, Risk factors and risk management, section 13.1, Establish a strong risk management environment.\n\nIn 2023, we reviewed the Integrity code and made some minor changes. While the core principles remain the same, we have made some updates to reflect changes in the organization and the outside world as well as progress made against our priorities. The revised Integrity code was published and brought to the attention of employees in Q3 2023.\n\n## Training and engagement of employees\n\nWe dedicate part of the training of our employees specifically on compliance topics. At the end of 2023, the completion rate of our e-learnings was 93% of the targeted employees. Our current program covers antitrust, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering, privacy and data protection, export controls and sanctions, security, speaking up and business integrity.\n\n## Compliance risk assessments\n\nIn 2023, we performed our annual risk assessment for the legal compliance domains. In that assessment we analyzed the risks related to a number of topics, such as bribery and corruption, and used the outcome as an input for the planned compliance activities for the coming year.\n\nIn 2023, 274 Integrity code concerns were captured via the Signify Ethics line and through our network of compliance officers, a 12% increase compared to 2022. The number of concerns raised is substantially higher than in the previous year. Details per category are shown in the table below.\n\n## Most commonly reported concerns\n\n## Human resources\n\nThe most reported concerns were related to human resources, representing 54% of the total cases reported (53% in 2022). This category, includes concerns that, for example, related to equal and fair treatment, harassment, or other human resources related topics.\n\n## Business integrity\n\nThe second most reported type of concern relates to business integrity. This, for example, includes concerns relating to conflicts of interest, fraudulent disbursements or any other fraudulent suspected behavior. The number of complaints reported in this segment represents 27% of the total cases reported in 2023 (31% in 2022).\n\n## Security\n\nIn 2023, the number of reported cases relating to Security, including IT increased. This category represents 15% of the total cases reported in 2023 (12% in 2022) and relates, for instance, to concerns about\n\n## Breakdown of alleged violations integrity code\n\n|                                |   2021 |   2022 |   2023 |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Environment, Health, or Safety |      3 |      3 |      4 |\n| Human Resources                |     90 |    130 |    148 |\n| Legal                          |     11 |      3 |      6 |\n| Business Integrity             |     56 |     75 |     74 |\n| Security, including IT         |     30 |     30 |     40 |\n| Other                          |      5 |      3 |      2 |\n| Total                          |    195 |    244 |    274 |\n\nunauthorized use of the company's assets, theft, cyber security or other IT-related concerns.\n\n## Substantiated concerns\n\nAt the start 2023, 50 cases were open. During 2023, a total number of 274 cases were reported. As per December 2023, 62 cases were open. That means that during 2023, we closed 262 cases. Of these 262 cases, 113 were found to be substantiated, which represents 43% of the closed cases.\n\nSubstantiated cases are followed up with corrective actions. Such corrective actions can include additional measures, such as training, strengthening of internal controls, creation of additional policies or other measures that aim to promote or enhance a culture of business compliance.\n\nCorrective actions can also take the form of disciplinary action. In 2023, Signify applied disciplinary actions ranging from training and coaching to verbal and written warnings and to termination of employment, depending on the severity of the matter.\n\n## Responsible tax policy\n\nOur tax principles are based on the recognition that tax is an integral element of our overall corporate social responsibility as well as commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Developments Goals.\n\nResponsible Tax is an important topic for Signify to report on. For us, acting with integrity means paying the right amount of tax, in the right place, at the right time. Being a responsible taxpayer is aligned with our purpose, business strategy and Integrity code. We are committed to providing timely,\n\n<!-- image -->",

At least once a year, the Tax Principles and Tax Strategy as well as the Tax Risks are discussed with Signify's Board of Management and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. If needed these principles and strategy are updated and subsequently approved by our Board of Management to ensure continuous alignment with our purpose, business structure and overall corporate social responsibility.\n\nSignify's Tax Principles ensure compliance with local and international tax laws and regulations for all our group entities. These principles govern how Signify operates with customers, suppliers, contractors, and employees. We aim to prepare and file all required tax returns on time, providing complete, accurate and timely disclosures to all relevant tax authorities.\n\nSignify has a Tax Control Framework in place, to monitor and test the execution of critical tax processes as well as for risk management. Our Tax Controls are part of our Business Control Framework and our internal controls for financial reporting (ICS). They are monitored and documented by our Tax Organization and the dedicated ICS team. Internal auditors regularly review our tax controls and external auditors review our key tax positions and our tax processes as part of the audit of our Annual Report.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nSignify maintains an open dialogue with our stakeholders and we engage constructively in national and international dialogue with governments, business groups and civil society to support the development of effective tax systems, legislation and administration. We regularly participate in meetings of business groups, to learn from our stakeholders and to provide our view on tax developments.\n\nSignify aims to build and maintain a cooperative and healthy working relationship with all relevant (tax) authorities.

We are focusing on improving our digital front and back-ends and increasing our data analytics capabilities to better serve our customers. In this context, it has been more important than ever to ensure that access to network, IT systems and data is assured at all times.\n\nSignify has a dedicated Corporate Security department which focuses on information, product and operational security. Signify follows the three lines of defense model. The first line of defense is performed by IT, Business units and Security Operations. The second by the Corporate Security department and the third by our internal independent Audit team. The responsibility of the Corporate Security Office, as a second line of defense, is assurance and control function that oversees security risk, sets the security controls framework and monitors the deployment of the controls within the first-line of defense.\n\nSignify's Cybersecurity team provides threat intelligence, guidance and assurance services, and manufacturing cybersecurity services. Our Threat Intelligence team has a defined process for gathering, analyzing, and distributing actionable intelligence on potential threats to Signify, and proactively alerts stakeholders. Our Guidance team is responsible for providing security guidance through the development of policies, standards and process guidelines, and establishing an enterprise security architecture to keep our digital identities, data and environment secure. Our Assurance team performs independent assessments and penetration testing activities to validate implementation of standards and assess residual risks and gaps. Our Operational Technology Cybersecurity team provides guidance and assurance services to our manufacturing and distribution operations. Our security operations center is responsible for the detection, mitigation and resolution of cybersecurity-related incidents, enabling action to be taken in a timely manner. Technical security measures are implemented to support the 'defense in depth' principle, starting from the collection of information to infrastructure controls.\n\nOur cybersecurity requirements also apply to our external partners and suppliers as part of the security schedules and contracts signed to emphasize the adherence of security standards expected from them. Our cybersecurity processes and measures are based on ISO 27001 (Information security) and ISA/IEC 62443 (Product Security) certifications, as well as other related best practices (such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Center of Internet Security (CIS)).\n\nOur overall approach to cybersecurity and prioritization of activities is risk-based, and we recognize identity as the perimeter to maintaining the required security (viz, Zerotrust mindset). In addition to the guidance provided as part of the security standards and guidelines, we have set up a formal process that extends the reach of our cybersecurity services directly to business and IT stakeholders and is available to clarify their questions and doubts about cybersecurity-related matters. Additionally, all our employees are expected to complete a mandatory e-learning training on security every year, which includes a quiz to ascertain their understanding of the topics. Webinars are organized on topics of emerging cybersecurity threats and best practices to teach employees to avoid the risks of falling prey to them. Focused trainings are also conducted as required. Phishing simulations are conducted monthly which include new hires. Dedicated learning pathways are created for those who fail the simulation tests.\n\nEarly 2023, we completed an attack simulation and penetration testing in order to identify security vulnerabilities and recommendation. The findings resulted in updates to Risk mitigation efforts in several areas including incident management. We also completed an external, independent evaluation of our Cybersecurity priorities, roadmap and the status execution to get an objective assessment of our current state of Cybersecurity. With an increased focus on continual assurance, the Cybersecurity team implemented and operationalized 'External Attack Surface Management (EASM)' platform to enable continuous vulnerability management and monitoring of externally\n\nexposed Signify assets. We also rolled out and operationalized the 'SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM)' solution, targeting multiple SaaS-based critical applications through which we can scan these environments for misconfigurations on a constant basis for early detection and mitigation of risks. Manual risk assessments were also conducted on several critical assets to identify and report risks and their mitigations to the respective stakeholders.\n\nWe conducted Cyber (tabletop) drills at eleven of our manufacturing sites. We are constantly trying to evolve and improve our cybersecurity guidance by regularly updating our existing standards and publishing new ones where we did not have one before. Vendor assurance of one of our major infrastructure partners was completed. Challenges of emerging trends in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related cyber-attacks are being addressed through knowledgesharing sessions. Revised security awareness of topics related to Ransomware and new AIbased phishing trends have been rolled out. Challenges in available resource bandwidth and budget continue to impact how much and how fast the desired changes can be addressed by the Cybersecurity team.\n\nAll cybersecurity activities are reported to and monitored by the Security Board, chaired by our Chief Executive Officer, Eric Rondolat. Other members of the Security Board are the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Security Officer, and the Heads of Internal Audit, Legal and Human Resources. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are informed regularly.\n\n<!-- image -->",

With a focus on becoming customer-centric, digitalized, and sustainable, our strategic initiative, DigITal Foundation, is enhancing our IT capabilities to enable Signify's digital transformation.\n\n## Signify's DigITal Foundation\n\nThis initiative focuses on improving end-user experience, driving operational excellence, increasing automation, improving cost performance, and contributing to sustainability targets. To achieve these objectives, we are investing in upgrading our core IT infrastructure, implementing new tools and technologies, and developing the skills and capabilities of our IT workforce. We are also embracing agile methodologies to accelerate the delivery of new digital solutions and services to our customers.\n\nBy strengthening our core IT capabilities, we are better positioned to drive innovation, improve efficiency, and enhance the overall customer experience. Moreover, the initiative aligns with our commitment to sustainability, by reducing our environmental footprint through increased automation and optimized operations.\n\nSignify's DigITal Foundation is a key driver for our ongoing success in the digital era and our\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Social impact of light\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Brighter lives revenues\n\nWe are driving change to create brighter futures. With our lighting innovations, we support the health and well-being of people, sustainable food production for a growing global population, and a safer and more secure society. We commit to double our Brighter lives revenues to 32% by the end of 2025, which means our revenues coming from lighting innovations that increase food availability, safety and security, or health and well-being. At the end of 2023, our Brighter lives revenues were 31% (2022: 27%). Through our actions, we directly contribute to the achievement of SDG 3: Good health and well-being and SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities.\n\n## Health & well-being\n\nLight is essential for life, and equally important as food, water and air. Light allows us to see and to experience the world around us. It affects us visually, biologically and emotionally, supporting comfort, well-being and performance. Scientific evidence shows that light has a powerful impact on our emotions and important physiological and biological processes in our body. Circadian lighting in an office environment makes an office more liveable and can enhance mood, boost concentration and productivity.\n\nIn 2023, we continued to focus on the quality of light in our LED portfolio meeting the EyeComfort criteria which include factors\n\nDigITal ambition is to elevate Signify's standing in the lighting industry by cultivating and sustaining a competitive edge through the delivery of an exceptional digital experience in the following areas:\n\n## Digitalizing customer interfaces\n\nWe are committed to providing the best-inclass experience for our B2B partners, making our customer interface the preferred one-stop-shop for OEMs, wholesalers, agents, specifiers, and installers. We aim to achieve this by offering an easy-to-use and intuitive digital platform that simplifies the purchasing process. For B2C customers, we are focused on creating a seamless and enjoyable digital experience across all channels, including mobile and web.\n\n## Digitalizing offers\n\nWe are dedicated to offering innovative connected products and services in the market and utilizing data and lighting beyond illumination. We have introduced in the past years brands like Interact, Philips Hue and WiZ, which offer smart lighting solutions that can be controlled through mobile devices. Moreover, we are exploring new business models by collaborating with partners in various industries, such as horticulture and entertainment.\n\n## Digitalizing processes and operations\n\nWe are committed to delighting customers and partners with delivery reliability and product availability by implementing touchless, automated, and analytics-driven internal processes. In addition, we are investing in enablers such as digital capabilities for our teams, data management and enablement, systems architecture and\n\nfostering an agile operating model to achieve this objective.\n\nDigital initiatives in these areas are enabling our business to enhance customer experience, increase online sales, and digitize and automate various business processes, which has resulted in increased efficiency, reduced costs, and improved profitability.\n\n## Digital sustainability\n\nOur commitment to sustainability is unwavering, and we are seeking innovative ways to minimize our environmental impact. Digital technologies support our business in measuring and tracking sustainability progress, reducing emissions, resource optimization and drive a more circular economy. Enhanced connectivity and the Internet of Things (IoT) enable innovations in our products that reduce product use emissions and support sustainable business operations.\n\nIn 2023, we implemented a digital Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool that enables the quantification of product environmental impacts throughout the full life cycle. Through digitalization, we can generate Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) at a large scale while considering standard and location specific requirements when required. This allows us to develop strategies to reduce our environmental impact, identify opportunities for sustainable innovation, and communicate our sustainability performance to stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

When melanopic lighting is properly designed in buildings, it brings the benefits of natural daylight indoors, enhancing visual comfort, well-being and workplace performance.\n\nWe also focused on office and healthcare applications, contributing to employees', patients' and staff's health and well-being. NatureConnect has been designed to mimic natural patterns of daylight to reconnect us to the outside world. The mimicking of the sky and daylight and receiving enough light especially becomes relevant when a room does not have daylight access. Recent studies have shown that NatureConnect has a positive impact on the alertness and vitality of office workers.\n\n\"I really feel like I'm outside\" is the most common reaction from customers. There are additional melanopic benefits from the blue enriched light which can have a positive effect on subjective alertness, vitality and performance.\n\n## Food availability\n\nTo meet the needs of a growing population, we need to consume resources more efficiently. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) global food demand will rise by 70% by 2050, while 50% of arable land globally is already farmed. Many of the vegetables we consume are not produced locally and are transported over long distances. Approximately, 17% of the world's available food is either spoiled or thrown away before it ever reaches a plate. Overall, the world's current food production and distribution systems contribute to between 20% and 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions. To address these challenges, significant changes to our food systems are needed to ensure enough safe, healthy, accessible and affordable food for all in the future.\n\nHorticulture LED technologies can provide an answer by realizing extremely efficient farming with high yields, efficient use of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nspace and enabling local production, at least a 90% reduction in water use, and avoiding pollution from pesticides. With the right light spectrum and growth recipe, our lighting innovations give better control over climate and crops and help to achieve high quality and yield at the right time.\n\n## Safety & security\n\nFor the last decade, lighting has gone through a significant technological transformation, opening new possibilities in using light. With increasing urbanization, street crime and traffic accidents are a real challenge. Interact-connected LED systems and management software improve city services and can help to reduce street crime and night-time traffic accidents, while reducing energy costs. Our connected LED systems also have applications for outdoor use in residences, enhancing feeling of safety and security.\n\nWe expanded our home connected systems by integrating smart lighting and smart home security, incorporating new Philips Hue Secure cameras, sensors, and app features designed to enhance the security of your home. The monitoring is in real time and motion notifications are instantly received; actions like triggering light and sound alarms can be taken via the security center in the Philips Hue app.\n\nToday, more than 50 billion devices are connected to the Internet, most of them wirelessly. This is placing wireless communication under increasing pressure, and the radio spectrum is becoming congested. In addition, there are areas where radio frequency wireless communication is not permitted or the best\n\nfit. Trulifi by Signify offers a range of LiFi systems, providing a two-way wireless communication that is reliable, secure, and fast. Next to this, Trulifi is immune to any electromagnetic interference from, for example, industrial processes.\n\n## Access to light\n\nAs a company that is committed to giving back to society, we use our expertise and knowledge of lighting to make a positive social impact. We do this by supporting the Signify Foundation, a standalone non-profit organization.\n\nWith the ambition of lighting 10 million lives by the end of 2025, the Foundation is making strides through its projects within three focus areas: Lighting Lives, Humanitarian Lighting, and Lighting Entrepreneurs. 2023 represents a story of further progress for the Foundation, lighting 9.4 million lives. This figure surpasses the year's target: 8.7 million lives lit from a 2017 baseline.\n\n## Lighting lives\n\nThe Lighting lives program aims to create long-lasting positive impact on people's lives. Lighting interventions designed in collaboration with local groups and aid agencies have made a positive impact on communities, providing better access to health care, essential services, sports, and productivity.\n\nThe Lighting Lives program focuses on rural community facilities such as schools and healthcare centers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Similarly, well-lit outdoor areas are crucial for the safety and security of both students and staff and create opportunities for sports and socialization in the evenings. Yet, the power of light goes beyond illuminating spaces.\n\nIn 2023, we donated 3,000 portable Solar Lamps to adolescent schoolgirls in rural Mozambique, in collaboration with Pathfinder International. These regions have been deeply affected by conflict and civil unrest, resulting in limited access to energy and heightened safety concerns. Many of these young girls are currently residing in displacement camps, where the lamps provide a reliable source of light in otherwise dark and uncertain environments after school. The Solar Lamps also enable the girls to continue their educational pursuits after the sun has set, ensuring that they can complete their homework and safely enjoy their leisure time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Healthcare centers\n\nIn remote and rural healthcare centers without lighting, life-saving interventions cannot take place after dark, leaving patients untreated or forcing them to travel long distances to overcrowded urban healthcare facilities. Access to light empowers workers to operate safely and effectively at night, providing better care to their patients. In 2023, the Foundation expanded its program Lighting Health Centers to an additional 100 remote health centers located in the Kisumu region of Northeast Kenya.\n\n## Humanitarian Lighting\n\nThroughout the year, the Signify Foundation continued to address pressing humanitarian needs caused by disasters and conflicts. The Foundation executed projects where lighting played an important role in disaster response, either by providing immediate relief or contributing to building and rebuilding efforts.\n\nWith a multitude of crises compounding, the Signify Foundation prioritized disaster support based on the scale of the disaster, the feasibility of reaching affected populations, and the potential for lighting to provide relief. In immediate responses, lighting can be installed in shelters and provides support for aid workers during search efforts or relocation. In rebuilding, recovery efforts, and medium-term development, lighting plays an important role in building or restoring infrastructure and peace for the affected communities.\n\nIn 2023, the Signify Foundation partnered with GlobalMedic to respond to the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria, which claimed over 50,000 lives and destroyed over 84,000 buildings. 12,700\n\nemergency kits with solar lights were distributed to families and medical centers, thanks to the Foundation's partnerships and the generous contributions of Signify employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn refugee settlements, lights enhance safety, reduce gender-based violence, crime, and create livelihood opportunities for refugees. This year, to mitigate the impact of Gender Based Violence for internally displaced people, the Signify Foundation provided 10,000 Solar Lights to reproductive health and protection services in Syria through a partnership with the UN Population Fund.\n\n## Lighting Entrepreneurs\n\nThe Lighting Entrepreneurs pillar is committed to building capacity and competency to ensure the long-term impact of lighting lives. Young adults are given vocational training to develop skills needed to operate and maintain lighting installations provided to their communities. One such project in partnership with BRAC took place in the Philippines. The project provided training for 50 unemployed young women and girls aged 16-30 from marginalized communities in the lowest income bracket.\n\nThe project trained them as electricians and entrepreneurs, and focused on developing soft skills, business skills, and technical training. This approach empowered the women trainees to be active in a sector that is traditionally dominated by men. In the coming year, these proud trainees will be linked to job opportunities and start a journey of self-dependence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDespite the Foundation's successful year ending ahead of track for the approaching 2025 target of lighting 10 million lives, much work remains to be done. 1 in 10 people still live without access to electricity globally. In the face of increasing climate-related disasters and conflicts, this challenge is further exacerbated. 2024 will be the year that the Foundation expects to achieve our first milestone of lighting 10 million lives, and a year to reflect on what is next. By increasing our ambition level, forging broader partnerships for collaboration and funding opportunities, the Foundation aims to make an even greater impact in the years to come.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The year was also marked by action, including the adoption of key global policy commitments such as the Global Biodiversity Framework in 2022 and the COP 28 agreement to transition away from fossil fuel. These commitments reflect a growing recognition of the urgent need to safeguard our planet's boundaries, address global warming and accelerate the transition to a net-zero world. The global focus on energy consumption and energy efficiency solutions has intensified, with renewable energy sources taking center stage. As we navigate this era of transformation, we know our collective actions today will shape the landscape of tomorrow.\n\nThrough our 'Brighter Lives, Better World 2025' sustainability program, we aim to double our positive impact on the environment and society. We are on track to reduce our emissions across our full value chain at double the pace required by the Paris agreement's 1.5\u00b0C scenario and have reduced our carbon emissions by 19% YoY. We continue to rely on 100% renewable electricity and in 2023 invested in a new virtual Power Purchase Agreement further supporting the green energy transition. And we are proud that we have surpassed our 2025 circular revenues target.\n\nAs the global leader in lighting and a pioneer in sustainable lighting solutions, our focus remains on innovating in energy efficiency, connected systems, and to further integrate circularity principles. We are working with peers and partners to steer the lighting sector towards even greater transformation, and ensuring we contribute positively to the transition toward a sustainable economy\"\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate action\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate leadership\n\nAt Signify, we acknowledge the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and believe we have an important role to play in the transformation towards a lowcarbon economy, with deep decarbonization across our value chain. In 2018, Signify was one of the first companies committing to verified Science-Based Targets in line with the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C pathway, to cut GHG emissions in our operations as well as in our value chain. We commit to reduce 70% of absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and 30% of absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from use of sold products by 2030 (baseline 2015). At the end of 2023, we achieved:\n\n- \u00b7 58% reduction of absolute scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions (baseline 2015).\n- \u00b7 61% reduction of absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from use of sold products (baseline 2015).\n\nSignify was again recognized in CDP's Climate A list for our leadership in environmental performance and we were included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World and Europe Index for the seventh consecutive year and sixth year, respectively, for our 2022 performance. We continued to partner with the Climate Group's EV100 Initiative to operate a lease fleet of hybrid and fully electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030. We remain engaged in the AndersReizen Dutch Business Sustainable Mobility Pledge to further\n\nimprove the sustainability performance of our business travel.\n\nThrough our partnership with the RE100 Initiative, we shifted to 100% renewable electricity use since 2020. As an active member of Clean Cargo and the WBCSD Transforming Heavy Transport project, we engage in cross-industry collaboration and strive to lower the carbon footprint of our freight transport. We renewed our partnership with Maersk, one of our key partners in ocean freight, and supported them in launching vessels that operate on zero-carbon fuels. These partnerships will help us to scale zero carbon solutions in our supply chain and logistics operations. Our continuous pledge to the World Green Building Council's Net Zero Carbon Buildings commitment facilitates improvement in energy efficiency as well as reduction in electricity consumption in our non-industrial buildings.\n\nIn 2023, we continued to evaluate our climate-related risks and opportunities through our internal cross-department task force aligned with the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). As a result, we refined our climate risk mitigation and adaptation strategy. For more information, refer to our TCFD reporting in the Sustainability Supplement to our Annual Report and to the CSRD section 17.\n\nAll our environmental policies and our management framework are based on the international ISO 14001 standard. In 2023, 87% of our manufacturing sites were ISO 14001 certified.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This means we aim to achieve the emission reduction goals laid out in the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C pathway for 2031 by 2025, six years early. By the end of 2025, we will reduce our scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 40% compared to our 2019 baseline year.\n\nWe track our progress, and we report our full Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions, shown in table to right. We reduced 53% GHG emissions across our full value chain at the end of 2023, 22% year-on-year. This reduction is mainly attributed to the increased share of sales of energy-efficient LED and connected LED lighting which drives energy saving and emissions reduction for our customers during product use. The key contributors are our energy-efficient LED and connected LED lighting, such as the Ultra Energy Efficient A class product families\n\n99% of our value-chain emissions lies in the product use phase. By offering energyefficient products, we help our customers reduce millions of tonnes of CO 2 e.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the total avoided emissions achieved through our LED technology sales (compared to Conventional technology) was 240 million tonnes CO 2 e.\n\nWe are on track to deliver against our ambitious goal of doubling the pace of the Paris Agreement.\n\n## Signify carbon footprint in kilotonnes-CO 2 e\n\n|                                                                                      | 2021   | 2022    | 2023    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Scope 1                                                                              | 149    | 142     | 148     |\n| Scope 2 (market based)                                                               | 10     | 13      | 0       |\n| Scope 2 (location based)                                                             | 186    | 140     | 129     |\n| Scope 3 (indirect emission categories)                                               |        |         |         |\n| Category 1: Purchased goods and services                                             | n.a.   | 696     | 683     |\n| Category 2: Capital goods                                                            | n.a.   | 5       | 15      |\n| Category 3: Fuel- and Energy-Related Activities.

We focus on decarbonizing our own operations and enabling our entire value chain and society to accelerate climate action. Signify has reduced 77% of its\n\nabsolute operational carbon footprint since 2010, and continues to do so, through implementing initiatives in our factories, offices, logistics, and business travel. Our operational carbon footprint calculation includes scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3: business travel and logistics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, total gross GHG emissions in our own operations were 249 kilotonnes (2022: 252), a 1% decrease year-on-year and a 31% reduction compared to 2019. Our operational emission intensity in tonnes of CO 2 e per million-euro sales was 37 in 2023 (2022: 34).\n\nAs a manufacturing company, we have unavoidable residual emissions, such as emissions from the use of natural gas in industrial processes. To fulfill our carbon neutral commitment, we invest in certified carbon credit projects, while supporting GHG emissions mitigation beyond our own value chain. Financing carbon credits is not part of our emission reduction strategy, rather we invest in high quality carbon credit projects to balance out unavoidable residual emissions that are not feasible to eliminate. By doing so, we also enable actors in and out of our value chain to act and cut their emissions.\n\nIn 2023, we invested 250 kilotonnes of CO 2 e via carbon credits (2022: 252), resulting in a net operational carbon footprint of 0 (2022: 0). All used carbon credits have been certified by the Verra, Verra Climate, Community, and Biodiversity (CCB) Standards and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Verra's diligence and transparency are underpinned by its fully publicly available Registry System.",

        "page_content": "## Operational carbon footprint in kilotonnes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLogistics\n\nNon-industrial operations\n\nBusiness travel\n\nManufacturing\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nIn 2023, manufacturing accounted for 48% of our operational carbon footprint and amounted to 120 kilotonnes. This is a decrease of 14% compared to 2022. We continued to lead operational changes and efficiency improvements, which resulted in less energy intensive activities and less energy consumption.\n\n## Non-industrial operations\n\nGHG emissions from non-industrial operations (offices, warehouses) represented 12% of our total operational carbon footprint. Our emissions from non-industrial operations increased by 14 kilotonnes compared to 2022 due to increased energy consumption in offices.\n\n## Logistics\n\nIn 2023, 35% of our total GHG emissions in our operations were attributed to logistics, and our total emissions from logistics remained stable compared to 2022. We continue to focus on improving sustainable logistics operations, such as reducing reliance on emission-intensive mode of transport - air transport.\n\n## Business travel\n\nBusiness travel accounted for 5% of our operational carbon footprint in 2023. Our GHG emissions from business travel increased 30% in 2023, mainly driven by an increase in business air travel.\n\n## Energy use in operations\n\nSignify's total energy usage in 2023 amounted to 3,237 terajoules (899,285 MWh). Our operational energy intensity in terajoules per million-euro sales was 0.48 in 2023 (132.6 MWh/million-euro sales). This is 6% more efficient than 2022 (0.51) and is due to operational optimization, improved energy efficiency, less reliance on energy-intensive activities in our factories and reduced heating and lighting requirements.\n\n## Electricity\n\nWe continue to procure 100% of our electricity from renewable sources. This achievement directly contributes to SDG 7: Clean and affordable energy. All electricity consumed by our operations worldwide was sourced from renewable sources or matched with Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). Approximately 9% of our renewable electricity was contracted via our energy providers, 54% was sourced through the procurement of renewable energy certificates, and 37% came from our\n\nparticipation in Power Purchase Agreements (PPA). In 2023, our most recent PPA in Finland went live and complements our other two PPAs in Poland and the US. Our virtual PPAs contribute to the transition to more sustainable electricity grids and reinforce our long-term commitment to using renewable electricity.\n\n## Enabling carbon reduction for our customers\n\nPhasing out conventional lighting and switching to energy-efficient LEDs, introducing solar lighting, and further enhancing energy saving with smart connected lighting has significant environmental benefits. As mentioned previously, the majority of our value-chain emissions lies in the product use phase. Helping our customers to reduce emissions through energy efficiency is a vital aspect of our innovation process.\n\nSignify is committed to reduce GHG emissions by improving the energy efficiency of its products, systems, and services. The progress in our portfolio to support climate change mitigation has been aligned with the EU Taxonomy regulation and is reflected in the Taxonomy specific section of this report. The benefits include having comparable and harmonized measures throughout the industry.\n\nThe past year we continued to work on developing ultra energy-efficient products and have launched an extended ultra energy efficient portfolio of professional indoor, outdoor, and residential lamps as well as the first luminaires in this category.\n\nBy delivering cleaner and more energyefficient solutions, we are proud to contribute to the achievement of SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Philips Ultra Efficient LED luminaire\n\nSignify's portfolio of Ultra Efficient LED solutions expanded in 2023, with the introduction of UE indoor luminaires. Designed to allow you to immediately save up to 20% energy compared to the current best offering within the same range. Ultra Efficient luminaires also meet Signify strict Lighting for Circularity criteria.\n\nThe products' high level of energy efficiency and long lifetime dramatically reduce both waste and carbon emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Enabling carbon reduction at our suppliers\n\nIn 2023, we continued to engage with our suppliers to reduce their carbon footprint. Our approach is to proactively initiate, develop and support GHG emission-reduction activities at suppliers through our partnership with the CDP Supply Chain program. In 2023, we invited 491 of our strategic suppliers to the program, of which 61% submitted their CDP questionnaire.\n\nIn 2023, 183 suppliers reported emission reduction activities (2022: 263). 134 suppliers reported that their emissions decreased compared to the previous reporting year, 26% of suppliers reported renewable energy usage, and 28% suppliers engaged their own suppliers to reduce emissions.\n\nWe increased the number of suppliers committed to the Science-Based Targets Initiative to 110 (2022: 103) and we increased the number of suppliers that have a RE100 program from 14 in 2022 to 16 in 2023. We are developing a more accurate method to calculate scope 3 GHG emission in the supply base. At the end of 2023, we estimated that 29 million metric tons carbon of CO 2 e were saved in our supply base (2022: 24 million metric tons).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Setting Science-Based Targets in China\n\nSignify was one of the first CDP Supply Chain members to start engaging Chinese suppliers on the importance to set Science-Based Targets (SBTs) to reduce GHG emissions. We nominated four of our high-impact China-based suppliers, of which two have now formally signed the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) commitment letter. In a dedicated webinar to our suppliers, we explained how science-based target setting plays an important role in suppliers' evaluation. Once suppliers have formally committed to the SBTi, an emission calculation tool was provided to them to help the establishment of accurate emission rates. Our collaboration with CDP was key to support our suppliers and monitor their progress and progress reports were shared at management level, to initiate actions where needed.\n\n## CDP reporters per region and topics reported\n\n|                                               | Greater  China   | Greater  China   | Rest of the  world   | Rest of the  world   | Europe   | Europe    | Americas   | Americas   | Total   | Total     |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------|-----------|------------|------------|---------|-----------|\n|                                               |                  | 2022 2023        | 2022 2023            |                      |          | 2022 2023 |            | 2022 2023  |         | 2022 2023 |\n| Scope 1                                       | 62%              | 68%              | 67%                  | 84%                  |          | 66%   66% | 65%        | 63%        | 64%     | 68%       |\n| Scope 2                                       | 33%              | 40%              | 53%                  | 69%                  | 44%      | 54%       | 57%        | 57%        | 43%     | 51%       |\n| Scope 1 & 2                                   | 36%              | 41%              | 58%                  | 78%                  | 50%      | 56%       | 57%        | 57%        | 47%     | 53%       |\n| Have a reduction target                       | 55%              | 56%              | 58%                  | 66%                  | 46%      | 54%       | 48%        | 52%        | 51%     | 56%       |\n| Have on-going reduction  activities           | 54%              | 56%              | 62%                  | 75%                  | 63%      | 68%       | 52%        | 53%        | 57%     | 61%       |\n| Climate change  opportunities                 | 70%              | 76%              | 67%                  | 72%                  | 73%      | 79%       | 73%        | 70%        | 71%     | 75%       |\n| Climate change risks                          | 60%              | 65%              | 44%                  | 63%                  | 52%      | 51%       | 56%        | 48%        | 55%     | 57%       |\n| Integrated climate change  in risk management | 31%              | 27%              | 44%                  | 59%                  | 38%      | 40%       | 51%        | 48%        | 38%     | 39%       |\n| Total amount of reporters                     | 141              | 111              | 45                   | 32                   | 103      | 96        | 63         | 60         | 352     | 299       |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Circular economy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accelerating the transition to a circular economy\n\nAt Signify, we identified five strategic areas where we will grow our business while furthering our contribution to a better and more sustainable world.

Via wellestablished sustainable design rules, Signify continuously lowers the weight of new product designs, resulting in less material use and costs for our product portfolio. The sustainable design rules are also optimized for circularity, resulting in products that can be upgraded, serviced, reused, refurbished, or recycled. For more information about the performance and benefits of our lighting for circularity solutions, visit our website.\n\nOur circular innovations cover four categories: Serviceable luminaires, Circular components, Intelligent asset management, and Circular services.\n\nServiceable luminaires are fixtures that are upgradable, serviceable, connectable, energy-efficient, reusable, and recyclable.\n\nIn 2023, we introduced the StoreFlow retail lighting, which enhances customer experience with a new concept in highcontrast aisle lighting that has great design flexibility and product sustainability. The product is made with bio-circular material (re-use of a biomass waste stream) for the housing and all key internal parts are replaceable and allow for greater product longevity.\n\nIn 2023, StoreFlow won two prestigious awards for its design from iF Design and Red Dot.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOther recently introduced luminaires meeting Signify's Lighting for Circularity criteria include the StoreSet evo in the retail segment, the SlimBlend in the office segment and the GentleSpace gen3 in the industry segment.\n\nOur 3D printed luminaires are another great example of a serviceable product; designed in a modular way and easily upgradable. 3D printing technology also supports sustainability by eliminating waste using recycled and mass balanced bio-circular materials. Supporting the reduction of CO 2 emissions through local and on demand production.\n\nIn 2023, Signify launched the Spring Oasis 3Dprinted pendant lamp, made from recycled water jugs commonly found in offices and homes for drinking water.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCircular components are exchangeable and have recyclable parts, such as drivers, controls, and LED boards.\n\nIntelligent systems monitor serviceable luminaires to enable preventive maintenance. Signify connected systems tell us exactly when and where to perform maintenance, cutting down on waste, costs, downtime, and manpower.\n\nCircular services aim at prolonging lifetimes and provide customers with services that combine lighting design, installation and maintenance in a single contract.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe closely monitor and report the progress of the circular portfolio contribution, and at the end of 2023, 33% of our revenues came from circular products, systems or services (2022: 29%).\n\nOur efforts also address supply chain improvements, such as remote serviceability (connected lighting) and end-of-life services. By minimizing material waste and reducing the environmental impact, we create an ecosystem that extends the life of our lighting products and provides a better future for the next generation.\n\n## 4.4.3 Environmental incidents\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, Signify experienced no significant environmental incidents.",

The indoor professional lighting business was impacted by higher interest rates and a more restrictive credit environment, while Signify's agriculture customers reduced their orders due to high energy/operating costs. In addition, the Chinese market remained weak throughout the year.\n\nAs the supply chain environment improved overall, Signify's customers continued to reduce their inventory levels, leading to a destocking effect that mainly impacted the OEM business.\n\nAt the same time, Signify's gross margin expanded through the combined effect of lower cost of goods sold and a positive pricing effect.\n\nIn 2023, nominal sales decreased by 10.8% to EUR 6,704 million, a comparable sales decline of 8.3%. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 10.0%, broadly in line with 2022. Net income decreased to EUR 215 million. In 2022, net income included a one-time gain of EUR 184 million on the disposal of non-strategic real estate assets. Net cash provided by\n\noperating activities increased to EUR 696 million, while free cash flow increased to EUR 586 million.\n\nThe nominal sales decrease of 10.8% year on year includes a negative currency effect of 3.3%, mainly due to the depreciation of the USD and the CNY, and a positive effect of 0.8% from the consolidation of Fluence, Pierlite and Intelligent Lighting Controls. Comparable sales declined by 8.3%, mainly due to weakness in consumer, OEM and indoor professional lighting. Outdoor professional lighting remained resilient throughout the year. LED-based sales were 85% of Signify's total sales (2022: 83%).\n\nThe gross margin decreased to EUR 2,558 million. The Adjusted gross margin decreased to EUR 2,660 million. As a percentage of sales, the Adjusted gross margin improved by 240 bps to 39.7%, mainly due to effective COGS management, pricing, and positive sales mix.\n\nIndirect costs decreased by EUR 31 million to EUR 2,191 million. Adjusted indirect costs decreased by EUR 96 million to EUR 2,075 million. As a percentage of sales, Adjusted indirect costs increased by 210 bps to 31.0%, mainly due to an under-absorption of fixed costs.\n\nEBITA decreased to EUR 449 million. Excluding the one-time gain on the disposal of nonstrategic real estate assets in 2022 and other adjusted items, such as restructuring expenses and acquisition-related charges, Adjusted EBITA decreased by EUR 92 million to EUR 670 million. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 10.0%, broadly in line with 2022, as the\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "gross margin improvement was offset by an under-absorption of fixed costs.\n\nIncome from operations decreased to EUR 369 million. This included EUR 167 million of restructuring expenses, EUR 14 million of acquisition-related charges and a net negative impact of EUR 40 million related to incidental items. These incidental items are non-recurring items by nature and are related to impairment and other non-cash charges/gains related to operations in Russia and Ukraine, a one-day FX loss from the devaluation of the Argentine peso, separation costs, real estate gain/loss, incidental warranty costs, environmental provisions for inactive sites and the discounting effect of long-term provisions.\n\nNet income decreased to EUR 215 million, mainly due to lower income from operations and higher financial expenses, partly offset by lower income tax expense. Last year's income from operations benefited from the one-time gain on the disposal of non-strategic real estate assets.\n\nCompared to December 2022, working capital decreased by EUR 103 million, mainly due to lower inventories, lower receivables and other working capital items, partly offset by lower payables. As a percentage of last twelve-month sales, working capital decreased by 60 bps to 6.9%. Including last twelve-month sales pro forma for Fluence and Pierlite, working capital decreased by 50 bps.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by EUR 320 million to EUR 696 million, mainly driven by lower inventories, which benefited from shorter lead times, and\n\nlower receivables. In 2023, net capital expenditures were EUR 110 million. In 2022, net capital expenditures were positive as they benefited from proceeds from the disposal of non-strategic real estate assets. In 2023, free cash flow increased to EUR 586 million, or 8.7% of sales, mainly as a result of the higher net cash provided by operating activities.\n\nShareholders' equity decreased to EUR 2,817 million, mainly due to the dividend distribution and currency translation results, partly offset by net income.\n\nNet debt decreased to EUR 1,071 million at year-end 2023, as a higher cash position more than offset the increase in gross debt. The higher cash position was mainly driven by higher free cash flow, lower purchases of businesses and financial proceeds from debt issuance. In Q4 2023, Signify issued long-term debt to refinance part of the debt that will mature in 2024. Gross debt increased as a result of the debt issuance.\n\nAt year-end 2023, Signify had a postemployment liability of EUR 322 million, compared with EUR 327 million at the end of 2022. The reduction is mostly related to benefit payments and one-off gains related to restructurings and plan amendments, partly offset by actuarial losses.\n\n## 5.1.2 Performance by Division\n\n## Performance Digital Solutions\n\n## About Digital Solutions\n\nSignify is the world leader in the professional lighting market for products such as LED and systems and services, with strong positions across key geographies.

        "page_content": "products see a much slower conversion rate to LED. The division continues to proactively manage its manufacturing footprint and reduce operational costs to optimize its profit margin and free cash flow.\n\n## Market developments\n\nThe conventional lamps market is expected to continue to decline in the coming years due to the ongoing adoption of LED lighting technologies and regulatory changes.\n\nIn 2023, Europe banned the production of CFL-ni, and T5 and T8 linear fluorescent tubes, accelerating the transition to LED technologies.\n\n## 2023 Business highlights\n\nSignify estimates that the conventional lighting market declined at a faster pace than its Conventional Products division in 2023 and thus the business continued to gain market share for the 7 th consecutive year.\n\n## 2023 Financial performance\n\nNominal sales decreased by 20.9% to EUR 627 million, including a negative currency effect of 2.5%. Comparable sales decreased by 18.4%.\n\nIncome from operations slightly increased to EUR 62 million. Adjusted EBITA was EUR 129 million and excluded restructuring expenses of EUR 51 million and a net negative impact of EUR 16 million from incidental items. The Adjusted EBITA margin increased by 600 bps to 20.6%, driven by gross margin recovery and cost discipline. Free cash flow increased by EUR 43 million to EUR 99 million.\n\n## 2024 and beyond\n\nConventional Products will continue focusing on optimizing market share, profit and cash, in line with its \"last company standing\" strategy. It will do so by leveraging its scale, global footprint and lean manufacturing capabilities, while still responding to the remaining customer demand for conventional products. It will intensify its focus on specialty lighting products, which have a much slower rate of decline.\n\n## Performance Other\n\n\"Other\" represents amounts not allocated to the operating segments and includes costs related both to central R&D activities to drive innovation, and to Group enabling functions. Income from operations and EBITA were both EUR (147) million. EBITA included restructuring costs of EUR 59 million, and a negative impact from incidental items and acquisition-related charges of EUR 1 million. In 2022, EBITA included a one-time gain of EUR 184 million related to the disposal of non-strategic real estate assets in Q2 2022. Adjusted EBITA was EUR (86) million, compared with EUR (75) million in 2022.\n\n## 5.1.3 P erformance by geographic cluster\n\nIn Europe, sales declined by 9.3% to EUR 2,023 million and included a negative currency effect of 0.6%. Comparable sales declined by 8.7%, as most markets declined.\n\nIn the Americas, sales declined by 11.6% to EUR 2,633 million and included a negative currency effect of 3.2% and a positive effect of 0.5% from the consolidation of Intelligent Lighting Controls. Comparable sales declined by 8.9%, mainly due to the United States, partly offset by strong growth in Latin America.\n\nIn the Rest of the world, sales declined by 11.0% to EUR 1,522 million and included a negative currency effect of 7.6% and a positive effect of 1.3% from the consolidation of Pierlite. Comparable sales declined by 4.7%, due to weakness across most markets.\n\nGlobal businesses' sales declined by 11.8% to EUR 526 million and included a negative currency effect of 1.5% and a positive effect of 4.1% from the consolidation of Fluence. Comparable sales declined by 14.4%, mainly due to Klite and Fluence.\n\n## Sales by market in millions of EUR unless otherwise stated\n\n|                      | 2022   | 2023   | Change   | CSG      |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|----------|----------|\n| Europe               | 2,230  | 2,023  | (9.3) %  | (8.7) %  |\n| Americas  1          | 2,978  | 2,633  | (11.6) % | (8.9) %  |\n| Rest of the world  2 | 1,709  | 1,522  | (11.0) % | (4.7) %  |\n| Global businesses  3 | 597    | 526    | (11.8) % | (14.4) % |\n| Total                | 7,514  | 6,704  | (10.8) % | (8.3) %  |\n\n- 1 Americas includes Intelligent Lighting Controls since March 1, 2023.\n- 2 Rest of the world includes Pierlite since April 29, 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The volatility remained high, and geopolitical tensions continued. Our financial results were negatively affected by continued softness in consumer, indoor professional and OEM channels, and slower than anticipated recovery in the Chinese markets. Whereas comparable sales declined in 2023, the company was able to maintain double digit profitability margin and over-deliver against its free cash flow guidance.\n\nAt the same time, the company is on track for three Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 sustainability commitments, with the percentage of circular revenues surpassing the 2025 target this year. We see the company being well positioned to capture opportunities under governmental stimulus programs promoting sustainability focused investments in the US, Europe and other countries, and to help our customers to save energy and reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nAs the Supervisory Board, we have been actively involved in refining the company's strategic direction and the company's response to the continued challenging market circumstances. We extensively discussed the intended new operating model, and the impact on the senior leadership of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe company. We support the transition to a new operating model and structural measures announced in December 2023 and believe these will strengthen the company's agility and performance.\n\n## Arthur van der Poel\n\nChair of the Supervisory Board\n\n## 9.1 Introduction\n\nThis report provides information on how the Supervisory Board and its committees fulfilled their duties in 2023.\n\nWe welcomed Sophie Bechu to our Supervisory Board, who was appointed by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in May 2023. Since then, our Supervisory Board consists of seven members; all seven (100%) of our Supervisory Board members are independent.\n\nThe Supervisory Board supervises the policies and management and the general affairs of the company. We also provide advice to the Board of Management.\n\nOur four committees cover key areas in greater detail: the Audit Committee, the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee, the Remuneration Committee, and the Digital Committee. The charters of each of the committees are published on the company's website.",

A Supervisory Board member shall attend at least 85% of the Supervisory Board meetings as scheduled annually in advance as referred to in Article 5.1 of the Supervisory Board Rules. If a Supervisory Board member does not meet this minimum attendance requirement, the Chair will review the reasons for the absence.\n\nThe Supervisory Board held seven regular meetings in 2023: four for the quarterly results plus a meeting in May, September and December. Six out of seven meetings were held in person. The attendance rate of the Supervisory Board meetings was 100% in 2023. The attendance record matrix in this chapter 9.2 gives details for both the Supervisory Board and committee meetings.\n\nIn addition to the seven regular meetings, a combined Supervisory Board/Audit Committee is held ahead of the publication of the annual report each year. In 2023, the Supervisory Board also held some ad hoc calls, for example on the Q4 2022 performance update and the new operating model.

In addition, the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the CEO are in regular contact on a variety of matters. Our members also individually interacted with members of the Board of Management and with senior management outside the formal Supervisory Board meetings. From time to time, Supervisory Board members wanted to be informed on, or discuss, a specific topic. This was then followed-up by a member of the Board of Management or senior management.\n\nThere were no apparent conflicts of interest of material significance in 2023, which would have called for one of the members not to participate in the decision-making.\n\nIn 2023, the Supervisory Board discussed a wide range of topics throughout the year. Key topics and activities included the following:\n\n## \u00b7 Strategy review and strategy execution\n\nIn September 2023, we had our annual Strategy Review meeting, dedicated to discussing the company's strategy towards sustainable long-term value creation. As part of the session, we discussed macroenvironment trends and changes, the impact on the lighting market forecast and competitive trends. We looked at the company's financial and sustainability performance, customer experience, and performance on our 2023 strategic initiatives. We discussed the strategic implications of the current macroenvironment, enterprise risks, and how we will address these as part of the overall company's 5 Frontiers strategy and strategic initiatives for 2024.\n\nAs part of the Strategy Review in September, we also had three strategic deep dives: on the company's current performance, future growth and brand strategy. Each of these deep dives was prepared with guidance and input of a Supervisory Board member. As a follow-up on the growth deep dive, management updated the Board on how the company builds its market forecasts.\n\nThe Strategy Review was followed by a strategic plan discussion in December in which management presented the 2024-2026 strategic plan, including financial objectives. We also discussed and approved the company's financial targets for 2024 within the context of its 2024 operating plan.\n\nIn addition to these meetings dedicated to the company's strategy, management updated us on a quarterly basis on the\n\n<!-- image -->",

We continued our practice started last year, to have a dedicated quarterly discussion on trends and developments in the company's competitive landscape, together with a deep dive on a competitor.\n\nThroughout the year, we discussed the market trends, risks and opportunities, and their strategic implications as part of the market and division updates and strategic projects.\n\nBoth on a quarterly basis and as part of the division and market updates, we discussed pending and potential acquisitions and divestments contributing to the company's strategy execution. The Board also discussed performance and learnings from past acquisitions, including Cooper Lighting, Fluence and Intelligent Lighting Controls.\n\nWe have reviewed, challenged, and advised the Board of Management on the company's implementation of its strategic plan and strategic priorities throughout the year.\n\n## \u00b7 New organization model\n\nIn December 2023, the company announced the introduction of a new operating model and structural measures to enhance customer centricity, speed of execution and reduction of structural costs.

This year, we focused on diversity, equity & inclusion and on how to best reinforce values and behaviors.\n\n## \u00b7 Business performance\n\nEach quarter, we discussed the company's business performance in detail. These discussions included updates on the company's financial performance on key financial metrics and factors impacting performance and forecasts, both on a global and on a division and market basis.\n\nAmong the factors impacting performance were the continued higher inflation, affecting both the company's costs and customer demand.\n\nWe discontinued the separate detailed quarterly reporting to the Board on operations, which was introduced in COVID-19 times. We did continue to address (potential) impacts of geopolitical tensions on the supply chain and the company's adaptation of its operational strategy thereto.\n\n## \u00b7 Sustainability\n\nSustainability is an inherent part of the company's 5 Frontiers strategy. In pursuance thereof, the company developed a five-year sustainability\n\nprogram: Brighter Lives, Better World 2025. Throughout the year, we were updated on the company's targets, progress on this program, and the company's strategic initiatives for 2023 to drive growth for sustainability. Also outside meetings, there is contact on sustainability matters between individual members of the Supervisory Board and the Head of Sustainability and the Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer.\n\nAs part of our last year's Supervisory Board performance evaluation, we agreed that the Supervisory Board oversight of sustainability strategy remains a topic for the full Board, and that sustainability reporting best resides with the Audit Committee.\n\nBoth the Audit Committee and the full Supervisory Board reviewed the double materiality assessment, adjusted this year to the new requirements under the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). For more information, see chapter 4, Brighter Lives Better World, subsection 4.1.4, Materiality assessment.\n\nIn December, the Supervisory Board engaged in an ESG program. The purpose of the program was to further enhance the knowledge and understanding of the Supervisory Board on ESG, with a focus on reporting, as such to be better equipped to supervise and advise management on sustainability matters. The broad part of the program was delivered by the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership. The Head of Sustainability thereafter provided a deep dive on the company's sustainability\n\nprogram, the company's climate transition plan and sustainability reporting, Our external auditor Ernst & Young, LLP completed the program with insights into their assurance approach and the role of the auditor as to sustainability reporting.\n\n## \u00b7 Digital delivery\n\nAt the start of the year, the full Board reviewed and discussed the company's digital year plan and focus in 2023 to accelerate digitalization, together with the governance for prioritization. The Board was also separately updated on a key digital customer interface project in Europe. Throughout the year, the Board remained updated on progress on the company's digital roadmap through the quarterly update on the company's global digital strategic initiatives and via its Digital Committee report back, see sub section 9.3.4 for more details.\n\n## \u00b7 Capital allocation, financial reporting and investor relations\n\nWe reviewed the capital allocation policy of the company. In this context we also discussed expectations related to cash generation, dividend distributions, investments in innovation and M&A, share repurchases to cover obligations arising from Signify's long-term incentive and other employee share plans, debt profile and refinancing as well as credit ratings.\n\nWe discussed the quarterly results, forecasts and the (semi-) annual financial statements for 2023, including related reports from the internal and external auditors and sustainability information, and related press releases.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In accordance with this proposal, the 2023 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders reappointed Ernst & Young Accountants LLP for the period 2023-2025.\n\n- \u00b7 Proposal external auditor 2026-2028 As EU law requires a rotation of the external audit firm after the firm has completed the company's statutory audit for ten consecutive years, a new auditor will need to be appointed for the period as from January 2026. The committee was engaged in the auditor tender, resulting in the committee's recommendation to the\n\nSupervisory Board to submit to the 2024 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders a proposal to appoint the company's new external auditor, starting on January 1, 2026, for a period of three years.\n\n- \u00b7 Interaction with external auditor and audit results reports\n\nThe reporting from the company's external auditor Ernst & Young Accountants LLP relates to the audit plan and the audit results reports, which are shared with management and the Audit Committee.

        "page_content": "The committee held five regular meetings in 2023 and reported its findings to the full Supervisory Board after each meeting. The CEO and Chief Legal Officer generally attend the committee's meetings. The committee Chair has regular contact with the CEO and the Chief Legal Officer. Committee members are regularly in contact on topics ahead of a committee meeting, resulting in efficient decision-making during the meetings.\n\nAs part of its standing agenda, the committee discussed changes in key personnel positions, succession planning and the functioning of key personnel as well as the Supervisory Board's performance evaluation procedures. In addition, the committee discussed developments in the Dutch corporate governance landscape and the company's corporate governance structure.\n\nIn 2023, the committee specifically dedicated time to the following matters:\n\n- \u00b7 Composition Board of Management Following a review and assessment by the committee, the Supervisory Board proposed to re-appoint Eric Rondolat as CEO and Chair of the Board of Management, at the AGM to be held in May 2024, for a period of four years.\n\nIn December 2023, the company announced that Javier van Engelen, who joined the company as its CFO in 2020, had decided to leave the company on April 1, 2024. The committee initiated the search and leads the selection process of his successor.\n\nAs the company moves to a new operating model announced in December 2023, it has been agreed not to renew the role of Chief Commercial Officer, held by Maria Letizia Mariani since her appointment in 2020. Therefore, she will not be up for reappointment at the AGM to be held in May 2024.\n\n## \u00b7 Composition Supervisory Board and onboarding\n\nFollowing the selection process led by the committee, Sophie Bechu was appointed as Supervisory Board member in May 2023. She followed a tailor-made immersion program to get to know the company's industry, business, strategy and management, and followed our cyber security training for Supervisory Board members.\n\nIn December 2023, the company announced that the Chair of the Supervisory Board, Arthur van der Poel, will step down at the close of the AGM to be held in May 2024. From that date, he will be succeeded by the current Vice Chair Gerard van de Aast, and Bram Schot will become the Vice Chair.\n\nIn 2023, the committee prepared and led an assessment and selection process that resulted in the proposals by the Supervisory Board to appoint Jeroen Drost as a new member to our Board, and to reappoint Pamela Knapp and Rita Lane at the AGM to be held on May 14, 2024.\n\nThe Supervisory Board recommends the appointment of Jeroen Drost in view of his wealth of experience in banking and investment activities across numerous industries, which will bring a thorough investor's perspective to our Board. Subject to his appointment by our shareholders, Jeroen Drost will become the new Chair of the Audit Committee.\n\nThe proposed appointment of Jeroen Drost and re-appointment of Pamela Knapp are for a period of four years. As Rita Lane served for two four-year terms, and in accordance with the Dutch corporate governance code, her proposed reappointment is for a period of two years. The Supervisory Board recommends her re-appointment for continuity and in view of her valuable contributions to the Board and the company in the past two terms.\n\nIn each selection process, the committee takes account of the desired board profile, including its diversity policy and expertise and experience as well as the desired board size. For the re-appointments, the respective performance and board evaluations have also been taken into consideration.\n\n- \u00b7 Board size and profile, including diversity We believe it is of strategic importance that our Board of Management and Supervisory Board are composed in line with Dutch and international corporate governance best practices and that they have the expertise needed for a good understanding of current affairs and longer-term risks and opportunities related to the company's business, taking into account our objectives that promote diversity at board level. Our boards' profile and the Supervisory Board skills and expertise matrix reflect the areas that the committee and Supervisory Board regard to be most relevant to address the transition in the lighting industry and the execution of the company's 5 Frontiers strategy.\n\nIn 2023, the committee reviewed the skills and expertise matrix and concluded that currently no categories need to be added nor removed. At the committee's initiative, as from this Annual report, the number of checks per person are limited to the most important categories for the member concerned. The biographies of the Supervisory Board members maintained on the company's website complement the information included in the matrix.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<\n\n\u2261\n\n>",

For the Supervisory Board members, and in line with Dutch law, we aim that at least onethird are men and at least one-third are women. Our Supervisory Board currently has 43% female and 57% male and thus meets this objective. For the Board of Management members, we aim at having at least one man and at least one woman for a board of three members, and at least two men and at least two women for a board of five members. Our Board of Management currently comprises of one woman (25%)\n\nand three men (75%) and thus meets this objective. For more details on the profile, including the diversity of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board, refer to chapter 11, Corporate governance. For more information on diversity & inclusion in the company, refer to chapter 4, Brighter Lives, Better World, subsection 4.3.2, Diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nAs to the size of the Supervisory Board, the committee concluded that a board of about seven members is a good size for the company.\n\nThe committee will continue to periodically assess its size and composition, including the desired diversity, and initiate searches where indicated.\n\n## \u00b7 ESG committee\n\nWe noted the suggestion from some stakeholders to companies in general to consider establishing an ESG committee from among their supervisory boards to support progress on sustainability. This topic was also addressed in our last year's annual performance evaluation. We concluded that sustainability has been an integral part of Signify's strategy for many years. The company also publishes extensive sustainability statements. The full Supervisory Board is and will continue to be engaged in the strategy, including sustainability, whereas the review of the sustainability reporting is within the scope of responsibilities of the Audit Committee. In view of this, we saw no need to establish an ESG committee from among the Supervisory Board. The committee reconsidered the establishment of an ESG committee again this year, and came to the same conclusion. It will continue to monitor the sustainability developments and needs in this respect.\n\n## \u00b7 Performance evaluation and findings\n\nThe committee looked after the follow-up on findings resulting from last year's Supervisory Board performance evaluation, including on how we can best track the execution of the strategy at the Supervisory Board level, the Board's continued attention to the company's response to geopolitical and market conditions and the organization of an ESG training for the Supervisory Board.\n\nAs per our practice to engage an external party to facilitate the performance evaluation of the Supervisory Board and its committees about every four years, the committee selected an external facilitator for the 2023 evaluation process.\n\n## \u00b7 New Dutch corporate governance code\n\n- The committee discussed the new Dutch corporate governance code that was issued in December 2022, and reviewed how the company embedded the updated Code in its organization. The committee led the review of the updates to the Supervisory Board Rules of Procedure, Supervisory Board committee charters and the Board of Management Rules.\n\n## 9.3.3\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee assists the Supervisory Board by, among other matters, reviewing and preparing remuneration policies for the Board of Management and Supervisory Board, remuneration proposals for individual members of the Board of Management and other key management positions, as well as proposals for targets relevant to the variable compensation of members of the Board of Management and the review of their performance.\n\nGerard van de Aast is the Chair, and Pamela Knapp and Arthur van der Poel are the members of this committee. Currently, no member of the Remuneration Committee is a member of the executive management board of another listed company.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "In performing its duties and responsibilities, the Remuneration Committee is assisted by an external consultant and an in-house remuneration expert.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee held three regular meetings in 2023 and three additional meetings in relation to the remuneration policies review, and reported its findings to the full Supervisory Board after each meeting. The CEO, the Chief HR Officer, the Head of Rewards and the Chief Legal Officer generally attend the committee's meetings. The committee also consulted with the CEO, the Board of Management and certain other key management employees. Following those consultations, the committee prepared decisions and advised the Supervisory Board.\n\nAs part of the standing agenda, the Remuneration Committee discussed, among other matters, base salary levels for the Board of Management, the target setting for variable remuneration, the final and interim performance results on variable remuneration, scenario analyses, disclosure in the remuneration report and AGM voting results on the remuneration report.\n\nIn 2023, the Committee performed a review of the remuneration policies for the Board of Management and for the Supervisory Board. The committee Chair engaged with key stakeholders, such as shareholders, shareholder representative groups and the Dutch Central Works Council, to obtain feedback on the proposed remuneration policies, executive remuneration in general and views on disclosure in the remuneration report. These findings from the policy review, feedback received from stakeholders and the proposed updates to the remuneration policy\n\nfor the Board of the Supervisory Board were shared and discussed with the full Supervisory Board.\n\nAlso refer to chapter 10, Remuneration report, for further information on the remuneration policies review and the implementation of the current policies in 2023.\n\n## 9.3.4 Digital Committee\n\nThe Digital Committee assists the Supervisory Board by, amongst other matters, reviewing the company's digital strategy and roadmap, digital objectives and performance and the governance for deciding on digital prioritization.\n\nAs from her appointment in May 2023, Sophie Bechu succeeded Frank Lubnau as the Chair of the Digital Committee. Rita Lane, Frank Lubnau and Bram Schot are the members of the Digital Committee.\n\nThe Digital Committee held four regular meetings in 2023 and reported its findings to the full Supervisory Board after each meeting. During the Supervisory Board's US visit, two additional sessions were held, focusing on a US digital lighthouse project and advanced analytics. The CFO and the Chief Digital and Information Officer (CDIO) generally attend the committee meetings. The committee Chair has regular contact with the CFO and the CDIO.\n\nThe company's digital aspiration has a roadmap covering three focus areas: digitalizing customer interfaces, digitalizing processes and digitalizing offers. To enable this roadmap, the company also has focused\n\nactivities around people, technology, data and way of working.\n\nAhead of the discussion with the full Board at the start of the year, the committee reviewed and discussed the company's digital year plan and focus in 2023 to accelerate digitalization, together with the governance for prioritization.\n\nAs part of the standing agenda throughout 2023, the committee reviewed and discussed progress on the company's global strategic initiatives in the digital domain, their enablers and status of lighthouse projects. In 2023, deep dives were held on various topics, including lighthouse projects in the US and Europe, the company's system & services business, advanced analytics, and the company's portfolio optimization and standardization, including enterprise resource planning (ERP) enhancement.\n\n## 9.4\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nWe evaluated the performance of the Board of Management and of the Supervisory Board and its committees in 2023.\n\nThe Board of Management evaluated their team and personal targets performance, and shared their views with the Chair and Chair of the Remuneration Committee, which were discussed in the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe objective of our annual Supervisory Board self-evaluation is to gain better insight into the functioning of the Supervisory Board, to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nidentify strengths that we want to keep and to identify matters that the Supervisory Board or the company can improve. In most years, the evaluation of the Supervisory Board's performance is organized internally, led by the Nomination and Governance Committee. About every four years, the Supervisory Board engages an external party to facilitate the performance evaluation. In line herewith, the Supervisory Board engaged an external party to facilitate its 2023 performance evaluation.\n\nThe objective of the external facilitator was to support the Supervisory Board in strengthening its effectiveness. They facilitated the Board in evaluating its own functioning, the functioning of its four committees and its relationship with the Board of Management and other stakeholders. The evaluation started with a questionnaire, followed by interviews with each of the members of the Supervisory Board and Board of Management as well as the Chief Legal Officer and Deputy General Secretary. The findings of the questionnaire and interviews served as input for a discussion led by the external facilitator, first with the full Supervisory Board only and thereafter also with the other interviewees.\n\nThe self-evaluation of the Supervisory Board provided valuable insight of the functioning of the Supervisory Board regarding several topics and roles, as described in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.\n\nA general conclusion is that the Supervisory Board is a professional and well-functioning team of highly involved experts, which are easy to mobilize if necessary and which is",

To add to this, the ambition was formulated to further balance the focus of the Supervisory Board on shortterm performance with long-term strategic portfolio developments. This is considered important given the ongoing geopolitical turbulence and uncertainties in markets.\n\nThe Supervisory Board makes use of four committees: Audit, Remuneration, Digital and Nomination & Governance. Their functioning is evaluated positively. Previous actions to define the scope and focus of the Digital Committee more clearly, have been successful. The entire board followed an ESG training in 2023 and decided that sustainability remains a key topic for the entire board as it is deeply rooted in every part of Signify. Specific elements, such as regulatory changes, organization culture and social aspects, will be reviewed in depth in the relevant committees.\n\nThe Supervisory Board expresses the ambition to further involve and expose second level leadership and potentials, both formally and informally. This is based on positive experiences in the recent past and considered important to maintain oversight regarding organization development and culture, against the background of announced changes within the Board of Management.\n\n9.5\n\n## Financial statements 2023 and dividend\n\nSignify's Consolidated and Company financial statements for 2023, as prepared by the Board of Management, have been audited by Ernst & Young Accountants LLP as independent external auditor appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders. Its report has been included in the Combined independent auditor's report. We have approved these financial statements.\n\nWe recommend to the General Meeting of Shareholders to adopt the financial statements for 2023.\n\nWe likewise recommend to shareholders that they adopt the proposal by the Board of Management to declare a cash dividend of EUR 1.55 per ordinary share from the 2023 net income.\n\n## 9.6 Appreciation\n\nMarket conditions in 2023 remained challenging. We would like to thank the Board of Management and all Signify employees for their continued commitment, ability to adapt to the changing environment, and performance throughout the year.\n\nWe would like to thank our departing CFO Javier van Engelen and CCO Maria Letizia Mariani for their important contributions to the company over the years.\n\nIn May 2024, I will step down as Chair.

        "page_content": "## 10 Remuneration report\n\n## 10.1 Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chair\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board, I am pleased to present the 2023 remuneration report. This report includes a detailed explanation of the current remuneration policies for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. The effectuation of these policies in 2023 is discussed in parts 10.2 and 10.3 of this remuneration report.\n\nIn 2023, we initiated a review of the remuneration policy for both the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. We continued our engagement with key stakeholders, such as shareholders, shareholder representative groups and the Dutch Central Works Council, to understand their views on remuneration in general and to solicit feedback on the proposed changes for the remuneration policies. These interactions were very productive, leading to a good dialogue and valuable feedback, particularly related to improvement opportunities that we have included in this remuneration report as well as the policy proposals that will be on the agenda for the Annual General Meeting of shareholders in 2024.\n\n## Signify's performance in 2023\n\nThis year was yet another volatile and unpredictable year. The dual specter of war and inflation did not abate during 2023. While inflationary pressure was trending down, it remained at relatively high levels, depressing consumer spending. The uncertainty in the geopolitical environment continued and yet another conflict erupted. It was therefore another year of adaptation for the company.\n\nWithin this environment, the Board of Management was able to strengthen Signify's financial profile. While comparable sales growth declined by 8.3% due to weakness in Consumer, OEM and indoor connect lighting, gross margin expanded enabling the company to deliver a healthy free cash flow of 8.7%. In addition, despite the sales decline, the company was able to maintain profitability at 10%, which was broadly in line with 2022, and deliver a gross margin improvement to 39.7%. At the same time, there was an under absorption of fixed costs due to the lower sales volume that offset that margin improvement.\n\nStrategically the company continued to stay the course and drive toward a differentiated position in the market. The relevance of Signify's strategy, products and solutions was further heightened in 2023, as energy efficiency continues to be an urgent means to address our collective impact on the planet. The year 2023 demonstrated a readiness by business and public customers to invest in energy efficiency measures that lend protection from volatile energy markets and help them remain aligned to emissions reduction targets. As a result, Signify is\n\n<!-- image -->",

This year was the third year of this program, and the company is on track to reduce emissions across the entire value chain by 40% against the 2019 baseline, driven by leadership in energy efficient and connected LED lighting solutions which significantly reduce emissions during the use phase. Circular revenues increased, surpassing the 2025 targets, with the main contribution coming from serviceable luminaries, with a strong performance from both professional and consumer segments. Brighter Lives revenue is on track to meet the 2025 targets, however women in leadership is behind the targets to achieve the 2025 outcome.\n\nSignify customers have reported an improved experience as the customer net promoter score increased to 53 in Q4, continuing the positive trajectory in this area as evidenced by the improvement over the score of 44 at the end of 2022. Significant improvement was experienced by customers in order and delivery, which was a noted pain point. From an employee perspective, the employee net promoter score declined to 26 at the end of 2023, down from a score of 36 at the end of 2022. This decline was expected and attributed to the announcement in Q4 of the need to restructure the business along customer segments and a need to reduce costs into 2024. The announced restructuring and costs savings will set the company on a good path to better serve customers, quickly adapt to the environment, and ensure end-to-end accountability for delivery to customer segments.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nThe 2022 remuneration report received a 92.93% advisory vote from the shareholders, at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, held on May 16, 2023.\n\nIn preparation for the 2023 Remuneration Report and the proposed changes for the Remuneration Policies for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board initiated extensive shareholder engagement. Our objective was to understand the expectations of, and solicit feedback from, our broad and geographically diverse shareholder base, including proxy advisors and other stakeholders. In this regard, we invited investors representing a total of 37% of our shareholder base to meet with Signify on this topic, and ultimately meetings were held with shareholders representing 18% of the shareholder base, excluding passive investors.\n\nThese discussions were very constructive, and we received valuable feedback and suggestions on how the Remuneration Report could be further improved. The following key points came from those interactions:\n\n- \u00b7 Very positive feedback on the link of strategy, ESG metrics, long-term incentives and related disclosure;\n- \u00b7 Expectation of increasing disclosure, particularly on the team/individual performance measures in short-term incentives; and\n- \u00b7 Recommendations for limiting the number of focus areas included in the team/individual performance measure in the future.\n\nWith respect to the second item, we have significantly expanded the disclosure on the team/ individual performance for 2023 in direct response to this feedback, while the third item has been taken for consideration for target setting for 2024.\n\n## Looking ahead to 2024\n\nThe current remuneration policies of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board were last reviewed and included in the AGM 2020. It was therefore time for a full review of the policy in light of Signify's evolution as an independent organization, market practices, expectations of shareholders, and developments in corporate governance. During 2023, we undertook a detailed review of the policies with an external remuneration expert to challenge us, bring best practice developments, and provide overall expertise. The policy review included remuneration structures, peer groups and potential changes to various policy clauses.\n\nThe stakeholder engagements as outlined were an important step in the development of the final policies. Specifically, shareholders, stakeholders and the Dutch Works Council were invited to give feedback and discuss the elements of the policy for which there were proposed changes.\n\nThe following were the key discussion points during these stakeholder engagements:\n\n- \u00b7 Limiting the potential for duplication of metrics in the short- and long-term incentive plans by removing free cash flow (FCF) from the short-term incentive plan;\n- \u00b7 Adapting the vesting of our long-term incentive plans at early or full retirement to reflect what shareholders consider to be best practice with a pro-rata vesting; and\n- \u00b7 Enabling some limited flexibility in the short-term incentive plan balance of financial and nonfinancial metrics to reflect priorities in a particular year.\n\nThe first two points were proposed as changes to the policy in direct response to feedback received from stakeholders in prior engagements. This was very much appreciated by all stakeholders with whom we met during these engagements.\n\nOther topics addressed included the labor market peer group, as well as the refinement of the base salary and the clawback clauses.\n\nWe very much appreciated those discussions and we have enhanced the policy based on the feedback received.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<\n\n\u2261\n\n>",

        "page_content": "With respect to the Supervisory Board Remuneration policy, we were not proposing any changes. While a review of this policy was conducted, the content remains largely consistent with the policy of 2020. During the engagement sessions, feedback on this policy was very limited. It was noted by our shareholders, however, that we may wish to consider increasing fees for the future as they have remained as is since 2017, when Signify became an independent company. We are not proposing to do that at this time; however, the feedback was noted for future consideration.\n\nThe proposal for the revised Remuneration Policies for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will be included in the convocation documents for the 2024 AGM.\n\nFinally, the link between the Signify strategy, ESG metrics and remuneration overall was a key component of all stakeholder conversations for both the Remuneration Report and Policy for the Board of Management, as illustrated in the image below. Signify continues to be identified as a leader in its approach to sustainability, the degree of reporting on these metrics and the related link to the long-term incentive plan. Additional input from stakeholders related to a desire for the inclusion of ESG metrics in the short-term incentive plan. While Signify believes these metrics fit more readily to a longer-term time horizon, the policy change related to enabling limited flexibility in the short-term incentive plan balance of financial and non-financial metrics would potentially enable this to be included in the future, if appropriate, in response to this feedback.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are pleased with the overall ongoing engagement with stakeholders and the degree of feedback and dialogue experienced. As described, we have continued to evolve the 2023 report and 2024 remuneration policies in direct response to this feedback. We trust that stakeholders experience these changes positively and appreciate the spirit of transparency and continuous improvement which drives them.\n\n## Gerard van de Aast\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee",

Our policy aims to stimulate sustainable short- and long-term value creation. Therefore, the performance measures used in the variable compensation components are linked to quantitative financial, non-financial and sustainability targets. The remuneration policy also serves a communication purpose as it clearly stipulates and supports a common approach to deliver on the company's strategy.\n\n## Signify's value creation model :\n\nThe value created by Signify goes beyond financial performance alone. Our approach is to optimize long-term value through financial, environmental and social resources. Our focus on environment and the societal implications of doing business is evidenced in our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 program. This program links to our long-term incentive plan and ensures that the interests of the organization, society at large, and our impact on the environment in which we live are key elements in how Signify delivers long-term value creation to stakeholders. Our activities and our way of doing business impact customers, employees, investors and society at large. Signify expresses these impacts in monetary terms in chapter 3, Creating sustainable long-term value, section 3.3, Our value created.\n\nThe current remuneration policy for the Board of Management a nd for the Supervisory Board was adopted by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) in 2020. The effectuation of these policies in 2023 is discussed in parts 10.2 and 10.3 of this remuneration report.\n\nThe report included in this chapter constitutes the remuneration report within the meaning of section 2:135b of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe following principles apply for the remuneration policy of the Board of Management:\n\n- \u00b7 Signify's remuneration policy aims to attract, reward and retain qualified leaders to pursue the company's purpose and long-term strategic objectives, while taking the interest of all the company's stakeholders into account;\n- \u00b7 Remuneration levels are to be competitive and in line with the market practice of comparable companies and support a pay-for-performance philosophy with a significant proportion of compensation at risk;\n- \u00b7 Remuneration should drive long-term value creation from a financial, non-financial and sustainability perspective;\n- \u00b7 During the policy design and review process, stakeholder feedback and legal provisions, including the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, are taken into consideration.\n\n## Remuneration components\n\nThe compensation package for the members of the Board of Management consists of the following fixed and variable components:\n\n- \u00b7 Base salary;\n- \u00b7 Annual cash incentive;\n- \u00b7 Long-term equity-based incentive;\n- \u00b7 Pensions and other benefits.\n\nThe combination of a member's base salary, annual cash incentive and long-term equity-based incentive, together referred to as the 'total direct compensation', is targeted around the median level of a representative labor market peer group and benchmarked on a regular basis.\n\nThis peer group consists of 50% Dutch cross-industry companies that are typically included in the AEX or AMX, and 50% European sector-specific companies. The Supervisory Board reviews the peer group on a regular basis and may adjust to ensure that the companies in the group remain relevant peers. In 2023, the peer group was reviewed and updated to ensure relevance.\n\nAs of January 2024, the labor market peer group consists of the following 14 companies:\n\n## Labor Market Peer Group\n\n| Aalberts   | DSM-Firmenich   | ams OSRAM*        |\n|------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| AkzoNobel  | KPN             | Prysmian          |\n| Arcadis*   | Legrand         | Rexel             |\n| ASMi*      | Nexans          | Rheinmetall Group |\n| BAM        | Nordex*         |                   |\n\n- * New companies to the labor market peer group",

Costs for F.J. van Engelen Sousa include the forfeiture of the 2022 and 2023 grants due to his termination per April 1, 2024; the Supervisory Board decided that the 2021 LTI grant will vest in full. Costs for M.L. Mariani reflect the pro-rata forfeiture of the 2022 and 2023 LTI grants, which will vest pro-rata given the company elected not to renew her services contract. As explained in more detail below, there is a disagreement between the company and Ms. Mariani about the treatment of these LTI grants.\n- 3 Costs of restricted shares rights are based on accounting standards (IFRS) and do not reflect the value of the shares at the vesting/release date and concerns the sign-on grant of EUR 300,000 for F.J. van Engelen Sousa that vested in 2022.\n- 4 The stated amounts mainly concern (part of) allowances to members of the Board of Management that can be considered as remuneration. In a situation where such a part of an allowance can be considered as (indirect) remuneration (for example, private use of the company car or car allowance), then such part is both valued and accounted for here. The method employed by the fiscal authorities in the Netherlands is the starting point for the value stated. Net allowances are not included.\n- 5 As the company elected not to renew the services contract of M.L. Mariani after the end of term in May 2024, as per her services contract (which is published on the company's website), she will receive a lump sum payment of one time the annual base compensation/salary (currently estimated to be a gross amount of EUR 644,649), which is payable in June 2024.\n- 6 Appointed member of the Board of Management at May 16, 2023 AGM. Remuneration costs represent the period functioning as member of the Board of Management as of May 16, 2023.\n\nAll remuneration was paid in accordance with the remuneration policy.\n\nThere is a disagreement between the company and Ms. Mariani about the treatment of the 2022 and 2023 LTI grants in the context of the termination of her services agreement on May 14, 2024. The Supervisory Board of the company holds the view that these grants should vest prorata in view of the overall termination arrangement made available by the company to Ms. Mariani, whereas Ms. Mariani holds the view that these grants should vest in full based on a separate agreement which is contested by the company. The company and Ms. Mariani have not been able to reach an agreement on this matter prior to the publication of this annual report.\n\nThe performance share costs for Ms. Mariani in 2023 as shown in the table above of EUR 266,689 would be increased by EUR 112,168 in case of full vesting of the 2022 and 2023 LTI grants.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Scenarios included minimum, threshold and maximum performance all under a 0% share price appreciation assumption. Additional scenarios included maximum performance with both a 50% share price increase and a 100% share price increase. The scenarios considered achievement across all metrics at below threshold, target and maximum levels of performance and the resulting remuneration. Based on the scenario analyses performed, the Supervisory Board has concluded that the policy supports the pay-for-performance philosophy and leads to appropriate remuneration.\n\n## 10.2.2 B ase salary\n\nThe base salary compensates for the individual's experience, skills, duties, responsibilities and the contribution of the individual within Signify. The Supervisory Board determines the base salary and may adjust the base salary, for example following the results of benchmark studies and to ensure alignment between members of the Board of Management. Absent any adjustment of the base salary, it aligns with (collective and merit) increase as agreed for the CLA population in the Netherlands. The Supervisory Board regularly reviews the total direct compensation (including base salaries).\n\nThe annual compensation of the members of the Board of Management was reviewed at the beginning of 2023 in line with the regular remuneration review. The Remuneration Committee considered the input of the Board of Management members in setting their pay levels.\n\nFor 2023, the Supervisory Board decided to increase the base salary levels for all members of the Board of Management by 4%, in line with the budgets (collective and merit increase) allocated for the CLA population in the Netherlands.\n\n## Base salaries Board of Management in 2023 in EUR\n\n|                        | January 1, 2023 (+ 4%)   |\n|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| E.H.E.

        "page_content": "## 10.2.3 V ariable remuneration\n\nThe variable remuneration of the members of the Board of Management consists of an annual cash incentive and a long-term equity-based incentive.\n\nThe design of the incentives aims to achieve a balance between short-term objectives, longterm value creation and sustainable performance. Variable pay is based on both financial and non-financial performance measures. In selecting performance measures, their respective weights and targets for a performance period, the following is considered:\n\n- \u00b7 Performance measures are selected based on relevance to the company's strategy;\n- \u00b7 The company's strategy determines the targets and intervals for the performance measures;\n- \u00b7 Targets are set ambitiously yet realistically, taking the company's risk appetite into account;\n- \u00b7 Alignment with stakeholders' interests and expectations is essential.\n\nThe Supervisory Board determines the target for each of the performance measures of the annual cash incentive and the long-term equity-based incentive. The target definition for these variable remuneration components includes target intervals and correlating payout schemes, being defined in incremental steps in performance and respective payout. In addition, a minimum threshold for the achievement of financial performance measures applies, below which there will be no payout. Following the end of the relevant performance period, the Supervisory Board will assess the actual performance relative to the targets set. On that basis, the Supervisory Board will, at its discretion, determine the achievement per performance measure and target.\n\n## 10.2.4 A nnual cash incentive\n\nMembers of the Board of Management are eligible for an annual cash incentive. The annual incentive is designed to reward the achievement of annual financial and operational objectives and personal performance. The purpose is to ensure alignment with the company's annual business plan setting the strategic priorities for that year, which in turn contribute to the company's long-term objectives.\n\nUnder the 2020 remuneration policy, the Supervisory Board can annually select two or three financial performance measures from the following list, and determine the weighting per performance measure: growth (such as comparable sales growth), profit (such as adjusted EBITA or net income), cash flow (such as average working capital or free cash flow) and investment return (such as return on capital employed).\n\nThe possibility to annually select financial performance measures from the above list gives the Supervisory Board a certain level of flexibility to ensure continuous alignment of the performance measures with the company's strategy and financial objectives for the mid-term.\n\nThe financial performance measures used in the annual incentive to track performance over 2023 were comparable sales growth (measured as a percentage of sales), adjusted EBITA (measured as a percentage of sales) and free cash flow (measured as a percentage of sales). These measures were determined by the Supervisory Board to reflect the best alignment with the company's strategy and financial objectives for the mid-term focusing on profitable growth, with more weight on free cash flow and adjusted EBITA than on comparable sales growth: free cash flow (30%), adjusted EBITA (30%) and comparable sales growth (20%),\n\nThe financial targets for 2023 were set within the context of the medium-term objectives of the company at the beginning of the year and did not change over the course of 2023. Payout between the financial targets is linear.\n\nThe team/individual performance measures are recommended by the CEO and discussed and ultimately approved by the Supervisory Board. For 2023, these measures included, among others, cultural change and people engagement, US business performance, customer satisfaction and organization redesign, explained further in the table on the realized outcomes.\n\n## Performance achievements 2023\n\nPerformance against financial targets are reviewed on a quarterly basis. The assessment of performance under the annual incentive plan is concluded by the Supervisory Board.\n\nFor 2023, the global environment continued to be volatile and unpredictable. Although Signify adapted to the challenges during the year, financial performance was not as expected. Comparable sales growth was -8.3% mainly due to weakness in Consumer, OEM and Indoor professional lighting. As such, performance was below the threshold level of expectations and results in a 0% payout on the metric. The adjusted EBITA result of 10% was broadly in line with 2022 but below ambitions set at the beginning of the year, as the gross margin improvement delivered during 2023 was offset by an under absorption of fixed costs. As such the outcome on this metric is also 0%. Despite adverse market conditions, Signify delivered a healthy free cash flow of 8.7% of sales, mainly as a result of the higher net cash provided by operating activities. This outcome was significantly above the threshold level of 6% expected for the year and as such the achievement of that metric was 136%. Overall, it was a mixed financial performance for the year, and given the results on the three metrics, the final realization on the financial metrics was 40.8%.\n\nFor the realization of the financial measures of the annual incentive, the Supervisory Board considered whether any adjustments or discretion should be applied. The Supervisory Board concluded not to make any discretionary adjustments to the outcomes of the financial measures, nor were any changes made to the original targets set for the year 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Finally, the Supervisory Board assessed the achievements of the Board of Management relative to each of their individual goals and their collective team goals, considered as equally weighted for 2023.\n\nFor the team objectives, the overall assessment was good but with mixed results across the different priorities. With respect to culture change and people engagement, there were some varied outcomes. Investment in future talent via campus hiring was strong compared to prior years with more than 400 campus hires versus 150 in 2022, and included a very strong diversity mix with women representing 57% of campus hires. Overall gender diversity increased by 1% with women representing 38% of the total population in 2023. Our US business is showing improvement, particularly with very strong cash metrics, but performance remains below expectations.\n\nCustomer engagement is a bright spot for 2023 as the Customer Net Promoter Score has improved to 53 versus a target of 47 and reflects a significant improvement over 2022 performance of 44. In addition, the company made significant improvements in a key customer pain point of order and delivery, which improved by 13 points. Finally, the needed restructuring was defined, structured and communicated, which negatively impacted the employee Net Promoter Score with a Q4 outcome of 26 versus 36 at the end of 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor the individual goals, the outcomes were modest. Cash optimization and inventory significantly improved while quality and service levels were protected as evidenced in the Customer Net Promoter Score and improvements in order and delivery. The Board of Management delivered on key strategic projects, inclusive of designing and having ready for implementation in Q1 2024 a new operating model focused on four businesses, as announced in December 2023. Growth was not as expected, although there were definite bright spots in our strategic frontiers, such as connected systems, solar lighting, and LiFi, while pricing discipline improved. Overall commercial excellence improved as reflected in the improved pricing discipline. Finally, the opportunities realized related to Green Deal revenue reflect above expectations for the number and value of projects won, while the achievement of the Brighter Lives, Better World 2023 outcomes relative to targets were above expectations and continue to position Signify very well relative to the ambitious targets set for the 2025 program.\n\nThe Supervisory Board acknowledged the continued volatility and challenging year and assessed the individual and team performance in the context of the year. The Supervisory Board assessed performance as good. As a result, the Supervisory Board has determined that the realized performance on this measure reflected 80% for the team objectives and 70% to 90% for the individual objectives.",

The objective of the long-term incentive is to link pay with long-term sustainable value creation. In addition to the Board of Management, approximately 800 employees globally are participants in a similar long-term incentive plan.\n\nThe main characteristics of the long-term incentive plan for the Board of Management are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The long-term incentive is granted in performance shares only and granted annually;\n- \u00b7 The vesting of performance shares is conditional upon the achievement of performance conditions measured over a period of three financial years and continued Signify employment;\n- \u00b7 Performance is measured using four performance measures in 2023: relative total shareholder return (25%), free cash flow (25%), return on capital employed (25%) and sustainability (25%);\n- \u00b7 Payout per performance measure can vary between 0% and 200%.\n\n## Performance measures\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Relative TSR\n\nThe vesting of 25% of the shares granted is subject to a TSR condition. Relative total shareholder return (TSR) measures the share price growth plus dividends paid over the threeyear performance period. Performance is expressed as a percentage. This percentage is compared to the TSR performance of companies included in the peer group specifically compiled for this purpose. The TSR performance is determined for each company in the peer group and the performances are ranked from top to bottom. Signify's position in the ranking, together with the payout curve, determines the payout level.\n\nIn 2023, the peer group consisted of the following companies:\n\n## TSR Peer Group\n\n| ABB               | Honeywell Int.   | Panasonic          |\n|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|\n| Acuity Brands     | Hubbell          | Signify            |\n| Eaton Corporation | Johnson Controls | Schneider Electric |\n| Fagerhult         | Legrand          | Toshiba            |\n| Hitachi           | MLS Co Ltd       | Zumtobel Group     |\n\nThe peer group is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the companies in the group remain relevant peers. In case a peer needs to be replaced due to a corporate event (merger, acquisition, and so on) the Supervisory Board will ensure that the adjusted peer group remains aligned with the strategic objectives, the geographical spread and the business characteristics of Signify. Per January 1, 2022. Cree was replaced by MLS Co Ltd. This means that:\n\n- \u00b7 For the LTI 2021 grant (vesting in 2024), TSR will be calculated on a 'synthetic combination', i.e. Cree until January 1, 2022, and MLS as of January 1, 2022;\n- \u00b7 As of the LTI 2022 grant (vesting in 2025 and thereafter), MLS will replace Cree in the TSR peer group.\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviewed the TSR peer group, and replaced Toshiba with ams OSRAM due to Toshiba's delisting at the end of 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Performance-incentive zone for TSR in % of grant value\n\n| Ranking   |   15 |   14 |   13 |   12 |   11 |   10 |   9 |   8 |   7 |   5 | 4   | 3   | 2 1             |\n|-----------|------|------|------|------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----------------|\n| Payout    |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |   0 |  75 | 100 | 150 |     |     | 175 200 200 200 |\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nThe vesting of another 25% of the annual long-term incentive grant is linked to performance measured by a free cash flow target over the three-year performance period. The targets and intervals around these measures are determined by the Supervisory Board, based on the company's strategic, multi-year plan.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nThe vesting of 25% of the annual long-term incentive grant is dependent on how well Signify performs against the targets set with respect to the sustainability condition. The targets and intervals around these measures are determined by the Supervisory Board, based on the company's strategic, multi-year plan. As targets set are usually both qualitative and quantitative, set ambitiously and adjusted regularly, the assessment of the performance is at the discretion of the Supervisory Board. The assessment will use tracked performance as input.\n\n## Return on capital employed\n\nThe vesting of the remaining 25% of the annual long-term incentive grant is linked to performance measured by a return on capital employed target. The targets and intervals around these measures are determined by the Supervisory Board, based on the company's strategic, multi-year plan.\n\nIn 2023, performance shares were granted to the members of the Board of Management. These grants are governed by the Signify long-term incentive plan. The grant is made on the basis of the average closing share price of the three months preceding the date of grant. In this way, the Signify granting policy ensures mitigation of share price volatility.",

Based on an 7% achievement of the ROCE metric, the Supervisory Board determined the LTI Plan ROCE achievement as 0%.\n\n|                 | Payout   | ROCE %   |\n|-----------------|----------|----------|\n| Below threshold | -%       | < 11.0%  |\n| Threshold       | 40%      | 11.0%    |\n| Target          | 100%     | 14.0%    |\n| Maximum         | 200%     | 17.0%    |\n\n## Sustainability (25% weighting)\n\nThe sustainability objectives for 2023 were based on the intent to double Signify's impact in the areas of climate action, the circular economy, Brighter Lives revenues and women in leadership positions by 2025. In all areas, significant progress has been made relative to the trajectory to deliver on the ambitions by 2025. This year was the third year of this five-year program, and the company is on track to reduce emissions across the entire value chain by 40% against the 2019 baseline, driven by leadership in energy efficient and connected LED lighting solutions which significantly reduce emissions during the use phase. Circular revenues increased, surpassing the 2025 targets two years earlier than projected, with the main contribution from serviceable luminaries with a strong performance from both professional and consumer segments. Brighter Lives revenue is on track to meet the 2025 targets, overachieving relative to 2023 plan. Women in leadership, however, is behind the targets set for 2023, despite increasing the percentage of women in leadership positions by 12% against the 2019 baseline.\n\nBased on the following LTI Plan sustainability measures and results over the performance period, the Supervisory Board determined the LTI Plan sustainability achievement as 141.7%.",

These guidelines are designed to further align the interest of the members of the Board of Management (and certain other leaders within Signify) with the interests of its shareholders. For the CEO, the value in Signify shares to be held is 300% of base salary and for the other members of the Board of Management it is 200% of base salary. The guidelines require that all after-tax shares be retained until the required level is met.\n\nIn addition, members of the Board of Management shall comply with holding requirements under the Dutch corporate governance code.

The net pension arrangement is in line with all other Signify employees in the Netherlands whose pensionable salary exceeds the cap. Participation in this net pension arrangement is voluntary.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Free cash flow was strong relative to 2022, and thus reflects an increase of 31%, while Signify closing share-price at year end reflects a decline of 3% from the 2022 closing share price. The total remuneration of the Board of Management is aligned to the company performance as it reflects a modest increase overall relative to 2022. Annual incentive for 2023 reflected a limited payout of between 55.8% to 57.8% for Board of Management members driven by below-threshold outcomes on two measures as detailed in subsection 10.2.4.\n\nEmployee salary adjustments and general wage increases during the year were much higher than in prior years and are reflective of the inflationary environment. Employee average total compensation has increased by 18% for 2023. This is primarily driven by the termination\n\n<!-- image -->",

Excluding those termination provisions, employee average total compensation has increased by 11%.\n\n## 10.2.10 Signify's internal pay ratio\n\nThe remuneration design for the members of the Board of Management is an integral part of the overall pay structure within the company. Signify uses the Hay system to evaluate and grade the various positions within its organization. This means that the company uses a standardized method for determining the appropriate benefits for each of the respective job levels within the company. Using the Hay grading system also ensures that the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management is aligned with and is relative to the remuneration of Signify employees holding other positions within the company. The remuneration of senior staff within Signify is based on the same components as the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Code requires reporting on the pay ratio. Signify's pay ratio reflects the average total compensation of the total global employee workforce, relative to the total remuneration package of the CEO. This has resulted in the following outcome:\n\n| Fiscal year   | CEO total  remuneration  1   | Average total  compensation employees  2   |   Resulting pay  ratio |\n|---------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| 2023          | 2,282,804                    | 63,623                                     |                     36 |\n| 2022          | 2,044,154                    | 53,766                                     |                     38 |\n| 2021  3       | 3,228,091                    | 51,337                                     |                     63 |\n| 2020          | 3,245,335                    | 51,780                                     |                     63 |\n| 2019          | 2,822,104                    | 60,601                                     |                     47 |\n\nIn light of transparency and clarity, Signify applies a methodology to calculate the internal pay ratio that is IFRS-driven (i.e. linked to Signify's notes to the Consolidated financial statements).\n\nFor 2023, average total compensation for employees increased by 18%. This is primarily driven by the termination provisions related to the Q4 2023 announcement of the reorganization of Signify (note 24: Provisions and note 5: Employee benefit expenses). Excluding those termination provisions, employee average total compensation has increased by 11%.\n\nThe CEO pay ratio has declined from 2022 to 2023, as a result of lower performance share costs and the termination of the transitional pension allowance, offset by a higher annual incentive award in 2023, versus the increase in average employee total compensation reflecting predominately the termination provisions as described. Signify believes that the pay ratio over 2023 aligns with Signify's performance for the year.\n\n## 10.2.11 Claw-back and change of control\n\nThe annual cash incentive and the long-term incentive of the members of the Board of Management are subject to adjustment and claw-back provisions. Pursuant hereto, the company can (a) revise an incentive prior to payment if unaltered payment would be unreasonable and unfair, (b) recover an incentive if it was granted on the basis of incorrect information on the fulfillment of the incentive goals or the conditions for payment of the incentive, and (c) recoup incentives in the circumstances set forth in the services contract with the member of the Board of Management concerned.\n\nIn the event of a change of control of the company, the Supervisory Board can, at its sole discretion, decide to accelerate the vesting of any unvested awards under the long-term incentive, subject to the achievement of the performance conditions up to the date of the completion of the change of control.\n\nNo variable remuneration was clawed back in 2023.\n\n## 10.2.12 Additional arrangements\n\nUnless relevant law provides otherwise, the members of the Board of Management and of the Supervisory Board shall be reimbursed by the company for various costs and expenses, such as reasonable costs of defending claims, as formalized in the Articles of Association. Under certain circumstances, described in the Articles of Association, such as an action or failure to act by a member of the Board of Management or a member of the Supervisory Board that can be characterized as intentional ('opzettelijk'), intentionally reckless ('bewust roekeloos') or seriously culpable ('ernstig verwijtbaar'), there will be no entitlement to this reimbursement. The company has also provided liability insurance (Directors and Officers) for the persons concerned.\n\n## 10.2.13 Contractual arrangements\n\nMembers of the Board of Management are engaged by a service contract ('overeenkomst van opdracht') with a maximum of four years ending on the date of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in the fourth calendar year after the appointment. Members of the Board of Management are appointed for a maximum period of four years, subject to re-appointment by\n\n<!-- image -->",

Team and individual metrics will continue to represent 20% of the total annual incentive opportunity for 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The two boards are independent of each other and are accountable to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) for the performance of their duties.\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are responsible for maintaining an appropriate corporate governance structure of the company.\n\nSignify N.V.'s corporate governance framework is based on the company's Articles of Association, the requirements of the Dutch Civil Code, the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 2022 (https://www.mccg.nl/english), the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act and any other applicable laws and regulations.

The divisions are responsible for the development of their strategy and product portfolio.\n\nIn addition, to manage its global sales channels, the company's commercial organization is currently structured along several geographical market clusters. These market clusters are principally responsible for driving and managing sales, managing customer relationships and delivering the commercial activities of the business across the company's markets, covering commercial activities in almost all countries. The company operates in many countries through its subsidiaries and affiliated companies as well as via a limited number of branch offices, which primarily act under the Signify trade name.\n\nDivisions and market clusters are supported by centralized shared services with respect to, among other functions, legal, audit and investigations, finance, human resources, strategy and sustainability, innovation and operations.\n\nOn December 1, 2023, Signify announced a new operating model, which includes four vertically integrated businesses: Professional, Consumer, OEM and Conventional, and is to be implemented during 2024.\n\n## 11.2\n\n## Board of Management\n\nThe Board of Management is entrusted with the management of the company. The Board of Management focuses on sustainable longterm value creation for the company and its business and takes the interests of relevant stakeholders into account. In performing its duties, the Board of Management is guided by the interests of the company and its affiliated enterprises, taking into consideration the interests of its stakeholders.\n\nAmong other responsibilities, the Board of Management drives the company's management agenda, defines and deploys the strategic direction, identifies opportunities and risks connected with its business activities and strategy, pursues the operational and financial objectives of the company, and monitors sustainability matters.\n\nThe Board of Management is accountable to the Supervisory Board for its actions and decisions. The Chief Executive Officer and other members of the Board of Management have regular contact with the Chair and other members of the Supervisory Board, attend most parts of the Supervisory Board meetings, and provide the Supervisory Board with the information it needs to fulfil its responsibilities.\n\nCertain decisions of the Board of Management require Supervisory Board approval. These decisions include important proposals for capital expenditures,\n\nacquisitions, divestments, decisions concerning financial and operational objectives and strategy to achieve such objectives, changes to corporate policies, as well as the annual operating plan.\n\nThe functioning and decision-making within the Board of Management are laid down in its Rules of Procedure which can be found on the company's website.\n\n## Appointment\n\nMembers of the Board of Management are appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders (the General Meeting) upon a nomination drawn up by the Supervisory Board, which nomination may be binding.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management are appointed for a maximum term of four years, it being understood that this term expires at the end of the AGM to be held in the fourth year after the year of their appointment. Reappointment is possible for consecutive terms of four years or, if applicable, until a later retirement date or other termination date in the fourth year, unless the General Meeting resolves otherwise. Members may be suspended by the Supervisory Board and the General Meeting, and dismissed by the latter.\n\n## Composition\n\nThe composition of the Board of Management follows the board profile which aims for an appropriate combination of knowledge and experience among its members, encompassing industrial, technology &\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninnovation, projects & infrastructure, digital & marketing, financial, economic, IT, social & sustainability aspects of international business and society, in relation to the global character of its business. This profile also applies for the Supervisory Board, and can be found on the company's website. The size of the Board of Management may vary over time, as considered appropriate to support its profile.\n\n## 11.3\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board, in the two-tier board structure under Dutch law, is a separate body that is independent of the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board supervises the policies and management and the general affairs of the company. The Supervisory Board appoints a Chair and a Vice-Chair from among its members. The Chair ensures the members of the Supervisory Board and its committees function properly in all respects and comply with the Supervisory Board Rules of Procedure. The Chair is the main contact on behalf of the Supervisory Board for the General Meeting. The Supervisory Board also provides advice to the Board of Management. In performing its duties, the members of the Supervisory Board are guided by the interests of the company and the business of the group, taking into consideration the interests of its stakeholders.",

        "page_content": "## Independence of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board is a separate corporate body that is independent of the Board of Management. Its independent character is also reflected in the requirement that members of the Supervisory Board can be neither a member of the Board of Management nor an employee of the company. Each member of the Supervisory Board meets the independence requirements as stated in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Appointment\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board are appointed by the General Meeting on the nomination of the Supervisory Board, which nomination may be binding.\n\nThe term of appointment of a member of the Supervisory Board will end at the closing of the AGM to be held in the fourth year after appointment. In line with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the members of the Supervisory Board are eligible for reappointment for a period of maximum four years. Subsequent re-appointments are possible for a period of two years, which may be extended by a re-appointment of maximum two years. The reasons for re-appointment of a member of the Supervisory Board after an eight-year term must be included in the report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nAs from 2022, a mandatory gender quota applies under Dutch law requiring supervisory\n\nboards to be composed of at least one-third men and one-third women. The Supervisory Board meets this target for the financial year 2023. The gender quota needs to be observed in case of a new appointment of a member of the Supervisory Board and a reappointment of an acting member of the Supervisory Board after an eight-year term. Any new appointment or re-appointment after an eight-year term resulting in the composition of the Supervisory Board not meeting this gender quota, will be null and void. An appointment or re-appointment that does not contribute to the gender balance will only be allowed under certain exceptional circumstances.\n\n## Composition\n\nThe composition of the Supervisory Board follows the same board profile that applies to the Board of Management, see paragraph 10.2 above.\n\nThe composition of the Supervisory Board shall also be in accordance with the best practice provisions on independence of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code as well as Dutch law restrictions on the overall number of supervisory positions that a member of the Supervisory Board may hold. Each member shall be capable of assessing the broad outline of the overall management of the company.\n\nThe size of the Supervisory Board may vary over time, as considered appropriate to support its profile. Until May 16, 2023, the Supervisory Board consisted of six and, as from that date, of seven independent members.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 11.4\n\n## Supervisory Board Committees\n\nIn 2023, the Supervisory Board had four committees: The Audit Committee, the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Digital Committee. Each of the committees has a preparatory and/or advisory role to the Supervisory Board. They report their findings to the full Supervisory Board, which is ultimately responsible for all decision-making. Information on the work and composition of the committees during 2023 is set out in chapter 9, Supervisory Board report.\n\nEach committee has a charter describing its role, responsibilities and functioning. These charters are published on the company's website. The responsibilities of each Committee are described in more detail below.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee assists the Supervisory Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities for the integrity and quality of the company's financial and sustainability reporting, the effectiveness of the design and operation of the internal risk management and control systems, the internal and external audit process, the internal and external auditor's qualifications, its independence and its performance, as well as the company's process for monitoring compliance with laws and regulations and the Integrity code. It\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nreviews the company's annual and interim financial statements (including sustainability information) prior to publication and periodically discusses the company's key risks. It maintains contact with and supervises the external auditor and prepares the nomination of an external auditor for appointment by the General Meeting.\n\nThe Audit Committee meets at least once before the publication of the quarterly and annual accounts of the company.\n\n## Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee\n\nThe Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 Advises the Supervisory Board on the selection and appointment of members of the Supervisory Board and the members of the Board of Management;\n- \u00b7 Prepares the selection criteria and appointment procedures for members of the Supervisory Board and the members of the Board of Management and proposing the profile for the Supervisory Board;\n- \u00b7 Supervises the policy on selection criteria, and is involved in the selection and appointment of the company's leadership team, appointments of which are subject to the Supervisory Board's approval;\n- \u00b7 Periodically assesses the size and composition of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, and the functioning of the individual members, and proposes on appointments and reappointments;",

For the Supervisory Board members, and in line with the Dutch law requirement, Signify aims that at least onethird are men and at least one-third are women. For the Board of Management, Signify aims at having at least one man and at least one woman for a board with three members, and at least two men and two women for a board with five members.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Remuneration\n\nThe remuneration of the individual members of the Board of Management is determined by the Supervisory Board based on the remuneration policy adopted by the General Meeting. The remuneration of the individual members of the Supervisory Board, as well as the additional remuneration for its Chair and the members of its committees, is determined by the General Meeting.\n\nPursuant to Dutch law, the remuneration policies must be adopted by the AGM at least every four years. The resolution of the general meeting to adopt the remuneration policy requires a 75% majority of the votes cast, unless the Articles of Association explicitly provide otherwise, which Signify's Articles of Association do not. The remuneration report relating to the previous financial year must be submitted to the AGM on an annual basis for an advisory vote.\n\nThe current remuneration policies for Board of Management and the Supervisory Board were adopted by the AGM in 2020. The composition of the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management and the members of the Supervisory Board and the remuneration policies are described in chapter 10, Remuneration report.",

Relevant matters relating to conflicts of interests, if any, must be approved by the Supervisory Board and shall be mentioned in the Annual Report for the financial year in question.\n\nThe rules for conflict of interest applicable to the members of the Board of Management also apply to the members of the Supervisory Board. No conflict of interest as referred to in this section occurred during 2023.\n\n## Outside positions\n\nPursuant to Dutch law, a person cannot be appointed as a managing or executive director of a large Dutch company if he or she already holds a supervisory position at more than two other large Dutch companies or if he or she is the chair of the supervisory board or one-tier board of another large Dutch company. Also, a person cannot be appointed as a supervisory director or nonexecutive director of a large Dutch company if he or she already holds a supervisory position at five or more other large Dutch companies, whereby the position of chair of the supervisory board or one-tier board of another large Dutch company counts twice.\n\nThe acceptance by a member of the Board of Management of a position as a member of a supervisory board or a position of non-\n\nexecutive director in a one-tier board at another company requires the approval of the Supervisory Board.

The Board of Management is entitled to determine the record date in accordance with Dutch law. The agenda, explanatory notes thereto and the procedure for attendance are published on the company's website. Holders of ordinary shares in the aggregate representing at least 3% of the total issued share capital may submit proposals for the AGM agenda. Such proposals must be made in writing at least 60 days before the AGM to the Board of Management. Any written request must comply with the procedure stipulated by the Board of Management, which is published on the company's website.\n\nEach ordinary share confers the right to cast one vote in the General Meeting. There are no special statutory rights attached to the shares of the company and no restrictions on\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe voting rights of the company's shares exist. Subject to certain exceptions provided by Dutch law or the Articles of Association, resolutions of the General Meeting are passed by an absolute majority of votes cast. A resolution to amend the Articles of Association requires a simple majority of the votes cast if the resolution is adopted on a proposal of the Board of Management. Otherwise, such resolution requires a majority of at least three-fourths of the votes cast provided that the majority represents more than half of the issued share capital. Pursuant to Dutch law, no votes may be cast at a General Meeting in respect of shares which are held by the company.\n\n## Share capital and repurchase and issue of (rights to) shares\n\nThe authorized share capital of the company amounts to EUR 6 million, divided into 300 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of one eurocent each and 300 million preference shares, also with a nominal value of one eurocent each.

At the same time, the Board of Management was authorized to acquire ordinary shares on the stock exchange or otherwise, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, at a price between the nominal value of the ordinary shares and 110% of the market price of the ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam, provided that the maximum number of ordinary shares the company may acquire and hold does not exceed 10% of the issued share capital as at May 16, 2023, plus an additional 10% of the issued capital as at that same date in connection with the execution of share repurchases for capital reduction purposes.\n\n11.7\n\n## Stichting Continu\u00efteit Signify\n\nStichting Continu\u00efteit Signify, a foundation (' stichting' ) incorporated under Dutch law, has been granted a call option right to acquire preference shares in the share capital of the company. The possibility of issuing preference shares in the share capital of the company is a defensive measure. The foundation may resolve to exercise the call option at its sole discretion without the consent of the company. On the exercise of the call option, the foundation is entitled to acquire, and the company shall have the unconditional obligation to issue, preference shares up to a maximum corresponding with 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company. This shall exclude the preference shares as issued and outstanding immediately prior to the exercise of the call option, less one preference share, from which maximum any preference shares already placed with the foundation at the time of the exercise of the call option must be deducted.\n\nThe call option can be exercised by the foundation in order to, for example:\n\n- \u00b7 Prevent, slow down or otherwise complicate an unsolicited takeover bid for and an unsolicited acquisition of shares by means of an acquisition at the stock market or otherwise;\n- \u00b7 Prevent and countervail concentration of voting rights in the General Meeting; and/ or\n- \u00b7 Resist unwanted influence by and pressure from shareholders to amend the strategy of the company.\n\nIf the foundation exercises the call option, the company issues such number of preference shares as for which the foundation exercised its call option. No preference shares had been issued as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe foundation's objects are to further the interests of Signify N.V., the enterprises maintained by the company and the companies affiliated with the company in a group. The foundation will act in such a way that the interests of the company and of those enterprises are optimally safeguarded and that influences which could affect the independence, continuity or identity of the company, the enterprise maintained by the company and the companies affiliated with the company in a group in conflict with those interests are deterred to the best of the foundation's ability.\n\nThe foundation has the right to file a petition with the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal to commence an inquiry procedure within the meaning of section 2:344 Dutch Civil Code.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the board of the foundation was composed of the following independent members: Jos Streppel (chair), Sietze Hepkema and Jan Willem Baud.\n\nFurthermore, it should be noted that also in the event of (an attempt at) a hostile takeover or other attempt to obtain (de facto) control of the company, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are authorized to exercise in the interests of Signify all powers vested in them.\n\n11.8\n\n## Change of control\n\nThe company is not a party to any material agreement that takes effect, alters or terminates upon a change of control of the company following a take-over bid as referred to in section 5:70 of the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act, other than the credit agreement entered into with a syndicate of financial institutions which established term loans and a revolving credit facility, certain bi-lateral credit agreements that have been entered into to refinance term loans, the Eurobonds issued by the company in 2020, certain credit agreements entered into to refinance such Eurobonds and the Trade Mark License Agreement entered into with Koninklijke Philips N.V. These credit agreements include a change of control provision which allows the lenders to cancel the commitment and declare any outstanding amounts under the agreement, immediately due and payable whereupon such amounts will become immediately due and payable. The provisions applicable to all Eurobonds issued by the company in 2020 contain a \"Change of Control Put Event\". This means that if the company experienced such an event with respect to such bonds, the company might be required to redeem or purchase the bonds at its principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, the Supervisory Board selects and nominates an external auditor for appointment, upon advice by the Audit Committee. The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee assess the functioning of the external auditor, taking the observations from the Board of Management into account. Ernst & Young Accountants LLP was first appointed as external auditor of the company on May 13, 2016, for the financial years 2016 through 2019. On May 16, 2023, the General Meeting re-appointed Ernst & Young Accountants LLP as external auditor of the company for the financial years 2023 through 2025.\n\nThe services provided by the external auditor are pre-approved by the Audit Committee on the basis of the annual audit services engagement agreed with the external auditor. Unless general pre-approval has been given at the beginning of the year, all proposed services require such specific preapproval.\n\nIn principle, the external auditor attends all meetings of the Audit Committee. The findings of the external auditor, the audit approach and the risk analysis are also discussed at these meetings. The external auditor attends the meeting of the Supervisory Board at which the report of the external auditor with respect to the audit of the annual accounts is discussed, and at which the annual accounts are approved. The external auditor may also attend the Annual General Meeting to elaborate on its audit and auditor's report and is available for questions.\n\n## Auditor independence\n\nThe Audit Committee evaluates at least annually the external auditor's independence. The lead auditor in charge of the Signify account is changed every five years; such change took place as of the start of the financial year 2021. Furthermore, EU law requires the rotation of the external audit firm after the firm has completed the statutory audit of the company for a period of 10 consecutive years.\n\n## Prohibition on non-audit services\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the proposed audit scope, approach and fees as well as services that the external auditor provides to the company. Dutch law requires the separation of audit and non-audit services, meaning the company's external auditor is not allowed to provide prohibited non-audit services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 11.10\n\n## Dutch Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe company fully endorses the underlying principles of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, and is committed to adhering to the best practices of the Code as much as possible.\n\nThe company fully complies with the Code and applies all its principles and best practice provisions that relate to the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The payment of dividends, if any, and the amounts and timing thereof depend on several factors, including future sales, profits, financial conditions, general economic and business conditions and prospects. Other factors that the Board of Management may deem relevant, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements, might also impact the amount, timing and payment of future dividends. These might be beyond the control of the company.\n\n## Proposed dividend\n\nThe company proposes a dividend of EUR 1.55 per share, in cash, from the net income for full-year 2023. This is in line with its dividend policy of paying an increasing cash dividend per share year on year.\n\nThe dividend payment is subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 14, 2024. Further details will be provided in the agenda for the AGM. Dividend in cash is, in principle, subject to 15% Dutch dividend withholding tax, which will be deducted from the dividend in cash paid to shareholders.\n\n## Dividend dates\n\n| Ex-dividend date      | May 16, 2024   |\n|-----------------------|----------------|\n| Dividend record date  | May 17, 2024   |\n| Dividend payment date | June 3, 2024   |\n\n## Share repurchases for LTI hedging\n\nNo shares were repurchased in the open market in 2023.\n\n## 12.5 Debt info\n\n## Term loan and revolving credit facility\n\nIn December 2023, Signify entered into a EUR 400 million long-term loan agreement, maturing in December 2026.

        "page_content": "## 13 Risk factors and risk management\n\n## Introduction\n\nAt Signify, we believe taking risks is an inherent part of entrepreneurial behavior. By deploying a structured risk management process, management is able to take risks in a controlled manner. The company's risk management and controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that strategic and financial business objectives are met. This is done by integrating management control into the daily operations, by ensuring compliance with legal requirements and by safeguarding the integrity of the company's financial reporting and its related disclosures. The components of our risk management process are listed below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n13.1\n\n## Establish a strong risk management environment\n\nSignify's risk management environment is embedded in the corporate governance, the business control framework and the Integrity code.\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nCorporate governance is the system by which a company is directed and controlled. Good corporate governance derives from, among other things, solid internal controls and high ethical standards.\n\nThe Board of Management is responsible for managing the risks associated with the company's activities and for defining the company's risk appetite. The Board of Management is assisted by the company's leadership team, which participates on a quarterly basis in audit risk and control meetings to identify critical risks and to review progress on the implementation of risk responses. The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board provides oversight for the system of internal business controls and risk management. Internal and external audits are reported to and discussed by the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis and management self-assessment is reported on a yearly basis. An in-depth description of the company's corporate governance structure can be found in chapter 11, Corporate governance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business Control Framework\n\nThe company's Business Control Framework (BCF) sets the standard for risk management and business controls in the company. The objectives of the BCF are to maintain (i) integrated management control of the company's operations in order to ensure the integrity of the financial reporting and related disclosure, and (ii) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The company has designed its BCF based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The company regularly evaluates and improves its BCF to align with business dynamics and good practices.\n\n## Integrity code\n\nActing with integrity is the cornerstone for the success of our business and for achieving our purpose. It is integral to the values that define us as a company. Acting with integrity means making the right choices when faced with ethical dilemmas, and holding ourselves and each other to high standards of behavior.\n\nThe Integrity code was updated in 2023 and has been approved and adopted by the Board of Management. It applies to all employees of Signify N.V. and its controlled subsidiaries. The Integrity code formulates minimum standards of behavior. The company has underlying policies that form an integral part of the Integrity code.\n\nTo increase the level of awareness and to create global engagement, the company has established a network of Compliance Officers in countries where the company has a",

        "page_content": "presence, on each significant site, and at Division, Market Group and Functional level. The activities and responsibilities of this network are focused on providing expertise and support to managers and employees on Integrity code-related matters .\n\nFurthermore, the Signify central privacy office safeguards the governance of personal data together with privacy contact points across divisions, markets and functions.\n\nThe Integrity code is supported by mechanisms that ensure standardized reporting, escalation and investigation of concerns. These mechanisms are based on the Integrity code Reporting Policy that urges employees and third parties to report any concerns they may have regarding business conduct in relation to the Integrity code, either through a Compliance Officer or through the Signify Ethics line. The Signify Ethics line enables employees and third parties to report a concern either by telephone or online via a web intake form. All concerns raised are consistently registered in a single database and are investigated in accordance with standardized investigation procedures. An overview of the reporting activities for 2023 is given in chapter 17, CSRD disclosures, subsection 17.1 ESRS.\n\n## Define risk\n\n## 13.2 appetite\n\nRisk management in Signify focuses on the following risk categories: strategic, operational, compliance and financial risks. The Board of Management has determined the risk appetite and seeks to manage risk within these boundaries. The risk appetite is different for each of the risk categories:\n\n## Strategic risks\n\nStrategic risks include economic and political developments and the effects of actions taken to anticipate and respond to market circumstances. The company has a medium strategic risk appetite and is prepared to take some reasonable strategic risks, balancing the need to capture return from opportunities and management of the risks.\n\nThe company's key strategic risks are discussed in section 13.5 and include technological change, competition, global political and economic instability, digitalization, acquisitions and integration, and concentration risk.\n\n## Operational risks\n\nOperational risks include adverse unexpected developments resulting from internal processes, people and systems, or from external events that are linked to the running of each business. The company has a low operational risk appetite and aims to minimize\n\ndownside risks to maintain the high quality of its products, systems and services, reliable IT systems and sustainability commitments.\n\nThe company's key operational risks are discussed in section 13.5 and include supply disruptions, innovation, cyber-attacks and security breaches, new organizational capabilities, and climate change.\n\n## Compliance risks\n\nThese risks cover unanticipated failures to implement, or comply with, appropriate laws, regulations, policies and procedures. The company is, due to its global footprint, exposed to risk of fraud and other misconduct in violation of the integrity code and/or applicable laws and regulations, governmental investigation and legal proceedings in relation thereto.\n\nThe company has a very low compliance risk appetite. The company is committed to full compliance to relevant laws, regulations and its Integrity code and has a zero tolerance policy towards non compliance in these areas\n\n## Financial risk\n\nThe company faces financial risks outside its control related to treasury, accounting and reporting, pensions, and tax. Here, the risk appetite is low. Therefore, the company aims to minimize the impact of financial risk, and it follows a conservative risk management approach in these areas. Furthermore, the company is committed to transparent and truthful accounting and reporting to allow users of the financial statements to take decisions considering these risks.\n\n## 13.3 Risk assessment and control\n\nIn order to provide a comprehensive view of the company's business strategy and activities, risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of top-down and bottom-up approaches.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nThe company leadership team identifies the key risks as part of its strategic review process. In a subsequent workshop, the leadership team ranks the risks based on impact, likelihood, risk criticality and control effectiveness. As part of the strategic review cycle, initiatives are defined to mitigate the risks. Owners are assigned for each of the strategic initiatives, and they are then accountable for ensuring adequate risk mitigation and for monitoring the implementation of mitigation measures. Each quarter, the key risks are discussed during the audit and risk committee meeting internally with key leaders. Reported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are aggregated at Division, Market cluster and company level.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Operational risk\n\nRisks are reported on a regular basis as part of the business performance reviews. In addition, on an annual basis, the top risks are identified by company leadership. Relevant risks, including those associated with business opportunities, are prioritized in terms of potential impact and likelihood, considering quantitative and/or qualitative aspects, and are reviewed together with the Board of Management. On a quarterly basis, risks and controls are reviewed with the Divisions, Market clusters and specific Functions in the audit risk committee.\n\n## Compliance risk\n\nThe Integrity Committee is the ultimate body within Signify to administer the organization's Integrity Code Legal Compliance Program. It does so by maintaining oversight of the development and implementation of the Integrity code, including the monitoring of its effectiveness. The Integrity Committee is chaired by the Chief Legal Officer. Its members include the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief HR Officer, Head of Internal Audit and Head of Legal Compliance.\n\nWith an annual Integrity code selfassessment process forming part of the internal controls over financial reporting (ICS), compliance to the Integrity code forms part of management's ICS monitoring process. Management of each business unit signs off on controls relating to compliance with the Integrity code, with this confirmation forming part of the annual certification statement on Business Controls. Noncompliance issues are highlighted and, if significant, they are reported to the Board of\n\nManagement through the Certification Statement process.\n\nEmployees are requested to state their commitment to the Integrity code after having completed e-learnings. In 2023, employees were required to complete one or more e-learnings on the Integrity code and related legal compliance domains. Specific target groups were required to participate in recurring (virtual) classroom trainings. In addition, each year, Finance and Procurement employees are asked to sign off on the Financial and the Procurement Codes of Ethics, respectively. All executives are asked to sign off on the Integrity code annually to confirm their awareness of and compliance with the code. Violations of the Integrity code will result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.\n\n## Financial risk\n\nThe company has implemented a global standard for ICS. ICS, together with the established accounting procedures, are designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that the books and records properly reflect transactions necessary to permit preparation of financial\n\nstatements, that policies and procedures are carried out by qualified personnel, and that published financial statements are properly prepared and do not contain any material misstatements.\n\nInternal controls are an inherent part of the processes in our company, where the responsibility for executing these internal controls is with the persons that carry out these processes. The design and maintenance of the global standard for\n\ninternal controls is with the (global) business process owners and the dedicated ICS team.\n\nAn ICS monitoring process exists for all material reporting units, whereby business process owners engaged in the key financial processes perform self-assessments on several key controls, document the results, and take corrective action where necessary. ICS supports business and functional management in a periodic cycle of assessment and monitoring of the control environment.\n\nOn an annual basis, management's accountability for business controls is recorded through the formal issuance of a Certification Statement on Business Controls and a Letter of Representation by Divisions, reporting units and Functional management to the Board of Management. Any deficiencies noted in the design and operating effectiveness of controls over financial reporting, which were not completely remediated, are evaluated at year end by the Board of Management.

At present, a relatively small  part of the worldwide installed base of light points is connected. A cornerstone of Signify's strategy is to focus on and invest in its connected                                        | Signify is actively developing and investing in technology platforms and software  applications to bring (more advanced) connected lighting systems to the  market. Part of this strategy is to strongly focus on the interoperability of its  applications and to incorporate different connectivity technologies in its  connected lighting portfolio, thereby addressing different needs in the market.                                                                       |\n|                      | The risk is that the extent and speed of adoption of connected lighting  systems and services does not develop as anticipated, or that Signify is unable  to successfully implement its strategy in connected lighting.                                                                                                                                  | Finally, in order to capture this new value opportunity, Signify's systems and  product teams are developing innovative services and flexible offers meeting  differentiated customer needs from basic to advanced and responding to  different regional requirements around connected lighting. The market  adoption of connected technologies is captured through quarterly market                                                                                             |\n| Competition          | The LED lighting market has attracted many new competitors (particularly from  Asia) with low-priced offerings and is at present highly competitive. This has  led to increased commoditization of offerings as well as price pressure on LED  products. This might impact revenues and profitability, in particular, if Signify  fails to manage costs. | To counter full category commoditization, Signify's strategy includes the  creation of tiered offerings (e.g. B-brand and private label), and bringing  renewed innovation into the commoditized LED segment (A-class LED range).  Further, the company is strengthening its digital (sales) capabilities and is  running saving initiatives to keep its cost base competitive. Also, Signify can  make use of the Philips brand, which has a strong global reputation and brand |\n\n<!-- image -->",

In particular, the continuing Russia-Ukraine war, the conflict in the Middle East, the rise of interest rates with the resulting high level of inflation, and the slower than anticipated recovery in China post COVID, have had an adverse effect on consumer and customer spending, and hence on the company's sales and profitability in 2023. Looking forward, uncertainty and volatility remain regarding adverse economic conditions and can impact the general lighting market.\n\nSignify depends on external suppliers and, to a large extent, on the production of components and LED products in Asian countries. The risk of this high dependency is that suppliers are not able to deliver (raw) materials, components or services in a timely manner for Signify to meet customer demand.\n\nNext to this, the production and shipping of products and components could be interrupted by conflicts, natural disasters, such as earthquakes, typhoons and floods caused by climate change, or pandemic diseases.\n\nFinally, increasing geopolitical tensions and trade protectionism, such as local manufacturing requirements, might disrupt the company's operations. This might limit the company's ability to leverage and draw efficiencies from its global (manufacturing) footprint. Specifically for conventional lighting, due to the decreasing demand in 2023 Signify faced a challenge to keep active dual sourcing in place, as suppliers decided to close their business.\n\nFinally, disruption of the global supply chain usually leads to increases in logistic costs, which in turn need to be offset through additional cost savings or additional pricing.\n\nAt the macro level, Signify actively engages in global forums focused on the benefits of globalization. Signify is also committed to highly credible industry organizations globally to support the stabilization of global trade.\n\nIn order to minimize the impact of instability on its business, Signify closely follows and reviews (geo)political and economic developments and takes these into account in both its short- and medium-term operational planning.\n\nTo mitigate potential supply chain inefficiencies and/or tariff impacts arising from geopolitical tensions and trade protectionism, Signify leverages its global (manufacturing) footprint and makes adjustments to its sourcing base when needed. Inflation in Commodity and Energy prices is offset through a combination of cost savings and price increases.\n\nSignify has built a supplier risk plan in which atrisk suppliers are identified using criteria that take into account the geographical location of the supplier, and the technologies and processes used. In addition, Signify has enhanced regional supply capabilities to increase the share of components needed for manufacturing products for a particular region, as opposed to them being sourced from remote locations.\n\nRegular risk assessments are carried out at individual plant level, including the risks related to natural catastrophes and water scarcity. These assessments are also performed at locations of business-critical suppliers and of strategic inventories. Signify requires its sites to have robust business continuity plans for any large-scale events that can severely impact the business. These plans include sourcing from alternative suppliers, nearshoring, and increasing strategic inventories.\n\nCost inflation due to the shortage of components, containers or labor is offset through a combination of cost savings and market price increases. The level of pricing moves is benchmarked versus key competitors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It also requires developing different capabilities and competences to commercialize its innovations successfully. In particular, in the fast-changing market in which the company operates, it must continuously address the needs of local customers and introduce locally relevant new products and solutions ahead of competition.\n\nFailure to bring new products and solutions to the markets in a timely fashion and to commercialize its innovations successfully would lead to the expected benefits of these investments not being delivered and, hence, this would be detrimental to both the top and bottom line of the company.\n\nAs Signify becomes more digitalized, more devices and systems are connected online. This increases cyber security risk across enterprise IT, Operational Technology (OT) and our products and solutions that are delivered with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities and accompanying (cloud-based) software applications.\n\nShould a successful cyber-attack materialize, the processes, services and systems that allow the organization to continue to operate could be impacted resulting in operational disruption, with or without ransom demands. Further, a cyber-attack could cause a data breach where sensitive, protected, personal or confidential data held by Signify are leaked or stolen.\n\nLast but not least, the cyber risk extends to the 3rd parties that Signify does business with.\n\nSignify invests significantly in its R&D activities. It has dedicated R&D activities to support its divisions in developing and realizing near-term innovation roadmaps, and to develop longer-term innovations with a focus on areas such as connected lighting systems, software and digital applications.\n\nSignify adapted its business structure to enable a stronger customer focus and enhanced specialization to further increase execution speed. Finally, dedicated go-to-market channels and tailored marketing approaches are in place with the aim to successfully introduce new offerings commercially.\n\nThe return on innovation investments is reviewed on a quarterly basis, including speed to market, efficiency of investment and sales development versus plan.\n\nCyber risk is reviewed by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board on a periodic basis. A dedicated cyber security team scans external developments, identifies inherent risks, and proposes plans to limit residual risk as much as possible. The Security Board aligns on the level of acceptable residual risk. Each year mandatory security and data protection & privacy awareness trainings are conducted. A security improvement roadmap has been created and the progress is monitored by the Security Board, Supervisory Board and Audit Risk Committee. Third party risk is assessed as part of this.\n\nSecurity measures are in place to detect attackers and to minimize the risk of them causing damage to systems and gaining access to critical data, systems and services. Business continuity plans are in place in the event of nonavailability of IT systems and manufacturing sites. These business continuity plans are tested periodically. Additionally, there is a security operations team that is supported by a managed security service provider for 24x7 vigilance of security events. This team is focused on security incident management and supports security incident monitoring and response within specified SLAs.\n\nSpecifically to its products and software applications, Signify develops them inhouse and secures the ecosystem in conformity to security standards and best practices (ISA/IEC62443, ISO2700x, NIST).\n\n<!-- image -->",

As such, digitalization is a key opportunity to provide higher customer service levels, more attractive customer offers, and to continue optimizing productivity through more efficient workflows. Failure to keep up with ongoing digitalization and to adapt to new technologies will lead to a gradual loss of both market share and earnings.\n\nOver the past years, the company has stepped up its investment in digitalization. Signify has established a Digitalization roadmap for customer interfaces, processes and offers, aligned to its business strategy. Upgrading the underlying IT architecture, re-skilling its employees, and improving the overall data governance, have been identified as key enablers.\n\nSignify needs to build the capabilities and culture required to transform its business and deliver on its strategy, including the ambition to grow its connected lighting business and grow in new areas such as agricultural, solar, UV-C lighting and 3D printing.\n\nNew capabilities are particularly relevant in the areas of digital, software development, marketing and consultative selling. Next to this, bringing advanced connected lighting offerings to the market requires highly specialized (technical) personnel.\n\nFailure to successfully develop these new and different capabilities may have a significant impact on the company achieving its long-term strategic goals.\n\nSelected acquisitions have been, and are, an important part of Signify's strategy. These acquisitions are aimed at growing the business, strengthening its supply chain or acquiring complementary technologies or new capabilities. Acquisitions always entail integration risk, which in turn could result in sales and cost synergies, strategic advantages and/or economies of scale being delayed or not fully realized.\n\nSeveral key programs have been initiated, under the leadership of Chief Digital and Information Officer, in the areas of technology foundation, skills up-grading, enhancement in go-to-market and E-commerce capabilities.\n\nProgress against the established roadmap and the key programs is closely followed-up by the Digital Committee, a sub-committee of the Supervisory Board.\n\nSignify invests in the professional development of its employees through learning initiatives as well as through dedicated talent management programs that identify top talents early in their career. In addition, actions were launched to upscale commercial skills and capabilities in cooperation with the Learning@Signify Academy. Next, talent acquisition programs are in place to attract new employees with a specific focus on those (technical) areas where the company sees capability needs that cannot be developed internally. Finally, through M&A projects of various size, new capabilities are brought to the company, with retention programs being part of the due diligence and acquisition approval process.\n\nFor any acquisition, Signify follows a rigid process of confirming strategic relevance, value creation, due-diligence, and post-merger integration plan. Throughout the entire process, Signify makes sure to involve the right people from the organization, considering all vital aspects of the business.\n\nImmediately after any acquisition, a multidisciplinary team with members from both organizations is put together to ensure a smooth integration of the new business, both from a top-line synergy, a cost synergy, and a cultural integration point of view.\n\n<!-- image -->",

And, with a global footprint, Signify's manufacturing sites and supply chain are exposed to risks related to climate change. In line with that, Signify is seeing continued and increased attention to climate change from all sectors of society. This attention has led to additional regulations designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the adoption of more energy-efficient products and low carbon solutions.and support products that contribute to circularity.\n\nAs lighting represents around 12% of global electricity consumption, the lighting industry will need to adapt to changing environmental regulations.\n\nThe inability to meet customer expectations related to the energy efficiency potential of the company's LED lighting products and solutions could adversely affect the company's reputation and brand. Additionally, understanding the risks posed by climate change, and how to improve business resilience through climate change mitigation and adaptation accordingly, is imperative to secure the company's longer-term success.\n\nAs part of its Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 sustainability program, Signify is taking measures to manage climate risks and adapt its businesses.\n\nSince 2020, Signify is carbon neutral in its operations and sources 100% renewable electricity in its own operations. Investments in purchase power agreements not only contribute to emission reduction but also hedge the fluctuation of energy prices. Sustainability is an integral part of Signify's 5 Frontiers strategy. Its pillar, Growth for Sustainability, aims to address global challenges by focusing on sustainable growth areas, based on low-carbon technological innovation: Climate action, Circular economy, Food availability, Safety & security, and Health & well-being. Through its global leadership in energy-efficient lighting, Signify's portfolio is uniquely positioned to mitigate risks and capture opportunities related to climate change. For example, Signify continues to expand its Philips Ultra Efficient portfolio, the world's most efficient energy saving LED Lighting, thereby helping to reduce energy expenditure. Signify's lighting for circularity initiative is driving the development of products that can be reprinted, refurbished,reused or recycled to optimize resource utilization and reduce emissions.\n\nFollowing the recommendations and guidance of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures, Signify conducts ongoing climate risk assessments in line with the four core elements of governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets (for details, refer to the Sustainability Supplements to the Annual Report, available on our Sustainability downloads webpage: https:// www.signify.com/global/sustainability/downloads).\n\nIn 2023, Signify reduced 19% and was on track to achieve its ambitious Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 commitments (for details, refer to chapter 4, Brighter Lives, Better World.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 15.6 Notes to the Consolidated financial statements\n\nIn millions of EUR unless otherwise stated\n\n## 1 Basis of preparation\n\nSignify N.V. is a public company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and listed on Euronext Amsterdam under the symbol \"LIGHT\".\n\nAs used herein, the term Signify is used for Signify N.V. ('the Company') and its subsidiaries within the meaning of section 2:24b of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2023, have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union (EU) and with the statutory provisions of Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The Consolidated financial statements are prepared by the Board of Management of the Company and authorized for issue on February 27, 2024, and will be submitted for adoption to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 14, 2024. The Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\n\n## Basis of measurement\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments, including derivatives (measured at fair value), assets held for sale (measured at the lower of carrying amount and its fair value less costs to sell), and definedbenefit pension plans (plan assets are measured at fair value).\n\n## Functional and presentation currency\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (EUR), which is the functional and presentation currency of Signify N.V. All amounts are presented in EUR million and have been rounded to the nearest EUR million, unless otherwise stated. Due to rounding, amounts may not add up to totals provided.\n\n## Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates inherently contain a degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThese estimates and judgments are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience, current and expected future outcomes, third-party evaluations and various other assumptions that are considered reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "contingencies. Signify revises material estimates if changes occur in the circumstances or if there is new information/experience on which an estimate was or can be based.\n\nThe areas where the most significant judgments and estimates are made are goodwill, deferred tax asset recoverability, non-current income tax payables, revenue recognition, impairments, provisions, insurance cover asset recoverability, employee benefit obligations, inventory valuation and obsolescence provision, leases, fair value of derivatives, other financial instruments and assets and liabilities in business combinations. For further discussion on these significant judgments and estimates, reference is made to the respective accounting policies and notes within these Consolidated financial statements that relate to the above topics.\n\n## Climate-related matters\n\nThe impact of climate change generates opportunities as well as challenges for Signify's existing and future lighting products and solutions portfolio. Sustainability is an integral part of Signify's 5 Frontiers strategy. Its pillar, Growth for Sustainability, aims to address global challenges by focusing on sustainable growth areas, based on low-carbon technological innovation: Climate action, Circular economy, Food availability, Safety & security, and Health & well-being. Through its global leadership in energy-efficient lighting, Signify's portfolio is uniquely positioned to mitigate risks and capture opportunities related to climate change.\n\n## Digital Solutions and Digital Products\n\nDigital Solutions and Digital Products benefit from the phasing out of conventional lighting and the move to more energy-efficient LED and connected lighting. Stimulus packages, such as the EU Green Deal and the US stimulus package, are pushing for the use of more sustainable technologies. This creates a multi-year opportunity for Signify, as its product portfolio is wellpositioned to capture growth from this drive for sustainability.\n\n## Conventional Products\n\nThe conventional lamps market is expected to continue to decline in the coming years due to the ongoing adoption of LED lighting technologies and regulatory changes. While the overall conventional market continues to decline, Conventional Products' focus is on further increasing its leading market share in key segments and markets. The specialty lighting products see a much slower conversion rate to LED. The division continues to proactively manage its manufacturing footprint and reduce operational costs to optimize free cash flow.\n\nDevelopments on climate-related matters for the Division were considered in preparing the Consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the key assumptions used in the annual goodwill impairment test for Conventional Products have taken into account external market assumptions, including potential phase out of products due to market conditions and legislation likely to be ratified. In the 2023 annual goodwill test, the estimated recoverable amount of Conventional Products exceeded its carrying value, therefore no impairment loss was recognized. For further details, refer to note 15, Intangible assets. In addition, Property, Plant\n\nand Equipment of Conventional Products were reviewed for impairment triggering events. Where applicable, assets were impaired to their recoverable amounts, and useful lives were adjusted accordingly.\n\n## Macroeconomic environment\n\nThe current macro economic environment poses risks and uncertainties which are closely monitored by Signify. Such risks, uncertainties and other important factors include but are not limited to: adverse economic and political developments, in particular the impacts of the RussiaUkraine conflict, the conflict in the Middle East, the energy crisis in Europe, the recovery trajectory of the Chinese economy, component availability and cost inflation.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter did not result in an impairment loss being recognized. The key assumptions of the goodwill impairment test include sales growth rates, EBITA and the rates used for discounting the projected cash flows. All key assumptions were updated to reflect management's current best estimates. For further details, refer to note 15, Intangible assets.\n\n## Intangible assets, other than goodwill\n\nSignify monitors changes in the economic environment which could indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, and performs an impairment test when an impairment trigger is identified. No material impairment was identified based on the procedures performed.\n\n## Assumptions for post-employment benefits\n\nMacroeconomic developments impacted underlying assumptions of post-employment liabilities such as the interest rates and investment performance. Signify performed an updated quantification of the net defined benefit liability as at December 31, 2023, based on the most recent assumptions. Details of the underlying assumptions used can be found in note 25, Postemployment benefits.\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nIn the context of macroeconomic developments, Signify has also assessed whether it is still probable that deferred tax assets recognized on the balance sheet will be realized. No material derecognition as a result of this assessment was recorded.\n\n## New operating model\n\nOn December 1, 2023, Signify announced its new operating model. The operating model and revised segments are expected to be effective in the course of 2024 and are therefore not reflected in the Consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The changes did not have any significant impact on the amounts recognized in the prior period and current period.\n\n## New and amended standards not yet adopted\n\nSeveral new standards or amendments to existing standards that are mandatory for reporting periods commencing on or after January 1, 2024, have been published. These standards have not been adopted early by Signify. The new standards or amendments are not expected to have a material impact on Signify in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.\n\n## 2 Material accounting policies\n\n## General\n\nThe accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied by Signify to all periods presented in these Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Signify N.V. and all subsidiaries it controls (i.e. when it is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee). The existence and effect of potential voting rights are considered when assessing whether the Company controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method, the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in\n\nthe acquiree are recognized at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to Signify. Signify measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:\n\n- \u00b7 The fair value of the consideration transferred; plus\n- \u00b7 The recognized amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; plus\n- \u00b7 If the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less\n- \u00b7 The net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\nCosts related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred. Non-controlling interests are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Signify entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (\"the functional currency\").\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation when items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the Consolidated statement of income, except when deferred in Other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges. The exchange differences are presented as part of Cost of sales, except for tax items and Financial income and expenses, which are recognized in the same line item as they relate to.\n\nUpon consolidation, the assets and liabilities of non-euro entities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments at the time of the acquisition, are translated into euros at the year-end rates of exchange. The items of the statement of income of foreign activities are translated at the rates which are approximating the rates at the dates of transactions. The resulting translation differences of the net investments in foreign operations are recognized in Other comprehensive income.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\n## Sale of goods\n\nRevenue from the sale of goods is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control over the goods. For standard sale of products, control generally passes to the customer when the product is delivered and accepted, depending on the delivery conditions and incoterms. For products for which a right to return exists during a defined period, revenue is\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "recognized by considering the historical pattern of actual returns. Return policies are typically based on customary return arrangements in local markets.\n\n## Sale of services\n\nSignify accounts for cloud-enabled services, extended warranties and lifecycle services as separate performance obligations. Control over these services is transferred over time and revenue is recognized, in most cases, on a straight-line basis over the duration of the service period.\n\n## Transaction price\n\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which Signify expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The transaction price excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as sales taxes.\n\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the total consideration of the contract is allocated to all distinct performance obligations in the contract based on their stand-alone selling prices. Stand-alone selling prices are determined based on other stand-alone sales transactions that are directly observable, when possible. If no direct observable prices are available, the stand-alone selling price is normally based on the expected cost plus a margin approach.\n\nThe transaction price may be variable due to discounts, rebates or similar arrangements. Revenue is only recognized for the part of the consideration for which it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Judgment is required in determining the probability and level of discounts and rebates that will be granted. The estimate is updated throughout the term of the contract.\n\nSignify does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of significant financing component if, at contract inception, it is expected that the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is one year or less. This applies to most sales transactions.\n\n## Other\n\nPayments made to customers for distinct goods or services are excluded from revenue recognized and recorded as part of Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\nSignify may incur costs for obtaining a contract, including payments made to agents that depend on winning the contract. Signify applies the practical expedient from IFRS 15, allowing the incremental costs of obtaining a contract to be expensed if the associated amortization period is 12 months or less. As a result, no amounts of contract costs are recognized in the balance sheet.\n\n## Contract assets and liabilities\n\nContract assets mostly comprise of unbilled positions, where Signify has, partially or in full, satisfied performance obligations but not yet billed the customer. These are recorded under either Other current assets or Other non-current assets. The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional, which is mostly when the customer is billed.\n\nContract liabilities, recorded under Other current liabilities and Other non-current liabilities, consist of customer payments received in advance, for which Signify still needs to satisfy (part of) the performance obligations. Contract liabilities mainly consist of recurring services performance obligations, such as extended warranties, life-cycle services and cloud-enabled services as well as advances for projects.\n\n## Income and expenses\n\nSignify applies accrual accounting. This means that expenses are recognized when incurred and Income is recognized when earned, irrespective of the actual cash flows.\n\nConsideration received from customers for shipping and handling is recognized as Sales. Shipping and handling expenses related to sales to third parties are generally recorded as Selling, general and administrative expenses. When shipping and handling are distinct performance obligations, then the related expenses are recorded as Cost of sales.\n\nAdvertising and promotion costs and costs related to the brand license fee are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The costs of conversion of inventories include direct labor and fixed and variable production overheads, considering the stage of completion and the normal capacity of production facilities. Costs of idle facility and abnormal waste are expensed. The cost of inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Due to price erosion and technological developments, inventory valuation requires forward-looking estimates on future sales levels, future price erosion and related expected gross margin percentages. On each reporting date, management performs an analysis of net realizable values and determines the lower of cost and net realizable value to measure its inventories. The write-down is included in Cost of sales.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Financial instruments\n\n## Recognition\n\nA financial asset or liability is recognized when Signify becomes a party to a contract that is a financial instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial instruments are accounted for at the trade date. Initial measurement of financial assets and liabilities is at fair value. Dividend income is recognized when declared.\n\nFinancial assets arising from insurance contracts are only recognized when it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received if Signify settles the obligation. Signify recognizes the reimbursement as a separate financial asset.\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\nThe classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets and liabilities depends on Signify's business model for managing the financial assets and liabilities, the contractual terms of the cash flows and the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) test. Signify performs the analysis on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Financial assets and liabilities are classified into one of the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at amortized cost: The business model for these instruments is to hold them to collect contractual cash flows. This financial asset category mainly consists of Trade and other receivables. After initial recognition these financial assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less loss allowance and net of discounts given or agreed to, if the offset requirements are met;\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): The business model for these instruments is to hold them for trading. This financial asset category mainly consists of Signify's participations in Virtual Power Purchase Agreements and other Derivatives;\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): The business model for these instruments is to hold them to collect contractual cash flows and to sell them. Fair value gains and losses are subsequently not reclassified to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. This category consists of minor equity investments;\n- \u00b7 All financial liabilities except for financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss are classified and subsequently measured at amortized cost. This financial liability category primarily consists of Debt and Trade and other payables. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss mainly consists of Derivatives and Contingent consideration in a business acquisition, to which IFRS 3 applies. Contingent consideration is subsequently measured at fair value with changes recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Netting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nSignify presents financial assets and financial liabilities on a gross basis as separate line items in the Consolidated statement of financial position, unless the offset criteria are met.\n\nThe offsetting criteria are met if Signify has a legal right to offset financial assets with financial liabilities and if Signify intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. To meet the requirement, the right of set-off should be available today and not contingent on a future event and it should be legally enforceable for all counterparties in a normal course of business, as well as in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognized when:\n\n- \u00b7 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or\n- \u00b7 Signify has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a \"pass-through\" arrangement; and either (a) Signify has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) Signify has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n\nWhen Signify has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, Signify continues to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, Signify also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that Signify has retained.\n\n## Impairment of trade receivables and contract assets\n\nSignify estimates lifetime expected loss allowance for all Trade receivables and Contract assets via calculating the expected credit losses. Trade receivables and contract assets are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due whereby the lifetime expected credit loss on the Trade receivables is recognized based on a matrix model calculated per country, which utilizes historical recoverability data and default probability per country.\n\nAs soon as individual trade accounts receivable can no longer be collected in a normal course of business and are expected to result in a loss, they are designated as doubtful trade accounts receivable and valued at the expected collectible amounts. They are written off when they are deemed to be uncollectable because of bankruptcy or other form of receivership at the debtors. Any previously recognized expected loss is offset against the carrying amount of such trade receivable and the difference is taken as a loss accounted for within Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nAt inception of the hedge relationship, Signify documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including whether changes in the cash flows of the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<\n\n\u2261\n\n>",

        "page_content": "hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items. Signify documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions.\n\nFor foreign currency forwards, Signify designates the spot component of the change in fair value in cash flow hedge relationships. The spot component is determined with reference to the relevant spot market exchange rates. The differential between the contracted forward rate and the spot market exchange rate is defined as forward points. It is discounted, where material. Changes in the fair value related to forward points are continuously recognized in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nTranslation exposure of foreign-currency equity invested in consolidated entities is generally not hedged. However, if a hedge is entered into, it is accounted for as a net investment hedge. Signify designates the full instrument in the hedge relationship. The result of hedging of the translation risk, using net investment hedges is recognized in the Currency translation differences within equity, as can be seen in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income as long as the hedge is effective.\n\nSignify measures all derivative financial instruments at fair value derived from market prices of the instruments or calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable interest yield curves, basis spread and foreign exchange rates. These calculations are tested for reasonableness by comparing the outcome of the internal valuation with the valuation received from the counterparty.\n\nSignify monitors that the economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and hedge ratio is the same as the one Signify uses for risk management purposes. A prospective effectiveness test is performed to prove that the hedge is effective.\n\nIf the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal due to the different timing or amount of the underlying transaction, but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, Signify performs re-balancing of the hedge relationship by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item, so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Gains and losses that were accumulated in equity related to an ineffective portion of hedge, Signify records immediately in the Consolidated statement of income when such ineffectiveness occurs.\n\nThe derivatives related to transactions are, for hedge accounting purposes, split into hedges of on-balance-sheet accounts receivable/payable and forecasted sales and purchases. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized within Cost of sales in the Consolidated statement of income, except for derivatives that are effective and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which are recorded in Other comprehensive income until the Consolidated statement of income is affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated\n\nhedged item. Changes in the fair value of hedges related to intercompany loans and deposits are recognized within Financial income and expenses in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\nThe derivatives used by Signify can be subject to master netting and set-off agreements with financial counterparties. In case of certain termination events, under the terms of these Master Agreements, Signify can terminate the outstanding transactions and aggregate their positive and negative values to arrive at a single net termination sum (or close-out amount). This contractual right is, among others, subject to the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The right may be limited by local law if the counterparty is subject to bankruptcy proceedings;\n- \u00b7 The right applies on a bilateral basis.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in the Consolidated statement of income except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly within equity or in Other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially-enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized, using the balance sheet method, for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities for withholding taxes are recognized for subsidiaries in situations where the income is to be paid out as dividend in the foreseeable future and for undistributed earnings of unconsolidated companies to the extent that these withholding taxes are not expected to be refundable or deductible.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<\n\n\u2261\n\n>",

        "page_content": "Changes in tax rates are reflected in the period when the change has been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized. The evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires judgment about the future taxable profitability of the legal entity holding the tax loss carry forward. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the countries where the deferred tax assets originated and during the periods when the deferred tax assets become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. A lack of future taxable profits or taxable profits below the level of current estimates, may cause deferred tax assets to be impaired.\n\nThe ultimate tax effects of transactions may be uncertain for a considerable period of time, requiring management to estimate the related current and deferred tax treatments. In assessing the uncertainty, Signify considers whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept or revise the uncertain tax treatment. Income tax payable include liabilities for uncertain tax positions which are recognized when it is probable that tax will be due. To the extent uncertain tax positions relate to deferred tax assets these are offset against each other. Actual tax assessments in relation to these uncertain tax positions may significantly deviate from estimates.\n\nIn determining the amount of current and deferred income tax, Signify takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgments about future events. New information may become available that causes Signify to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact the income tax expense in the period that such a determination is made.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized if, as a result of a past event, Signify has a present legal or constructive obligation, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of time value of money. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognized as interest expense. Significant judgment is required in determining the amount and probability of resources outflow and discount rates used to calculate the present value of this outflow. A liability is recognized if timing and amount of the settlement can be reliably estimated.\n\nThe accounting and presentation for some of Signify's provisions is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Restructuring related provisions - The provision for restructuring relates to the estimated costs of programs that are planned and controlled by management that materially change the scope of Signify's business or the manner in which it is conducted. A provision is recognized when Signify has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan, or by announcing the plan's main features to those affected by it;\n- \u00b7 Environmental provisions - Measurement of liabilities associated with environmental obligations is based on current legal and constructive requirements. Liabilities and expected insurance recoveries, if any, are recorded separately. The carrying amount of environmental provisions is regularly reviewed and adjusted for new facts and changes in law;\n- \u00b7 Product warranty - A provision for product warranty is recognized at the time of revenue recognition and reflects the estimated costs of replacement and free-of-charge services that will be incurred by Signify with respect to the products. The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighing of possible outcomes against their associated probabilities;\n- \u00b7 Litigation provisions - Liabilities and expected insurance recoveries, if any, are recorded separately. Balances are transferred to Other liabilities when the amount and timing of cash flows are no longer uncertain. Settlements which are agreed for amounts in excess of existing provisions are reflected as payables;\n- \u00b7 Onerous contract provisions - Provisions are recognized for a contract if it is onerous. The present obligation under the contract is measured and recognized as a provision. An onerous contract is a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nWhen the potential cash outflow is possible or remote and the risk covered by a guarantee is not a financial risk, Signify applies off-balance sheet treatment to such guarantees. For example, environmental remediation and legal proceedings. When the expectation of the cash outflow becomes probable such guarantees become provisions, see guidance above.\n\nWhen guarantees are covering credit risk or any other financial risk they are accounted for as financial assets and liabilities.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The useful lives and residual values are evaluated annually. The costs of property, plant and equipment comprise of all directly attributable costs (including the cost of materials and direct labor). Government grants for assets are deducted from the cost of the related asset.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, is calculated using the straight-line method taking into account the residual values and estimated useful lives and is primarily included in Cost of sales. Freehold land is not depreciated. Gains and losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment are included in Other business income. Costs related to repair and maintenance activities are expensed in the period in which they are incurred unless leading to an extension of the original lifetime of capacity.\n\nThe expected useful lives in years of property, plant and equipment are as follows:\n\n| Building                    | from 5 to 50   |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|\n| Machinery and installations | from 3 to 20   |\n| Other equipment             | from 2 to 10   |\n| Right-of-use assets         | from 2 to 20   |\n\n## Leases\n\nSignify entered into contracts that conveys the right to use the identified asset and as such Signify accounted for these contracts as a lessee.\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nSignify recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless Signify is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, Signify recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include (in-substance) fixed payments (less any lease incentives), variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by Signify and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects Signify exercising the option to terminate. In calculating the present value of lease payments, Signify uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a\n\nmodification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nSignify applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases for real estate (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered of low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Significant judgment in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal options\n\nSignify determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. When determining the lease term, Signify considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. These circumstances include Signify's strategic plans, the industrial footprint of Signify and divisions and the importance of the site to Signify's operations.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe measurement of goodwill at initial recognition is described under the Business combinations accounting policy above. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of investments in associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and an impairment loss on such investment is allocated to the investment as a whole.\n\n## Intangible assets other than goodwill\n\nThe fair value of other intangible assets, which mainly consist of customer relations, brand names and technology based intangibles acquired through business combinations is determined using a valuation technique that estimates the fair value of an asset based on market participants' expectations of the cash flows associated with that asset over its remaining useful life. Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life. The useful lives are evaluated annually. Intangible assets are initially capitalized at cost, with the exception of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination that are capitalized at their acquisition-date fair values.\n\nExpenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalized as an intangible asset when Signify can demonstrate that: the product or process is technically and\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "commercially feasible, the costs can be reliably measured, Signify has sufficient resources and the intention to complete the development.\n\nThe development expenditure capitalized comprises all directly attributable costs (including the cost of materials and direct labor). Other development expenditures and expenditures on research activities are recognized in the Consolidated statement of income. Capitalized development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Amortization of capitalized development expenditure is charged to the Consolidated statement of income on a straight- line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets in Research and development expenses.\n\nAmortization of other intangible assets is reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses for brand names and customer relationships and in Cost of sales for technologybased and other intangible assets.\n\nThe expected useful lives in years of intangible assets excluding goodwill are as follows:\n\n| Product development   | from 2 to 5   |\n|-----------------------|---------------|\n| Software              | from 3 to 10  |\n| Technology            | from 2 to 20  |\n| Customer relations    | from 5 to 20  |\n| Brand names           | from 5 to 20  |\n| Other                 | from 2 to 10  |\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use are not amortized but tested for impairment annually and whenever impairment indicators require impairment testing. Signify performed and completed annual impairment tests in the last quarter of the financial year. Judgment is required when analyzing impairments triggers and tests of goodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use. These analyses are based on the estimation of the recoverable amount. The review for impairment is carried out at the level where cash flows occur that are independent of other cash flows.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized in the Consolidated statement of income whenever and to the extent that the carrying amount of a cash-generating unit exceeds the unit's recoverable amount, which is the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Value in use or fair value less costs of disposal is measured as the present value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset via its use or sale with deduction of costs directly associated with its use or sale.\n\n## Impairment of property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is assessed by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset with the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Value in use is measured as the present value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset is deemed not recoverable, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the recoverable amount. The review for impairment is carried out at the level where cash flows occur that are independent of other cash flows.\n\nImpairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if and to the extent there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. Reversals of impairment are recognized in the Consolidated income statement.\n\n## Pension and other employee benefits\n\n## Defined-benefit plans\n\nSignify's retirement benefit obligation is calculated by an independent actuary, using the projected unit credit method. This calculation is performed separately for each plan by estimating the amount of the benefit that employees have earned in relation to their past services. The measurement date for all defined benefit plans is December 31. For plans with a relatively low defined-benefit obligation, Signify may decide to calculate the defined-benefit obligation with a lower frequency. The liability recognized in the Consolidated statement of financial position is the present value of these benefits at the end of the reporting period (defined-benefit obligation) less the fair value of plan assets. The defined-benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows using a discount yield curve of highquality corporate bonds with durations matching the terms of the benefits.\n\nPension costs in respect of defined benefit post employment plans primarily represent the increase of the actuarial present value of the obligation for post employment benefits based on employee service during the year. The increase in the defined-benefit obligation due to the passage of time and the expected return on plan assets, using the same interest rate as for the defined-benefit obligation, are included in the pension costs. Interest on the net definedbenefit obligation is recognized in Financing income and expenses in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Past-service costs are recognized immediately in the Personnel costs in the Consolidated statement of income. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity via other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.\n\nWhen a plan is changed, settled or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in the definedbenefit obligation that relates to past-service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognized immediately in the Consolidated statement of income. Signify recognizes gains and losses on the settlement of a defined-benefit plan when the settlement occurs.\n\nSignify presents all net defined-benefit post-employment obligations on one line within noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## Defined-contribution plans\n\nContributions to defined-contribution plans are recognized in the Consolidated income statement in Personnel expenses as incurred.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by Signify before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. Signify recognizes termination benefits when they are demonstrably committed to a termination and when they have a detailed formal plan to terminate the employment of current employees without possibility of withdrawal.\n\n## Other employee benefits\n\nSignify's net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, such as jubilee entitlements. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Remeasurements are recognized in the Consolidated statement of income in the period in which they arise.\n\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis. Signify recognizes a liability and an expense for bonuses and incentives based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to Signify's shareholders after certain adjustments.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash. Bank overdrafts form an integral part of Signify's cash management and often fluctuate from being positive to overdrawn and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.\n\n## Assets held for sale\n\nSignify classifies a non-current asset (or disposal group) as held for sale if the carrying amount is expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use. The asset or disposal group should be available for immediate sale in its present condition, and the sale should be highly probable, evidenced by Signify's commitment to sell the asset or disposal group within one year from classification date. Signify's actions to complete the sale should demonstrate that withdrawal from the plan is unlikely. The assessment of the held for sale criteria requires judgment. Non-current assets held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Comparatives in the balance sheet are not changed when a non-current asset is classified as held-for-sale.\n\n## Hyperinflationary economies\n\nWhen the economy of a country in which Signify operates is deemed hyperinflationary and the functional currency of a Signify entity is the currency of that hyperinflationary economy, the financial statements of such entity are adjusted so that they are stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period. This involves adjustment of historical cost in purchasing power caused by inflation from the date of initial recognition to the balance sheet date. The hyperinflation adjustment is recognized directly in equity. Comparative amounts are not adjusted.\n\n## Equity\n\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of shares are recognized as a deduction from equity. Dividends are recognized as a liability in the period in which they are declared. The income tax consequences of dividends are recognized when a liability to pay the dividend is recognized.\n\nTreasury shares that are reacquired are recognized at cost, representing the market price on the acquisition date, and deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled or reissued. When reissued, shares are removed from treasury shares on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. When treasury shares are delivered under Signify's share plans, the difference between the market price of the shares delivered and the cost is recorded in retained earnings, the market price is recorded in share premium. Upon cancellation, treasury shares are deducted from the share capital at their nominal value of EUR 0.01 per share and retained earnings for the difference.\n\nCosts including dividend withholding tax in connection with Signify's purchase of treasury shares for capital reduction purposes are recorded in retained earnings.\n\n## Share-based compensation expenses\n\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the grant date using an appropriate valuation model.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognized as personnel expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the award. The cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and Signify's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in the statement of profit or loss for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognized as at the beginning and end of that period.\n\nService and non-market performance conditions are not considered when determining the grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of Signify's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market performance conditions are reflected within the grant date fair value.\n\nNo expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or service conditions have not been met. Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.\n\n## Consolidated statement of cash flows\n\nThe Consolidated statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method. Cash flows from derivative instruments that are accounted for as cash flow hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged items. Cash flows from other derivative instruments are classified consistent with the nature of the instrument. Cash flows in foreign currencies have been translated into euros using the exchange rate at the date of the cash flow. Borrowings which are repaid within the quarter, with a maturity of less than three months, are reported on a net basis in cash flows from financing activities.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nSignify presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Signify N.V. by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprises of restricted shares, conditional shares and performance shares granted to employees.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGrants from the government are recognized at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and Signify will comply with all attached conditions. Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognized in the Consolidated statement of income over the period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate.\n\n## 3 Information by segment and main country\n\nOperating segments are components of Signify's business activities about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the Board of Management of Signify). The operating segments are Digital Solutions, Digital Products and Conventional Products. The segments are organized based on the nature of the products and services. \"Other\" represents amounts not allocated to the operating segments and includes certain costs related to central R&D activities to drive innovation as well as group enabling functions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The difference is primarily due to the impact of tax incentives and exempt income and the effect of changes in the liabilities for uncertain tax positions, offset by the impact of non-deductible expenses.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Management's projections support the assumption that it is probable that the results of future operations will generate enough taxable income to utilize these deferred tax assets.\n\nMovement in deferred tax balances during 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n\n|                                                              | Balance  as at  January 1   | Recognized  in income   | Other   | Balance  as at  December 31   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|---------|-------------------------------|\n| 2023                                                         |                             |                         |         |                               |\n| Intangible assets                                            | 131                         | (27)                    | 1       | 106                           |\n| Property, plant and equipment                                | (38)                        | 6                       | 2       | (30)                          |\n| Inventories                                                  | 51                          | 1                       | (2)     | 50                            |\n| Other receivables and assets                                 | 12                          | 5                       | (1)     | 16                            |\n| Post-employment benefits                                     | 51                          | (4)                     | 2       | 49                            |\n| Provisions                                                   | 51                          | (2)                     | (1)     | 48                            |\n| Other liabilities                                            | 70                          | (1)                     | (10)    | 58                            |\n| Tax loss carryforwards (including tax credit  carryforwards) | 66                          | 22                      | (3)     | 85                            |\n| Net deferred tax assets                                      | 393                         | -                       | (11)    | 382                           |\n| 2022                                                         |                             |                         |         |                               |\n| Intangible assets                                            | 169                         | (31)                    | (7)     | 131                           |\n| Property, plant and equipment                                | (32)                        | (11)                    | 5       | (38)                          |\n| Inventories                                                  | 48                          | (1)                     | 4       | 51                            |\n| Other receivables and assets                                 | 15                          | (3)                     | 1       | 12                            |\n| Post-employment benefits                                     | 58                          | (6)                     | (2)     | 51                            |\n| Provisions                                                   | 47                          | -                       | 3       | 51                            |\n| Other liabilities                                            | 75                          | (13)                    | 8       | 70                            |\n| Tax loss carryforwards (including tax credit                 |                             |                         |         |                               |\n| carryforwards)                                               | 73                          | (7)                     | -       | 66                            |\n| Net deferred tax assets                                      | 454                         | (72)                    | 12      | 393                           |\n\n'Other' includes foreign currency translation differences, acquisitions and the impact of the remeasurement of the deferred tax balances relating to post-employment benefits.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the temporary differences associated with investments, including potential income tax consequences on dividends for which no deferred tax liabilities are recognized, aggregate to EUR 270 million (2022: EUR 271 million).",

The Pillar Two model rules aim to ensure that large multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax on the income arising in each jurisdiction where they operate.These Pillar Two model rules have been transposed into Pillar Two legislation that has been enacted or substantively enacted as at December 31, 2023, in certain jurisdictions in which Signify operates.\n\nThe IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 clarifying that IAS 12 applies to income taxes arising from tax law enacted or substantively enacted to implement the OECD/G20 BEPS Pillar Two model\n\nrules. Signify applied the mandatory temporary exception to the requirements of IAS 12, under which a company does not recognize or disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the OECD/G20 BEPS Pillar Two model rules at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe Pillar Two legislation will be effective for Signify's financial year beginning 1 January 2024. Signify is in scope of the legislation and has performed an assessment of Signify's potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes. The assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes is based on prior year country-by-country reporting and IFRS financial data for the constituent entities included in the IFRS financial statements of Signify. Based on the assessment, Signify can apply a transitional safe harbor in most of the jurisdictions it operates. However, there are a limited number of jurisdictions where the transitional safe harbor relief may not apply. Signify does not expect a material exposure to Pillar Two income taxes in future years based on the assessment performed.\n\n## Tax risks\n\nSignify is exposed to tax uncertainties for which, if deemed probable, a liability is recognized in the income tax payable under non-current liabilities, and when tax uncertainties relate to deferred tax assets, these are offset against each other. These uncertainties include, among others, the following:\n\n## Transfer pricing uncertainties\n\nSignify has issued transfer pricing directives, which are in accordance with international guidelines, such as those of the OECD. As transfer pricing has a cross-border effect, potential adjustments by local tax authorities on implemented transfer pricing procedures in a country may have an impact on results in another country. In order to reduce the transfer pricing uncertainties, monitoring procedures are carried out by Group Tax and Internal Audit to safeguard the correct implementation of the transfer pricing directives.\n\n## Tax uncertainties on general and specific service agreements and licensing agreements\n\nDue to the centralization of certain activities in a limited number of countries (such as research and development, IT, group functions and head office), costs are also centralized. Consequently, these costs and/or revenues must be allocated to the beneficiaries, i.e. the various Signify entities. This could lead to discussions with local tax authorities if they do not accept these charges. For that purpose, service contracts such as intra-group service agreements and licensing agreements are signed with Signify group entities. Tax authorities review these intra-group service and licensing agreements and may reject the implemented intra-group charges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<\n\n\u2261\n\n>",

        "page_content": "## Tax uncertainties due to permanent establishments\n\nSignify may encounter tax uncertainties because of potential permanent establishments in countries where new operations are started or business models are altered. This could happen when operations in a country involve a foreign Signify organization. There is a risk that tax claims could arise on these operations in both countries.\n\nWhen Signify has cross-border operations, there is a risk that tax claims will arise in all relevant countries.\n\nAssessing the amount of tax liabilities for these tax uncertainties is highly judgmental and the timing of possible outflows, if any, is uncertain. Signify has considered the merits of its filing position in its overall evaluation of potential tax liabilities and believes it has adequate tax liabilities recorded in its Consolidated financial statements for exposures on these matters. Based on its evaluation of the potential tax liabilities and the merits of Signify's filing positions, it is unlikely that potential tax exposures over the amounts currently recorded as liabilities in its Consolidated financial statements will be material to its financial condition or future results of operations.\n\nTax uncertainties also include exposures with a risk assessment which are deemed lower than probable, but possible. The best estimate of the maximum amount in connection with these uncertainties is EUR 57 million. Signify believes that in connection with these uncertainties it is probable that no additional taxes will be due. Therefore, no income tax payable is recognized.\n\n## 10 Earnings per share\n\n|                                                                                                                       | 2022        | 2023        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Net income attributable to shareholders of Signify N.V.                                                               | 523         | 203         |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding  (after deduction of treasury shares) during the year          | 125,004,312 | 125,950,998 |\n| Plus incremental shares assumed from conversions of:                                                                  |             |             |\n| \u00b7 Performance shares                                                                                                  | 1,904,807   | 791,331     |\n| \u00b7 Conditional shares                                                                                                  | 599,885     | 545,112     |\n| \u00b7 Restricted shares                                                                                                   | 87,966      | 50,288      |\n| Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares  outstanding (after deduction of treasury shares) during the  year | 127,596,971 | 127,337,729 |\n| in EUR                                                                                                                |             |             |\n| \u00b7 Basic                                                                                                               | 4.18        | 1.61        |\n| \u00b7 Diluted                                                                                                             | 4.10        | 1.59        |\n\n## 11 Acquisitions and divestments\n\nSignify completed one acquisition in 2023.\n\n## Acquisition of ILC Intelligent Lighting Controls\n\nOn March 1, 2023, Signify completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity of ILC Intelligent Lighting Controls, Inc. (ILC), a market-leading U.S. manufacturer of wired control systems, expanding its connected portfolio. ILC is consolidated as part of Cooper Lighting Solutions within Digital Solutions. The acquisition is considered not material to the Consolidated financial statements.

        "page_content": "## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill as of December 31, 2023, was EUR 2,755 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, a translation difference of EUR 100 million was mainly due to the change in the USD/EUR rate, which impacted the goodwill denominated in USD. The acquisition in goodwill relates to the Intelligent Lighting Controls, Inc. (ILC) acquisition, recognized in Digital Solutions, and the final purchase price adjustments for Fluence. Refer to note 11, Acquisitions for details.\n\nFor impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units, which represent the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored internally for management purposes. The cashgenerating units correspond to the operating segments.\n\nGoodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit Digital Solutions is considered to be significant in comparison to the total book value of goodwill of Signify at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2023. The goodwill allocated to each of the cash-generating units as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2023, is presented below.\n\n|                       | 2022   | 2023   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Digital Solutions     | 2,482  | 2,387  |\n| Digital Products      | 317    | 307    |\n| Conventional Products | 63     | 61     |\n| Book value            | 2,861  | 2,755  |\n\nThe basis of the recoverable amount used of the cash-generating units is the value in use. In the annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2023, the estimated recoverable amount of the tested cash-generating units exceeded the carrying value of the units. Therefore, no impairment loss was recognized.\n\nKey assumptions used in the impairment tests for the units were sales growth rates, EBITA and the rates used for discounting the projected cash flows. These cash flow projections cover an initial period with specific estimates from 2024 to 2026. Projections were extrapolated with declining growth rates for a period of five years, after which a terminal value was calculated. The sales growth rates and EBITA used to estimate cash flows are based on past performance, external market growth assumptions, taking into account current market conditions, and industry long-term growth averages. The applied discount rates are determined based on the weighted average cost of capital which reflects the risks relevant to the cash-generating units.\n\nCash flow projections for the impairment tests in 2023 and 2022 were based on the key assumptions included in the table below:\n\n## Key assumptions in %\n\n|                        | Compound sales growth rate  1   | Compound sales growth rate  1      | Compound sales growth rate  1   |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                        | Extra polation  period          | Used to  calculate  terminal value | Pre-tax  discount rates         |\n| Digital Solutions 2023 | 2.4%                            | 0.5%                               | 11.8%                           |\n| Digital Solutions 2022 | 2.8%                            | 0.3%                               | 11.6%                           |\n\nThe company has taken into account the current macroeconomic environment and assumed a lower growth expectation in the 2023 impairment test. In addition, Signify performed a sensitivity analysis and noted that a reasonably possible change in key assumptions will not result in an impairment.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nThe additions for 2023 contain internally generated assets of EUR 49 million for product development and EUR 15 million for software. In 2023, acquired other intangible assets are Technology of EUR 4 million, customer relationships of EUR 1 million and brand names of EUR 1 million which relates to Intelligent Lighting Controls, Inc. (ILC) acquisition in Q1 2023.\n\nThe capitalized product development costs and software, for which amortization has not yet commenced, amounted to EUR 62 million as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: EUR 50 million).\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of the customer relationships originating from the Cooper Lighting acquisition in 2023 was EUR 249 million (USD 276 million) with a remaining amortization period of 16.8 years (2022: EUR 276 million, USD 294 million; 17.8 years).\n\n<!-- image -->",

During that period, Signify has opened, discontinued and acquired many manufacturing plants and sites. Some of these plants and sites have been used for industrial purposes for decades and as such, there is a latent risk that these premises may have environmental conditions that require corrective actions as a result of such use. The environmental provisions include accrued costs recorded with respect to environmental remediation in various countries. Provisions for environmental remediation can change significantly due to the emergence of additional information regarding the extent or nature of the contamination, the need to utilize alternative technologies, actions by regulatory authorities as well as changes in judgments and discount rates. The environmental provision is expected to be utilized mainly within the next five years.\n\n## Product warranty\n\nManufacturing of Signify's products involves complex processes and defects might occur. In addition, it is possible that some of Signify's products may not perform as expected (for example, in terms of estimated life span and projected energy savings). These defects or shortfalls may cause Signify to incur significant warranty, support and replacement costs. The provision for product warranty reflects the estimated costs of replacement and free-of-charge services that will be incurred by Signify with respect to products sold. Signify expects the provision will be mainly utilized within the next two years.\n\n## Legal\n\nSignify and certain of its group companies are involved in legal proceedings and claims relating to various matters including commercial transactions, alleged intellectual property infringement and product liability claims for property damage and personal injury, alleged to have been caused by failure or malfunction of Signify products. The outcome of asserted claims and proceedings, or the impact of any claims that may be asserted in the future, cannot be predicted with certainty. Signify makes a provision if payment with respect to a particular matter is probable and the amount can be estimated reliably. Signify expects the provision will be mainly utilized within the next three years. Releases from legal provisions were mainly related to the legal case as described below.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "On October 5, 2022, a jury in trial court in Connecticut awarded compensation of USD 90 million in a lawsuit against Signify relating to a workplace accident that occurred in September 2017 in a warehouse leased and operated by a Signify customer, where the customer's employee was injured when struck by a pallet of Signify products that was pushed off a storage rack by a temporary worker operating a forklift at the warehouse.\n\nIn Q1 2023, Signify filed post-trial motions with the trial court challenging the jury award. On April 26, 2023,the trial judge, issued an order reducing the jury's award to approximately USD 42 million. Signify has comprehensive global liability insurance and has confirmation that the case is fully covered without reservations of rights, including interest and other cost. Both the legal provision and the insurance cover asset have been adjusted in the balance sheet as per year end without any net P&L impact. Signify continues to exercise all its rights to appeal the verdict issued in this case. To that effect, Signify has filed its notice of appeal with the appropriate Connecticut Appellate court to contest its liability this claim.\n\n## Other\n\nOther provisions mainly comprise of provisions for onerous contracts, other taxes, selfinsurance, decommissioning and provision for employee jubilee funds. Other provisions are expected to be utilized mainly within the next five years.\n\n## 25 Post-employment benefits\n\nPost-employment benefits covered in this note relate to defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, including defined-benefit retiree medical plans. The benefits provided by these plans are based on employees' years of service and compensation levels. Employee post-employment defined-benefit plans have been established in several countries in accordance with the legal requirements, customs and local practice.\n\n## Net defined-benefit liabilities per country\n\n|                 | 2022       | 2022         | 2022           | 2023       | 2023         | 2023           |\n|-----------------|------------|--------------|----------------|------------|--------------|----------------|\n|                 | Obligation | Plan  assets | Net  Liability | Obligation | Plan  assets | Net  Liability |\n| Unites States   | 459        | (351)        | 108            | 420        | (323)        | 97             |\n| Germany         | 170        | (15)         | 155            | 169        | (15)         | 154            |\n| Other countries | 112        | (48)         | 64             | 116        | (45)         | 71             |\n| Total countries | 741        | (414)        | 327            | 705        | (383)        | 322            |\n\n## United States\n\nThe defined-benefit Hourly & Salaried Pension Plan in the US covers certain hourly workers and salaried workers hired before January 1, 2005 and has a net liability of EUR 43 million. The plan is\n\nclosed for new entrants and since 2016 no further benefit accruals are taking place. Employees only accrue benefits in a defined-contribution plan. Signify pays the administration cost and contributions to cover the funding deficit of the Hourly & Salaried Pension Plan. The plan assets are governed by an Investment Committee. Signify also has an unfunded pension plan in place for higher salaried employees with a net liability of EUR 15 million and a post-retirement welfare plan with a net liability of EUR 38 million.\n\nSignify reviewed the funding level of the Hourly & Salaried Pension Plan and decided to make a contribution in 2023 of EUR 5 million. Signify decided to initiate a plan termination with the intention to settle the plan liabilities in 2024 with an insurance company. This will mean that any difference between the costs of settling the plan liabilities and the plan assets will need to be funded by Signify. The financial impact on this transaction will only be known at the end of 2024 when Signify is expected to complete the buy out.\n\nSignify expects cash outflows of EUR 7 million in 2024 for the unfunded plans.\n\nFor the funding of the deficit of the US Hourly & Salaried Pension Plan, Signify adheres to the minimum funding requirements of the US Pension Protection Act.\n\n## Germany\n\nFor employees with a salary above a certain salary threshold, there is a funded defined-benefit pension plan which has a deficit of EUR 4 million. This plan has been closed for new entrants since January 1, 2018. Since 2016, Signify no longer makes any contributions to this plan but funds the liabilities when these are paid out to retirees. New employees accrue pension benefits through a defined-contribution plan. For other closed defined-benefit plans, Signify had an unfunded liability of EUR 150 million as at December 31, 2023. Signify expects cash outflows of EUR 17 million in 2024 for the pension plans.\n\nCash outflows for the defined-benefit plans in countries other than the USA and Germany are expected to total EUR 12 million in 2024.\n\n## Risks related to defined-benefit plans\n\nThe defined-benefit plans expose Signify to various demographic and economic risks, such as longevity, investment, currency and interest rate risks and, in some cases, inflation risk. The latter plays a role in the assumed wage increase and in some plans with pension indexation.\n\nThe larger plans are governed by either independent boards, committees or trustees who have a legal obligation to evenly balance the interests of all stakeholders and operate under the local regulatory frameworks. These bodies are responsible for and have full discretion over the investment strategy of the plan assets, in general they manage pension fund risks by diversifying the investments of plan assets and by (partially) matching interest rate risk of liabilities.\n\nSignify has an active de-risking strategy in which it constantly looks for opportunities to reduce the risks associated with its defined-benefit plans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<\n\n\u2261\n\n>",

        "page_content": "During 2023, US interest rates dropped by some 20 bps and this has been reflected in lower discount rates. For the Eurozone, the interest rates were some 50 bps lower at 31 December than the year before. As such, the unfunded defined benefit plans in the US and the German plans experienced the losses on the financial assumptions. For the funded plan in the US, this was offset by the effect of the interest rate hedge gains.\n\n## Plan assets allocation\n\nThe asset allocation in Signify's pension plans at December 31 was as follows:\n\n|                   |   2022 | 2023   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|\n| Debt securities   |    310 | 323    |\n| Equity securities |     38 | -      |\n| Other             |     67 | 60     |\n| Total assets      |    415 | 383    |\n\nThe assets in 2023 contained 16% unquoted assets. Plan assets in 2023 do not include property occupied by or financial instruments issued by Signify.\n\nSome 84% of the total plan assets of the Signify pension plan are in the US and are invested in a well-diversified portfolio. In anticipation of the earlier mentioned intended settlement of the pension plan, the equity portfolio was sold and all assets at year-end are in the fixed income portfolio with the interest rate sensitivity of this portfolio closely aligned to that of the plan's pension liabilities. The remaining 16% of the total plan assets is mainly the market value of insured pension benefits.\n\n## Assumptions\n\nThe mortality tables used for Signify's major schemes are:\n\n- \u00b7 US: Base table PRI-2012 White Collar mortality table, projected forward with future mortality improvements according to Scale MP-2021.\n- \u00b7 Germany: Richttafeln 2018 G K. Heubeck.\n\nThe weighted averages of the assumptions used to calculate the defined-benefit obligation as of December 31, 2023, were as follows:\n\n|                           | 2022   | 2023   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Discount rate             | 4.8%   | 4.7%   |\n| Pension cost increases    | 0.5%   | 0.5%   |\n| Healthcare cost increases | 0.5%   | 0.5%   |\n| Wage increases            | 1.1%   | 1.1%   |\n\nThe average duration of the defined-benefit obligation of the defined-benefit plans is 7.7 years.\n\nFor the defined-benefit plans in the US and Germany, the average duration is respectively 7.6 years and 7.1 years. The average discount rates for the plans in these countries are respectively 4.77% and 3.24%. The pension cost increase rate assumption for the German defined-benefit plans is 2.25%.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe table below illustrates the approximate impact on the defined-benefit obligation if Signify were to change key assumptions. The defined-benefit obligation was recalculated using a change of 1% in the respective assumptions which overall is considered a reasonably possible change. The impact on the defined-benefit obligation of changes in discount rate is for funded plans normally accompanied by offsetting movements in plan assets, especially when using matching strategies.\n\n|                                         | 2022   | 2023   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Increase                                |        |        |\n| Discount rate (1% movement)             | (52)   | (51)   |\n| Wage change (1% movement)               | 5      | 2      |\n| Pension indexation change (1% movement) | 10     | 9      |\n| Longevity (see explanation)             | 20     | 23     |\n| Healthcare cost change (1% movement)    | 5      | 5      |\n| Decrease                                |        |        |\n| Discount rate (1% movement)             | 65     | 59     |\n| Wage change (1% movement)               | (3)    | (5)    |\n| Pension indexation change (1% movement) | (8)    | (8)    |\n| Longevity (see explanation)             | (28)   | (23)   |\n| Healthcare cost change (1% movement)    | (4)    | (4)    |\n\nLongevity also impacts the post-employment defined-benefit obligation which is illustrated in the above sensitivity table for the impact of a 10% increase and a 10% decrease in the assumed rates of mortality for Signify's major schemes. A 10% decrease in assumed mortality rates equals improvement of life expectancy by six months to a year. Vice versa, an increase in the assumed mortality rates equals reduction of life expectancy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Conditional shares have a three-year cliff vesting period and will vest if a grantee is still employed with Signify at the vesting date.\n\nVesting of performance shares is conditional on the achievement of performance conditions measured over a period of three years. The performance condition measurement is based on four measures, each one of them with an equal weight of 25% of the shares:\n\n- \u00b7 Total shareholder return;\n- \u00b7 Free cash flow;\n- \u00b7 Sustainability;\n- \u00b7 Return on capital employed.\n\nFor the Board of Management and certain members of senior management, the LTI Plan consists of performance shares only. Shares are conditionally granted annually.\n\nIn addition to shares awarded under the Signify LTI Plan, Signify may in individual cases, such as in the hiring process of members of (senior-) management, also grant restricted shares. Restricted shares have either three-year cliff vesting period or vest gradually over the vesting period of one, two or three years.\n\nUnder the terms of the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), employees are eligible to purchase a limited number of Signify shares at discounted prices through payroll withholdings.\n\n## Performance shares\n\nThe fair value of shares granted with the market performance condition of relative TSR is measured based on Monte Carlo simulation. The closing share price at grant date is adjusted for the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period, as participants are not compensated for Signify dividend payouts. Monte Carlo simulation takes into account market conditions expected to impact relative Total Shareholders' Return performance in relation to selected peers and the following weighted-average assumptions:\n\nAssumptions used in Monte-Carlo simulation for valuation in %\n\n|                                 | 2023   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|\n| Risk-free interest rate         | 2.5%   |\n| Expected share price volatility | 37%    |\n\nThe assumptions were used for these calculations only and do not necessarily represent an indication of Signify management's expectation of future developments for other purposes. Historic volatility was measured over the same timeframe as the simulation period (weighted average 2.6 years).\n\nThe amount calculated as an expense for TSR shares is not adjusted for actual performance.\n\nFCF, Sustainability, and ROCE related measurements are non-market performance conditions. Fair value of shares granted under FCF, Sustainability, and ROCE objective conditions equals the closing share price on the grant date, adjusted for the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period.\n\nThe amount calculated as an expense for shares granted with a non-market performance condition is adjusted for actual performance.\n\nA summary of Signify performance shares movements and outstanding balance is presented below.\n\n## Signify performance shares\n\n|                           | 2022        | 2022                                      | 2023      | 2023                                      |\n|---------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------|\n| EUR-denominated           | Shares      | Weighted  average  grant-date  fair value | Shares    | Weighted  average  grant-date  fair value |\n| Balance as at January 1   | 3,085,771   | 24.51                                     | 1,525,305 | 24.83                                     |\n| Granted                   | 657,031     | 35.24                                     | 829,170   | 20.94                                     |\n| Vested                    | (1,188,103) | 24.14                                     | (995,035) | 15.97                                     |\n| Forfeited                 | (112,046)   | 32.10                                     | (206,024) | 35.56                                     |\n| Performance adjustment    | (917,348)   | 31.22                                     | (479,314) | 25.06                                     |\n| Balance as at December 31 | 1,525,305   | 24.83                                     | 674,102   | 29.68                                     |\n\nThe performance adjustment originates from updates in the number of shares which are expected to vest in relation to the mentioned non-market performance conditions.\n\nOn December 31, 2023, estimated unrecognized costs related to non-vested performance shares amounted to EUR 12 million.

        "page_content": "The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined by Signify using available market information and appropriate valuation methods. The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will ultimately be realized by Signify upon maturity or disposal. The use of market assumptions and/or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.\n\nThe following hierarchy is applied to classify the financial assets and liabilities:\n\n## Level 1\n\nInstruments included in Level 1 are comprised primarily of listed Eurobonds classified as financial liabilities at amortized cost. The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.\n\n## Level 2\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, overthe-counter derivatives) are determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 2.\n\nThe fair value of derivatives is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable interest yield curves, basis spread and foreign exchange rates. For further details, refer to note 2, Material accounting policies.\n\n## Level 3\n\nIf one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.\n\nThis applies for Derivative financial assets not designated as hedging instruments, which mainly relate to Signify's participations in Virtual Power Purchase Agreements. These contracts are accounted for as financial instruments (FVTPL) under IFRS 9 and valued by an external valuator on a quarterly basis. The fair value is calculated as the net forecasted cash inflows or outflows discounted to the present value. The unrealized loss in fair value of EUR 22 million (2022: EUR 26 million gain) is recorded in financial income or expense (note 8). Unobservable input data is the volume of generated wind power and the price curves of the respective electricity market.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk of the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuating because of changes in the market interest rates. Financial instruments included in the debt position create an inherent interest rate risk. Failure to effectively hedge this risk could negatively impact financial results.\n\nSignify monitors interest rate coverage, short-term and long-term interest rate developments and has the flexibility to opt for different short-term interest periods for the variable debt instruments at roll-over dates and/or could enter into derivative financial instruments to fix interest rates for a certain period of time. As of December 31, 2023, Signify had a ratio of fixedrate debt to total outstanding debt of approximately 68% (2022: 75%).\n\nA sensitivity analysis conducted at reporting date shows that if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by 1% from their level of December 31, 2023, with all other variables held constant, the annualized net interest expense would decrease by EUR 6 million. This impact was based on the outstanding net floating debt position as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.\n\nLiquidity risk for Signify is monitored through the Treasury Risk Committee which tracks the development of the actual cash flow position and uses input from a number of sources in order to forecast the overall liquidity position.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.

Signify pools cash from subsidiaries to the extent legally and economically feasible; cash not pooled remains available for operational or investment needs. The table below shows details of cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts as of the reporting date:\n\n|                                               | 2022   | 2023   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Cash at banks and in hand                     | 425    | 358    |\n| Short-term deposits                           | 216    | 768    |\n| Other cash equivalents                        | 35     | 33     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                     | 677    | 1,158  |\n| Bank overdrafts                               | (1)    | -      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts | 676    | 1,158  |\n\nSignify has a EUR 500 million revolving credit facility that can be used for general purposes. As of December 31, 2023, Signify did not have any amounts drawn under this facility.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nCurrency risk is the risk that reported financial performance, or the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument, will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Signify operates in many countries and currencies and therefore currency fluctuations may inevitably impact its financial results. Signify is exposed to currency risk in the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Transaction exposures related to anticipated sales and purchases and on-balance-sheet receivables/payables resulting from such transactions;\n- \u00b7 Financing exposure arising from foreign currency intercompany and external debt and deposits;\n- \u00b7 Translation exposure of net income in foreign entities;\n- \u00b7 Translation exposure of foreign currency denominated equity invested in consolidated companies;\n- \u00b7 Translation exposure to equity interests in non-functional-currency investments in associates and financial assets at fair value.\n\nIt is Signify's policy to reduce the volatility caused by foreign currency movements on its net earnings by hedging the anticipated net exposure of foreign currencies resulting from foreign currency sales and purchases. In general, net anticipated exposures are hedged during a period of 9 months in layers of 25% up to a hedge ratio of 75%, using derivatives.\n\nSignify's policy requires significant committed foreign currency exposures to be fully hedged, generally using forwards. However, not every foreign currency can or shall be hedged as there may be regulatory barriers or prohibitive hedging cost preventing Signify from effectively and/or efficiently hedging its currency exposures. As a result, hedging activities cannot and will not eliminate all currency risks for anticipated and committed transaction exposures.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The result deferred in equity will be released to earnings mostly during 2024 at the time when the related hedged transaction affects the Consolidated statement of income. During 2023, EUR nil million (2022: EUR nil million) was recorded within cost of goods sold in the Consolidated statement of income as a result of ineffectiveness on certain anticipated cash flow hedges.\n\nThe total net fair value of hedges related to transaction exposure as of December 31, 2023, was an unrealized liability of EUR 1 million (2022: liability EUR 14 million). An instantaneous 10% increase in the value of euro against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would lead to a decrease of EUR 19 million in the value of the derivatives. The above sensitivity analysis includes a gain of EUR 1 million that would impact the income statement, which would partially offset the opposite revaluation effect on the underlying accounts receivable and payable, and the remaining loss of EUR 20 million would be recognized in equity to the extent that the cash flow hedges were effective.\n\nForeign exchange exposure also arises from intercompany loans and deposits. Where Signify enters into such arrangements the financing is generally provided in the functional currency of the subsidiary. The currency of Signify's external funding and liquid assets is matched with the required financing of subsidiaries either directly through external foreign currency loans and deposits or synthetically by using foreign exchange derivatives. In certain cases, where Signify\n\nsubsidiaries may also have external foreign currency debt or liquid assets, these exposures are also hedged using foreign exchange derivatives. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of these hedges was an unrealized liability of EUR 2 million (2022: asset EUR 6 million). An instantaneous 10% increase in the value of euro against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would lead to a decrease of EUR 41 million in the value of the derivatives.\n\nTranslation exposure of foreign-currency equity invested in consolidated entities is generally not hedged. However, if a hedge is entered into, it is accounted for as a net investment hedge. During 2023, net investment hedges consisting of foreign currency forward contracts with nominal amount of USD 250 million matured. These hedges partially mitigated foreign currency translation risk arising from the net assets of USD functional currency subsidiaries. These hedges were fully effective, as such there was no ineffectiveness recognized in profit and loss in 2023. As at December 31, 2023, no net investment hedges were outstanding (2022: nil). Signify may enter into further net investment hedges to partially offset these risks in the future.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nCommodity price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in commodity prices.\n\nSignify is a purchaser of certain base metals, precious metals and energy. Signify could hedge certain commodity price risks using derivative instruments to minimize significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility. As of December 31, 2023, Signify had EUR 22 million of commodity derivatives recognized in the Statement of financial position (2022: EUR 44 million),which relate to Virtual Power Purchase Agreements. An increase of the energy prices by 10% will lead to the commodity derivatives value increase by EUR 7 million (2022: EUR 9 million).\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date, if counterparties failed completely to perform their payment obligations as contracted. Credit risk is present within Signify trade and other receivables and contract assets. To have better insights into the credit exposures, Signify performs ongoing evaluations of the financial and non-financial condition of its customers and adjusts credit limits when appropriate. In instances where the creditworthiness of a customer is determined not to be sufficient to grant the credit limit required, there are a number of mitigation tools that can be utilized to close the gap, including reducing payment terms, cash on delivery, prepayments and pledges on assets.\n\nSignify invests available cash and cash equivalents and enters into financial derivative instruments with various financial institutions and is exposed to credit risk with these counterparties. Signify does not enter into any financial derivative instruments to protect against default by financial institutions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Signify also regularly monitors the development of the credit risk of its financial counterparties.\n\nSignify minimizes this risk by limiting the deposits made with any single bank and by making deposits, the majority of which is with banks that have strong credit ratings.\n\nMaximum credit risk exposure for Signify equals carrying amounts of all financial assets recognized in the Statement of financial position plus off-balance sheet guarantees provided.\n\n## Country risk\n\nCountry risk is the risk that political, legal, or economic developments in a single country could adversely impact our performance. The country risk per country is defined as the sum of the equity of all subsidiaries and associated companies in country cross-border transactions, such as intercompany loans, accounts receivable from third parties and intercompany accounts receivable.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Signify had country risk exposure of EUR 2.7 billion in the United States and EUR 1.3 billion in the Netherlands. Countries where the risk exceeds EUR 200 million but was less than EUR 500 million are Belgium (EUR 477 million), China including Hong Kong (EUR 446 million), Poland (EUR 388 million) and France (EUR 271 million).

It includes references to our human rights policy commitments relevant to value chain workers, specific activities we are running to manage actual and potential impact as well as our general approach to negative impact and remedies [S2.1 (17, 17a), S2.2 (22, 22a-b), S2.3 (27a, 27c, 27d, 28)]. We have tailored channels and programs in place and monitor their effectiveness [S2.4 (32c)].\n\nBased on the impact assessed, we have defined actions and programs, including the Tritium and Audit Programs, training and\n\ndevelopment of key suppliers and Signify Conflict Minerals program. These activities and our aims for continued improvement are further defined in the sections Responsible supply chain and Responsible mineral sourcing under 4.3.3 Human Rights [S2.4 (33a, AR22a, AR28)]. Regarding specific human rights abuses from the extractive sector, 4.3.3 Human rights, Responsible Mineral Sourcing details our Forced Labor program and how we follow the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. The full description of our due diligence process and Signify's position on Conflict Minerals is available on our website [SBM3 (11b)].\n\n## Business conduct (G1)\n\nWhile business conduct is not part of the most material topics for 2023, it remains a key strategic topic for Signify against which we are committed to voluntarily report on. 4.3.5 Business ethics specifically outlines our approach and commitments to business ethics which includes references to existing mechanisms for identifying, reporting and investigating concerns in contradictions to our Code of Conduct, as well as trainings and procedures to prevent, detect and address incidents of corruption and bribery [G1.1 (10a, 10e, 10g), G1.3 (18a)].\n\nRegarding our supply-side contractual partners, we provide details on the social and environmental criteria used for selection processes in 4.3.3 Human Rights [G1.2 (15b)]. Concerning Signify political engagement and contributions, we provide details in the Sustainability supplements 2023 [G1.5 (29bd)].\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 17.2 EU Taxonomy\n\nThe European Commission has established the EU Taxonomy as an important enabler to scale up sustainable investments and make the EU carbon neutral by 2050. At Signify, we want to be a catalyst for change, and are committed to doubling our positive impact on the environment and society. We continuously seek opportunities to increase our portfolio of products and solutions to contribute to a more sustainable future.\n\nProof of this is the evolution of the percentage of LED-based revenues over the last 10 years, from just 29% in 2013 to 85% in 2023. This transition has moved us away from being a company based on conventional lighting ,a low energy-efficient technology, to become a LED company. This shift has been made possible, among other things, by continued investment in R&D dedicated to sustainable innovation. In 2023, we invested EUR 271 million in sustainable innovation, representing 88% of Signify's R&D expenditure.\n\nSimilarly, in order to achieve lighting products, systems and services that maximize (re)usability, serviceability and upgradeability and minimize value destruction with the aim of preserving value and avoiding waste, we developed the circular revenue objective. The goal is to ensure that 32% of total revenues by the end of 2025 come from products internally identified as circular (for more information, see section 4.2 Sustainable innovation). In addition, in 2023, Signify launched a refurbishment service as part of the professional portfolio with the ambition of expanding it in the coming years.\n\n## The EU Taxonomy reporting framework\n\nThe European Commission has developed a catalog of economic activities to determine if they substantially contribute towards a sustainable economy based on criteria known as the EU Taxonomy. Companies must use this classification system to assess if their business activities are sustainable. For its financial year 2023, Signify discloses eligibility and alignment on the first two environmental objectives (Climate Change Mitigation and Climate Change Adaptation) and also eligibility for the remaining four objectives (Water and Marine Resources, Transition to a Circular Economy, Pollution Prevention and Control and Biodiversity and Ecosystems).\n\n## Signify's economic activities\n\nThe definitions of the Taxonomy are broadly formulated which leaves room for companies to interpret it for their business activities. We applied judgment, interpretations and assumptions based on currently available information. Future guidance could result in more accurate definitions and other reporting obligations, which could impact our future Taxonomy reporting.\n\nThe analysis of Signify's economic activities in the context of the EU Taxonomy has revealed the following lighting activities that contribute to the environmental objectives:\n\n## Climate Change Mitigation\n\n- \u00b7 3.5 Manufacture of energy efficiency equipment for buildings. We allocate manufacturing of LED and Connected technologies for Indoor spaces to this economic activity;\n- \u00b7 3.6 Manufacture other low-carbon technologies that result in substantial GHG emission reductions in other sectors of the economy. We allocate manufacturing of LED and Connected technologies for Outdoor spaces to this economic activity;\n- \u00b7 7.3 Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment. We allocate installation, maintenance and repair activities of lighting products such as lamps and luminaires, without controls, for indoor spaces to this economic activity;\n- \u00b7 7.5 Installation, maintenance and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulation and controlling energy performance of buildings. We allocate installation, maintenance and repair activities of lighting systems, such as luminaires with control modules, for indoor spaces to this economic activity. The system might also include sensors, triggers, software, on-site or cloud connectivity.\n\n## Transition to a Circular Economy\n\n- \u00b7 1.2 Manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment. We allocate here manufacturing of electrical and electronic equipment and their related activities, mostly related to lighting, including LED technology and also conventional lighting;\n- \u00b7 5.1 Repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing. We allocate services offered to customers to repair, refurbish or remanufacture lighting products and related items;\n- \u00b7 5.2 Sale of spare parts. We allocate manufacturing of components aimed to replace an existing part of a final products;\n- \u00b7 5.5 Product-as-a-service and other circular use and result-oriented service models. We allocate products and related\n\nservices that are marketed under a 'Light as a service' and other pay-per-use business models.\n\nThe analysis has not revealed any activities that contribute to the four other environmental objectives namely; climate change adaptation, water and marine resources, pollution prevention and control and biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\n## Signify's 2023 assessment\n\nThe EU Taxonomy defines Turnover, Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operating Expenditure (OpEx) as the key performance indicators that must be reported on. The financial figures relevant for Signify's EU Taxonomy reporting are based on the IFRS consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2023. Allocation formulas have been used for CapEx and OpEx. If possible, figures have been directly assigned to an economic activity.\n\nTo prevent double counting on eligibility towards the Transition to a Circular Economy and Climate Change Mitigation objectives, we have allocated respectively, the Turnover, CapEx and Opex that are contributing to both objectives to Climate Change Mitigation. By adopting this approach, we can ensure that none of the economic values are counted twice.\n\nOur data collection processes have been improved in 2023, allowing more granularity on the mapping of aligned products.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The following list sets out Signify's Taxonomyeligible turnover, contributing to the following environmental objectives:\n\n## Climate Change Mitigation:\n\n- \u00b7 Turnover of the manufacturing of LED and Connected technologies, for Indoor spaces (3.5) and Outdoor spaces (3.6);\n- \u00b7 Turnover of the installation, maintenance, and repair of energy-efficient lighting, without controls (7.3) and with control modules (7.5).\n\n## Transition to a Circular Economy\n\n- \u00b7 Turnover of the manufacturing of electrical and electronic products (1.2 and 5.5), components (5.2), and related activities (5.1).\n\nThis resulted in EUR 6,704 million of Taxonomy-eligible turnover (A.1+A.2, see graph) in 2023. Of the Taxonomy-eligible turnover, EUR 571 million met the screening criteria used to measure the substantial contribution to the environmental objectives (A.1). This includes our products in the highest two populated classes of energy efficiency in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1369; automation and controls systems and sensors; outdoor luminaires aimed at demonstrating substantial life-cycle GHG emission savings quantified by an external third party with verification due in 2024; and the installation, maintenance and repair of energy-efficient light sources and lighting control systems.

For product groups that are incomplete or misleading in EPREL, we looked at our portfolio's energy labels distribution. As a conclusion, Signify defines the highest two populated classes as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 A & B classes for lamps and consumer luminaires;\n- \u00b7 C & D classes (on luminaire level) for professional indoor luminaires;\n- \u00b7 C & D classes for color controllable lamps.\n\n## CapEx\n\nThe Taxonomy-eligible CapEx is defined as the capital expenditure:\n\n- \u00b7 Related to assets or processes that are associated with Taxonomy-eligible economic activities;\n- \u00b7 Part of a plan to expand Taxonomy-eligible economic activities or to allow Taxonomy-\n- igible economic activities to become Taxonomy-aligned;\n- \u00b7 Related to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-eligible economic activities and individual measures.\n\nThe following list sets out Signify's Taxonomyeligible CapEx contributing to the environmental objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate Change Mitigation: CapEx related the manufacturing of LED and Connected technologies, for Indoor spaces (3.5) and Outdoor spaces (3.6), and the annual turnover of the installation, maintenance and repair of energy-efficient lighting, without controls (7.3) and with control modules (7.5);\n- \u00b7 Transition to a Circular Economy: CapEx related the manufacturing of electrical and electronic products (1.2 and 5.5), components (5.2), and related activities (5.1);\n- \u00b7 CapEx that is part of a plan (CapEx plan) to expand these Taxonomy-eligible economic activities, or expenditures that will allow Taxonomy-eligible activities to become Taxonomy-aligned (i.e. new production lines and extension of production capacity of LED, connected technologies and product refurbishment);\n- \u00b7 CapEx related to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-eligible economic activities and individual measures (i.e. freight vehicles and company cars acquired or taken as a lease, lease contracts for new or renovated buildings, energy efficiency improvement measures in buildings, purchase of energy-efficient equipment for buildings, solar panels installation, maintenance and repair, and data processing, hosting and related activities).\n\nOf the Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures of EUR 180 million (A.1+A.2), Signify used the Taxonomy-aligned turnover proportion per business unit as allocation formula to calculate the Taxonomy-aligned CapEx of EUR 15.5 million (A.1).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal Taxonomy-eligible CapEx (A.1+A.2)\n\nTotal Taxonomy-eligible CapEx (A.1)\n\n## OpEx\n\nThe Taxonomy-eligible OpEx is defined as the operational expenditures:\n\n- \u00b7 Related to assets or processes that are associated with Taxonomy-eligible economic activities;\n- \u00b7 Part of a plan to expand Taxonomy-eligible economic activities or to allow Taxonomyeligible economic activities to become Taxonomy-aligned;\n- \u00b7 Related to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-eligible economic activities and individual measures.\n\nThe following list sets out Signify's Taxonomyeligible operational expenditures, contributing to the environmental objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate Change Mitigation: OpEx related the manufacturing of LED and Connected technologies, for Indoor spaces (3.5) and Outdoor spaces (3.6), and the annual revenue of the installation, maintenance\n\n<!-- image -->",

To conduct that assessment, we have gathered information about our measurements, processes and policies for each of the DNSH criteria covering the economic activities 3.5, 3.6, 7.3 and 7.5. The assessment confirmed that we meet the requirements of the DNSH criteria.\n\n## DNSH to Climate Change Adaptation\n\nWe performed a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to identify potential physical and transition risks in our value chain (upstream and downstream). Regarding the physical risks, we have analyzed all the climaterelated hazards listed in appendix A from Annex 1 of the EU Taxonomy and focused on assessing physical risks relevant to Signify's\n\nmanufacturing sites, warehouses and distribution centers, namely riverine flooding, coastal flooding, drought, tropical cyclones, and heatwave for the short-term (2025) and two long-term (2050) scenarios. The two long-term scenarios cover a below 2\u00b0C or SSP1-2.6 scenario - taking the sustainable road, and an above 4\u00b0C or SSP5-8.5 scenario - fossil fueled development path. In the 2023 assessment, no material risks have been identified. For more details on our Climate risk and vulnerability assessment, refer to our TCFD reporting in the Sustainability Supplements to this 2023 Annual Report.\n\n## DNSH to Sustainable use and protection of Water and Marine Resources\n\nFor all our operations, Signify follows the local environmental regulation and has developed local studies about water impact when relevant based on the sites' operation\n\nand location. We operate in accordance with the international standards ISO 14001 and ISO 45001, as stipulated in our EHS Policy.\n\nIn 2023, we conducted an in-depth nature impact assessment across our value chain, which considered water-related impact pathways leveraging the WWF Biodiversity & Water Risk Filters; specifically looking at freshwater ecosystem use, marine ecosystem use, water use, and water pollutants. Regarding marine waters, we have not identified any significant risks across our operations. We identified that 1% of all sites face potential risks regarding water pollution and ground water abstraction. These sites have manufacturing functions and already have environmental impact management processes and containment protocols for hazardous materials in place. We plan to work further on increasing the actions to prevent\n\n<!-- image -->",

This approach helps to preserve value and avoid waste. In fact, Signify has been sending zero manufacturing waste to landfill since 2020. This achievement is reinforced by our Sustainability Policy, which is designed to shift towards a more circular economy, with responsible consumption and production in mind, contributing to SDG12.\n\nTo further improve our sustainability performance, we have implemented a mandatory Sustainable Design Procedure for all R&D organizations and businesses. This procedure aims to increase the sustainability benefits of our portfolio and promote responsible practices.\n\nIn addition to these efforts, Signify participates in Collection and Recycling Service Organizations (CRSOs) to establish a dedicated infrastructure for the collection and recycling of conventional lamps, LEDs, and luminaires. We also continuously extend our serviceable luminaires portfolios and undertake successful remanufacturing projects, with a new remanufacturing services offering launched.\n\nSignify is committed to using recycled and bio-circular materials in our products. We have extended the use of these materials in the professional luminaires segment and in the 3D-printed portfolio. Furthermore, our responsible packaging initiative saves 2,500 tonnes of plastics on a yearly basis. The packaging requirements strongly direct us to use at least 80% recycled paper and/or ensure responsible renewable sources (e.g. FSC, SFI, PEFC).\n\nThrough our commitments, procedures, and current activities, Signify mitigates the risk of harming the objective of transitioning to a circular economy. For more information about our actions towards a this topic, refer to subsection 4.4,2 Circular Economy.\n\n## DNSH to Pollution Prevention and Control\n\nSignify has a strict policy regarding pollution and prevention control. We control the use and disposal of all raw materials necessary for our operations, following all the local regulations. Signify requires all its suppliers to communicate all substances in their components and to comply with the stipulations that we have listed in our Regulated Substance List (RSL). For more information about pollution and prevention control, refer to the Sustainability Supplements 2023.\n\n## DNSH to Protection and restoration of Biodiversity and Ecosystems\n\nRegarding the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems, all our sites follow at minimum the local environmental regulations and all sites located within the EU comply with mandatory Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) requirements. In 2023, as mentioned above, we conducted an in-depth impact assessment across the value chain and looked specifically at impact pathways related to biodiversity. The pathways included terrestrial ecosystem use, soil pollution, waste generation and wildlife disturbance.\n\nWe identified that 2% of all sites were located within the zone of influence to protected areas and at risks of potentially contributing to soil pollution and wildlife disturbance. These risks are currently mitigated by policies in place, such as the Biodiversity Policy, as well as environmental impact management processes and containment protocols for hazardous materials. Regarding the risks in our supply chain, we identified our seven priority commodities and are engaging with the key suppliers that face potential risk of impacting terrestrial ecosystem use. We are working on improving the responsible sourcing policy as well as adopting mitigation measures to minimize the risks of impact. We are working on developing more and better biodiversity friendly lighting solutions and we are planning to activate awareness of users about light and its impact on wildlife as well as partner with non-profit organizations to fund conservation efforts. For more information about biodiversity and ecosystems, refer to the Sustainability Supplements 2023.\n\n## Minimum Social Safeguards\n\nThe Minimum Social Safeguards (MSS) provision of the EU Taxonomy Regulation requires companies involved in environmentally sustainable economic activities must also meet criteria for responsible business conduct already outlined in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the International Bill of Human Rights. We assessed the coverage of our codes and standards to the principles and policies under the MSS of the EU Taxonomy. Based on Signify's interpretation of the guidance on MSS, the assessment confirmed that we meet the requirements of the MSS criteria. In addition, the company is committed to a continuous improvement of its human and labor rights performance.\n\n## Complementary information\n\nThe detailed results following the format of the Taxonomy Regulation can be found in the following pages. Signify understands and appreciates the fact that the EU Taxonomy framework is in constant evolution, and that the company's reporting obligations will continue to grow and evolve over the next years. Assessment of the 2023 results is pending further EU Taxonomy's market practice and comparability. Signify is committed to increasing its taxonomyeligibility and taxonomy-alignment percentages independently of regulatory developments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

(hereafter: the Company), based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. The financial statements comprise the consolidated and company financial statements.\n\nIn our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 The accompanying Consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Signify N.V. as at December 31, 2023, and of its result and its cash flows for 2023 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union  (EUIFRSs) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code;\n- \u00b7 The accompanying Company financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Signify N.V. as at December 31, 2023, and of its result for 2023 in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\n## Sustainability information\n\nWe have performed a reasonable assurance engagement on the sustainability information in the annual report 2023 of Signify N.V. based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands (hereafter: the Annual Report). The scope is described in the section 'Our Scope' of our report.\n\nIn our opinion, the sustainability information presents fairly, in all material respects:\n\n- \u00b7 The policy with regard to sustainability matters;\n- \u00b7 The business operations, events and achievements in that area in 2023 in accordance with the applicable criteria as\n\nincluded in the section 'Criteria'.\n\n## Basis for our opinions\n\n## Financial statements\n\nWe conducted our audit of the financial statements in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the section 'Our responsibilities' of our report.\n\nWe believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.\n\n## Sustainability information\n\nWe have performed our reasonable assurance engagement on the sustainability information in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3810N, 'Assuranceopdrachten inzake\n\nduurzaamheidsverslaggeving' (Assurance engagements relating to sustainability reporting), which is a specified Dutch standard that is based on the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, 'Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information'.

        "page_content": "Governance\n\nWe believe that the assurance evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Our independence\n\nWe are independent of Signify N.V. in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities, the 'Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties'  (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).\n\n## Our scope\n\n## Financial statements\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 The consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2023;\n- \u00b7 The following statements for 2023: the consolidated statement of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity;\n- \u00b7 The notes comprising material accounting policy information and other explanatory information.\n\nThe Company financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 The Company statement of financial position as at December 31, 2023;\n- \u00b7 The Company statement of income for 2023;\n- \u00b7 The notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\n## Sustainability information\n\nThe sustainability information is included in sections 3.2 Our impact, 3.3 Our value created, 5.2 Sustainability performance and sections 4.1 to 4.4 of the Sustainability statements of the annual report, excluding the section Responsible Tax Policy as included in paragraph 4.3.5 Business Ethics.\n\nIn preparation for the EU's new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which will come into force in 2024 and will replace the current Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) regulation, Signify voluntarily provided information on the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) in chapter 17 of the Annual Report. This information is not included in our scope.\n\n## Limitations to the scope of our assurance engagement on the sustainability information\n\nThe sustainability information includes prospective information, such as ambitions, strategy, plans, forecasts, expectations and estimates. Prospective information relates to events and actions that have not yet occurred and may never occur. We do not provide assurance on the assumptions and achievability of this prospective information.\n\nWith regards to the Company's sustainability information, the 2019 baseline is based on\n\nSignify's  best estimates available at the time of the start of the Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 doubling commitments in 2021. The 2019 baseline assumptions are excluded from the scope of our reasonable assurance engagement on the sustainability information. We refer to chapter 4, Sustainability statements, subsection 4.4.1 of the Annual Report for more information.\n\nIn the sustainability information, the calculations to determine societal impact as included in section 3.3 of the Annual Report are mostly based on assumptions and sources from third parties. The assumptions and sources used are explained in the document 'Supplement s to the Annual Report 2023' as available on the website of Signify N.V.\n\nWe have determined that these assumptions and external sources are appropriate, but we have not performed procedures on the content of these assumptions and external sources.\n\nThe references to external sources or websites in the sustainability information are not part of the sustainability information as included in the scope of our assurance engagement. We therefore do not provide assurance on this information.\n\nOur opinion is not modified in respect of these matters .\n\n## Criteria\n\nThe criteria applied for the preparation of the sustainability information are the GRI\n\nSustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards) and the criteria supplementally applied as disclosed in section 4.1 Approach to sustainability reporting of the Annual Report 2023 of Signify N.V.\n\nThe sustainability information is prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards. The GRI Standards used are listed in the GRI Content Index as published on the website of Signify N.V.\n\nThe comparability of sustainability information between entities and over time may be affected by the absence of a uniform practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure this information. This allows for the application of different, but acceptable, measurement techniques.\n\nConsequently, the sustainability information needs to be read and understood together with the reporting criteria applied.\n\n## Information in support of our opinion on the financial statements\n\nWe designed our procedures in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon. The following information in support of our opinion and any findings were addressed in this context, and we do not provide a separate opinion or conclusion on these matters.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\n## Our understanding of the business\n\nSignify N.V. is a global provider of lighting solutions. The group is structured in components and we tailored our group audit approach accordingly. We paid specific attention in our audit to a number of areas driven by the operations of the group and our risk assessment. We determined materiality and identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error in order to design audit procedures responsive to those risks and to obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit procedures is influenced by the application of materiality. Our audit engagement aims to provide assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to error or fraud. They are considered to be material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the (economic) decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our conclusions.\n\nMateriality\n\n## EUR 26 million\n\nBenchmark applied\n\nApproximately 4% of adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortization (Adjusted EBITA)\n\nExplanation Based on our professional judgment we consider earnings-based measures as the most appropriate basis to determine materiality.\n\nAdjustments are made to earnings before interest, taxes and amortization for elements that are not directly related to the operational performance of the company as disclosed in chapter 19, 19. Reconciliation of non-IFRS financial measures.\n\nWe have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.\n\nWe agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements in excess of EUR 1.3 million, which are identified during the audit, are reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.\n\n## Scope of the group audit of the financial statements\n\nSignify N.V. is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this\n\ngroup is included in the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nBecause we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items.\n\nOur group audit mainly focused on significant group entities following our assessment of the risk of material misstatement to Signify N.V.'s Consolidated financial statements. We have selected two components that required an audit of all financial information (Full Scope Components). We have selected 26 components requiring audit procedures on specific account balances that we considered to have the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile (Specific Scope Components). We have:\n\n- \u00b7 Performed audit procedures ourselves at 10 Specific Scope Components;\n- \u00b7 Used the work of other EY member firms for two Full Scope Components and 16 Specific Scope Components outside the Netherlands;\n- \u00b7 Centrally performed audit procedures on accounting areas that are managed centrally such as goodwill, acquisitions, legal claims and treasury.\n\nAs a result of our scoping, our actual coverage varies per account balance. In addition, the level of detail of our audit procedures per account balance varies depending on our risk assessment.\n\nOf the remaining components, we performed risk-based data analytics procedures to respond to potential risks of material misstatements to the financial statements.\n\nAccordingly, our coverage of the group's Revenues and Total Assets can be summarized as follows:\n\n## Revenues\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Total assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "By performing the procedures mentioned above at components of the group, together with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group's financial information to provide an opinion about the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Teaming and use of specialists\n\nWe ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component level included the appropriate skills and competences that are needed for the audit of a listed client in Signify's industry. We included specialists in the areas of IT audit, forensics, treasury and income tax and have made use of our own experts in the areas of valuations and actuaries.\n\n## Our focus on climate related risks and the energy transition\n\nClimate change and the energy transition are high on the public agenda. Issues such as CO 2 reduction impact financial reporting, as these issues entail risks for the business operation, the valuation of assets (stranded assets) and provisions or the sustainability of the business model and access to financial markets of companies with a larger CO 2 footprint. The Sustainability statements summarize, among other topics, Signify's commitments and obligations and how the company is addressing climate-related and environmental risks.\n\nAs part of our audit of the financial statements, we evaluated the extent to which climate-related risks and the possible effects of the energy transition are taken into\n\naccount in estimates and significant assumptions, as disclosed in note 1, Basis of preparation of the Consolidated financial statements, as well as in the design of relevant internal control measures by Signify N.V. Furthermore, we read the report of the Board of Management and considered whether there is any material inconsistency between the non-financial information in chapter 4, Brighter Lives, Better World and the financial statements.\n\n## Our focus on fraud and noncompliance with laws and regulations\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nAlthough we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and we cannot be expected to detect noncompliance with all laws and regulations, it is our responsibility to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n## Our audit response related to fraud risks\n\nWe identified and assessed the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements due to fraud. During our audit we obtained an understanding of the entity and its environment and the components of the system of internal control, including the risk assessment process and management's\n\nprocess for responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the system of internal control and how the Supervisory Board exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes.\n\nWe refer to chapter 13, Risk factors and risk management, for management's (fraud) risk assessment and section 9.2 of the Supervisory Board report in which the Supervisory Board reflects on this (fraud) risk assessment.\n\nWe evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control and in particular the fraud risk assessment, as well as the code of conduct, whistle blowerprocedures and incident registration.\n\nWe evaluated the design and the implementation and, where considered appropriate, tested the operating effectiveness, of internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks.\n\nAs part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud and misappropriation of assets. As Signify N.V. is a global company, operating in multiple jurisdictions, we also considered the risk of bribery and corruption. In close co-operation with our forensic specialists we evaluated whether these factors indicate that a risk of material misstatement due to fraud is present.\n\nWe incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance.\n\nWe addressed the risks related to management override of controls. For these risks we have performed procedures among others to evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud, in particular relating to important judgment areas and significant accounting estimates as disclosed in note 1, Basis of preparation of the Consolidated financial statements. We have also used data analysis to identify and address high-risk journal entries and evaluated the business rationale (or the lack thereof) of significant extraordinary transactions, including those with related parties.\n\nThe following fraud risk identified did require significant attention during our audit:\n\n## Presumed risk of fraud in revenue recognition\n\n## Fraud risk\n\nWe presumed that there are risks of fraud in revenue recognition. We evaluated that revenue from sales of goods gives rise to such risks, specifically related to cut-off.\n\nWe describe the risk assessment and audit procedures responsive to the presumed risk of fraud in revenue recognition in the description of the key audit matter 'Improper revenue recognition'.\n\nWe considered available information and made enquiries of the Board of Management and other relevant executives, directors (including internal audit, legal, compliance and heads of Divisions) and the Supervisory Board.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, we assessed factors related to the risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations, including bribery and corruption that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general industry experience, through discussions with management, reading minutes, inspection of internal audit and compliance reports, and performing substantive tests of details of classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures.\n\nWe also inspected lawyers' letters and correspondence with regulatory authorities and remained alert  to any indication of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit. Finally we obtained written representations from the Board of Management and management of operating companies that all known instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed to us.\n\n## Our audit response related to going concern\n\nAs disclosed in note 1, Basis of preparation, of the Consolidated financial statements, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. When preparing the financial statements, management made a specific assessment of the company's ability to continue as a going concern  and to continue its operations for the foreseeable future. We discussed and evaluated the specific assessment with management exercising professional judgment and maintaining professional skepticism.\n\nWe considered whether management's going concern assessment, based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, contains all relevant events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nIf we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,  to modify our opinion.\n\nBased on our procedures performed, we did not identify material uncertainties about going concern.\n\nOur conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Our key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed.\n\nThe key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit procedures for the financial statements and to conclude thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nThe following key audit matters are excluded or new compared to the key audit matters included in our last year's auditor's report:\n\n| Key audit matter                                              | Change   | Reason for change                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Valuation of inventories and  related obsolescence  provision |          | Excluded The risk that inventories and related  obsolescence provision is incorrectly valued  decreased following the decline in inventory  levels and softened supply chain disruptions and  related uncertainties. |\n| Valuation of goodwill                                         | New      | The risk of goodwill impairment increased  following the decrease in headroom (difference  between the recoverable amount and its carrying  amount) in the annual impairment test.                                   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<\n\n\u2261\n\n>",

The requirements for this are set out in the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 with regard to Regulatory Technical Standards on the specification of a single electronic reporting format (hereinafter: the RTS on ESEF).\n\nIn our opinion the Annual Report prepared in XHTML format, including the (partially) marked-up consolidated financial statements as included in the reporting package by Signify N.V., complies in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF.\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing the Annual Report, including the financial statements,  in accordance with the RTS on ESEF, whereby management combines the various components into a single reporting package.\n\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance for our opinion whether the Annual Report in this reporting package complies with the RTS on ESEF.\n\nWe performed our examination in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3950N 'Assurance-opdrachten inzake het voldoen aan de criteria voor het opstellen van een digitaal verantwoordingsdocument' (assurance engagements relating to compliance with criteria for digital reporting). Our examination included among others:\n\n- \u00b7 Obtaining an understanding of Signify N.V.'s financial reporting process, including the preparation of the reporting package;\n- \u00b7 Identifying and assessing the risks that the Annual Report does not comply in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF and designing and performing further assurance procedures responsive to those risks to provide a basis for our opinion, including:\n- - Obtaining the reporting package and performing validations to determine whether the reporting package containing the Inline XBRL instance document and the XBRL extension taxonomy files, has been prepared in accordance with the technical specifications as included in the RTS on ESEF;\n- - Examining the information related to the consolidated financial statements in the reporting package to determine whether all required mark-ups have been applied and whether these are in accordance with the RTS on ESEF.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, management should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has  no realistic alternative but to do so. Management should disclose events and circumstances that may  cast significant doubt on Signify N.V.'s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing Signify N.V.'s financial reporting process.\n\n## Sustainability information\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the sustainability information in accordance with the criteria as included in the section 'Criteria', including the identification of the stakeholders and the definition of material matters. Management is also responsible for selecting and applying the criteria and for determining that these criteria are suitable for the legitimate information needs of stakeholders, considering applicable law and regulations related to reporting. The choices made by management with respect to the scope of the sustainability information and the reporting policy are included in section 4.1 Approach to sustainability reporting of the Annual Report.\n\nFurthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements and the sustainability information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the sustainability reporting process of Signify N.V.\n\n## Our responsibilities\n\n## Financial statements\n\nOur objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.\n\nOur audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.\n\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.\n\n## Sustainability information\n\nOur responsibility is to plan and perform the assurance engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate assurance evidence for our opinion.\n\nOur assurance engagement has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not have detected all material fraud and errors during our assurance engagement.\n\nWe apply the 'Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen' (NVKS, regulations for quality management systems) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality management including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and other relevant legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nAn informative summary of the work performed as the basis of our opinions is included in the Annex to the combined independent auditor's report.\n\nAmsterdam, February 27, 2024\n\nErnst & Young Accountants LLP\n\nA.E.

These procedures consisted amongst others of:\n- \u00b7 Making inquiries of management and relevant staff at corporate and business\n\nlevel responsible for the sustainability strategy, policy and results.\n\n- \u00b7 Reading minutes of the meetings of management, the Supervisory Board and of other meetings that are important for the content of the sustainability reporting.\n- \u00b7 Interviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the information for, carrying out internal control procedures on, and consolidating the data in the sustainability information.\n- \u00b7 Determining the nature and extent of the procedures to be performed for the group components and locations. For this, the nature, extent and/or risk profile of these components are decisive. Based thereon we selected the components and locations to visit, taking into account experience from previous visits. The visits to production sites in Poland and the United States are aimed at, on a local level, validating source data and to evaluate the design, implementation and operation of controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the suitability of assumptions and sources from third parties used for the calculation of the societal impact as included in the section 3.3 of the annual report and further explained in the Methodology for societal impact calculations.\n- \u00b7 Obtaining assurance evidence that the sustainability information reconciles with underlying records of the company.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating relevant internal and external documentation, on a sample basis, to determine the reliability of the information in the sustainability information.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the data and trends in the information submitted for consolidation at corporate level.\n- \u00b7 Reconciling the relevant financial information with the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Reading the information in the annual report that is not included in the scope of our assurance engagement to identify material inconsistencies, if any, with the sustainability information; and\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the sustainability information; and\n- \u00b7 Evaluation whether the sustainability information as a whole, including the sustainability matters and disclosures, is clearly and adequately disclosed in accordance with the criteria applied.\n\n## Communication\n\nWe communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit of the financial statements and the assurance engagement on the sustainability information and significant audit or assurance findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identify during our audit and assurance engagement. In this respect we also report to the audit committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this  combined independent auditor's report.\n\nWe provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding\n\n<!-- image -->",

These are commonly referred to as non-IFRS financial measures and include items such as comparable sales growth, adjusted gross margin, adjusted indirect costs, EBITA, adjusted EBITA, free cash flow and other related ratios.\n\nAlthough the non-IFRS financial measures presented are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS, the company uses these measures to monitor the underlying performance of its business and operations. These measures have not been audited or reviewed by the company's external auditor. Furthermore, these measures might not be indicative of the company's historical operating results, nor are such measures meant to be predictive of the company's future results. These measures are presented in this Annual Report because the company considers them an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes that these and similar measures are widely used in the industry in which it operates as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity.\n\n## Comparable sales growth\n\nThe company discloses comparable sales growth as a supplemental non-IFRS financial measure, as the company believes that the presentation of comparable sales growth is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate the performance of the company's business activities over time. The company determines comparable sales growth by deducting the percentage figures for changes from the nominal change of sales. Interaction effects between currency movements, changes in consolidation, regulatory changes and changes in accounting standards (second order effects) are not taken into account. The company presents comparable sales growth on both a Division and Market basis. Comparable sales growth is also used by the company as a key financial measure to assess the operating performance of the Divisions and Markets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The company understands that\n\nthese measures are used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in assessing the company's performance. The company presents EBITA, Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA ratio on a Division basis. The company also believes that the presentation of EBITA, Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA ratio provide useful information to investors on the development of the company's business and enhance the ability of investors to compare profitability across the Divisions. In the case of EBITA, the company believes that it makes the underlying performance of its businesses more transparent by factoring out the amortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets and goodwill, which arises when acquisitions are consolidated by the company. In the case of Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA ratio, the company believes that these measures make the underlying performance of its businesses more transparent by factoring out restructuring costs, acquisition-related charges and other incidental charges which are not directly related to the operational performance of a Division. EBITA, Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA ratio are also used by the company as key financial measures to assess the operating performance of the Divisions.\n\n## Adjusted EBITA to Income from operations (EBIT) in millions of EUR\n\n|                                  | Signify   | Digital  Solutions   | Digital  Products   | Conventional  Products   | Signify  Other   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| 2023                             |           |                      |                     |                          |                  |\n| Adjusted EBITA                   | 670       | 422                  | 205                 | 129                      | (86)             |\n| Restructuring                    | (167)     | (32)                 | (25)                | (51)                     | (59)             |\n| Acquisition-related charges      | (14)      | (15)                 | -                   | -                        | 1                |\n| Incidental items                 | (40)      | (17)                 | (4)                 | (16)                     | (2)              |\n| EBITA                            | 449       | 358                  | 176                 | 62                       | (147)            |\n| Amortization  1                  | (80)      | (74)                 | (6)                 | -                        | (1)              |\n| Income from operations (EBIT)  2 | 369       | 285                  | 170                 | 62                       | (147)            |\n\n## 2022\n\nAdjusted EBITA\n\n762\n\n424\n\n297\n\n116\n\n(75)\n\nRestructuring\n\n(64)\n\n(15)\n\n(11)\n\n(34)\n\n(4)\n\nAcquisition-related charges\n\n(27)\n\n(27)\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nIncidental items\n\n173\n\n(8)\n\n(14)\n\n(22)\n\n217\n\nEBITA\n\n844\n\n374\n\n272\n\n60\n\n138\n\nAmortization\n\n1\n\nIncome from operations (EBIT)\n\n2\n\n(126)\n\n(118)\n\n(7)\n\n-\n\n(1)\n\n718\n\n256\n\n265\n\n60\n\n137\n\n- 1 Amortization and impairments of acquisition related intangible assets and goodwill.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The company understands that free cash flow is broadly used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in assessing the company's performance. The company also believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding the cash generated by the company's operating activities after deducting cash outflows for additions of intangible assets, capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment and proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment. Therefore, the measure gives an indication of the long-term cash generating ability of the company's business. In addition, because free cash flow is not impacted by purchases of businesses, it is less volatile than the total of cash flows from operating and investing activities.

This means we aim to achieve the emission reduction goals laid out in the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C scenario for 2031 by 2025, six years early. With this scenario, the Paris Agreement suggests that companies must reduce their emissions by 4.2% year on year. In other words, by the end of 2025, we will reduce our scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 40% compared to our baseline year 2019. To track progress, we are comparing Signify actual and projected carbon footprint every year from 2021 to 2025. Based on the 80% coverage of all Signify data from sold portfolio, we have estimated our 2022 value chain CO 2 . By extrapolating the remaining 20% within each product family, we calculated our 100% value chain CO 2 and concluded that we are 4% ahead on our projected carbon footprint for\n\n2022. Comparing to the 2019 baseline, we have already achieved 30% emissions reduction across our value chain (vs. 40% by the end of 2025). With an estimated a 5% error rate for 2022 (10% in 2021), we have achieved between 27% and 34% emissions reduction across the value chain (vs. 40% by the end of 2025), which means that we are on track towards our 2025 targets.\n\n## Other taxes\n\nOther taxes comprise environmental taxes, property taxes and other contributions to governments in the form of taxes.

These fair values are based on market prices, where available, and are obtained from sources that are deemed to be reliable. Readers are cautioned that these values are subject to changes over time and are only valid on the balance sheet date. When quoted prices or observable market values do not exist, fair values are estimated using valuation models that we believe are appropriate for their purpose. They require management to make significant assumptions with respect to future developments that are inherently uncertain and might therefore deviate from actual developments.\n\nCritical assumptions used are disclosed in the financial statements. In certain cases, independent valuations are obtained to support management's determination of fair values.\n\n## IFRS basis of presentation\n\nThe financial information included in this document is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union (EU), as explained in significant accounting policies, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## Statutory financial statements\n\nChapter 15, Consolidated financial statements and chapter 16, Signify N.V. financial statements, contain the statutory financial statements of Signify N.V.\n\n## Regulated information\n\nThis document contains regulated information within the meaning of the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<\n\n\u2261\n\n>",
