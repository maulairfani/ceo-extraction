We quickly got to work in year one of this transformation to create a new Biogen and while we still have a way to go on that journey, I believe we laid a solid foundation in 2023 with a clear roadmap for 2024.\n\nWe acted decisively and, following a series of strategic changes over the last year, we believe we now have the operational elements in place to achieve our /financial and growth goals, bolster our research and development pipeline, and create long-term value for all who place their trust in us - including our patients, our partners, our employees and our shareholders.\n\n## Focus on Operational Execution With a Realigned Cost-Base and Four New Product Launches\n\nIn 2023, we took steps to realign our cost-base to our revenue and to reengineer our business to better support areas of expected future growth. We implemented a Fit for Growth operating model that prioritized decision-making, agility, accountability and cost savings. We expect to achieve approximately $1 billion in gross cost reductions by the end of 2025, and this initiative enabled us to reinvest part of those savings in potential key growth drivers, including new capabilities and potential future medicines.\n\nEssential to this effort was a thorough review of our Research and Development (R&D) pipeline, as we prioritize future investment and strategic assets that we believe will provide the greatest returns while also delivering impactful medicines to patients in need. As stewards of shareholder capital, we are building on our legacy of pioneering scienti/fic leadership in tackling the toughest challenges with a refreshed approach to risk management and return on investment. Through a concerted focus on prudently allocating capital and maximizing value, we are focused on implementing pipeline programs we believe have the highest probability of success, while exiting those where we do not see potential return.\n\nAs part of this effort, we are thoughtfully broadening our focus and exploring new treatment areas where we see the greatest opportunities to address unmet patient needs. We have made tremendous progress, our product portfolio expanded due to the achievement of four U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals of /first-in-class medicines during 2023: QALSODY to treat adults with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); ZURZUVAE, in collaboration with Sage Therapeutics, Inc., to treat postpartum depression (PPD) in adults; LEQEMBI, in collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd., to treat early Alzheimer's disease (AD); and SKYCLARYS via our acquisition of Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc., to treat patients 16 years and older with Friedreich's ataxia (FA).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI believe strongly that we have the elements we need to bring life-changing treatments to market and grow sustainably, and I appreciate the continued support of our shareholders during this period of transformation.\n\n-\n\n## Christopher A. Viehbacher\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Of/ficer",

        "page_content": "The launch of LEQEMBI is a signi/ficant milestone - it's not just a product, but a breakthrough medicine that represents a new treatment paradigm for AD. We are also serving more patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and remaining competitive in multiple sclerosis (MS) - our legacy franchises - where we have already successfully developed and commercialized effective treatments.\n\nIn 2024, we will focus heavily on executing on these new product launches and supporting patient uptake. For instance, we have been in the market for about 10 months with LEQEMBI and, together with Eisai, will now increase the size of the sales force representation by approximately 30% in the U.S., with the aim of building upon the progress we have made, as we continue to advance launches and regulatory /filings outside the U.S. The launch has been on a progressive ramp as we continue to educate the medical community about the appropriate patient pro/file and care pathway. We continue to believe in the long-term importance of LEQEMBI to both patients and the company, and that its clinical pro/file and long-term ef/ficacy data will be meaningful to patients and their caregivers.\n\nWe have made tremendous progress, with Biogen being granted the secondhighest number of FDA approvals last year and launching four commercially available /first-in-class medicines in 2023.\n\n-\n\n## Christopher A. Viehbacher\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Of/ficer\n\nWe also foresee a strong global outlook for SKYCLARYS, which recently became the /first treatment approved in the European Union for treatment of FA in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older. In the U.S., we had more than 1,000 patients on therapy as of midFebruary, which we believe represents nearly 25% of the eligible population, and we are working toward expanding access to this groundbreaking treatment to the pediatric population and more geographies.\n\n## A Strengthened Leadership Team and Evolved Culture to Advance Our Strategy\n\nAs part of our efforts to strengthen Biogen, we also made several key additions to our leadership team in 2023, complementing our existing expertise and ensuring we have the skills and experience needed to achieve our vision.\n\nWe welcomed Dr. Jane Grogan as Head of Research and Dr. Adam Keeney as Head of Corporate Development, and we promoted Dr. Priya Singhal, M.D., M.P.H., to Head of Development, in line with our strategy to separate Research and Development into two distinct functions to increase focus and improve productivity. Collectively, this added depth of expertise enables Biogen to identify and execute against opportunities for both internal growth and external partnerships that have the potential to bring innovative medicines to market faster and more effectively.\n\nWe also reviewed our culture and internal structure to ensure that the people who are closest to our customers, to our patients and to our science are empowered to raise ideas and make decisions. The Biogen Way describes the mission and behaviors pioneer, think broadly, drive results, ethical and inclusive - that provide the foundation for Biogen's long-term success. Building upon our legacy of breakthroughs in biology, we intend to continue pioneering while thinking broadly and driving results so we can bring more medicines to patients.\n\n## 2024 Priorities and Key Development Milestones\n\nMoving forward, we are seeking to complement our pipeline with more assets in rare disease and in certain de/fined areas of immunology. Biogen has always been active in immunology, and we are refreshing our focus on immunology and in/flammation, while building on our strength in neurological and expanding into nonneurological rare diseases, which are a strong /fit for our existing commercial and scienti/fic capabilities. We believe that we have the potential to develop strong biomarkers and best-in-class drugs in these areas, given our understanding of the genetics and disease biology.",

        "page_content": "Our 2024 roadmap will be de/fined by our ability to maximize the performance of our recent launches and further build our R&D pipeline, with four important clinical trial readouts expected in mid-2024: Phase 1b readout for antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting ataxin-2 in ALS [BIIB105]; Phase 1b readout for ASO in Angelman syndrome [BIIB121]; Phase 3 readout for dapirolizumab pegol in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in collaboration with UCB; and Phase 2b readout for essential tremor [BIIB124] in collaboration with Sage Therapeutics, Inc. These are rare, devastating diseases with very few existing treatment options for patients, and we are proud to be advancing the development of treatments with the potential to improve outcomes and quality of life for these patients and their families.\n\nWe also continue to build on our breakthrough position in AD and invest in advancing the care of patients suffering from this dif/ficult disease. We believe LEQEMBI represents both a mid-term and long-term growth opportunity, and we are focused on creating additional treatment options with LEQEMBI for patients. This includes subcutaneous formulation and intravenous maintenance dosing, as well as, together with Eisai, the advancement of the AHEAD study, which looks at presymptomatic patients, as we believe that intervening earlier has the potential to further delay or, potentially, even prevent the onset of the disease.\n\nBeyond LEQEMBI, we're excited about several other pipeline programs to treat AD. We have already initiated a Phase 2 study for an ASO that targets tau [BIIB080], utilizing an entirely new mechanism, and we are also studying an oral small molecule inhibitor of tau aggregation [BIIB113] currently in Phase 1.\n\nThe 2023 comprehensive pipeline review was not a one-time exercise; rather, our pipeline review will remain dynamic. As we advance each of our programs and reach key milestones, we are committed to holding ourselves accountable to ef/ficiently seek out scienti/fic insights to build the pipeline that we believe represents the appropriate risk-reward balance for our portfolio.\n\n## Advancing Our Mission and Making a Difference in Patients' Lives\n\nI am immensely grateful to the entire team here at Biogen, who continue to impress me with their talent, passion and dedication to pioneering innovative science as we aim to deliver new medicines to transform patients' lives and to create value for shareholders and our communities. Our people have played a critical role in the hard work that has helped get Biogen back on track, where we are today, and I am truly looking forward to all that we will achieve together.\n\nAt its core, Biogen is a company rooted in rigorous science, curiosity and purpose to drive innovation in medicine, and as we execute against our strategic and /financial objectives for the coming year, we remain focused on investing our resources where we have the potential to make the biggest difference. I believe strongly that we have the elements we need to bring life-changing treatments to market and grow sustainably, and I appreciate the continued support of our shareholders during this period of transformation.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChristopher A.

        "page_content": "## ITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nBiogen is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and delivering innovative therapies for people living with serious and complex diseases worldwide. We have a broad portfolio of medicines to treat MS, have introduced the first approved treatment for SMA, co-developed treatments to address a defining pathology of Alzheimer's disease and launched the first approved treatment to target a genetic cause of ALS. Through our 2023 acquisition of Reata we market the first and only drug approved in the U.S. and the E.U. for the treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older. We are focused on advancing our pipeline in neurology, specialized immunology and rare diseases. We support our drug discovery and development efforts through internal research and development programs and external collaborations.\n\nOur marketed products include TECFIDERA, VUMERITY, AVONEX, PLEGRIDY, TYSABRI and FAMPYRA for the treatment of MS; SPINRAZA for the treatment of SMA; SKYCLARYS for the treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia; QALSODY for the treatment of ALS; and FUMADERM for the treatment of severe plaque psoriasis.\n\nWe also have collaborations with Eisai on the commercialization of LEQEMBI for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Sage on the commercialization of ZURZUVAE for the treatment of PPD and we have certain business and financial rights with respect to RITUXAN for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, CLL and other conditions; RITUXAN HYCELA for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and CLL; GAZYVA for the treatment of CLL and follicular lymphoma; OCREVUS for the treatment of PPMS and RMS; LUNSUMIO for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma; COLUMVI, a bispecific antibody for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; and have the option to add other potential anti-CD20 therapies, pursuant to our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, a wholly-owned member of the Roche Group.\n\nWe commercialize a portfolio of biosimilars of advanced biologics including BENEPALI, an etanercept biosimilar referencing ENBREL, IMRALDI, an adalimumab biosimilar referencing HUMIRA, and FLIXABI, an infliximab biosimilar referencing REMICADE, in certain countries in Europe, as well as BYOOVIZ, a ranibizumab biosimilar referencing LUCENTIS, in the U.S. and certain international markets. We also have exclusive rights to commercialize TOFIDENCE, a tocilizumab biosimilar referencing ACTEMRA. We continue to develop potential biosimilar product SB15, a proposed aflibercept biosimilar referencing EYLEA. In February 2023 we announced that we are exploring strategic options for our biosimilars business.\n\n## KEY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS\n\nThe following is a summary of key developments affecting our business since the beginning of 2023.\n\nFor additional information on our collaborative and other relationships discussed below, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## DEVELOPMENTS IN KEY COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS\n\n## LEQEMBI (lecanemab)\n\n## United States\n\nIn July 2023 the FDA granted traditional approval of LEQEMBI, an anti-amyloid antibody for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, which was previously granted accelerated approval by the FDA in January 2023. Following the FDA's traditional approval of LEQEMBI, CMS confirmed broader coverage of LEQEMBI.\n\nAdditionally, in March 2023 Eisai announced that the U.S. Veteran's Health Administration will be providing coverage of LEQEMBI to veterans living with early stages of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n## Rest of World\n\nKey developments related to LEQEMBI (lecanemab) in rest of world markets during 2023 consisted of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 In January 2024 we and Eisai announced that the SAG will convene at the request of the CHMP to discuss the MAA of lecanemab that is currently under review by the EMA. The meeting of the SAG is expected to take place during the first quarter of 2024 and the EC decision for the MAA of lecanemab is expected during the first half of 2024.\n- \u00b7 In January 2024 the NMPA approved LEQEMBI in China, with an expected launch date in 2024.\n\n## PART I",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 In December 2023 we and Eisai announced that LEQEMBI intravenous infusion was launched in Japan.\n- \u00b7 In September 2023 the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approved LEQEMBI in Japan.\n- \u00b7 In January 2023 the EMA accepted for review the MAA for lecanemab.\n- \u00b7 In February 2023 the BLA for lecanemab was granted Priority Review by the NMPA of China.\n- \u00b7 In May 2023 we and Eisai announced the submission of a MAA for lecanemab to the U.K. MHRA in Great Britain, which has been designated by the MHRA for the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway. Additionally, in May 2023 Health Canada accepted for review the NDS for lecanemab.\n- \u00b7 In June 2023 we and Eisai announced the submission of a MAA for lecanemab to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in South Korea.\n\n## ZURZUVAE (zuranolone)\n\nIn August 2023 the FDA approved ZURZUVAE for adults with PPD, pending DEA scheduling, which was completed in October 2023. Upon approval, ZURZUVAE for PPD became the first and only oral, once-daily, 14-day treatment that can provide rapid improvements in depressive symptoms by day 15 for women with PPD. ZURZUVAE for PPD became commercially available in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally, the FDA issued a CRL for the NDA for zuranolone in the treatment of adults with MDD. The CRL stated that the application did not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness to support the approval of zuranolone for the treatment of MDD and that an additional study or studies would be needed. We and Sage are continuing to seek feedback from the FDA and evaluating next steps.\n\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangement with Sage, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\n\n## REATA ACQUISITION\n\nOn September 26, 2023, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Reata, a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapeutics that regulate cellular metabolism and inflammation in serious neurologic diseases. As a result of this transaction we acquired SKYCLARYS (omaveloxolone), the first and only drug approved in the U.S. and the E.U. for the treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older, as well as other clinical and preclinical pipeline programs.\n\nUnder the terms of this acquisition, we paid Reata shareholders $172.50 in cash for each issued and outstanding Reata share, which totaled approximately $6.6 billion. In addition, we agreed to pay approximately $983.9 million in cash for Reata's outstanding equity awards, inclusive of employer taxes, of which approximately $590.5 million was attributable to pre-acquisition services and is therefore reflected as a component of total purchase price paid. Of the $983.9 million paid to Reata's equity award holders, we recognized approximately $393.4 million as compensation attributable to the post-acquisition service period, of which $196.4 million was recognized as a charge to selling, general and administrative expense with the remaining $197.0 million as a charge to research and development expense within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023. These amounts were associated with the accelerated vesting of stock options and RSUs previously granted to Reata employees that required no future services to vest.\n\nFor additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read Note 2, Acquisitions , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## OTHER KEY DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## QALSODY (tofersen)\n\nIn April 2023 the FDA approved QALSODY for the treatment of ALS in adults who have a mutation in the SOD1 gene. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on reduction in plasma neurofilament light chain observed in patients treated with QALSODY. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).\n\n## TECFIDERA\n\nFollowing a favorable March 2023 decision of the CJEU affirming TECFIDERA's right to regulatory data and marketing protection and the EC determination in May 2023 that TECFIDERA is entitled to an additional year of market",

        "page_content": "protection for its pediatric indication, we believe that TECFIDERA is entitled to regulatory marketing protection in the E.U. until at least February 2, 2025, and are seeking to enforce this protection. In December 2023, the EC revoked all centralized marketing authorizations for generic versions of TECFIDERA. As of December 31, 2023, some of the TECFIDERA generics have not yet fully exited some E.U. markets and we expect removal of all generics from the market will take additional time. We are closely monitoring this situation and working to enforce our legal right to market protection. In addition, we will continue to enforce our EP 2 653 873 patent related to TECFIDERA, which expires in 2028.\n\n## CORPORATE MATTERS\n\n## FIT FOR GROWTH\n\nIn 2023 we initiated additional cost saving measures as part of our Fit for Growth program to reduce operating costs, while improving operating efficiency and effectiveness. The Fit for Growth program is expected to generate approximately $1.0 billion in gross operating expense savings and $800.0 million in net operating expense savings by 2025, some of which will be reinvested in various initiatives.

        "page_content": "SMA is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem, resulting in severe and progressive muscular atrophy and weakness. Ultimately, individuals with the most severe type of SMA can become paralyzed and have difficulty performing the basic functions of life, like breathing and swallowing. Due to a deletion or mutations in the SMN1 gene, people with SMA do not produce enough SMN protein, which is critical to the survival of the neurons that control muscles. The severity of SMA correlates with the amount of SMN protein. People with Type 1 SMA, the most severe life-threatening form, produce very little SMN protein and do not achieve the ability to sit without support, and typically do not live beyond two years of age without respiratory support and nutritional interventions. People with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA produce greater amounts of SMN protein and have less severe, but still life-altering, forms of SMA.\n\nFA is an inherited, debilitating and degenerative neuromuscular disorder that is typically diagnosed during adolescence and can ultimately lead to premature death. Patients with FA experience progressive loss of coordination, muscle weakness and fatigue, which commonly progresses to motor incapacitation, wheelchair reliance and eventually death. Symptoms generally first occur in children, with patients requiring a wheelchair by their teens or early-20s and generally have a life expectancy of their mid-30s.\n\nALS is a rare, progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease that results in the loss of motor neurons in the brain and the spinal cord that are responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement. People with ALS experience muscle weakness and atrophy, causing them to lose independence as they steadily lose the ability to move, speak, eat and eventually breathe. Average life expectancy for people with ALS is three to five years from time of symptom onset. Multiple genes have been implicated in ALS. Genetic testing helps determine if a person's ALS is associated with a genetic mutation, even in individuals without a known family history of the disease.

        "page_content": "We are dedicated to helping patients obtain access to our therapies. Our patient representatives have access to a suite of financial assistance tools. With those tools, we help patients understand their insurance coverage and, if needed, help patients compare insurance options and programs. In the U.S., we have established programs that provide co-pay assistance or free product for qualified uninsured or underinsured patients, based on specific eligibility criteria. We also provide charitable contributions to independent charitable organizations that assist patients with out-of-pocket expenses associated with their therapy.\n\nWe believe all healthcare stakeholders have a shared responsibility to ensure patients have equitable access to new, innovative medicines. We regularly review our pricing strategy and prioritize patient access to our therapies. We have a value-based contracting program designed to align the price of our therapies to the value our therapies deliver to patients. We also work with regulators, clinical researchers, ethicists, physicians and patient advocacy organizations and communities, among others, to determine how best to address requests for access to our investigational therapies in a manner that is consistent with our patient-focused values and compliant with regulatory standards and protocols. In appropriate situations, patients may have access to investigational therapies through Early Access Programs, single patient access or emergency use based on humanitarian or compassionate grounds.\n\n## MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n## SALES FORCE AND MARKETING\n\nWe promote our marketed products worldwide, including in the U.S., Europe and Japan, primarily through our own sales forces and marketing groups. In some countries, particularly in areas where we continue to expand into new geographic areas, we partner with third parties.\n\nRITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA, GAZYVA, OCREVUS and LUNSUMIO are marketed by the Roche Group and its sublicensees.\n\nWe commercialize BENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI pursuant to our agreement with Samsung Bioepis in certain countries in Europe, as well as BYOOVIZ in the U.S. and certain international markets.\n\nWe focus our sales and marketing efforts on physicians in private practice or at major medical centers. We use customary industry practices to market our products and to educate physicians. This includes our sales representatives calling on individual health care providers (in-person and virtually), advertisements, professional symposia, direct mail, digital marketing, point of care marketing, public relations and other methods. We focus on health care provider sales and marketing efforts on specialty providers in both private practice and at major medical centers.\n\n## DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS\n\nWe distribute our products in the U.S. principally through wholesale and specialty distributors of pharmaceutical products and specialty pharmacies, mail order specialty distributors or shipping service providers. In other countries, the distribution of our products varies from country to country, including through wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products and third-party distribution partners who are responsible for most marketing and distribution activities.\n\nRITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA, GAZYVA, OCREVUS and LUNSUMIO are distributed by the Roche Group and its sublicensees.\n\nWe distribute BENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI in certain countries in Europe and have an option to acquire exclusive rights to distribute these products in China, as well as BYOOVIZ in the U.S. and certain international markets.\n\nOur product sales to two wholesale distributors each accounted for more than 10.0% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, and on a combined basis, accounted for approximately 36.9%, 37.9% and 38.9%, respectively, of our gross product revenue. For additional information, please read Note 5, Revenue , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## PATENTS AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS\n\nPatents are important for obtaining and protecting exclusive rights in our products and product candidates. We regularly seek patent protection in the U.S. and in selected countries outside the U.S. for inventions originating from our research and development efforts and those we license or acquire. In addition, we license rights to various patents and patent applications.",

        "page_content": "U.S. patents, as well as most foreign patents, are generally effective for 20 years from the date the earliest application was filed; however, U.S. patents on applications filed before June 8, 1995, may be effective until 17 years from the issue date, if that is later than the 20-year date. In some cases, the patent term may be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during regulatory review of the claimed therapeutic or, in the case of the U.S., additional patent term may be awarded due to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office delays in prosecuting the application. In the U.S., under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, a patent that covers a drug approved by the FDA may be eligible for patent term extension (for up to 5 years, but not beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval) as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The duration and extension of the term of foreign patents vary, in accordance with local law. For example, in a number of European countries, SPCs can be granted to a product to compensate in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval.\n\nRegulatory exclusivity, which may consist of regulatory data protection and market protection, can also provide meaningful protection for our products. Regulatory data protection provides to the holder of a drug or biologic marketing authorization, for a set period of time, the exclusive use of the proprietary pre-clinical and clinical data that it created at significant cost and submitted to the applicable regulatory authority to obtain approval of its product. After the period of exclusive use, third parties are permitted to reference such data in abbreviated applications for approval and to market (subject to any applicable market protection) their generic drugs and biosimilars. Market protection provides the holder of a drug or biologic marketing authorization the exclusive right to commercialize its product for a period of time, thereby preventing the commercialization of another product containing the same active ingredient(s) during that period. Although the World Trade Organization's agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights requires signatory countries to provide regulatory exclusivity to innovative pharmaceutical products, implementation and enforcement varies widely from country to country.\n\nWe also rely upon other forms of unpatented confidential information to remain competitive. We protect such information principally through refraining from public disclosure and utilizing confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, scientists whose research we sponsor and other advisers. In the case of our employees, these agreements also provide, in compliance with relevant law, that inventions and other intellectual property conceived by such employees during their employment are our exclusive property.\n\nOur trademarks are important to us and are generally covered by trademark applications or registrations in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the patent or trademark offices of other countries. We also use trademarks licensed from third parties. Trademark protection varies in accordance with local law, and continues in some countries as long as the trademark is used and in other countries as long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms.\n\n## OUR PATENT PORTFOLIO\n\nThe following table describes certain patents in the U.S. and Europe that we currently consider of primary importance to our marketed products, including the territory, patent number, general subject matter and expected expiration dates. Except as otherwise noted, the expected expiration dates include any granted patent term extensions and issued SPCs. In some instances, there may be additional later-expiring patents relating to our products directed to, among other things, particular forms or compositions, methods of manufacturing or use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions. We also continue to pursue additional patents and patent term extensions in the U.S. and other territories covering various aspects of our products that may, if issued, extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the patents listed in the table.",

        "page_content": "## COMPETITION\n\nCompetition in the biopharmaceutical industry and the markets in which we operate is intense. There are many companies, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, engaged in developing products for the indications our approved products are approved to treat and the therapeutic areas we are targeting with our research and development activities. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources than we do.\n\nWe believe that competition and leadership in the industry is based on scientific, managerial and technological excellence and innovation as well as establishing patent and other proprietary positions through research and development. The achievement of a leadership position also depends largely upon our ability to maximize the approval, acceptance and use of our product candidates and the availability of adequate financial resources to fund facilities, equipment, personnel, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing. Another key aspect of remaining competitive in the industry is recruiting and retaining leading scientists and technicians to conduct our research activities and advance our development programs, including with the regulatory and commercial expertise to effectively advance and market our products.\n\nCompetition among products approved for sale may be based, among other things, on patent position, product efficacy, safety, patient convenience, delivery devices, reliability, availability, reimbursement and price. In addition, early entry of a new pharmaceutical product into the market may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance and market share. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the testing and approval process and supply commercial quantities of products will have a significant impact on our competitive position.\n\nThe introduction of new products or technologies, including the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or new information about existing products or technologies, results in increased competition for our marketed products and pricing pressure on our marketed products. The development of new or improved treatment options or standards of care or cures for the diseases our products treat reduces and could eliminate the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates.\n\nIn addition, the commercialization of certain of our own approved products, products of our collaborators and pipeline product candidates may negatively impact future sales of our existing products.\n\nWe believe our long-term competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet medical needs, along with our ability to manufacture products efficiently and to launch and market them effectively in a highly competitive environment.\n\nAdditional information about the competition that our marketed products face is set forth below and in Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report.\n\n## NEUROLOGY\n\n## MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS\n\nOur MS products and revenue streams continue to face increasing competition in many markets from the introduction of generic versions, prodrugs and biosimilars of existing products and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways. Such products are likely to be sold at substantially lower prices than branded products. Accordingly, the introduction of such products as well as other lower-priced competing products may significantly reduce both the price that we are able to charge for our products and the volume of products we sell, which will negatively impact our revenue. In some jurisdictions a decrease in reimbursed price is mandated by law. In addition, in some markets, when a generic or biosimilar version of one of our products is commercialized, it may be automatically substituted for our product and significantly reduce our revenue in a short period of time.\n\nCompetition in the MS market is intense. Along with us, a number of companies are working to develop additional treatments for MS that may in the future compete with our MS products. One such product that was approved in the U.S. in 2017 and in the E.U. in 2018 is OCREVUS, a treatment for RMS and PPMS that was developed by Genentech. While we have a financial interest in OCREVUS, future sales of our MS products may be adversely affected if OCREVUS continues to gain market share, or if other MS products that we or our competitors are developing are commercialized.",

In December 2023, the EC revoked all centralized marketing authorizations for generic versions of TECFIDERA. As of December 31, 2023, some of the TECFIDERA generics have not yet fully exited some E.U. markets and we expect removal of all generics from the market will take additional time. We are closely monitoring this situation and working to enforce our legal right to market protection. In addition, we will continue to enforce our EP 2 653 873 patent related to TECFIDERA, which expires in 2028.\n\nThe generic competition for TECFIDERA has significantly reduced our TECFIDERA revenue and we expect that TECFIDERA revenue will continue to decline in the future.\n\nWe are also aware of a biosimilar entrant of TYSABRI that was approved in the U.S. in August 2023 and the E.U. in September 2023. We believe that future sales of TYSABRI may be adversely affected by the entrance of this biosimilar.\n\nFor additional information on the U.S. patent litigation related to a TYSABRI biosimilar, please read Note 21, Litigation , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE\n\nThe market for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease is undeveloped and could be subject to rapid change in the future. Most current treatments are symptomatic or intended to improve quality of life. Along with us, several companies are working to develop additional treatments. Most recently, we codeveloped LEQEMBI, a treatment to address a defining pathology of Alzheimer's disease and we and our collaborator Eisai are in the process of launching this product. We are aware of other products now in development that, if approved, may also compete with LEQEMBI.",

We expect that we will experience competition from both products in additional jurisdictions in the future, which may adversely affect our sales of SPINRAZA.\n\nAdditionally, we are aware of other products now in development that, if launched, may also compete with SPINRAZA. Future sales of SPINRAZA may be adversely affected by the commercialization of competing products.\n\n## FRIEDREICH'S ATAXIA\n\nSKYCLARYS is the first treatment on the market for this indication and could face future competition from pipeline programs under development.\n\n## BIOSIMILARS\n\nBENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI, the three biosimilar products we currently commercialize in certain countries in Europe pursuant to an agreement with Samsung Bioepis, compete with their reference products, ENBREL, HUMIRA and REMICADE, respectively, as well as other biosimilars of those reference products.\n\nBYOOVIZ, a biosimilar product we currently commercialize in the U.S. and certain international markets pursuant to an agreement with Samsung Bioepis, competes with its reference product LUCENTIS, as well as other biosimilars of this reference product.\n\n## GENENTECH RELATIONSHIPS IN OTHER INDICATIONS\n\n## RITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA, GAZYVA and LUNSUMIO in Oncology\n\nRITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA, GAZYVA and LUNSUMIO compete with a number of therapies in the oncology market, including TREANDA (bendamustine HCL), ARZERRA (ofatumumab), IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) and ZYDELIG (idelalisib) and other new innovative oncological therapies.\n\nBiosimilar products referencing RITUXAN have launched in the U.S and are being offered at lower prices. This competition has had a significant adverse impact on the pre-tax profits of our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, as the sales of RITUXAN have decreased substantially compared to prior periods. We expect that biosimilar competition will continue to increase as these products capture additional market share and that this will have a significant adverse impact on our co-promotion profits in the U.S. in future years.\n\n## RITUXAN in Rheumatoid Arthritis\n\nRITUXAN competes with several different types of therapies in the rheumatoid arthritis market, including, among others, traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs such as steroids, methotrexate and cyclosporine, TNF inhibitors, ORENCIA (abatacept), ACTEMRA (tocilizumab) and XELJANZ (tofacitinib) and biosimilar versions of RITUXAN.\n\nWe are also aware of other products, including biosimilars, in development that, if approved, may compete with RITUXAN in the rheumatoid arthritis market.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\n\nA commitment to research is fundamental to our mission. Our research efforts are focused on better understanding the underlying biology of diseases so we can discover and deliver treatments that have the potential to make a real difference in the lives of patients with high unmet medical needs. By applying our expertise in biologics and our capabilities in small molecule, antisense, gene therapy and other technologies, we target specific medical needs where we believe new or better treatments are needed.\n\nWe intend to continue committing significant resources to targeted research and development opportunities where there is a significant unmet need and where a drug candidate has the potential to be highly differentiated. As part of our ongoing research and development efforts, we have devoted significant resources to conducting clinical studies to advance the development of new pharmaceutical products and technologies and to explore the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their labels.",

Outside the U.S. and China we are responsible for commercialization and may pay Denali potential tiered royalties.\n\n## SAMSUNG BIOEPIS\n\nWe have an agreement with Samsung Bioepis to commercialize, over a 10-year term, three anti-TNF biosimilar product candidates in certain countries in Europe and, in the case of BENEPALI, Japan. Under this agreement, we are commercializing BENEPALI, an etanercept biosimilar referencing ENBREL, IMRALDI, an adalimumab biosimilar referencing HUMIRA, and FLIXABI, an infliximab biosimilar referencing REMICADE, in certain countries in Europe.\n\nIn December 2019 we completed a transaction with Samsung Bioepis and acquired an option to extend our existing commercial agreement with Samsung Bioepis for BENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI in certain countries in Europe. We have also secured the exclusive rights to commercialize BYOOVIZ, a ranibizumab biosimilar referencing LUCENTIS, which has been approved in the U.S. and certain international markets, and TOFIDENCE, a tocilizumab biosimilar referencing ACTEMRA, which was approved in the U.S. during the third quarter of 2023. In addition to our commercialization agreements with Samsung Bioepis, we license certain of our proprietary technology to Samsung Bioepis in connection with Samsung Bioepis' development, manufacture and commercialization of its biosimilar products.\n\n## UCB\n\nWe have a collaboration agreement with UCB to jointly develop and commercialize dapirolizumab pegol, an antiCD40L pegylated Fab, for the potential treatment of SLE and other future agreed indications. Both companies will share equally costs incurred for agreed indications, including research, development, sales and marketing expense. If marketing approval is obtained, both companies will co-promote dapirolizumab pegol and share profits and losses equally.\n\n## REGULATORY\n\nOur current and contemplated activities and the products, technologies and processes that result from such activities are subject to substantial government regulation.\n\n## REGULATION OF PHARMACEUTICALS\n\n## PRODUCT APPROVAL AND POST-APPROVAL REGULATION IN THE U.S.\n\n## APPROVAL PROCESS\n\nBefore new pharmaceutical products may be sold in the U.S., preclinical studies and clinical trials of the products must be conducted and the results submitted to the FDA for approval. With limited exceptions, the FDA requires companies to register both pre-approval and post-approval clinical trials and disclose clinical trial results in public databases. Failure to register a trial or disclose study results within the required time periods could result in penalties, including civil monetary penalties. Clinical trial programs must establish efficacy, determine an appropriate dose and dosing regimen and define the conditions for safe use. This is a high-risk process that requires stepwise clinical studies in which the candidate product must successfully meet predetermined endpoints. The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a product are then submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA or a NDA. In response to a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application if it determines the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval.\n\nProduct development and receipt of regulatory approval takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of suitable alternative treatments, potential safety signals observed in preclinical or clinical tests and the risks and benefits of the product as demonstrated in clinical trials. The FDA has substantial discretion in the product approval process, and it is impossible to predict with any certainty whether and when the FDA will grant marketing approval. The agency may require the sponsor of a BLA or NDA to conduct additional clinical studies or to provide other scientific or technical information about the product, and these additional requirements may lead to",

        "page_content": "unanticipated delays or expenses. Furthermore, even if a product is approved, the approval may be subject to limitations based on the FDA's interpretation of the existing pre-clinical and/or clinical data.\n\nThe FDA has developed four distinct approaches intended to facilitate the development and expedite the regulatory review of therapeutically important drugs, especially when the drugs are the first available treatment or have advantages over existing treatments: accelerated approval, fast track, breakthrough therapy and priority review.\n\n- \u00b7 Accelerated Approval : The FDA may grant 'accelerated approval' to products that treat serious or lifethreatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefits to patients over existing treatments. Under this pathway, the FDA may approve a product based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or irreversible morbidity. When approval is based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or morbidity, the sponsor will be required to provide the FDA with confirmatory data postapproval to verify and describe clinical benefit. Under the FDA's accelerated approval regulations, if the FDA concludes that a drug that has been shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require certain post-marketing restrictions to assure safe use. In addition, for products approved under accelerated approval, sponsors may be required to submit all copies of their promotional materials, including advertisements, to the FDA at least 30 days prior to initial dissemination. The FDA may withdraw approval if, for instance, post-marketing studies fail to verify clinical benefit, it becomes clear that restrictions on the distribution of the product are inadequate to ensure its safe use or if a sponsor fails to comply with the conditions of the accelerated approval.\n- \u00b7 Fast Track : The FDA may grant \"fast track\" status to products that treat a serious condition and have data demonstrating the potential to address an unmet medical need or a drug that has been designated as a qualified infectious disease product.\n- \u00b7 Breakthrough Therapy : The FDA may grant 'breakthrough therapy' status to drugs designed to treat, alone or in combination with another drug or drugs, a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and for which preliminary clinical evidence suggests a substantial improvement over existing therapies based on a clinically significant endpoint. Breakthrough therapy status entitles the sponsor to earlier and more frequent meetings with the FDA regarding the development of nonclinical and clinical data and permits the FDA to offer product development or regulatory advice for the purpose of shortening the time to product approval. Breakthrough therapy status does not guarantee that a product will be eligible for priority review and does not ensure FDA approval.\n- \u00b7 Priority Review : 'Priority review' only applies to applications (original or efficacy supplement) for a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition. Priority review may also be granted for any supplement that proposes a labeling change due to studies completed in response to a written request from the FDA for pediatric studies, for an application for a drug that has been designated as a qualified infectious disease product or for any application or supplement for a drug submitted with a priority review voucher.\n- In December 2016 the FDA issued a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher to us in connection with the approval of SPINRAZA. Additionally, as part of our acquisition of Reata in September 2023 we obtained a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher in connection with the approval of SKYCLARYS, which was approved by the FDA in February 2023.\n\n## POST-MARKETING STUDIES\n\nRegardless of the approval pathway employed, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct additional post-marketing studies as a condition of approval to provide data on safety and effectiveness. If a sponsor fails to conduct the required studies, the FDA may withdraw its approval. In addition, if the FDA concludes that a drug that has been shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it can mandate post-marketing restrictions to assure safe use. In such a case, the sponsor may be required to establish rigorous systems to assure use of the product under safe conditions. These systems are usually referred to as REMS. The FDA can impose financial penalties for failing to comply with certain post-marketing commitments, including REMS. In addition, any changes to an approved REMS must be reviewed and approved by the FDA prior to implementation.\n\n## ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING\n\nWe monitor information on side effects and adverse events reported during clinical studies and after marketing approval and report such information and events to regulatory agencies. Non-compliance with the FDA's safety reporting requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent marketing approval. Based on new safety information that emerges after approval, the FDA can mandate product labeling changes, impose a new REMS or the addition of elements to",

These requirements may affect our ability to maintain marketing approval of our products or require us to make significant expenditures to obtain or maintain such approvals.\n\n## APPROVAL OF CHANGES TO AN APPROVED PRODUCT\n\nIf we seek to make certain types of changes to an approved product, such as adding a new indication, making certain manufacturing changes or changing manufacturers or suppliers of certain ingredients or components, the FDA will need to review and approve such changes in advance. In the case of a new indication, we are required to demonstrate with additional clinical data that the product is safe and effective for a use other than what was initially approved. FDA regulatory review may result in denial or modification of the planned changes, or requirements to conduct additional tests or evaluations that can substantially delay or increase the cost of the planned changes.\n\n## REGULATION OF PRODUCT ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION\n\nThe FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities and communications for products under its jurisdiction both before and after approval. Pursuant to FDA guidance, a company can make safety and efficacy claims either in or consistent with the product label. However, physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug's labeling. Such off-label prescribing is common across medical specialties, and often reflects a physician's belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for patients. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the government.\n\n## REGULATION OF COMBINATION PRODUCTS\n\nCombination products are defined by the FDA to include products comprising two or more regulated components (e.g., a biologic and a device). Biologics and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. Some of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under this framework and similar regulations outside the U.S., and we expect that some of our pipeline product candidates may be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well.\n\nIn May 2017 new regulations governing medical devices and in-vitro diagnostic medical devices entered into force in the E.U. The medical devices regulations became applicable in May 2021 and the in-vitro diagnostic medical devices regulations became applicable in May 2022. All products covered by these regulations will be required to comply with them at the end of the transitional periods. These regulations introduce new requirements, including for clinical investigation of certain classifications of medical devices, require increased regulatory scrutiny, enhance the requirements for post market surveillance and vigilance and provide for greater transparency. These regulations also change the requirements for assessment of the medical device components of integral drug-device combination products, necessitating assessment of the device components under both the medical device and medicinal product regulatory regimes.\n\n## PRODUCT APPROVAL AND POST-APPROVAL REGULATION OUTSIDE THE U.S.\n\nWe market our products in numerous jurisdictions outside the U.S. Most of these jurisdictions have product approval and post-approval regulatory processes that are similar in principle to those in the U.S. In Europe, for example, where a substantial part of our ex-U.S. efforts are focused, there are several routes for marketing approval, depending on the type of product for which approval is sought. Under the centralized procedure, a company submits a single application to the EMA. The marketing authorization application is similar to the NDA or BLA in the U.S. and is evaluated by the CHMP, the expert scientific committee of the EMA responsible for human medicines. If the CHMP determines that the MAA fulfills the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy and that the medicine has a positive benefit risk balance, it will adopt a positive opinion recommending the granting of the marketing authorization by the EC. The CHMP opinion is not binding, but is typically adopted by the EC. A MAA approved by the EC is valid in all member states of the E.U. The centralized procedure is required for all biological products, orphan medicinal products and new treatments for neurodegenerative disorders, and it is available for certain other products, including those which constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation.\n\nIn addition to the centralized procedure, the European regulatory framework includes the following options for regulatory review and approval in the E.U. member states:\n\n- \u00b7 a national procedure, where the first application is made to the competent authority in one E.U. member state only;",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 a decentralized procedure, where applicants submit identical applications to several E.U. member states and receive simultaneous approval, if the medicine has not yet been authorized in any E.U. member state; and\n- \u00b7 a mutual recognition procedure, where applicants that have a medicine authorized in one E.U. member state can apply for mutual recognition of this authorization in other E.U. member states\n\nAs in the U.S., the E.U. also has distinct approaches intended to optimize the regulatory pathways for therapeutically important drugs, including the Priority Medicines Evaluation Scheme, accelerated assessment and conditional marketing authorization. Priority Medicines Evaluation Scheme is intended to provide additional support to medicine developers throughout the development process. Regulatory review timelines in the E.U. may be truncated under accelerated assessment for products that address an unmet medical need. In addition, conditional marketing authorizations may be granted for products in the interest of public health, where the benefit of immediate availability outweighs the risk of having less comprehensive data than normally required. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year and can be renewed annually. The marketing authorization holder is required to complete specific obligations (ongoing or new studies and, in some cases, additional activities) with a view to providing comprehensive data confirming that the benefit risk balance is positive. Once comprehensive data on the product have been obtained, the marketing authorization may be converted into a standard marketing authorization.\n\nAside from the U.S. and the E.U., there are countries in other regions where it is possible to receive an \"accelerated\" review whereby the national regulatory authority will commit to truncated review timelines for products that meet specific medical needs.\n\nIn the E.U. there is detailed legislation on pharmacovigilance and extensive guidance on good pharmacovigilance practices. A failure to comply with the E.U. pharmacovigilance obligations may result in significant financial penalties for the marketing authorization holder.\n\nRegardless of the approval process employed, various parties share responsibilities for the monitoring, detection and evaluation of adverse events post-approval, including national competent authorities, the EMA, the EC and the marketing authorization holder. The EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee is responsible for assessing and monitoring the safety of human medicines and makes recommendations on product safety issues. Marketing authorization holders have an obligation to inform regulatory agencies of any new information which may influence the evaluation of benefits and risks of the medicinal product concerned.\n\nIn the U.S., the E.U. and other jurisdictions, regulatory agencies, including the FDA, conduct periodic inspections of NDA, BLA and marketing authorization holders to assess their compliance with pharmacovigilance obligations.\n\n## GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES\n\nRegulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of pharmaceutical and biologic products prior to approving a product. If, after receiving approval from regulatory agencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. We also must adhere to current GMP and product-specific regulations enforced by regulatory agencies following product approval. The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies also conduct periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities and processes following the initial approval of a product. If, as a result of these inspections, it is determined that our equipment, facilities or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, regulatory agencies may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions or remedies against us, including significant financial penalties and the suspension of our manufacturing operations.\n\n## GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICES\n\nThe FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies promulgate regulations and standards for designing, conducting, monitoring, auditing and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are accurate and that the rights and welfare of trial participants are adequately protected (commonly referred to as current GCP). Regulatory agencies enforce current GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites, CROs and institutional review boards. If our studies fail to comply with applicable current GCP guidelines, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and relevant regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Noncompliance can also result in civil or criminal sanctions. We rely on third-parties, including CROs, to carry out many of our clinical trialrelated activities. Failure of such third-parties to comply with current GCP can likewise result in rejection of our clinical trial data or other sanctions.",

        "page_content": "In April 2014 the EC adopted a new Clinical Trial Regulation, which was entered into force in June 2014 but did not apply until January 2022. There are transitional provisions for clinical trials which are ongoing at the date of application. Clinical trial applications could be made under the Clinical Trial Directive (the existing regulatory framework) through January 2023. All clinical trials must fully comply with the Clinical Trial Regulation by January 2025. The regulation harmonizes the procedures for assessment and governance of clinical trials throughout the E.U. and will require that information on the authorization, conduct and results of each clinical trial conducted in the E.U. be publicly available.\n\n## APPROVAL OF BIOSIMILARS\n\nIn the U.S. the PPACA amended the PHS Act to authorize the FDA to approve biological products, referred to as biosimilars or follow-on biologics, that are shown to be \"highly similar\" to previously approved biological products based upon potentially abbreviated data packages. The biosimilar must show it has no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety and effectiveness from the reference product, and only minor differences in clinically inactive components are allowable in biosimilar products. The approval pathway for biosimilars does, however, grant a biologics manufacturer a 12-year period of exclusivity from the date of approval of its biological product before biosimilar competition can be introduced. There is uncertainty, however, as the approval framework for biosimilars originally was enacted as part of the PPACA. There have been, and there are likely to continue to be, federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the PPACA. If the PPACA is repealed, substantially modified or invalidated, it is unclear what, if any, impact such action would have on biosimilar regulation.\n\nA biosimilars approval pathway has been in place in the E.U. since 2003. The EMA has issued a number of scientific and product specific biosimilar guidelines, including requirements for approving biosimilars containing monoclonal antibodies. In the E.U., biosimilars are generally approved under the centralized procedure. The approval pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on reliance on the clinical trial data of an innovator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated, through comprehensive comparability studies, to be 'similar.' In many cases, this allows biosimilars to be brought to market without conducting the full complement of clinical trials typically required for novel biologic drugs.\n\n## ORPHAN DRUG ACT\n\nUnder the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a 'rare disease or condition,' which generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives an initial FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, i.e., the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years following marketing approval, except in certain very limited circumstances, such as if the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the orphan product. Legislation similar to the U.S. Orphan Drug Act has been enacted in other countries to encourage the research, development and marketing of medicines to treat, prevent or diagnose rare diseases. In the E.U., medicinal products that receive and maintain an orphan designation are entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity following approval, protocol assistance and access to the centralized procedure for marketing authorization. SPINRAZA has been granted orphan drug designation in the U.S., the E.U. and Japan. QALSODY and SKYCLARYS have been granted orphan drug designation in the U.S.\n\n## REGULATION PERTAINING TO PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT\n\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our products depend, to a significant extent, on the availability and amount of reimbursement by third-party payors, including governments, private health plans and other organizations. Substantial uncertainty exists regarding the pricing and reimbursement of our products, and drug prices continue to receive significant scrutiny. Governments may regulate coverage, reimbursement and pricing of our products to control cost or affect utilization of our products. Challenges to our pricing strategies, by either government or private stakeholders, could harm our business. The U.S. and foreign governments have enacted and regularly consider additional reform measures that affect health care coverage and costs. Private health plans may also seek to manage cost and utilization by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations. Other payors, including managed care organizations, health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, government health administration authorities and private health insurers, seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies and, in some cases, may impose restrictions on access, coverage or pricing of particular drugs based on perceived value.",

        "page_content": "## WITHIN THE U.S.\n\n- \u00b7 Medicaid : Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate is established by law and is adjusted upward if the AMP increases more than inflation (measured by the Consumer Price Index - Urban). The rebate amount is calculated each quarter based on our report of current AMP and best price for each of our products to the CMS. The requirements for calculating AMP and best price are complex. We are required to report any revisions to AMP or best price previously reported within a certain period, which revisions could affect our rebate liability for prior quarters. In addition, if we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the statute governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program provides for civil monetary penalties.\n- \u00b7 Medicare : Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government. The program covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part B generally covers drugs that must be administered by physicians or other health care practitioners, are provided in connection with certain durable medical equipment or are certain oral anti-cancer drugs and certain oral immunosuppressive drugs. Medicare Part B pays for such drugs under a payment methodology based on the average sales price of the drugs. Manufacturers, including us, are required to provide average sales price information to the CMS on a quarterly basis. The manufacturer-submitted information is used to calculate Medicare payment rates. If a manufacturer is found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of average sales price, the governing statute provides for civil monetary penalties.\n\nMedicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that are not administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government. Each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time-to-time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with manufacturers and pharmacies, and may condition formulary placement on the availability of manufacturer discounts. In addition, manufacturers, including us, are required to provide to the CMS a discount of up to 70.0% on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage gap in their drug benefits.\n\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the IRA, which provides for (i) the government to negotiate prices for select high-cost Medicare Part D drugs (beginning in 2026) and Part B drugs (beginning in 2028), (ii) manufacturers to pay a rebate for Medicare Part B and Part D drugs when prices increase faster than inflation beginning in 2022 for Part D and 2023 for Part B, and (iii) Medicare Part D redesign which replaces the current coverage gap provisions and establishes a $2,000 cap for out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries beginning in 2025, with manufacturers being responsible for 10.0% of costs up to the $2,000 cap and 20.0% after that cap is reached.\n\nThe result of these forthcoming changes for manufacturers, including us, may include: i) a material adverse effect on our revenue on drugs subject to 'negotiation'; ii) new rebate liability for drugs subject to the inflation provisions, and iii) potential significant additional costs related to the Part D re-design. However, as the degree of impact from this legislation on our business depends on a number of forthcoming implementation actions by regulatory authorities, the full extent of the IRA's impact on our sales and, in turn, our business, remains unclear.\n\n- \u00b7 Federal Agency Discounted Pricing : Our products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the FSS. FSS participation is required for our products to be covered and reimbursed by the VA, Department of Defense, Coast Guard and PHS. Coverage under Medicaid, Medicare and the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program is also conditioned upon FSS participation. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that we charge our most-favored non-federal customer for a product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the VA, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TriCare retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing equal to 76.0% of the non-federal average manufacturer price (non-FAMP). An additional discount applies if nonFAMP increases more than inflation (measured by the Consumer Price Index - Urban). In addition, if we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the governing statute provides for civil monetary penalties.\n- \u00b7 340B Discounted Pricing : To maintain coverage of our products under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B, we are required to extend significant discounts to certain covered entities that purchase products under Section 340B of the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and",

        "page_content": "other entities that receive certain types of grants under the PHS Act. For all of our products, we must agree to charge a price that will not exceed the amount determined under statute (the 'ceiling price') when we sell outpatient drugs to these covered entities. In addition, we may, but are not required to, offer these covered entities a price lower than the 340B ceiling price. The 340B discount formula is based on AMP and is generally similar to the level of rebates calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.\n\n## OUTSIDE THE U.S .\n\nOutside the U.S., our products are paid for by a variety of payors, with governments being the primary source of payment. Governments may determine or influence reimbursement of products and may also set prices or otherwise regulate pricing. Negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization of our products. Governments may use a variety of cost-containment measures to control the cost of products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set a price). Budgetary pressures in many countries are continuing to cause governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates and expanded generic substitution and patient cost-sharing.\n\n## REGULATION PERTAINING TO SALES AND MARKETING\n\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care 'fraud and abuse,' including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a prescription drug manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may be no regulations, guidance or court decisions that clarify how the laws apply to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid), claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). In the U.S., federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the federal civil False Claims Act. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed.\n\nLaws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. The laws include federal 'sunshine' provisions. The sunshine provisions apply to pharmaceutical manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government (for re-disclosure to the public) certain payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare practitioners or to teaching hospitals. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. Outside the U.S., other countries have implemented requirements for disclosure of financial interactions with healthcare providers and additional countries may consider or implement such laws.\n\n## OTHER REGULATIONS\n\n## FOREIGN ANTI-CORRUPTION\n\nWe are subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern our international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA's definition of a foreign government official. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that",

U.S. companies that conduct business in the U.K. generally will be subject to the Bribery Act. Penalties under the Bribery Act include significant fines for companies and criminal sanctions for corporate officers under certain circumstances.\n\n## NIH GUIDELINES\n\nWe seek to conduct research at our U.S. facilities in compliance with the current U.S. National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH Guidelines). By local ordinance, we are required to, among other things, comply with the NIH Guidelines in relation to our facilities in RTP, North Carolina and are required to operate pursuant to certain permits.\n\n## OTHER LAWS\n\nOur present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to data privacy and protection, safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive license rights may be subject to national or international antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.\n\nThe European Parliament and the Council of the E.U. adopted a comprehensive GDPR in 2016 to replace the current E.U. Data Protection Directive and related country-specific legislation. The GDPR took effect in May 2018 and governs the collection and use of personal data in the E.U. The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the E.U. to the U.S., provides an enforcement authority and imposes large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to \u20ac20.0 million or 4.0% of the annual global revenue of the infringer, whichever is greater. In addition, several U.S. jurisdictions have similar data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and California Privacy Rights Act.\n\n## MANUFACTURING\n\nWe seek to ensure an uninterrupted supply of medicines to patients around the world. To that end, we continually review our manufacturing capacity, capabilities, processes and facilities. We believe that our manufacturing facilities, together with the third-party contract manufacturing organizations we outsource to, currently provide sufficient capacity for our products and to Samsung Bioepis, our collaboration partner that develops, manufactures and markets biosimilar products, and other strategic contract manufacturing partners.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021 we began construction of a new gene therapy manufacturing facility in RTP, North Carolina to support our gene therapy pipeline across multiple therapeutic areas. The new manufacturing facility will be approximately 197,000 square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $195.0 million. As we continue to advance our research and development prioritization efforts, which includes refocusing our investment in gene therapy, we are evaluating several alternative uses for this facility.",

The oral solid dose products facility can supplement our outsourced small molecule manufacturing capabilities.\n\nWe also have an oligonucleotide synthesis manufacturing facility in RTP, North Carolina. This facility gives us the capability to manufacture both commercial and clinical ASO's and beginning in 2024 this facility will manufacture SPINRAZA.\n\nIn order to support our future growth and drug development pipeline, we built a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Solothurn, Switzerland. In the second quarter of 2021 a portion of the facility (the first manufacturing suite) received a GMP multi-product license from the SWISSMEDIC and was placed into service. The second manufacturing suite became operational in January 2024. Solothurn has been approved for the manufacture of ADUHELM and LEQEMBI by the FDA.\n\nGenentech is responsible for all worldwide manufacturing activities for bulk RITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA and GAZYVA and has sourced the manufacture of certain bulk RITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA and GAZYVA requirements to a third party.\n\nAlkermes currently supplies both VUMERITY and FAMPYRA to us pursuant to separate supply agreements. In October 2019 we entered into a new supply agreement and amended our license and collaboration agreement with Alkermes for VUMERITY. We have elected to initiate a technology transfer and, following a transition period, to manufacture VUMERITY or have VUMERITY manufactured by a third party we have engaged in exchange for paying an increased royalty rate to Alkermes on any portion of future worldwide net commercial sales of VUMERITY that is manufactured by us or our designee. In January 2023 we entered into a new supply agreement with Alkermes for FAMPYRA through January 2025. In December 2023 Alkermes entered into a definitive agreement to sell its development and manufacturing facility to Novo Nordisk, which is expected to close in mid-2024. Alkermes and Novo Nordisk plan to enter into subcontracting arrangements to continue work currently performed at the facility for a period of time after closing the transaction, which may continue through the end of 2025.\n\n## THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURERS\n\nWe principally use third parties to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient and the final product for our small molecule products and product candidates, including TECFIDERA and FUMADERM, and the final drug product for our large molecule products and, to a lesser extent, product candidates.\n\nWe source the majority of our fill-finish and all of our final product assembly and storage operations for our products, along with a substantial part of our label and packaging operations, to a concentrated group of third-party contract manufacturing organizations. Raw materials, delivery devices, such as syringes and auto-injectors, and other supplies required for the production of our products and product candidates are procured from various third-party suppliers and manufacturers in quantities adequate to meet our needs. Continuity of supply of such raw materials, devices and supplies is assured through inventory management and dual sourcing as appropriate. Our third-party service providers, suppliers and manufacturers may be subject to routine cGMP inspections by the FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions and undergo assessment and certification by our quality management",

In addition, one of our contract manufacturers for IMRALDI and BENEPALI entered into a proposed acquisition by a third party, which is expected to close at the end of 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact this will have on our biosimilars business.\n\n## ESG AND CLIMATE-RELATED MATTERS\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nWe continue to refine our ESG strategy and programs so they are designed to deliver meaningful results in the areas where we believe we can have the greatest impact. We have bolstered our efforts in access and health equity and refocused our Foundation efforts on the communities where we operate. Our environmental strategy is designed to balance impact in line with investment and to drive sustainability into our core operations.\n\n## GOVERNANCE\n\nESG oversight is formally embedded into our Board of Director's corporate governance principles and our Board of Directors annually review our ESG strategy and short-and long-term goals. We regularly review our environmental commitments within the context of our business performance, rising costs and supply chain challenges. We remain committed to engaging employees and suppliers.\n\nAs part of our broader commitment to these priorities, we continue to tie a portion of our employees' and executive officers' compensation to advancing our ESG efforts.\n\nWe strive to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning the environment. While it is impossible to predict accurately the future costs associated with environmental compliance and potential remediation activities, compliance with environmental laws is not currently expected to require significant capital expenditures and has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our operations or competitive position. Our Executive Committee has responsibility for evaluating the impact of climate change on the business and overseeing actions taken by the company to limit its adverse impact on the environment.\n\nOur ERM framework is designed to ensure climate-related risks and opportunities are integrated into our overall business strategy. Our ERM team monitors strategic climate-related risks across all aspects of our business and utilizes climate scenarios as part of its assessments. The ERM team evaluates identified risks, including any climate-related physical and transitional risks, by engaging leaders across the company.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nAddressing ESG matters is part of our long-term global strategy and investment in our future and we have seen increased interest from stakeholders and investors on our ESG practices. While we continue to advance our ESG efforts, there is no certainty that we will manage ESG matters in ways that successfully meet rapidly changing expectations from investors, regulators, third party rankings firms, customers and society as a whole. Our inability to manage ESG matters in accordance with expectations can negatively impact our reputation and business.\n\n## CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nWe identify climate risk as the risk of loss arising from climate change which comprises both physical risk and transition risk. Physical risk considers how the physical impacts of climate change (e.g., increased frequency and intensity of storms, drought, fires, floods) can directly damage physical assets or otherwise impact their value or productivity. Transition risk considers how changes in policy, regulations, culture, technology, business practices and market preferences to address climate change (e.g., carbon pricing policies, power generation shifts from fossil fuels to renewable energy) can lead to changes in the value of assets and businesses. Disruption in supply chains, changing customer expectations in the biosimilars market and potential shifts in the regulatory environment that disadvantage the use of fossil fuels, PFAS or other materials may make it difficult for us to fulfill business obligations or cause us to incur substantial expense.\n\nIdentified climate-related material risks and opportunities are reported to our ERM team, which reports to our Executive Committee and Board of Directors. We consider and address those risks and opportunities that are financially material and may impact our business model, as well as mitigation measures that are in place or need to be adopted.\n\nFor additional information on our environment-related risks, please read Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report.",

        "page_content": "## CALIFORNIA CLIMATE LEGISLATION\n\nIn October 2023 California signed into law the CCDAA and the CRFRA. These new environmental disclosure laws will each impose additional climate-related reporting requirements on large companies conducting business in the state of California.\n\nBeginning in 2026 the CCDAA will require companies meeting certain revenue thresholds to publicly disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions for the prior fiscal year. Starting in 2027 companies meeting certain revenue thresholds will also need to publicly disclose Scope 3 GHG emissions for the prior fiscal year. Assurance requirements will also apply to these public disclosures and will be phased-in over time. The CRFRA will require companies meeting certain revenue thresholds to prepare biennial reports disclosing climate-related financial risk, as well as mitigation measures the company has adopted to reduce this risk. The first climate-related financial risk reports are due by January 1, 2026. We expect to be required to comply with both the CCDAA and CRFRA and are actively evaluating the requirements under these acts in order to prepare for compliance. At this time, we expect we may incur additional costs associated with these new laws, including costs associated with implementing or updating existing controls and procedures to collect and maintain required data, as well as costs associated with retaining third-party assurance providers.\n\n## HUMAN CAPITAL\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 7,570 employees worldwide. Approximately 4,140 employees were employed in the U.S. and approximately 3,430 employees were employed in foreign countries.\n\n## DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION\n\nAt Biogen, prejudice, racism and intolerance are unacceptable. We are committed to DE&I across all aspects of our organization, including recruitment, hiring, promotion, retention and development practices. As of December 31, 2023, 31.2% of Biogen's manager-level and above positions were held by ethnic or racial minorities in the U.S. Our policies and practices are global, but the laws in many countries outside the U.S. do not permit us to collect ethnic or racial data on our employees. Globally, 48.6% of Biogen's positions at director-level and above were held by women as of December 31, 2023.\n\nOur DE&I strategy outlines what we believe to be actionable steps to deepen our commitment across the business, building upon a strong foundation. This plan includes the strategy to build our talent and strengthen our leadership, improve health outcomes for underserved communities in the disease areas we treat and contribute to the communities impacting our employees and patients. We plan to create greater awareness and capability in our organization through leadership accountability and transparency.\n\nWe are honored to be recognized as an employer of choice. For the sixth consecutive year, we scored 100% on the Disability:IN's Disability Equality Index, which measures our policies and practices related to disability inclusion. Additionally, for the fourth consecutive year, we were awarded the DI-NC Employer Award by Disability:IN North Carolina for our commitment to champion and invest in disability inclusion at the affiliate and national levels. For the tenth consecutive year, we were recognized as a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality by the Human Rights Campaign, scoring 100% on their Corporate Equality Index.\n\n## STRENGTHENING OUR GLOBAL COMPETENCY\n\nWe are committed to strengthening the DE&I awareness and capability of our employees. We have focused on giving our employees the resources and learning they need to contribute to our strategy. Our people managers are trained on inclusive recruiting and hiring and our global employees are trained on DE&I curriculum.\n\nIn 2022 we introduced GlobeSmart\u00ae, a tool to enhance cross-cultural collaboration, increase cultural agility and further connect our global teams. Our people leaders have used GlobeSmart\u00ae, allowing them to explore different working styles, perspectives and approaches that exist around the globe, getting actionable, personalized advice for better collaboration and teamwork across cultures, and exploring new ways for teams to build trust, strengthen collaboration and leverage diversity.\n\n## PHILOSOPHY ON PAY EQUITY\n\nWe are committed to providing our employees with equal pay for equal work. We establish components and ranges of compensation based on market and benchmark data. Within this context, we strive to pay all employees equitably within a reasonable range, taking into consideration factors such as role; market data; internal equity; job location; relevant experience; and individual, business unit and company performance. In addition, we are committed to",

        "page_content": "providing flexible benefits designed to allow our diverse global workforce to have reward opportunities that meet their varied needs so that they are inspired to perform their best on behalf of patients and stockholders each day.\n\nWe regularly review our compensation practices and analyze the equity of compensation decisions, for individual employees and our workforce as a whole.\n\nWe institute measures, such as communications and trainings, to recognize, interrupt and prevent bias in hiring, performance management and compensation decisions and we provide resources to further develop managers and leaders to help them make equitable decisions about pay.\n\n## RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION\n\nA business-wide priority is to strengthen our culture and the employee experience. To address a highly dynamic labor market, we have examined our global benefits and seek to provide competitive comprehensive total rewards to our employees. We have also conducted an affordability analysis to benchmark whether our benefits program costs are equitable. We examined employee total rewards across four pillars: physical, financial, emotional and social wellbeing.\n\nWe continue to evolve our programs to meet our employees' health and wellness needs, which we believe is essential to attract and retain employees of the highest caliber. We have refreshed our flexible working arrangement policies to allow for more flexibility around work hours to help employees balance the demands of their work and home lives, shifted many of our on-site wellness services to virtual, including virtual behavior health, nutrition, fitness and overall well-being classes and counseling, provided financial planning workshops, expanded our caregiver services and provided additional holidays and time off for recharging, voting and volunteering.\n\n## SUCCESSION PLANNING\n\nEach year we conduct a talent review across our global enterprise that includes, among other important topics, a review of succession plans for many of our roles. To help ensure the long-term continuity of our business, we actively manage the development of talent to fill the roles that are most critical to the ongoing success of our Company. In addition, each year our Board of Directors reviews the succession plan for our executives.\n\n## TALENT AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nMany factors influence employee success and well-being. We work to foster a workplace to allow employees to deliver on our shared mission while helping to mitigate their challenges. From career development to wellness to workplace environment, there are many opportunities to meet employee needs, and to build a workplace where people are empowered to learn, grow and build rewarding careers. Our employees are encouraged to take advantage of an array of professional development resources. Managers are trained to coach employees for performance, and also engage in employee development discussions to support growth and learning.\n\nOpportunities for ongoing learning can contribute to employee related engagement and success. At Biogen, development occurs through on-the-job learning, challenging new assignments, formal training, online learning, mentoring and more. With many employees continuing to work from home, virtual learning plays a key role. Virtual learnings are available through Biogen University as well as LinkedIn Learning. Through Biogen University we offer more than 1,000 instructor-based courses, of which approximately 200 are available virtually. Through LinkedIn Learning we provided employees with access to more than 22,000 on-demand learning modules in 13 languages.\n\nTo create and sustain a workplace as diverse and inclusive as the patients we serve, we offer programs that invest in our talent pipeline and in our current leaders, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Activate, Reflect and Co-Create: Preparing top talent for the rigors of executive roles.\n- \u00b7 Women's Leadership Program: Addressing the unique challenges faced by female leaders to increase influence and impact.\n- \u00b7 Executive Leadership Retreat: Immersing leaders in topics designed to help them shape culture and build resilience.\n- \u00b7 The Partnership, Inc's BioDiversity Fellows Program: To continue to bolster our talent pipeline with a diverse mix of leaders, high potential, mid-career, underrepresented minorities participate in this program, which we helped create.\n- \u00b7 Women on the Rise: Addressing the unique challenges faced by mid-level female leaders to increase influence and impact.\n- \u00b7 Emerging Leaders: Preparing high-potential individual contributors for first-level leadership roles.",

The survey is designed to empower managers and leaders with anonymous information on their practices related to building culture, performance and an engaged workforce, allowing them to create plans and measure efficacy for continuous improvement. We care deeply about employee feedback and are building an analytics community across Human Resources to bring more rigor and sophistication to the collection and analysis of employee opinions. We use their perspectives to guide us to take actions that improve engagement and support and help maintain our reputation as a great place to work for all our employees.\n\n## WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY\n\nThe well-being of our employees is the priority, and we believe every employee plays a role in creating a safe and healthy workplace. Our employees have varied roles and functions, which is why we empower them to promote a safe working environment, regardless of whether work happens in the lab, in an office or in a manufacturing plant. Our policies and practices are intended to protect not only our employees, but also the surrounding communities where we operate.\n\nIn 2023 we continued to make significant progress integrating Human Performance into our Environment, Health and Safety programs. We believe that, when it comes to safety, workers are part of the solution. We encourage employees to collaboratively engage in proactive problem solving through practices such as Open Reporting and Work Observation and Risk Conversations. Additionally, our physical safety program focused on detailed evaluations of critical tasks that could expose employees to serious injury or fatality if controls are absent or not used. The actions we implement as a result of these evaluations reduce the risks associated with these essential activities and ensure our operational systems are safer and more resilient for employees. We also use 'After Action Reviews' following the completion of a project. These reviews enable us to not only focus on areas for improvement, but also to learn and apply good practices from what goes well. By engaging and empowering our employees through such programs, we believe that we can help change how the entire industry approaches safety performance and risk management.",

RISK FACTORS\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business\n\n## We are substantially dependent on revenue from our products.\n\nOur revenue depends upon continued sales of our products as well as the financial rights we have in our anti-CD20 therapeutic programs. A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated on sales of our products in increasingly competitive markets. Any of the following negative developments relating to any of our products or any of our antiCD20 therapeutic programs may adversely affect our revenue and results of operations or could cause a decline in our stock price:\n\n- \u00b7 the introduction, greater acceptance or more favorable reimbursement of competing products, including new originator therapies, generics, prodrugs and biosimilars of existing products and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways;\n- \u00b7 safety or efficacy issues;\n- \u00b7 limitations and additional pressures on product pricing or price increases, including those relating to inflation and those resulting from governmental or regulatory requirements, including those relating to any future potential drug price negotiation under the IRA; increased competition, including from generic or biosimilar versions of our products; or changes in, or implementation of, reimbursement policies and practices of payors and other third-parties;\n- \u00b7 adverse legal, administrative, geopolitical events, regulatory or legislative developments; or\n- \u00b7 our ability to maintain a positive reputation among patients, healthcare providers and others, which may be impacted by our pricing and reimbursement decisions.\n\nLEQEMBI and SKYCLARYS are in the early stages of commercial launch in the U.S. In addition to risks associated with new product launches and the other factors described in these Risk Factors, Biogen's and Eisai's ability to successfully commercialize LEQEMBI and our ability to successfully commercialize SKYCLARYS may be adversely affected due to:\n\n- \u00b7 Eisai's ability to obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement for LEQEMBI;\n- \u00b7 the effectiveness of Eisai's and Biogen's commercial strategy for marketing LEQEMBI;\n- \u00b7 requirements such as participation in a registry and the use of imaging or other diagnostics for LEQEMBI;\n- \u00b7 our ability to obtain approval in other markets;\n- \u00b7 the approval of other new products for the same or similar indications;\n- \u00b7 Eisai's and Biogen's ability to maintain a positive reputation among patients, healthcare providers and others in the Alzheimer's disease community, which may be impacted by pricing and reimbursement decisions relating to LEQEMBI, which are made by Eisai;\n- \u00b7 Biogen's ability to obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement for SKYCLARYS; and\n- \u00b7 the effectiveness of Biogen's commercial strategy for marketing SKYCLARYS.\n\nOur long-term success depends upon the successful development of new products and additional indications for our existing products.\n\nOur long-term success will depend upon the successful development of new products from our research and development activities or our licenses or acquisitions from third-parties, as well as additional indications for our existing products.\n\nProduct development is very expensive and involves a high degree of uncertainty and risk and may not be successful. Only a small number of research and development programs result in the commercialization of a product. It is difficult to predict the success and the time and cost of product development of novel approaches for the treatment of diseases. The development of novel approaches for the treatment of diseases, including development efforts in new modalities such as those based on the antisense oligonucleotide platform and gene therapy, may present additional challenges and risks, including obtaining approval from regulatory authorities that have limited experience with the development of such therapies. For example, we are currently seeking approval of SKYCLARYS in Europe and any delays or challenges regarding its approval in Europe may adversely impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the Reata acquisition.",

        "page_content": "Clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and even if we view data as sufficient to support the safety, effectiveness and/or approval of an investigational therapy, regulatory authorities may disagree and may require additional data, limit the scope of the approval or deny approval altogether. Furthermore, the approval of a product candidate by one regulatory agency does not mean that other regulatory agencies will also approve such product candidate.\n\nSuccess in preclinical work or early-stage clinical trials does not ensure that later stage or larger scale clinical trials will be successful. Clinical trials may indicate that our product candidates lack efficacy, have harmful side effects, result in unexpected adverse events or raise other concerns that may significantly reduce or delay the likelihood of regulatory approval. This may result in terminated programs, significant restrictions on use and safety warnings in an approved label, adverse placement within the treatment paradigm or significant reduction in the commercial potential of the product candidate.\n\nEven if we could successfully develop new products or indications, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of a product candidate or indication if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to the standard of care or we prioritize other opportunities in our pipeline.\n\nSales of new products or products with additional indications may not meet investor expectations.\n\n## If we fail to compete effectively, our business and market position would suffer.\n\nThe biopharmaceutical industry and the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. We compete in the marketing and sale of our products, the development of new products and processes, the acquisition of rights to new products with commercial potential and the hiring and retention of personnel. We compete with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that have a greater number of products on the market and in the product pipeline, substantially greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources and other technological or competitive advantages.\n\nOur products continue to face increasing competition from the introduction of new originator therapies, generics, prodrugs and biosimilars of existing products and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways. Some of these products are likely to be sold at substantially lower prices than our branded products. The introduction of such products as well as other lower-priced competing products has reduced, and may in the future, significantly reduce both the price that we are able to charge for our products and the volume of products we sell, which will negatively impact our revenue. For instance, demand and price for TECFIDERA declined significantly as a result of multiple TECFIDERA generic entrants entering the U.S. market in 2020. In addition, in some markets, when a generic or biosimilar version of one of our products is commercialized, it may be automatically substituted for our product and significantly reduce our revenue in a short period of time.\n\nOur ability to compete, maintain and grow our business may also be adversely affected due to a number of factors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the introduction of other products, including products that may be more efficacious, safer, less expensive or more convenient alternatives to our products, including our own products and products of our collaborators;\n- \u00b7 the off-label use by physicians of therapies indicated for other conditions to treat patients;\n- \u00b7 patient dynamics, including the size of the patient population and our ability to identify, attract and maintain new and current patients to our therapies;\n- \u00b7 the reluctance of physicians to prescribe, and patients to use, our products without additional data on the efficacy and safety of such products;\n- \u00b7 damage to physician and patient confidence in any of our products, generic or biosimilars of our products or any other product from the same class as one of our products, or to our sales and reputation as a result of label changes, pricing and reimbursement decisions or adverse experiences or events that may occur with patients treated with our products or generic or biosimilars of our products;\n- \u00b7 inability to obtain and maintain appropriate pricing and adequate reimbursement for our products compared to our competitors in key markets; or\n- \u00b7 our ability to obtain and maintain patent, data or market exclusivity for our products.\n\nOur business may be adversely affected if we do not successfully execute or realize the anticipated benefits of our strategic and growth initiatives.\n\nThe successful execution of our strategic and growth initiatives may depend upon internal development projects, commercial initiatives and external opportunities, which may include the acquisition and in-licensing of products,",

We have made, and may continue to make, significant operating and capital expenditures for potential new products prior to regulatory approval with no assurance that such investment will be recouped, which may adversely affect our financial condition, business and operations.\n\nThe availability of high quality, fairly valued external product development is limited and the opportunity for their acquisition is highly competitive. As such, we are not certain that we will be able to identify suitable candidates for acquisition or if we will be able to reach agreement to make any such acquisition if suitable candidates are identified.\n\nWe may fail to initiate or complete transactions for many reasons, including failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals as well as a result of disputes or litigation. Furthermore, we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from transactions, or the benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. We may also face additional costs or liabilities in completed transactions that were not contemplated prior to completion.\n\nAny failure in the execution of a transaction, in the integration of an acquired asset or business or in achieving expected synergies could result in slower growth, higher than expected costs, the recording of asset impairment charges and other actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, we recently acquired Reata and are in the process of integrating Reata into our Company. The ultimate success of our acquisition of Reata and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition, including the SKYCLARYS product and anticipated synergies, depends on, among other things, how effective we are in integrating the Biogen and Reata operations.\n\nWe face risks associated with our Fit for Growth program that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated savings and operational efficiencies or that may otherwise harm our business. These risks include delays in implementation of cost optimization actions, loss of workforce capabilities, higher than anticipated separation expenses, litigation and the failure to meet financial and operational targets. In addition, the calculation of the anticipated cost savings and other benefits resulting from our Fit for Growth program are subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant business, economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect or if we experience delays or unforeseen events, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\n\nSales of our products depend, to a significant extent, on adequate coverage, pricing and reimbursement from thirdparty payors, which are subject to increasing and intense pressure from political, social, competitive and other sources. Our inability to obtain and maintain adequate coverage, or a reduction in pricing or reimbursement, could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, revenue and results of operations.\n\nSales of our products depend, to a significant extent, on adequate coverage, pricing and reimbursement from thirdparty payors. When a new pharmaceutical product is approved, the availability of government and private reimbursement for that product, diagnosis of the condition it treats and the cost to administer it may be uncertain, as is the pricing and amount for which that product will be reimbursed.\n\nPricing and reimbursement for our products may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in, and implementation of, federal, state or foreign government regulations or private third-party payors' reimbursement policies;\n- \u00b7 pressure by employers on private health insurance plans to reduce costs;\n- \u00b7 consolidation and increasing assertiveness of payors seeking price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies and, in some cases, the imposition of restrictions on access or coverage of particular drugs or pricing determined based on perceived value;\n- \u00b7 our ability to receive reimbursement for our products or our ability to receive comparable reimbursement to that of competing products; and",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 our value-based contracting program pursuant to which we aim to tie the pricing of our products to their clinical values by either aligning price to patient outcomes or adjusting price for patients who discontinue therapy for any reason, including efficacy or tolerability concerns.\n\nOur ability to set the price for our products varies significantly from country to country and, as a result, so can the price of our products. Governments may use a variety of cost-containment measures to control the cost of products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set a price). Drug prices are under significant scrutiny in the markets in which our products are prescribed; for example the IRA has certain provisions related to drug pricing. We expect drug pricing and other health care costs to continue to be subject to intense political and societal pressures on a global basis. Certain countries set prices by reference to the prices in other countries where our products are marketed. Our inability to obtain and maintain adequate prices in a particular country may not only limit the revenue from our products within that country but may also adversely affect our ability to secure acceptable prices in existing and potential new markets, which may limit market growth and result in reductions in revenue. This may create the opportunity for third-party cross-border trade or influence our decision to sell or not to sell a product, thus adversely affecting our geographic expansion plans and revenue. Additionally, in certain jurisdictions governmental health agencies may adjust, retroactively and/or prospectively, reimbursement rates for our products. Reimbursement for our products by governments, including the timing of any reimbursements, may also be affected by budgetary or political constraints, particularly in challenging economic environments. Government agencies often do not set their own budgets and therefore, have limited control over the amount of money they can spend. In addition, these agencies experience political pressure that may dictate the manner in which they spend money. There can be no assurance that the economic, budgeting or political issues will not worsen and adversely impact sales or reimbursements of our products.\n\nCompetition from current and future competitors may negatively impact our ability to maintain pricing and our market share. New products marketed by our competitors could cause our revenue to decrease due to potential price reductions and lower sales volumes. Additionally, the introduction of generic or biosimilar versions of our products, follow-on products, prodrugs or products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways may significantly reduce the price that we are able to charge for our products and the volume of products we sell.\n\nMany payors continue to adopt benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription costs to patients, including more limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pay or co-insurance obligations and limitations on patients' use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs). Significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and pharmacy benefit managers exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers, significantly increasing discounts and rebates required of manufacturers and limiting patient access and usage. Further consolidation among insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and other payors would increase the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other drug manufacturers. Additional discounts, rebates, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products.\n\nOur failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage, pricing or reimbursement for our products could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, revenue and results of operations.\n\nWe depend on relationships with collaborators and other third-parties for revenue, and for the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of certain of our products and product candidates, which are outside of our full control.\n\nWe rely on a number of collaborative and other third-party relationships for revenue and the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of certain of our products and product candidates. We also outsource certain aspects of our regulatory affairs and clinical development relating to our products and product candidates to third-parties. Reliance on third-parties subjects us to a number of risks, including:\n\n- \u00b7 we may be unable to control the resources our collaborators or third-parties devote to our programs, products or product candidates, which may affect our ability to achieve development goals or milestones;\n- \u00b7 disputes may arise under an agreement, including with respect to the achievement and payment of milestones, payment of development or commercial costs, ownership of rights to technology developed, and the underlying agreement may fail to provide us with significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if the collaborators or third-parties fail to perform;\n- \u00b7 the interests of our collaborators or third-parties may not always be aligned with our interests, and such parties may not pursue regulatory approvals or market a product in the same manner or to the same extent",

If these efforts fail, our product development or commercialization of new products could be delayed, revenue from products could decline and/or we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these arrangements.\n\n## Our results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare reforms.\n\nIn the U.S., federal and state legislatures, health agencies and third-party payors continue to focus on containing the cost of health care. Legislative and regulatory proposals, enactments to reform health care insurance programs (including those contained in the IRA) and increasing pressure from social sources could significantly influence the manner in which our products are prescribed, purchased and reimbursed. For example, provisions of the PPACA have resulted in changes in the way health care is paid for by both governmental and private insurers, including increased rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, the requirement that manufacturers participate in a discount program for certain outpatient drugs under Medicare Part D and the expansion of the number of hospitals eligible for discounts under Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act. These changes have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our business.\n\nWe may face uncertainties as a result of efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the PPACA. There is no assurance that the PPACA, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\n\nThere is substantial public attention on the costs of prescription drugs and we expect drug pricing and other health care costs to continue to be subject to intense political and societal pressures on a global basis. In addition, there have been (including elements of the IRA), and are expected to continue to be, legislative proposals to address prescription drug pricing. Some of these proposals could have significant effects on our business, including an executive order issued in September 2020 to test a 'most favored nation' model for Part B and Part D drugs that tie reimbursement rates to international drug pricing metrics. These actions and the uncertainty about the future of the PPACA and healthcare laws may put downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\n\nThere is also significant economic pressure on state budgets, that may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for our drugs. In recent years, some states have considered legislation and ballot initiatives that would control the prices of drugs, including laws to allow importation of pharmaceutical products from lower cost jurisdictions outside the U.S. and laws intended to impose price controls on state drug purchases. State Medicaid programs are requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which supplemental rebates are not being paid. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expense may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs. This may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding limitation on prices and reimbursement for our products.\n\nIn the E.U. and some other international markets, the government provides health care at low cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility or reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored health care system. Many countries have announced or implemented measures, and may in the future implement new or additional measures, to reduce health care costs to limit the overall level of government",

These measures vary by country and may include, among other things, patient access restrictions, suspensions on price increases, prospective and possible retroactive price reductions and other recoupments and increased mandatory discounts or rebates, recoveries of past price increases and greater importation of drugs from lower-cost countries. These measures have negatively impacted our revenue and may continue to adversely affect our revenue and results of operations in the future.\n\nOur success in commercializing biosimilars is subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in the development, manufacture and commercialization of biosimilars. If we are unsuccessful in such activities, our business may be adversely affected.\n\nThe development, manufacture and commercialization of biosimilar products require specialized expertise and are very costly and subject to complex regulation. Our success in commercializing biosimilars is subject to a number of risks, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Reliance on Third-Parties. We are dependent, in part, on the efforts of collaboration partners and other thirdparties over whom we have limited or no control in the development and manufacturing of biosimilars products. For example, a recently announced potential acquisition of a contract development and manufacturing organization by a third party. If these third-parties fail to perform successfully, or reduce their third party manufacturing production, our biosimilar product development or commercialization of biosimilar products could be delayed, revenue from biosimilar products could decline and/or we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these arrangements;\n- \u00b7 Regulatory Compliance. Biosimilar products may face regulatory hurdles or delays due to the evolving and uncertain regulatory and commercial pathway of biosimilars products in certain jurisdictions;\n- \u00b7 Ability to Provide Adequate Supply. Manufacturing biosimilars is complex. If we encounter any manufacturing or supply chain difficulties we may be unable to meet demand. We are dependent on a third-party for the manufacture of our biosimilar products and such third-party may not perform its obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner or in compliance with applicable regulations and may be unable or unwilling to increase production capacity commensurate with demand for our existing or future biosimilar products;\n- \u00b7 Intellectual Property and Regulatory Challenges. Biosimilar products may face extensive intellectual property clearances and infringement litigation, injunctions or regulatory challenges, which could prevent the commercial launch of a product or delay it for many years or result in imposition of monetary damages, penalties or other civil sanctions and damage our reputation;\n- \u00b7 Failure to Gain Market and Patient Acceptance. Market success of biosimilar products will be adversely affected if patients, physicians and/or payors do not accept biosimilar products as safe and efficacious products offering a more competitive price or other benefit over existing therapies; and\n- \u00b7 Competitive Challenges. Biosimilar products face significant competition, including from innovator products and biosimilar products offered by other companies that may receive greater acceptance or more favorable reimbursement. Local tendering processes may restrict biosimilar products from being marketed and sold in some jurisdictions. The number of competitors in a jurisdiction, the timing of approval and the ability to market biosimilar products successfully in a timely and cost-effective manner are additional factors that may impact our success in this business area. The decision to explore strategic options related to our biosimilars business could adversely affect our operations related to our biosimilars business.\n\n## Risks Related to Intellectual Property\n\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection for our data, intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.\n\nOur success, including our long-term viability and growth, depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and defend patent and other intellectual property rights, including certain regulatory forms of exclusivity, that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. Patent protection and/or regulatory exclusivity in the U.S. and other important markets remains uncertain and depends, in part, upon decisions of the patent offices, courts, administrative bodies and lawmakers in these countries. We may fail to obtain, defend or preserve patent and other intellectual property rights, including certain regulatory forms of exclusivity, or the protection we obtain may not be of sufficient breadth and degree to protect our commercial interests in all countries where we conduct business, which could result in financial, business or reputational harm to us or could cause a decline or volatility in our stock price. In addition, settlements of such proceedings often result in reducing the period of exclusivity and other protections, resulting in a reduction in revenue from affected products.",

        "page_content": "In many markets, including the U.S., manufacturers may be allowed to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator's product and do not need to conduct clinical trials before marketing a competing version of a product after there is no longer patent or regulatory exclusivity. In such cases, manufacturers often charge significantly lower prices and a major portion of the company's revenue may be reduced in a short period of time. In addition, manufacturers of generics and biosimilars may choose to launch or attempt to launch their products before the expiration of our patent or other intellectual property protections.\n\nFurthermore, our products may be determined to infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by thirdparties. Legal proceedings, administrative challenges or other types of proceedings are and may in the future be necessary to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third-parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. Legal proceedings may also be necessary to determine the rights, obligations and payments claimed during and after the expiration of intellectual property license agreements we have entered with third parties. Such proceedings are unpredictable and are often protracted and expensive. Negative outcomes of such proceedings could hinder or prevent us from manufacturing and marketing our products, require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements. A failure to obtain necessary licenses for an infringed product or technology could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products. Furthermore, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain could reduce our profits from the covered products and services. Any of these circumstances could result in financial, business or reputational harm to us or could cause a decline or volatility in our stock price.\n\nRisks Related to Development, Clinical Testing and Regulation of Our Products and Product Candidates\n\nSuccessful preclinical work or early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage trials, regulatory approval or commercial viability of a product.\n\nPositive results in a clinical trial may not be replicated in subsequent or confirmatory trials. Additionally, success in preclinical work or early stage clinical trials does not ensure that later stage or larger scale clinical trials will be successful or that regulatory approval will be obtained. Even if later stage clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may delay or decline approval of our product candidates. Regulatory authorities may disagree with our view of the data, require additional studies, disagree with our trial design or endpoints or not approve adequate reimbursement. Regulatory authorities may also fail to approve the facilities or processes used to manufacture a product candidate, our dosing or delivery methods or companion devices. Regulatory authorities may grant marketing approval that is more restricted than anticipated, including limiting indications to narrow patient populations and the imposition of safety monitoring, educational requirements, requiring confirmatory trials and risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The occurrence of any of these events could result in significant costs and expense, have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and/or cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility.\n\nClinical trials and the development of biopharmaceutical products is a lengthy and complex process. If we fail to adequately manage our clinical activities, our clinical trials or potential regulatory approvals may be delayed or denied.\n\nConducting clinical trials is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. Our ability to complete clinical trials in a timely fashion depends on a number of key factors, including protocol design, regulatory and institutional review board approval, patient enrollment rates and compliance with current Good Clinical Practices. If we or our third-party clinical trial providers or third-party CROs do not successfully carry out these clinical activities, our clinical trials or the potential regulatory approval of a product candidate may be delayed or denied.\n\nWe have opened clinical trial sites and are enrolling patients in a number of countries where our experience is limited. In most cases, we use the services of third-parties to carry out our clinical trial related activities and rely on such parties to accurately report their results. Our reliance on third-parties for these activities may impact our ability to control the timing, conduct, expense and quality of our clinical trials. One CRO has responsibility for a substantial portion of our activities and reporting related to our clinical trials and if such CRO does not adequately perform, many of our trials may be affected, including adversely affecting our expenses associated with such trials. We may need to replace our CROs, which may result in the delay of the affected trials or otherwise adversely affect our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals and commercialize our product candidates.\n\nAdverse safety events or restrictions on use and safety warnings for our products can negatively affect our business, product sales and stock price.\n\nAdverse safety events involving our marketed products, generic or biosimilar versions of our marketed products or products from the same class as one of our products may have a negative impact on our business. Discovery of safety issues with our products could create product liability and could cause additional regulatory scrutiny and",

Changes in how we operate have caused us to modify our business practices in ways that heighten this dependence, including changing the requirement that most of our office-based employees in the U.S. and our other key markets work from the office, with many of our employees now working in hybrid or full-remote positions. As a result, we are increasingly dependent upon our information systems to operate our business and our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security, reliability and adequacy of our information systems and data, which includes use of cloud technologies, including Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Breakdowns, invasions, corruptions, destructions and/or breaches, which impact may include, but not limited to, comprising the capacity, reliability or security of our information systems or those of our business partners, including our cloud tech\n\nnologies, and/or unauthorized access to our data and information could subject us to significant liability, negatively impact our business operations, and/or require replacement of technology and/or sizeable ransom payments. Our information systems, including our cloud technologies, continue to increase in multitude and complexity, increasing our vulnerability when breakdowns, malicious intrusions and random attacks occur. Data privacy or security breaches also pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, patients, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public.\n\nCybersecurity threats and incidents are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect, particularly when they impact vendors, customers or suppliers, and other companies in our supply chain. Cybersecurity threats and incidents are often carried out by motivated, well-resourced, skilled and persistent actors, including nation states, organized crime groups, 'hacktivists' and may include or target employees or contractors acting with careless or malicious intent. Recent developments in the threat landscape include use of AI and machine learning, as well as an increased number of cyber extortion attacks, with higher financial ransom demand amounts and increasing sophistication and variety of ransomware techniques and methodology. Geopolitical instability, including that related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine or the conflict in the Middle East, may increase the risk of cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity threats or incidents may include deployment of harmful malware and key loggers, ransomware, a denial-of-service attack, a malicious website, the use of social engineering and other means to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information systems and data. Cybersecurity threats and incidents also include manufacturing, hardware or software supply chain attacks, which could cause a delay in the manufacturing of products or products produced for contract manufacturing or lead to a data privacy or security breach. Our key business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. In addition, our increased use of cloud technologies heightens these and other operational risks, and any failure by cloud or other technology service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential or propriety information.\n\nWhile we continue to build and improve our systems and infrastructure, including our business continuity plans, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent cybersecurity threats or incidents in our systems and any such incidents could materially adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in material financial, legal, operational or reputational harm to us, loss of competitive advantage or loss of consumer confidence. Our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches.",

        "page_content": "Regulations continue to change as regulators worldwide consider new rules. For example, the SEC has adopted additional disclosure rules regarding cyber security risk management, strategy, governance and incident reporting by public companies. These new regulations or other regulations being considered in Europe and around the world may impact the manner in which we operate.\n\nRegulators are imposing new data privacy and security requirements, including new and greater monetary fines for privacy violations. For example, the E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation established regulations regarding the handling of personal data, and provides an enforcement authority and imposes large penalties for noncompliance. New U.S. data privacy and security laws, such as the CCPA, and others that may be passed, similarly introduce requirements with respect to personal information, and non-compliance with the CCPA may result in liability through private actions (subject to statutorily defined damages in the event of certain data breaches) and enforcement. Failure to comply with these current and future laws, policies, industry standards or legal obligations or any security incident resulting in the unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of personal information may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nManufacturing issues could substantially increase our costs, limit supply of our products and/or reduce our revenue.\n\nThe process of manufacturing our products is complex, highly regulated and subject to numerous risks, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Risks of Reliance on Third-Parties and Single Source Providers. We rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers for many aspects of our manufacturing process for our products and product candidates. In some cases, due to the unique manner in which our products are manufactured, we rely on single source providers of raw materials and manufacturing supplies. These third-parties are independent entities subject to their own unique operational and financial risks that are outside of our control. For example, a recently announced potential acquisition of a contract development and manufacturing organization by a third party. These third-parties may not perform their obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner or in compliance with applicable regulations, and they may be unable or unwilling to increase production capacity commensurate with demand for our existing or future products. Finding alternative providers could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the specialized nature of the services and the need to obtain regulatory approval of any significant changes to our suppliers or manufacturing methods. We cannot be certain that we could reach agreement with alternative providers or that the FDA or other regulatory authorities would approve our use of such alternatives.\n- \u00b7 Global Bulk Supply Risks. We rely on our manufacturing facilities for the production of drug substance for our large molecule products and product candidates. Our global bulk supply of these products and product candidates depends on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities, which could be adversely affected by equipment failures, labor or raw material shortages, geopolitical instability, public health epidemics, natural disasters, power failures, cyber-attacks and many other factors.\n- \u00b7 Risks Relating to Compliance with current GMP (cGMP). We and our third-party providers are generally required to maintain compliance with cGMP and other stringent requirements and are subject to inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities to confirm compliance. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or operations or those of third-parties to receive regulatory approval or pass any regulatory agency inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products. Significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of monetary penalties or other civil or criminal sanctions and damage our reputation.\n- \u00b7 Risk of Product Loss. The manufacturing process for our products is extremely susceptible to product loss due to contamination, oxidation, equipment failure or improper installation or operation of equipment or vendor or operator error. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our products or manufacturing facilities, we may need to close our manufacturing facilities for an extended period of time to investigate and remediate the contaminant.\n\nAny adverse developments affecting our manufacturing operations or the operations of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls or other interruptions in the commercial supply of our products.\n\nFurthermore, factors such as geopolitical events, global health outbreaks, weather events, labor or raw material shortages and other supply chain disruptions could result in difficulties and delays in manufacturing our products, which could have an adverse impact on our results in operations or result in product shortages. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expense for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Such developments could increase our",

New members of management may have different perspectives on programs and opportunities for our business, which may cause us to focus on new opportunities or reduce or change emphasis on our existing programs.\n\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel in a highly competitive environment. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract or retain them. We may face difficulty in attracting and retaining talent for a number of reasons, including management changes, integration related to the Reata acquisition, the underperformance or discontinuation of one or more marketed, pre-clinical or clinical programs, recruitment by competitors or changes in the overall labor market. In addition, changes in our organizational structure or in our flexible working arrangements could impact employees' productivity and morale as well as our ability to attract, retain and motivate employees. We cannot ensure that we will be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary for our operations or that the loss of any personnel will not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the health care industry, we could face increased costs, penalties and a loss of business.\n\nOur activities, and the activities of our collaborators, distributors and other third-party providers, are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions, and are subject to change and evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our business practices. The FDA and comparable foreign agencies directly regulate many of our most critical business activities, including the conduct of preclinical and clinical studies, product manufacturing, advertising and promotion, product distribution, adverse event reporting, product risk management and our compliance with good practice quality guidelines and regulations. Our interactions with physicians and other health care providers that prescribe or purchase our products are also subject to laws and government regulation designed to prevent fraud and abuse in the sale and use of products and place significant restrictions on the marketing practices of health care companies. Health care companies are facing heightened scrutiny of their relationships with health care providers and have been the target of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of laws and government regulation, including claims asserting submission of incorrect pricing information, impermissible off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products, payments intended to influence the referral of health care business, submission of false claims for government reimbursement, antitrust violations or violations related to environmental matters. There is also enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including testing, insurance premium and co-pay assistance programs and donations to third-party charities that provide such assistance. The U.S. government has challenged some of our donations to third-party charities that provide patient assistance. If we, or our vendors or donation recipients, are found to fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations or government guidance in the operation of these or other patient assistance programs, we could be subject to significant fines or penalties. Risks relating to compliance with laws and regulations may be heightened as we continue to expand our global operations and enter new therapeutic areas with different patient populations, which may have different product distribution methods, marketing programs or patient assistance programs from those we currently utilize or support.\n\nConditions and regulations governing the health care industry are subject to change, with possible retroactive effect, including:\n\n- \u00b7 new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or judicial decisions, related to health care availability, pricing or marketing practices, compliance with employment practices, method of delivery, payment for health care products and services, compliance with health information and data privacy and security laws and regulations, tracking and reporting payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, extensive anti-bribery and anti-corruption prohibitions, product serialization and labeling requirements and used product take-back requirements;",

We could also be required to repay amounts we received from government payors or pay additional rebates and interest if we are found to have miscalculated the pricing information we submitted to the government. In addition, legal proceedings and investigations are inherently unpredictable, and large judgments or settlements sometimes occur. While we believe that we have appropriate compliance controls, policies and procedures in place to comply with the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, there is a risk that acts committed by our employees, agents, distributors, collaborators or thirdparty providers might violate such laws or regulations. Whether or not we have complied with the law, an investigation or litigation related to alleged unlawful conduct could increase our expense, damage our reputation, divert management time and attention and adversely affect our business.\n\n## Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.\n\nWe are increasing our presence in international markets, subjecting us to many risks that could adversely affect our business and revenue. There is no guarantee that our efforts and strategies to expand sales in international markets will succeed. Emerging market countries may be especially vulnerable to periods of global and local political, legal, regulatory and financial instability and may have a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices. Certain countries may require local clinical trial data as part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trials, which can add to overall drug development and registration timelines. We may also be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents or distributors and unfamiliar operations and arrangements previously utilized by companies we collaborate with or acquire in emerging markets.\n\nOur sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the impact of public health epidemics on the global economy and the delivery of healthcare treatments;\n- \u00b7 less favorable intellectual property or other applicable laws;\n- \u00b7 the inability to obtain necessary foreign regulatory approvals of products in a timely manner;\n- \u00b7 limitations and additional pressures on our ability to obtain and maintain product pricing, reimbursement or receive price increases, including those resulting from governmental or regulatory requirements;\n- \u00b7 increased cost of goods due to factors such as inflation and supply chain disruptions;\n- \u00b7 additional complexity in manufacturing internationally, including materials manufactured in China;\n- \u00b7 delays in clinical trials relating to geopolitical instability related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the military conflict in the Middle East;\n- \u00b7 the inability to successfully complete subsequent or confirmatory clinical trials in countries where our experience is limited;\n- \u00b7 longer payment and reimbursement cycles and uncertainties regarding the collectability of accounts receivable;\n- \u00b7 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely impact our revenue, net income and value of certain of our investments;\n- \u00b7 the imposition of governmental controls;",

For example, the U.S. FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA's definition of a foreign government official. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, disruption in the supply or availability of our products or suspension of export or import privileges, the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations and damage to our reputation. Any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside of the U.S. could adversely impact our business and financial results. In addition, while we believe that we have appropriate compliance controls, policies and procedures in place to comply with the FCPA, there is a risk that acts committed by our employees, agents, distributors, collaborators or third-party providers might violate the FCPA and we might be held responsible. If our employees, agents, distributors, collaborators or third-party providers are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nWe built a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility and are building a gene therapy manufacturing facility, which will result in the incurrence of significant investment with no assurance that such investment will be recouped.\n\nIn order to support our future growth and drug development pipeline, we have expanded our large molecule production capacity by building a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Solothurn, Switzerland with no assurance that the additional capacity will be required or this investment will be recouped.\n\nAlthough the Solothurn facility was approved by the FDA for ADUHELM and LEQEMBI, there can be no assurance that the regulatory authorities will approve the Solothurn facility for the manufacturing of other products.\n\nAdditionally, we are building a new gene therapy manufacturing facility in RTP, North Carolina with no assurance that this investment will be fully utilized. If we are unable to fully utilize this gene therapy manufacturing facility, charges from excess capacity may occur and would have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIf we are unable to fully utilize our manufacturing facilities, our business may be harmed. Charges resulting from excess capacity may continue to occur and would have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third-parties of counterfeit or unfit versions of our products or stolen products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.\n\nThird-parties might illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or unfit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing, distribution and testing standards. A patient who receives a counterfeit or unfit drug may be at risk for a number of dangerous health consequences. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or unfit drugs sold under our brand name. Inventory that is stolen from warehouses, plants or while intransit, and that is subsequently improperly stored and sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business.\n\nThe increasing use of social media platforms and artificial intelligence based software presents new risks and challenges.\n\nSocial media is increasingly being used to communicate about our products and the diseases our therapies are designed to treat. Social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear and create uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. For example, patients may use social media channels to comment on the effectiveness",

When such disclosures occur, there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend the company or the public's legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our products. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on social media. We may also encounter criticism on social media regarding our company, management, product candidates or products. The immediacy of social media precludes us from having real-time control over postings made regarding us via social media, whether matters of fact or opinion. Our reputation could be damaged by negative publicity or if adverse information concerning us is posted on social media platforms or similar mediums, which we may not be able to reverse. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business. Additionally, the use of AI based software is increasingly being used in the biopharmaceutical industry. Use of AI based software may lead to the release of confidential proprietary information which may impact our ability to realize the benefit of our intellectual property.\n\n## Risks Related to Holding Our Common Stock\n\n## Our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations.\n\nOur quarterly revenue, expense and net income (loss) have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to the risks described in these Risk Factors as well as the timing of charges and expense that we may take.

Our efforts to mitigate the impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates may not be successful. As a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, and other currencies in which we do business will affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways. Our net income may also fluctuate due to the impact of charges we may be required to take with respect to foreign currency hedge transactions. In particular, we may incur higher than expected charges from early termination of a hedge relationship.\n\nOur operating results during any one period do not necessarily suggest the anticipated results of future periods.\n\n## Our investments in properties may not be fully realized.\n\nWe own or lease real estate primarily consisting of buildings that contain research laboratories, office space and manufacturing operations. We may decide to consolidate or co-locate certain aspects of our business operations or dispose of one or more of our properties, some of which may be located in markets that are experiencing high vacancy rates and decreasing property values. If we determine that the fair value of any of our owned properties is lower than their book value, we may not realize the full investment in these properties and incur significant impairment charges or additional depreciation when the expected useful lives of certain assets have been shortened due to the anticipated closing of facilities. If we decide to fully or partially vacate a property, we may incur significant cost, including facility closing costs, employee separation and retention expense, lease termination fees, rent expense in excess of sublease income and impairment of leasehold improvements and accelerated depreciation of assets. Any of these events may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.",

Changes in the value of our investment portfolio could adversely affect our earnings. The value of our investments may decline due to, among other things, increases in interest rates, downgrades of the bonds and other securities in our portfolio, negative company-specific news, biotechnology market sentiment, instability in the global financial markets that reduces the liquidity of securities in our portfolio, declines in the value of collateral underlying the securities in our portfolio and other factors. Each of these events may cause us to record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio or sell investments for less than our acquisition cost. Although we attempt to mitigate these risks through diversification of our investments and continuous monitoring of our portfolio's overall risk profile, the value of our investments may nevertheless decline.\n\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to repurchase shares or that we will repurchase shares at favorable prices.\n\nFrom time to time our Board of Directors authorizes share repurchase programs. The amount and timing of share repurchases are subject to capital availability and our determination that share repurchases are in the best interest of our shareholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and our applicable agreements. Our ability to repurchase shares will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, our results of operations, our financial condition and other factors beyond our control that we may deem relevant. Additionally, the recently enacted IRA includes an excise tax on share repurchases, which will increase the cost of share repurchases. A reduction in repurchases under, or the completion of, our share repurchase programs could have a negative effect on our stock price. We can provide no assurance that we will repurchase shares at favorable prices, if at all.\n\n## We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us.\n\nWe may seek access to the capital and credit markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements and other business initiatives. The capital and credit markets are experiencing, and have in the past experienced, extreme volatility and disruption, which leads to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. In the event of adverse market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital or credit market financing on favorable terms which could significantly increase our financing costs. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our cost of financing and the market price of our securities.\n\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business.\n\nOur indebtedness, together with our significant contingent liabilities, including milestone and royalty payment obligations, could have important consequences to our business; for example, such obligations could:\n\n- \u00b7 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n- \u00b7 limit our ability to access capital markets and incur additional debt in the future;\n- \u00b7 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including business development, research and development and mergers and acquisitions; and\n- \u00b7 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, thereby placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\n\nSome of our collaboration agreements contain change in control provisions that may discourage a third-party from attempting to acquire us.\n\nSome of our collaboration agreements include change in control provisions that could reduce the potential acquisition price an acquirer is willing to pay or discourage a takeover attempt that could be viewed as beneficial to shareholders. Upon a change in control, some of these provisions could trigger reduced milestone, profit or royalty payments to us or give our collaboration partner rights to terminate our collaboration agreement, acquire operational control or force the purchase or sale of the programs that are the subject of the collaboration.\n\n## General Risk Factors\n\nOur effective tax rate fluctuates, and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of accrued amounts.\n\nAs a global biopharmaceutical company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions.

These initiatives focus on common international principles for the entitlement to taxation of global corporate profits and minimum global tax rates. Many countries have or are in the process of enacting legislation intended to implement the OECD GloBE Model Rules effective on January 1, 2024.

Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with state, federal and foreign standards, there will always be the risk of accidental contamination or injury. If we were to become liable for an accident, or if we were to suffer an extended facility shutdown, we could incur significant costs, damages and penalties that could harm our business. Manufacturing of our products and product candidates also requires permits from government agencies for water supply and wastewater discharge. If we do not obtain appropriate permits, including permits for sufficient quantities of water and wastewater, we could incur significant costs and limits on our manufacturing volumes that could harm our business. Additionally, regulators are considering new environmental disclosure rules. For example, the SEC and other regulators are considering environmental disclosure rules and California enacted new environmental disclosure laws in October 2023 that will generally require additional disclosure and reporting by 2026. The new California laws, the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act, each impose additional climate-related reporting requirements on large companies conducting business in the state of California. We expect to be subject to these new laws, which impose extensive reporting obligations about greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related financial risks. These recently enacted and proposed regulations may require us to incur compliance and disclosure costs and require management attention.\n\n## ITEM  1B.   UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNone.\n\n## ITEM  1C.   CYBERSECURITY\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY\n\nWe maintain a technology and cybersecurity program, which includes information security, as part of our overall risk management process with the aim that our information systems, including those of our vendors and other thirdparties, will be resilient, effective and capable of safeguarding against emerging risks and cybersecurity threats. We endeavor to assure our program is appropriately resourced and to attract and retain expert talent to execute it.\n\nIn designing, operating, evaluating and maintaining our program we use internal and external resources and frameworks, including cybersecurity expert consultants, industry working groups, the U.S. NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the U.S. Cybersecurity Agency's National Cyber Incident Scoring System model to benchmark, inform and evaluate the design of our program, our operational capabilities and our program maturity.\n\nConsistent with NIST 800-53, our technology and cybersecurity program and controls include a third party and vendor risk management component. As part of our vendor risk management program, we conduct security assessments prior to engagement of high-risk vendors and other third-party providers and have a monitoring program to evaluate ongoing compliance with our cybersecurity standards.",

Our training and awareness program includes annual cybersecurity awareness training and role-based phishing tests for our employees and for third parties with access to our systems.\n\nOur technology and cybersecurity program focuses on the defense, rapid detection and rapid remediation of cybersecurity threats and incidents. Our program includes systems and processes designed based on defense-indepth and zero-trust architectural principles and that are intended to provide the control capabilities set forth in NIST's 800-53 Rev 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations. Our program also includes cybersecurity policies and a crisis response and management plan that is intended to allow rapid management and response and appropriate communication of cybersecurity threats and incidents.\n\nWe staff a cybersecurity operations center to respond to threats and incidents. Our cybersecurity crisis management plan sets forth the items, procedures and actions we expect to address and follow in the event of a cybersecurity incident, including detection, response, mitigation and remediation. In addition to the cybersecurity operations center and our designated cybersecurity response team, we maintain a cross-functional cybersecurity crisis core team, which includes our CISO and senior representatives from our Legal, Finance, IT and Corporate Security teams.\n\nWhen a potential threat or incident is identified, our cyber security incident response team will assign a risk level classification and initiate the escalation and other steps called for by our plan. All incidents that are initially assessed by the cybersecurity incident response team as potentially high-risk are escalated promptly to our CISO. Our CISO, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer, will determine whether and what elements of our cybersecurity crisis response and management plan should be activated, including escalation to other senior management or our Executive Committee. Our Executive Committee will inform our Board of Directors of cybersecurity incidents, as appropriate, considering a variety of factors, including financial, operational, legal or reputational impact.\n\nOur program's maturity and operational readiness are regularly evaluated by independent experts using the U.S. NIST's CyberSecurity Framework and penetration tests. Our program, and the results of these independent evaluations and testing, are regularly reviewed by our senior management and members of our Board of Directors.\n\n## CYBERSECURITY RISK GOVERNANCE\n\nWe are committed to appropriate cybersecurity governance and oversight. Our technology and cybersecurity program is the principal responsibility of our Chief Information Officer and CISO, each of whom have over 20 years of experience in information systems, including cybersecurity training and experience. Additionally, we have a Cybersecurity steering committee that includes senior representatives from our Legal, Finance and IT departments, which meets regularly to discuss cybersecurity matters.\n\nOur Board of Directors oversees management's processes for identifying and mitigating risks, including cybersecurity and information security risks. Our Audit Committee of our Board of Directors regularly reviews our technology and cybersecurity program and effectiveness, internal audits of our program, independent external expert evaluations of our program's maturity and operational readiness and the results of penetration testing. Our Audit Committee also receives regular cybersecurity updates and education on a broad range of topics, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Current cybersecurity landscape and emerging threats;\n- \u00b7 Status of ongoing cybersecurity initiatives and strategies;\n- \u00b7 Incident report and learnings from any cybersecurity events; and\n- \u00b7 Compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards.\n\nFor additional information on our cybersecurity risks, please read Item 1A.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes beginning on page F-1 of this report.\n\nFor our discussion of the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, please read Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nBiogen is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and delivering innovative therapies for people living with serious and complex diseases worldwide. We have a broad portfolio of medicines to treat MS, have introduced the first approved treatment for SMA, co-developed treatments to address a defining pathology of Alzheimer's disease and launched the first approved treatment to target a genetic cause of ALS. Through our 2023 acquisition of Reata we market the first and only drug approved in the U.S. and the E.U. for the treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older. We are focused on advancing our pipeline in neurology, specialized immunology and rare diseases. We support our drug discovery and development efforts through internal research and development programs and external collaborations.\n\nOur marketed products include TECFIDERA, VUMERITY, AVONEX, PLEGRIDY, TYSABRI and FAMPYRA for the treatment of MS; SPINRAZA for the treatment of SMA; SKYCLARYS for the treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia; QALSODY for the treatment of ALS; and FUMADERM for the treatment of severe plaque psoriasis.\n\nWe also have collaborations with Eisai on the commercialization of LEQEMBI for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Sage on the commercialization of ZURZUVAE for the treatment of PPD and we have certain business and financial rights with respect to RITUXAN for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, CLL and other conditions; RITUXAN HYCELA for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and CLL; GAZYVA for the treatment of CLL and follicular lymphoma; OCREVUS for the treatment of PPMS and RMS; LUNSUMIO for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma; COLUMVI, a bispecific antibody for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; and have the option to add other potential anti-CD20 therapies, pursuant to our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, a wholly-owned member of the Roche Group.\n\nWe commercialize a portfolio of biosimilars of advanced biologics including BENEPALI, an etanercept biosimilar referencing ENBREL, IMRALDI, an adalimumab biosimilar referencing HUMIRA, and FLIXABI, an infliximab biosimilar referencing REMICADE, in certain countries in Europe, as well as BYOOVIZ, a ranibizumab biosimilar referencing LUCENTIS, in the U.S. and certain international markets. We also have exclusive rights to commercialize TOFIDENCE, a tocilizumab biosimilar referencing ACTEMRA. We continue to develop potential biosimilar product SB15, a proposed aflibercept biosimilar referencing EYLEA. In February 2023 we announced that we are exploring strategic options for our biosimilars business.\n\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\nWe seek to ensure an uninterrupted supply of medicines to patients around the world. To that end, we continually review our manufacturing capacity, capabilities, processes and facilities. In order to support our future growth and drug development pipeline, we expanded our large molecule production capacity and built a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Solothurn, Switzerland. In the second quarter of 2021 a portion of the facility (the first manufacturing suite) received a GMP multi-product license from the SWISSMEDIC and was placed into service. The second manufacturing suite became operational in January 2024. Solothurn has been approved for the manufacture of ADUHELM and LEQEMBI by the FDA. We believe that the Solothurn facility will support our anticipated near to midterm needs for the manufacturing of biologic assets, including the commercial launch of LEQEMBI. The plant represents a significant increase in our overall manufacturing capacity and is not yet being fully utilized, resulting in our recording of excess capacity charges. If we are unable to fully utilize our manufacturing facilities, we will incur additional excess capacity charges which would have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn the longer term, our revenue growth will depend upon the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and launch of new commercial products as well as additional indications for our existing products, our ability to obtain",

Business, included in this report. For additional information on our competition and pricing risks that could negatively impact our product sales, please read Item 1A. Risk Factors, included in this report.\n\n## TECFIDERA\n\nMultiple TECFIDERA generic entrants are now in North America, Brazil and certain E.U. countries and have deeply discounted prices compared to TECFIDERA. The generic competition for TECFIDERA has significantly reduced our TECFIDERA revenue and we expect that TECFIDERA revenue will continue to decline in the future.\n\nFollowing a favorable March 2023 decision of the CJEU affirming TECFIDERA's right to regulatory data and marketing protection and the EC determination in May 2023 that TECFIDERA is entitled to an additional year of market protection for its pediatric indication, we believe that TECFIDERA is entitled to regulatory marketing protection in the E.U. until at least February 2, 2025, and are seeking to enforce this protection. In December 2023, the EC revoked all centralized marketing authorizations for generic versions of TECFIDERA. As of December 31, 2023, some of the TECFIDERA generics have not yet fully exited some E.U. markets and we expect removal of all generics from the market will take additional time. We are closely monitoring this situation and working to enforce our legal right to market protection. In addition, we will continue to enforce our EP 2 653 873 patent related to TECFIDERA, which expires in 2028.\n\nFor additional information, please read Note 21, Litigation , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## BUSINESS UPDATE REGARDING MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER DISRUPTIONS\n\nSignificant portions of our business are conducted in Europe, Asia and other international geographies. Factors such as global health outbreaks, adverse weather events, geopolitical events, inflation, labor or raw material shortages and other supply chain disruptions could result in product shortages or other difficulties and delays or increased costs in manufacturing our products. Additionally, global disputes and interruptions in international relationships, including tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements and the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the U.S. or other governments, affect our ability to do business. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs and sanctions being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions.\n\n## CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS\n\nEconomic conditions remain vulnerable as markets continue to be impacted in part by elevated inflation, rising interest rates, global supply chain constraints and recent bank failures.\n\nDuring 2023 concerns arose with respect to the financial condition of certain banking institutions in the U.S., in particular those with exposure to certain types of depositors and large portfolios of investment securities. In March 2023 two such banks were closed and taken over by the FDIC, which created significant market disruption. While we did not have any direct exposure to these institutions, we do maintain our cash at financial institutions, often in balances that exceed the current FDIC insurance limits, and will continue to monitor our cash, cash equivalents and investments and take steps to identify any potential impact and minimize any disruptions on our business.\n\nIf other banks and financial institutions enter receivership or become insolvent in the future due to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets, our ability to access our cash, cash equivalents and investments, including transferring funds, making payments or receiving funds, may be threatened and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\n## GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS\n\nThe ongoing geopolitical tensions related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the recent military conflict in the Middle East have resulted in global business disruptions and economic volatility.\n\nFor example, sanctions and other restrictions have been levied on the government and businesses in Russia. Although we do not have affiliates or employees, in either Russia or Ukraine, we do provide various therapies to patients in Russia through a distributor. In addition, new government sanctions on the export of certain",

The impact of the conflict on our operations and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the severity and duration of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, its impact on regional and global economic conditions and whether the conflict spreads or has effects on countries outside Ukraine and Russia.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine as well as the military conflict in the Middle East and assess any potential impacts on our business, supply chain, partners or customers, as well as any factors that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Revenue generated from sales in Russia and Ukraine represent less than 2.0% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. Revenue generated from sales in the broader Middle East region represents less than 2.0% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 2022\n\nIn August 2022 the IRA was signed into law in the U.S. The IRA introduced new tax provisions, including a 15.0% corporate alternative minimum tax and a 1.0% excise tax on stock repurchases. The provisions of the IRA are effective for periods after December 31, 2022. The IRA did not result in any material adjustments to our income tax provision or other income tax balances as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Preliminary guidance has been issued by the IRS and we expect additional guidance and regulations to be issued in future periods. We will continue to assess its potential impact on our business and results of operations as further information becomes available.\n\nThe IRA also contains substantial drug pricing reforms that may have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry in the U.S. This includes allowing CMS to negotiate a maximum fair price for certain high-priced single source Medicare drugs, as well as redesigning Medicare Part D to reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for beneficiaries, potentially resulting in higher contributions from plans and manufacturers. The IRA also establishes drug inflationary rebate requirements to penalize manufacturers from raising the prices of Medicare covered singlesource drugs and biologics beyond the inflation-adjusted rate. Further, to incentivize biosimilar development, the IRA provides an 8.0% Medicare Part B add-on payment for qualifying biosimilar products for a five-year period.\n\nThe IRA's drug pricing controls and Medicare redesign may have an adverse impact on our sales (particularly for our products that are more substantially reliant on Medicare reimbursement), our business and our results of operations. However, the degree of impact from this legislation on our business depends on a number of implementation decisions. We will continue to assess as further information becomes available.",

The increase was partially offset by a decrease in rest of world SPINRAZA revenue primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange, increased competition, a decrease in pricing and the timing of shipments.\n\n## TOTAL COST AND EXPENSE\n\nIncreased $1,957.2 million or 29.7%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Cost of sales increased $255.1 million, or 11.2%\n- \u00b7 R&D expense increased $230.9 million, or 10.3%\n- \u00b7 SG&A expense increased $146.1 million, or 6.1%\n- \u00b7 Restructuring expense increased $87.7 million, or 66.9%\n- \u00b7 Other income decreased $423.7 million, net\n- \u00b7 The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to unfavorable product mix from increased contract manufacturing revenue, MS product mix and higher idle capacity charges, partially offset by a decrease in excess and obsolescence inventory charges in 2023.\n- \u00b7 The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to clinical trial close out costs incurred in 2023 of approximately $125.4 million and the recognition of $197.0 million in equity-based compensation expense related to our acquisition of Reata.\n- \u00b7 The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily due to the recognition of $196.4 million in equity-based compensation expense related to our acquisition of Reata .\n- \u00b7 The increase in restructuring expense was primarily due to higher severance benefits associated with the 2023 cost savings initiatives as compared to 2022.\n- \u00b7 The decrease in other income, net was primarily due to the pre-tax gain of $1.5 billion recorded in 2022 related to the sale of our equity interest in Samsung Bioepis, partially offset by a pre-tax charge of $900.0 million, plus settlement fees and expenses, related to a litigation settlement agreement\n- \u00b7 Additionally, total cost and expense in 2022 was reduced by a pre-tax gain of approximately $503.7 million related to a sale of a building.",

Net cash flow from operations includes $393.4 million of equity-based compensation expense related to our acquisition of Reata in September 2023.\n- \u00b7 There were no share repurchases of our common stock during 2023 under our 2020 Share Repurchase Program. Approximately $2.1 billion remained available under our 2020 Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2023.\n- \u00b7 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2023, compared to approximately $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to consideration paid for our acquisition of Reata in September 2023.\n\n## RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## DEVELOPMENTS IN KEY COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS\n\n## LEQEMBI (lecanemab)\n\n## United States\n\nIn July 2023 the FDA granted traditional approval of LEQEMBI, an anti-amyloid antibody for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, which was previously granted accelerated approval by the FDA in January 2023. Following the FDA's traditional approval of LEQEMBI, CMS confirmed broader coverage of LEQEMBI.\n\nAdditionally, in March 2023 Eisai announced that the U.S. Veteran's Health Administration will be providing coverage of LEQEMBI to veterans living with early stages of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n## Rest of World\n\nKey developments related to LEQEMBI (lecanemab) in rest of world markets during 2023 consisted of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 In January 2024 we and Eisai announced that the SAG will convene at the request of the CHMP to discuss the MAA of lecanemab that is currently under review by the EMA. The meeting of the SAG is expected to take place during the first quarter of 2024 and the EC decision for the MAA of lecanemab is expected during the first half of 2024.\n- \u00b7 In January 2024 the NMPA approved LEQEMBI in China, with an expected launch date in 2024.\n- \u00b7 In December 2023 we and Eisai announced that LEQEMBI intravenous infusion was launched in Japan.\n- \u00b7 In September 2023 the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approved LEQEMBI in Japan.\n- \u00b7 In January 2023 the EMA accepted for review the MAA for lecanemab.\n- \u00b7 In February 2023 the BLA for lecanemab was granted Priority Review by the NMPA of China.\n- \u00b7 In May 2023 we and Eisai announced the submission of a MAA for lecanemab to the U.K. MHRA in Great Britain, which has been designated by the MHRA for the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway. Additionally, in May 2023 Health Canada accepted for review the NDS for lecanemab.\n- \u00b7 In June 2023 we and Eisai announced the submission of a MAA for lecanemab to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in South Korea.\n\n## ZURZUVAE (zuranolone)\n\nIn August 2023 the FDA approved ZURZUVAE for adults with PPD, pending DEA scheduling, which was completed in October 2023. Upon approval, ZURZUVAE for PPD became the first and only oral, once-daily, 14-day treatment that can provide rapid improvements in depressive symptoms by day 15 for women with PPD. ZURZUVAE for PPD became commercially available in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally, the FDA issued a CRL for the NDA for zuranolone in the treatment of adults with MDD. The CRL stated that the application did not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness to support the approval of zuranolone for the treatment of MDD and that an additional study or studies would be needed. We and Sage are continuing to seek feedback from the FDA and evaluating next steps.",

        "page_content": "## BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\n\n## REATA ACQUISITION\n\nOn September 26, 2023,  we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Reata, a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapeutics that regulate cellular metabolism and inflammation in serious neurologic diseases. As a result of this transaction we acquired SKYCLARYS (omaveloxolone), the first and only drug approved in the U.S. and the E.U. for the treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older, as well as other clinical and preclinical pipeline programs.\n\nUnder the terms of this acquisition, we paid Reata shareholders $172.50 in cash for each issued and outstanding Reata share, which totaled approximately $6.6 billion. In addition, we agreed to pay approximately $983.9 million in cash for Reata's outstanding equity awards, inclusive of employer taxes, of which approximately $590.5 million was attributable to pre-acquisition services and is therefore reflected as a component of total purchase price paid. Of the $983.9 million paid to Reata's equity award holders, we recognized approximately $393.4 million as compensation attributable to the post-acquisition service period, of which $196.4 million was recognized as a charge to selling, general and administrative expense with the remaining $197.0 million as a charge to research and development expense within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023 . These amounts were associated with the accelerated vesting of stock options and RSUs previously granted to Reata employees that required no future services to vest.\n\nFor additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read Note 2, Acquisitions , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## OTHER KEY DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## SKYCLARYS (omaveloxolone)\n\nIn February 2024 the EC approved SKYCLARYS in the E.U. for the treatment of FA in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older. SKYCLARYS is the first treatment approved within the E.U. for this rare, genetic, progressive neurodegenerative disease.\n\n## QALSODY (tofersen)\n\nIn April 2023 the FDA approved QALSODY for the treatment of ALS in adults who have a mutation in the SOD1 gene. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on reduction in plasma neurofilament light chain observed in patients treated with QALSODY. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).\n\n## TECFIDERA\n\nFollowing a favorable March 2023 decision of the CJEU affirming TECFIDERA's right to regulatory data and marketing protection and the EC determination in May 2023 that TECFIDERA is entitled to an additional year of market protection for its pediatric indication, we believe that TECFIDERA is entitled to regulatory marketing protection in the E.U. until at least February 2, 2025, and are seeking to enforce this protection. In December 2023, the EC revoked all centralized marketing authorizations for generic versions of TECFIDERA. As of December 31, 2023, some of the TECFIDERA generics have not yet fully exited some E.U. markets and we expect removal of all generics from the market will take additional time. We are closely monitoring this situation and working to enforce our legal right to market protection. In addition, we will continue to enforce our EP 2 653 873 patent related to TECFIDERA, which expires in 2028.\n\n## CORPORATE MATTERS\n\n## FIT FOR GROWTH\n\nIn 2023 we initiated additional cost saving measures as part of our Fit for Growth program to reduce operating costs, while improving operating efficiency and effectiveness. The Fit for Growth program is expected to generate approximately $1.0 billion in gross operating expense savings and $800.0 million in net operating expense savings by 2025, some of which will be reinvested in various initiatives. The Fit for Growth program is currently estimated to include net headcount reductions of approximately 1,000 employees and we expect to incur restructuring charges ranging from approximately $260.0 million to $280.0 million.\n\nFor additional information on our Fit for Growth program, please read Note 4, Restructuring , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.",

In connection with this termination, we recorded close-out costs of approximately $60.0 million in research and development expense within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## EMBARK STUDY\n\nIn September 2023 we discontinued our EMBARK study for aducanumab. In connection with this discontinuation we recorded termination costs of approximately $43.0 million in research and development expense within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023 .\n\n## ACORDA COLLABORATION\n\nIn January 2024 we notified Acorda of our decision to terminate our collaboration and license agreement, effective January 1, 2025. As a result of this termination, Acorda will regain global commercialization rights to FAMPYRA.\n\n## BIIB122\n\nIn June 2023 we and Denali announced plans to terminate the Phase 3 LIGHTHOUSE study for BIIB122, a small molecule inhibitor of LRRK2 in Parkinson's disease. The protocol for the Phase 2b LUMA study for BIIB122 in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease was amended to now include eligible patients with a LRRK2 genetic mutation in addition to continuing to enroll eligible patients with early-stage idiopathic Parkinson's disease.\n\n## BIIB093\n\nIn April 2023 we announced that we would terminate the development of BIIB093 (glibenclamide IV), currently in a Phase 3 study for LHI and a Phase 2 study for brain contusion, due to operational challenges and other strategic considerations. In connection with this termination, we recorded close-out costs of approximately $13.2 million in research and development expense within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## BIIB131\n\nIn April 2023 we announced that we will be pausing the initiation of a Phase 2b study for BIIB131 (TMS-007) for acute ischemic stroke and will continue to assess whether to initiate this study. We sold the rights to BIIB131 to a third-party biopharmaceutical company in exchange for an upfront with potential milestones and future royalties on global sales.\n\n## BIIB132\n\nIn April 2023 we announced that we would discontinue further development of BIIB132 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, as part of our ongoing research and development prioritization initiative.",

We are also aware of a biosimilar entrant of TYSABRI that was approved in the U.S. in August 2023 and the E.U. in September 2023. We believe that future sales of TYSABRI may be adversely affected by the entrance of this biosimilar.\n\nWe believe that we have resolved previously reported manufacturing issues at our VUMERITY contract manufacturer. In addition, we are in the process of securing regulatory approval for a secondary source of supply. We do not anticipate a supply shortage in 2024 and are currently focused on rebuilding adequate inventory.",

In February 2024 the EC approved SKYCLARYS in the E.U. for the treatment of FA in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older.\n\nIn 2024 we expect growth in rare disease revenue as we continue to launch SKYCLARYS in the U.S. Despite competition from a gene therapy product and an oral product, we anticipate SPINRAZA revenue to be relatively flat in 2024. We expect moderate growth in SPINRAZA in the U.S. as well as continued access expansion in emerging markets to offset increased competition and the impact of loading dose dynamics.",

BYOOVIZ launched in the U.S. in June 2022 and became commercially available in July 2022 through major distributors in the U.S. In 2023 BYOOVIZ became commercially available in certain international markets. During the third quarter of 2023 the FDA approved TOFIDENCE, a tocilizumab biosimilar referencing ACTEMRA, which we expect to become commercially available during 2024.\n\nIn 2024 we anticipate modest growth in revenue from our biosimilars business driven by the continued launch of BYOOVIZ in the U.S. and rest of world, offset in part by lower pricing in certain markets.\n\nWe continue to work with our third-party contract manufacturers for IMRALDI and BENEPALI to address supply constraints. If not resolved these supply constraints could have an adverse impact on 2024 sales. In addition, one of our contract manufacturers for IMRALDI and BENEPALI entered into a proposed acquisition by a third party, which is expected to close at the end of 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact this will have on our biosimilars business.\n\nIn February 2023 we announced that we are exploring strategic options for our biosimilars business.",

After an anti-CD20 product is approved, we record our share of the development and sales and marketing expense related to that product as a reduction of our share of pre-tax profits in revenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs.\n\nWe are aware of several other anti-CD20 molecules, including biosimilar products, that have been approved and are competing with RITUXAN and GAZYVA in the oncology and other markets. Biosimilar products referencing RITUXAN have launched in the U.S and are being offered at lower prices. This competition has had a significant adverse impact on the pre-tax profits of our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, as the sales of RITUXAN have decreased substantially compared to prior periods. We expect that biosimilar competition will continue to increase as these products capture additional market share and that this will have a significant adverse impact on our copromotion profits in the U.S. in future years.",

As of December 31, 2023, these batch commitments have been satisfied and we expect that our contract manufacturing revenue will be lower in 2024, compared to 2023, as we are no longer supplying contract manufacturing customers in this manner.\n\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Eisai, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## ROYALTY AND OTHER REVENUE\n\nRoyalty and other revenue primarily reflects the royalties we receive from net sales on products related to patents that we have out-licensed, as well as royalty revenue on biosimilar products from our license arrangements with Samsung Bioepis and our 50.0% share of LEQEMBI product revenue, net and cost of sales, including royalties, as we are not the principal.\n\nFor additional information on our collaborative arrangements with Samsung Bioepis, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## RESERVES FOR DISCOUNTS AND ALLOWANCES\n\nRevenue from product sales is recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances, including those associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain international markets where we operate.\n\nThese reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer). These estimates reflect our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. If actual results vary, we adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.",

In accordance with contractual terms, wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product. The majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration. Provisions for estimated product returns are recognized in the period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to product sales.\n\nFor 2023 compared to 2022, the increase in returns was primarily driven by higher return rates in the U.S.\n\nFor additional information on our revenue reserves, please read Note 5, Revenue, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.",

Contract manufacturing revenue includes LEQEMBI inventory produced for Eisai, beginning in the first quarter of 2023 upon the accelerated approval of LEQEMBI in the U.S. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was adversely affected by LEQEMBI batches due to minimal margins. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in excess and obsolescence inventory charges as 2022 included a write-off of approximately $275.0 million during the first quarter of 2022 of excess inventory and contractual commitments related to ADUHELM.\n\nAs a result of our acquisition of Reata in September 2023 we recorded a fair value step-up adjustment related to the acquired inventory of SKYCLARYS of approximately $1.3 billion. This fair value step-up adjustment will be amortized to cost of sales within our consolidated statements of income when the inventory is sold, which is expected to be within approximately 3 years from the acquisition date. For the year ended December 31, 2023, amortization from the fair value step-up adjustment as a result of inventory sold during the fourth quarter was approximately $31.5 million. For additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read Note 2, Acquisitions , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## Write Downs and Other Charges\n\nInventory amounts written down as a result of excess, obsolescence or unmarketability totaled $124.4 million, $336.2 million and $167.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.",

The development stage reported is based upon the program status when incurred. Therefore, the same program could be reflected in different development stages in the same year.\n\n- \u00b7 Research and discovery: represents costs incurred to support our discovery research and translational science efforts.\n- \u00b7 Early stage programs: are programs in Phase 1 or Phase 2 development.\n- \u00b7 Late stage programs: are programs in Phase 3 development or in registration stage.\n- \u00b7 Marketed products: includes costs associated with product lifecycle management activities including, if applicable, costs associated with the development of new indications for existing products.\n- \u00b7 Other research and development costs: A significant amount of our research and development costs consist of indirect costs incurred in support of overall research and development activities and non-specific programs, including activities that benefit multiple programs, such as management costs, as well as depreciation, information technology and facility-based expenses. These costs are considered other research and development costs in the table above and are not allocated to a specific program or stage. For several of our programs, the research and development activities are part of our collaborative and other relationships. Our costs reflect our share of the total costs incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2023, other research and development costs also includes approximately $197.0 million of equity-based compensation expense incurred as a result of our acquisition of Reata in September 2023.\n\nExcluding any milestone and upfront payments, we expect our core research and development expense to decrease in 2024, while continuing to invest in our pipeline. This is primarily due to the continued realization of our cost savings initiatives and the one-time costs incurred from our acquisition of Reata in September 2023 of approximately $197.0 million. We intend to continue committing significant resources to targeted research and development opportunities where there is a significant unmet need and where a drug candidate has the potential to be highly differentiated.\n\nFor additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read Note 2, Acquisitions , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.",

        "page_content": "## SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE\n\nFor 2023 compared to 2022, selling, general and administrative expense increased by approximately 6.1% primarily due to the recognition of approximately $196.4 million in equity-based compensation expense related to our acquisition of Reata in September 2023. Additionally, we incurred transaction and integration-related expense of approximately $34.6 million related to this acquisition. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense was also due to a $31.0 million obligation to Eisai related to the termination of the co-promotion agreement for our MS products in Japan during 2023 and approximately $11.5 million of accelerated depreciation, associated with exiting a leased property, recognized during the second quarter of 2023. The increases were partially offset by the impact of cost-reduction measures realized during 2023.\n\nWe expect selling, general and administrative costs to continue to decline in 2024 due to the continued realization of our cost savings initiatives and the one-time costs incurred from our acquisition of Reata in 2023 of approximately $196.4 million.\n\nFor additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read Note 2, Acquisitions , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. For additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Eisai, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nOur amortization expense is based on the economic consumption and impairment of intangible assets. Our most significant amortizable intangible assets are related to TYSABRI, AVONEX, SPINRAZA, VUMERITY and SKYCLARYS, which was obtained as part of our acquisition of Reata in September 2023. For additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read Note 2, Acquisitions , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\nFor 2023 compared to 2022, the decrease in amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets was primarily due to higher impairment charges in 2022 of approximately $119.6 million, compared to no impairment charges in 2023.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets reflects the impact of a $119.6 million impairment charge related to vixotrigine (BIIB074) for the potential treatment of DPN.\n\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets, excluding impairment charges, totaled $240.6 million, $246.3 million and $252.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets, excluding impairment charges, over the three years was primarily due to a lower rate of amortization for acquired intangible assets.\n\nFor additional information on the amortization and impairment of our acquired intangible assets, please read Note 7, Intangible Assets and Goodwill , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## COLLABORATION PROFIT SHARING/(LOSS REIMBURSEMENT)\n\nCollaboration profit sharing/(loss reimbursement) primarily includes Samsung Bioepis' 50.0% share of the profit or loss related to our biosimilars 2013 commercial agreement with Samsung Bioepis. In the third quarter of 2023 we began recognizing collaboration profit sharing/(loss reimbursement) related to Sage's 50.0% share of income and expense in the U.S. related to ZURZUVAE for PPD. During 2022 we recognized Eisai's 45.0% share of income and expense in the U.S. related to the ADUHELM Collaboration Agreement. Beginning January 1, 2023, Eisai receives only a tiered royalty based on net sales of ADUHELM, and will no longer share global profits and losses.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized net profit-sharing expense of $223.5 million and $217.4 million, respectively, to reflect Samsung Bioepis' 50.0% sharing of the net collaboration profits.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized net reductions to our operating expense of approximately $4.7 million to reflect Sage's 50.0% share of net collaboration losses in the U.S.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized net reductions to our operating expense of approximately $224.7 million to reflect Eisai's 45.0% share of net collaboration losses in the U.S. for ADUHELM.\n\nFor additional information on our collaboration and license arrangements with Samsung Bioepis, Sage and Eisai, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.",

        "page_content": "## (GAIN) LOSS ON FAIR VALUE REMEASUREMENT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the changes in fair value of our contingent consideration obligations were primarily due to the discontinuation of further development efforts related to vixotrigine for the potential treatment of TGN and DPN, resulting in a reduction of our contingent consideration obligations of approximately $195.4 million, reducing the remaining fair value of vixotrigine to zero, as well as changes in the interest rates used to revalue our contingent consideration liabilities.\n\nFor additional information on our IPR&D intangible assets, please read Note 7, Intangible Assets and Goodwill , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## RESTRUCTURING CHARGES\n\n## 2023 FIT FOR GROWTH RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM\n\nIn 2023 we initiated additional cost saving measures as part of our Fit for Growth program to reduce operating costs, while improving operating efficiency and effectiveness. The Fit for Growth program is expected to generate approximately $1.0 billion in gross operating expense savings and $800.0 million in net operating expense savings by 2025, some of which will be reinvested in various initiatives. The Fit for Growth program is currently estimated to include net headcount reductions of approximately 1,000 employees and we expect to incur restructuring charges ranging from approximately $260.0 million to $280.0 million.\n\nTotal charges incurred from our 2023 cost saving initiatives are summarized as follows:\n\n|                                     | For the Years Ended December 31, 2023   | For the Years Ended December 31, 2023      | For the Years Ended December 31, 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| (In millions)                       | Severance Costs                         | Accelerated  Depreciation and  Other Costs | Total                                   |\n| Selling, general and administrative | $  -                                    | $  23.3                                    | $  23.3                                 |\n| Research and development            | -                                       | 1.2                                        | 1.2                                     |\n| Restructuring charges               | 153.4                                   | 34.6                                       | 188.0                                   |\n| Total charges                       | $  153.4                                | $  59.1                                    | $  212.5                                |\n\nOther Costs: includes costs associated with items such as asset abandonment and write-offs, facility closure costs, pretax gains and losses resulting from the termination of certain leases, employee non-severance expense, consulting fees and other costs.\n\n## REATA INTEGRATION\n\nFollowing the close of our Reata acquisition, we implemented an integration plan designed to realize operating synergies through cost savings and avoidance. These amounts are primarily related to severance and are expected to be paid by the end of 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized approximately $30.4 million of net pre-tax restructuring charges related to employee severance costs.\n\n## 2022 COST SAVING INITIATIVES\n\nIn December 2021 and May 2022 we announced our plans to implement a series of cost-reduction measures during 2022. These savings are being achieved through a number of initiatives, including reductions to our workforce, the substantial elimination of our commercial ADUHELM infrastructure, deprioritization of certain research and development programs, the consolidation of certain real estate locations and operating efficiencies across our selling, general and administrative and research and development functions. Charges related to our 2022 cost saving initiatives were substantially incurred during 2022 with remaining payments expected to be made through 2026.",

This sale resulted in a pre-tax gain on sale of approximately $503.7 million, net of transaction costs, which is reflected within gain on sale of building in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. Simultaneously, with the close of this transaction we leased back the building for a term of approximately 5.5 years, which resulted in the recognition of approximately $168.2 million in a new lease liability and right-of-use asset recorded within our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022. The sale and immediate leaseback of this building qualified for sale and leaseback treatment and is classified as an operating lease.\n\nFor additional information on our 125 Broadway sale and leaseback transaction, please read Note 11, Property, Plant and Equipment and Note 12, Leases , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET\n\nFor 2023 compared to 2022, the change in other (income) expense, net primarily reflects a pre-tax gain recorded during 2022 of approximately $1.5 billion related to the sale of our 49.9% equity interest in Samsung Bioepis, partially offset by a pre-tax charge recorded during 2022 of approximately $900.0 million, plus settlement fees and expenses, related to a litigation settlement agreement to resolve a qui tam litigation relating to conduct prior to 2015. Additionally, other (income) expense, net for 2023 reflects higher interest income driven by higher interest rates in 2023.\n\n## NET (GAINS) LOSSES IN EQUITY SECURITIES\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net unrealized and realized losses on our holdings in equity securities were approximately $270.0 million and $5.2 million, respectively, compared to net unrealized losses and realized (gains) losses of approximately $264.7 million and zero, respectively, in 2022.\n\n- \u00b7 The net unrealized losses recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily reflect a decrease in the aggregate fair value of our investments in Sage, Denali, Sangamo and Ionis common stock of approximately $248.5 million.\n- \u00b7 The net unrealized losses recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily reflect a decrease in the aggregate fair value of our investments in Denali and Sangamo common stock of approximately $278.0 million, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of Ionis and Sage common stock of approximately $27.3 million.\n\n## INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net interest income was $29.6 million, compared to net interest expense of $157.3 million in 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates leading to greater interest income earned on our investments in 2023, compared to 2022.\n\nFor 2024 compared to 2023, we anticipate an increase in net interest expense as a result of lower cash balances leading to lower interest income due to the funding of our acquisition of Reata.\n\nFor additional information on the sale of our equity interest in Samsung Bioepis, please read Note 3, Dispositions , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.",

The factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate include changes in tax laws, variability in the allocation of our taxable earnings among multiple jurisdictions, the amount and characterization of our research and development expense, the levels of certain deductions and credits, acquisitions and licensing transactions.\n\nFor 2023 compared to 2022, the decrease in our effective tax rate was driven by the impact of the non-cash changes in the value of our equity investments, the impact of Fit for Growth related expenses and Reata acquisitionrelated expenses, as well as the combined net unfavorable tax rate impacts in 2022 related to a litigation settlement agreement, the sale of our equity interest in Samsung Bioepis, the impact of a Neurimmune valuation allowance and an international reorganization to align with global tax developments. The change also benefits from the resolution of an uncertain tax matter during the first quarter of 2023 related to tax credits.\n\nFor additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read Note 2, Acquisitions , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\nFor additional information on the litigation settlement agreement, please read Note 18, Other Consolidated Financial Statement Detail , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\nFor additional information on our income taxes, uncertain tax positions and income tax rate reconciliation, please read Note 17, Income Taxes , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## EQUITY IN (INCOME) LOSS OF INVESTEE, NET OF TAX\n\nIn February 2012 we entered into a joint venture agreement with Samsung BioLogics establishing an entity, Samsung Bioepis, to develop, manufacture and market biosimilar products.\n\nIn April 2022 we completed the sale of our 49.9% equity interest in Samsung Bioepis to Samsung BioLogics. Following the sale of Samsung Bioepis we no longer recognize gains or losses associated with Samsung Bioepis' results of operations and amortization related to basis differences.\n\nPrior to this sale, we recognized our share of the results of operations related to our investment in Samsung Bioepis under the equity method of accounting one quarter in arrears when the results of the entity became available, which was reflected as equity in (income) loss of investee, net of tax in our consolidated statements of income. We also recognized amortization on certain basis differences resulting from our November 2018 investment.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized net income on our investment of $2.6 million, reflecting our share of Samsung Bioepis' operating profits, net of tax, totaling $17.0 million offset by amortization of basis differences totaling $14.4 million. This amount reflects our share of results prior to the sale of Samsung Bioepis as the results are recognized one quarter in arrears.\n\nFor additional information on the sale of our equity interest in Samsung Bioepis, please read Note 3, Dispositions , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Samsung Bioepis, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, NET OF TAX\n\nOur consolidated financial statements include the financial results of a variable interest entity, Neurimmune, as we determined that we were the primary beneficiary.\n\nIn November 2023 we notified Neurimmune of our decision to terminate the Neurimmune Agreement. Subsequent to the termination, we reconsidered our relationship with Neurimmune and determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. As a result, we recorded a net gain on the deconsolidation of",

We believe that generic and biosimilar competition for many of our key products, the continued overall decline of our MS business and our investments in the launch of key new products and the development of our pipeline will have a significant adverse impact on our future cash flow from operations.\n\nWe believe that our existing funds, when combined with cash generated from operations and our access to additional financing resources, if needed, are sufficient to satisfy our operating, working capital, strategic alliance, milestone payment, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. In addition, we may choose to opportunistically return cash to shareholders and pursue other business initiatives, including acquisition and licensing activities. We may also seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements, strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources should we identify a significant new opportunity.\n\nOn September 26, 2023 , we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Reata for $6.6 billion and $983.9 million for outstanding equity awards. This transaction was funded with cash on hand and the issuance of a $1.0 billion term loan. Additionally, we paid approximately $459.9 million to settle outstanding debt obligations acquired as part of our acquisition of Reata. For additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read Note 2, Acquisitions , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.",

Risk Factors and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in this report.\n\n## LIQUIDITY\n\n## WORKING CAPITAL\n\nWorking capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Our working capital was $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2023, compared to $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2022. The change in working capital reflects a decrease in total current assets of approximately $2,931.9 million and an increase in total current liabilities of approximately $161.5 million. The changes in total current assets and total current liabilities were primarily driven by the following:\n\n## CURRENT ASSETS\n\n- \u00b7 $3,842.9 million decrease in cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities primarily due to consideration paid for our acquisition of Reata as well as the early repayment of $350.0 million in outstanding debt obligations associated with our Reata acquisition ;\n- \u00b7 $235.6 million decrease in other current assets primarily due to the receipt of $812.5 million from Samsung BioLogics related to the sale of Samsung Bioepis, partially offset by the final deferred payment of $437.5 million now due within one year; and\n- \u00b7 $1,183.0 million increase in inventory primarily due to the fair value step-up adjustment for acquired inventory from our acquisition of Reata.\n\n## CURRENT LIABILITIES\n\n- \u00b7 $88.2 million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments;\n- \u00b7 $102.2 million increase in accrued expense and other primarily reflecting accrued costs related to our acquisition of Reata; and\n- \u00b7 $150.0 million increase in current portion of debt due to the short-term portion of our outstanding 2023 Term Loan related to our acquisition of Reata.\n\nFor additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read Note 2, Acquisitions , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\nFor additional information on our 2023 Term Loan, please read Note 13, Indebtedness , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\nFor additional information on the sale of our equity interest in Samsung Bioepis, please read Note 3, Dispositions , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately $1.0 billion compared to approximately $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in the balance was primarily due to the use of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to fund our acquisition of Reata. In connection with our acquisition of Reata we paid approximately $6.6 billion for the issued and outstanding shares of Reata and $983.9 million related to Reata's outstanding equity awards, inclusive of employer taxes. Additionally, we assumed a payable to Blackstone of approximately $300.0 million related to a one-time contract termination fee to eliminate potential future royalty obligations related to SKYCLARYS, which was triggered as part of the change in control provision under Reata's funding agreement with Blackstone. For additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read Note 2, Acquisitions , to these consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\nUntil required for another use in our business, we typically invest our cash reserves in bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. and foreign government instruments, overnight reverse repurchase agreements and other interest-bearing marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy. It is our policy to mitigate credit risk in our cash reserves and marketable securities by maintaining a well-diversified portfolio that limits the amount of exposure as to institution, maturity and investment type. We have experienced no significant limitations in our liquidity resulting from uncertainties in the banking sector.",

Operating cash flow in 2023 was also negatively impacted by the $393.4 million in equity-based compensation payments associated with the Reata acquisition. Operating cash flow in 2022 was also negatively impacted by the payment of of approximately $900.0 million, plus settlement fees and expenses, related to a litigation settlement agreement to resolve a qui tam litigation relating to conduct prior to 2015.\n\n## INVESTING ACTIVITIES\n\nFor 2023 compared to 2022, the change in net cash flow provided by (used in) investing activities was primarily due to a $6.9 billion payment made in 2023 for our acquisition of Reata, net of cash acquired, partially offset by higher net proceeds from the sales of marketable securities in the current period. Additionally, we received $582.6 million in 2022 related to the sale of one of our buildings.",

We had debt repayments of approximately $1.0 billion and share repurchases of $750.0 million during the same period in 2022.\n\nFor additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read Note 2, Acquisitions , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES\n\n## LONG-TERM DEBT AND TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENTS\n\nOur long-term obligations primarily consist of long-term debt related to our Senior Notes with final maturity dates ranging between 2025 and 2051. As of December 31, 2023, our outstanding balance related to long-term debt was $6,788.2 million.\n\nIn connection with our acquisition of Reata in September 2023 we entered into a $1.5 billion term loan credit agreement. On the closing date of the Reata acquisition we drew $1.0 billion from the 2023 Term Loan, comprised of a $500.0 million floating rate 364-day tranche and a $500.0 million floating rate three-year tranche. The remaining unused commitment of $500.0 million was terminated. During the fourth quarter of 2023 we repaid $350.0 million of the 364-day tranche. As of December 31, 2023, we had $650.0 million outstanding under the 2023 Term Loan, of which $150.0 million was outstanding under the 364-day tranche and $500.0 million was outstanding under the three-year tranche.\n\n## 2020 REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\n\nIn January 2020 we entered into a $1.0 billion, five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which we are permitted to draw funds for working capital and general corporate purposes. The terms of the revolving credit facility include a financial covenant that requires us not to exceed a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings and were in compliance with all covenants under this facility.\n\nFor a summary of the fair values of our outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, please read Note 8, Fair Value Measurements, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\nFor additional information on our Senior Notes, 2023 Term Loan and credit facility please read, Note 13, Indebtedness , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS\n\nIn October 2020 our Board of Directors authorized our 2020 Share Repurchase Program, which is a program to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock. Our 2020 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date. All share repurchases under our 2020 Share Repurchase Program will be retired. Under our 2020 Share Repurchase Program, we repurchased and retired approximately 3.6 million and 6.0 million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $750.0 million and $1.8 billion during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were no share repurchases of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2023. Approximately $2.1 billion remained available under our 2020 Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## CAPITAL EXPENDITURES\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021 we began construction of a new gene therapy manufacturing facility in RTP, North Carolina to support our gene therapy pipeline across multiple therapeutic areas. The new manufacturing facility will be approximately 197,000 square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $195.0 million. As we continue to advance our research and development prioritization efforts, which includes refocusing our investment in gene therapy, we are evaluating several alternative uses for this facility.",

Reata entered into agreements to pay royalties on future sales of SKYCLARYS, which will cumulatively range in the low- to mid-single digits.\n\nFor additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read Note 2, Acquisitions , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## CONTINGENT DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY AND COMMERCIAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS\n\nBased on our development plans as of December 31, 2023, we could trigger potential future milestone payments to third parties of up to approximately $5.1 billion, including approximately $0.9 billion in development milestones, approximately $0.4 billion in regulatory milestones and approximately $3.8 billion in commercial milestones, as part of our various collaborations, including licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones was not considered probable as of December 31, 2023, such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023 we accrued a milestone payment due to Sage of $75.0 million upon the first commercial sale of ZURZUVAE for PPD in the U.S., which was recorded within intangible assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets, and subsequently paid in January 2024. If certain clinical and commercial milestones are met, we may pay up to approximately $109.0 million in milestones in 2024 under our current agreements.\n\n## OTHER FUNDING COMMITMENTS\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have several ongoing clinical studies in various clinical trial stages. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. The contracts with CROs are generally cancellable, with notice, at our option. We recorded accrued expense of approximately $47.2 million in our consolidated balance sheets for expenditures incurred by CROs as of December 31, 2023. We have approximately $669.0 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## TAX RELATED OBLIGATIONS\n\nWe exclude liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2023, we have approximately $172.0 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have accrued income tax liabilities of approximately $419.5 million and $558.0 million, respectively, under the Transition Toll Tax. Of the amounts accrued as of December 31, 2023, approximately $185.4 million is expected to be paid within one year. The Transition Toll Tax is being paid in installments over an eight--year period, which started in 2018, and will not accrue interest.\n\n## OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\n\nWe do not have any relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We consolidate variable interest entities if we are the primary beneficiary.",

On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Other significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nWe recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenue following the five-step model prescribed under FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers : (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligations.\n\n## PRODUCT REVENUE\n\nIn the U.S., we sell our products primarily to wholesale and specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies. In other countries, we sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors, hospitals, pharmacies and other third-party distribution partners. These customers subsequently resell our products to health care providers and patients. In addition, we enter into arrangements with health care providers and payors that provide for government-mandated or privately-negotiated discounts and allowances related to our products.\n\nProduct revenue is recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer. We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial.\n\n## RESERVES FOR DISCOUNTS AND ALLOWANCES\n\nProduct revenue is recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with our customers, health care providers or payors, including those associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain of the international markets in which we operate. Our process for estimating reserves established for these variable consideration components do not differ materially from our historical practices.\n\nProduct revenue reserves, which are classified as a reduction in product revenue, are generally characterized in the following categories: discounts, contractual adjustments and returns.\n\nThese reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer). Our estimates of reserves established for variable consideration are calculated based upon a consistent application of our methodology utilizing the expected value method. These estimates reflect our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. The transaction price, which includes variable consideration reflecting the impact of discounts and allowances, may be subject to constraint and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the amount of the",

        "page_content": "cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. If actual results vary, we adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, a 10.0% change in our discounts, contractual adjustments and reserves would have resulted in a decrease of our pre-tax earnings by approximately $345.5 million and $338.6 million, respectively.\n\nIn addition to discounts, rebates and product returns, we also maintain certain customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel that provide us with inventory management, data and distribution services, which are generally reflected as a reduction of revenue. To the extent we can demonstrate a separable benefit and fair value for these services we classify these payments in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.\n\nFor additional information on our revenue, please read Note 5, Revenue , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IPR&D\n\nWhen we purchase a business, the acquired IPR&D is measured at fair value, capitalized as an intangible asset and tested for impairment at least annually, as of October 31, until commercialization, after which time the IPR&D is amortized over its estimated useful life. If we acquire an asset or group of assets that do not meet the definition of a business under applicable accounting standards, the acquired IPR&D is expensed on its acquisition date. Future costs to develop these assets are recorded to research and development expense as they are incurred.\n\nWe have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, intangible assets through the acquisition of biotechnology companies or through the consolidation of variable interest entities. These intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products, IPR&D product candidates and priority review vouchers. When significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired, we generally engage an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. Management will determine the fair value of less significant identifiable intangible assets acquired. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in-process projects;\n- \u00b7 projecting regulatory approvals;\n- \u00b7 estimating future cash flow from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects; and\n- \u00b7 developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project.\n\nWe believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates.\n\nIf these projects are not successfully developed, the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods. Additionally, the value of the acquired intangible assets may become impaired. No assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales, development costs or profitability, or the events associated with such projects, will transpire as estimated.\n\n## INVENTORY\n\nAt each reporting period we review our inventories for excess or obsolescence and write-down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires management to make estimates based on assumptions about the future demand of our products, product expiration dates, estimated future sales and our general future plans. If customer demand subsequently differs from our forecasts, we may be required to record additional charges for excess inventory.\n\nAlthough we believe that the assumptions we use in estimating inventory write-downs are reasonable, no assurance can be given that significant future changes in these assumptions or changes in future events and market conditions could result in different estimates.\n\nDuring 2022 and 2021 we wrote-off excess inventory of $275.0 million and $120.0 million, respectively, related to ADUHELM.",

Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We review our intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, as of October 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nWhen performing our impairment assessment, we calculate the fair value using the same methodology as described above under Acquired Intangible Assets, including IPR&D . If the carrying value of our acquired IPR&D exceeds its fair value, then the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Changes in estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our acquired IPR&D could result in an impairment. Impairments are recorded within amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets in our consolidated statements of income.\n\nBased on our most recent impairment assessment we incurred impairment charges of approximately $119.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, mainly related to the discontinuation of IPR&D programs. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had no impairment charges. For additional information on our impairments, please read Note 7, Intangible Assets and Goodwill , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\nOur most significant intangible assets are our acquired and in-licensed rights and patents. Acquired and in-licensed rights and patents primarily relate to our acquisition of all remaining rights to TYSABRI. We amortize the intangible assets related to our marketed products using the economic consumption method based on revenue generated from the products underlying the related intangible assets. An analysis of the anticipated lifetime revenue of our marketed products is performed annually during our long-range planning cycle and whenever events or changes in circumstances would significantly affect anticipated lifetime revenue of the relevant products.\n\nFor additional information on the impairment charges related to our long-lived assets during 2023, 2022 and 2021, please read Note 7, Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nWe prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction's tax laws and regulations. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. Upon our election in the fourth quarter of 2018 to record deferred taxes for GILTI, we have included amounts related to GILTI taxes within temporary difference.\n\nSignificant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. In performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In making this determination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and the effects of tax planning strategies. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\n\nWe account for uncertain tax positions using a 'more likely than not' threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. We adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. Our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished, through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations, the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the 'more likely than not' threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process. We consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures, including all appeals and administrative reviews, we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine",

        "page_content": "or re-examine the related tax position. We also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\n\n## BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\n\nBusiness combinations are recorded using the acquisition method of accounting. The results of operations of the acquired company are included in our results of operations beginning on the acquisition date, and assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on the acquisition date at their respective fair values. Any excess of consideration transferred over the net carrying value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date is recognized as goodwill.\n\nWe use the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a form of the income approach, utilizing post-tax cash flow and discount rates in estimating the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired when allocating the purchase consideration paid for the acquisition. The estimates of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets involve significant judgment by management and include assumptions with measurement uncertainty, such as the amount and timing of projected cash flow, long-term sales forecasts, discount rates and additionally for IPR&D intangible assets, the timing and probability of regulatory and commercial success.\n\nWe use the net realizable value method in estimating the fair value of acquired finished goods and work-in-process inventory. Raw materials acquired are valued using the replacement cost method.\n\nTransaction and restructuring costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. If we determine the assets acquired do not meet the definition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination.\n\n## ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nWe are subject to certain risks that may affect our results of operations, cash flow and fair values of assets and liabilities, including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rate movements and equity price exposure as well as changes in economic conditions in the markets in which we operate as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the military conflict in the Middle East. We manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates through various financial instruments, including derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency options, interest rate lock contracts and interest rate swap contracts. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions, and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK\n\nOur results of operations are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. As a result, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flow can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily with respect to the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc.\n\nWhile the financial results of our global activities are reported in U.S. dollars, the functional currency for most of our foreign subsidiaries is their respective local currency. Fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our operating results, often in ways that are difficult to predict. In particular, as the U.S. dollar strengthens versus other currencies, the value of the non-U.S. revenue will decline when reported in U.S. dollars. The impact to net income as a result of a strengthening U.S. dollar will be partially mitigated by the value of non-U.S. expense, which will also decline when reported in U.S. dollars. As the U.S. dollar weakens versus other currencies, the value of the non-U.S. revenue and expense will increase when reported in U.S. dollars.\n\nWe have established revenue and operating expense hedging and balance sheet risk management programs to protect against volatility of future foreign currency cash flow and changes in fair value caused by volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2018 the International Practices Task Force of the Center for Audit Quality categorized Argentina as a country with a projected three-year cumulative inflation rate greater than 100.0%, which indicated that Argentina's economy is highly inflationary. This categorization did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position as of December 31, 2023, and is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position in the future. In December 2023 the Argentinian Peso experienced a substantial devaluation following a presidential election. The devaluation resulted in a $16.0 million charge recorded",

We use foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options to manage foreign currency risk, with the majority of our forward contracts and options used to hedge certain forecasted revenue and operating expense transactions denominated in foreign currencies in the next 12 months. We do not engage in currency speculation. For a more detailed disclosure of our revenue and operating expense hedging program, please read Note 10, Derivative Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\nOur ability to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on revenue and net income diminishes as significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are sustained over extended periods of time. In particular, devaluation or significant deterioration of foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to mitigate and likely to negatively impact earnings. The cash flow from these contracts are reported as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flow.\n\n## BALANCE SHEET RISK MANAGEMENT HEDGING PROGRAM\n\nWe also use forward contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exposure related to certain balance sheet items. The primary objective of our balance sheet risk management program is to mitigate the exposure of foreign currency denominated net monetary assets and liabilities of foreign affiliates. In these instances, we principally utilize currency forward contracts. We have not elected hedge accounting for the balance sheet related items. The cash flow from these contracts are reported as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flow.\n\nThe following quantitative information includes the impact of currency movements on forward contracts used in our revenue, operating expense and balance sheet hedging programs. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, a hypothetical adverse 10.0% movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar across all maturities would result in a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of forward contracts of approximately $249.4 million and $293.7 million, respectively. The estimated fair value change was determined by measuring the impact of the hypothetical exchange rate movement on outstanding forward contracts. Our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments is subject to assumptions and actual impact could be significantly different. The quantitative information about market risk is limited because it does not take into account all foreign currency operating transactions.\n\n## INTEREST RATE RISK\n\nOur investment portfolio includes cash equivalents and short-term investments. The fair value of our marketable securities is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates. The potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement across all maturities. As of December 31, 2022, we estimate that such hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $11.7 million to our interest rate sensitive instruments. The fair values of our investments were determined using third-party pricing services or other market observable data.\n\nWe partially funded our Reata acquisition through available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of December 31, 2023 , we have sold all of our marketable debt securities. For additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read Note 2, Acquisitions , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.",

We attempt to minimize the risks related to cash and cash equivalents and investments by investing in a broad and diverse range of financial instruments. We have established guidelines related to credit ratings and maturities intended to safeguard principal balances and maintain liquidity. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. We minimize credit risk resulting from derivative instruments by choosing only highly rated financial institutions as counterparties.\n\nWe operate in certain countries where weakness in economic conditions, including the effects of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the military conflict in the Middle East, can result in extended collection periods. We continue to monitor these conditions, including the volatility associated with international economies and the relevant financial markets, and assess their possible impact on our business. To date, we have not experienced any significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable.\n\nWe believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## EQUITY PRICE RISK\n\nOur strategic investment portfolio includes investments in equity securities of certain biotechnology companies. While we are holding such securities, we are subject to equity price risk, and this may increase the volatility of our income in future periods due to changes in the fair value of equity investments. We may sell such equity securities based on our business considerations, which may include limiting our price risk.\n\nChanges in the fair value of these equity securities are impacted by the volatility of the stock market and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors. The potential change in fair value for equity price sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical 10.0% adverse movement. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, a hypothetical adverse 10.0% movement would result in a hypothetical decrease in fair value of approximately $41.7 million and $79.1 million, respectively.\n\n## ITEM 8.

Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by a company's board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n- \u00b7 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n- \u00b7 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n- \u00b7 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in its 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework.\n\nBased on our assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\n\nWe excluded Reata from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, as Reata was acquired by our Company in a business combination during 2023. The total assets and total revenue of Reata represents 1.0% and 0.6%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report, which is included herein.\n\n## ITEM 9B.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nReferences in these notes to \"Biogen,\" the \"company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our\" refer to Biogen Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nBiogen is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and delivering innovative therapies for people living with serious and complex diseases worldwide. We have a broad portfolio of medicines to treat MS, have introduced the first approved treatment for SMA, co-developed treatments to address a defining pathology of Alzheimer's disease and launched the first approved treatment to target a genetic cause of ALS. Through our 2023 acquisition of Reata we market the first and only drug approved in the U.S. and the E.U. for the treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older. We are focused on advancing our pipeline in neurology, specialized immunology and rare diseases. We support our drug discovery and development efforts through internal research and development programs and external collaborations.\n\nOur marketed products include TECFIDERA, VUMERITY, AVONEX, PLEGRIDY, TYSABRI and FAMPYRA for the treatment of MS; SPINRAZA for the treatment of SMA; SKYCLARYS for the treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia; QALSODY for the treatment of ALS; and FUMADERM for the treatment of severe plaque psoriasis.\n\nWe also have collaborations with Eisai on the commercialization of LEQEMBI for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Sage on the commercialization of ZURZUVAE for the treatment of PPD and we have certain business and financial rights with respect to RITUXAN for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, CLL and other conditions; RITUXAN HYCELA for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and CLL; GAZYVA for the treatment of CLL and follicular lymphoma; OCREVUS for the treatment of PPMS and RMS; LUNSUMIO for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma; COLUMVI, a bispecific antibody for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; and have the option to add other potential anti-CD20 therapies, pursuant to our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, a wholly-owned member of the Roche Group.\n\nWe commercialize a portfolio of biosimilars of advanced biologics including BENEPALI, an etanercept biosimilar referencing ENBREL, IMRALDI, an adalimumab biosimilar referencing HUMIRA, and FLIXABI, an infliximab biosimilar referencing REMICADE, in certain countries in Europe, as well as BYOOVIZ, a ranibizumab biosimilar referencing LUCENTIS, in the U.S. and certain international markets. We also have exclusive rights to commercialize TOFIDENCE, a tocilizumab biosimilar referencing ACTEMRA. We continue to develop potential biosimilar product SB15, a proposed aflibercept biosimilar referencing EYLEA.\n\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships , to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nOur consolidated financial statements reflect our financial statements, those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary. For consolidated entities where we own or are exposed to less than 100.0% of the economics, we record net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of income equal to the percentage of the economic or ownership interest retained in such entities by the respective noncontrolling parties. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\n\nIn determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, we apply a qualitative approach that determines whether we have both (1) the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to that entity. We continuously assess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as changes to existing relationships or future transactions may result in us consolidating or deconsolidating one or more of our collaborators or partners. In November 2023 we terminated the Neurimmune Agreement, which resulted in the deconsolidation of our variable interest entity, Neurimmune.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expense and related",

On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenue following the five-step model prescribed under FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers : (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligations.\n\n## Product Revenue\n\nIn the U.S., we sell our products primarily to wholesale and specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies. In other countries, we sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors, hospitals, pharmacies and other third-party distribution partners. These customers subsequently resell our products to health care providers and patients. In addition, we enter into arrangements with health care providers and payors that provide for government-mandated or privately-negotiated discounts and allowances related to our products.\n\nProduct revenue is recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer. We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial.\n\n## Reserves for Discounts and Allowances\n\nProduct revenue is recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with our customers, health care providers or payors, including those associated with the implementation of pricing actions in certain of the international markets in which we operate.\n\nProduct revenue reserves, which are classified as a reduction in product revenue, are generally characterized in the following categories: discounts, contractual adjustments and returns.\n\nThese reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer). Our estimates of reserves established for variable consideration are calculated based upon a consistent application of our methodology utilizing the expected value method. These estimates reflect our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. The transaction price, which includes variable consideration reflecting the impact of discounts and allowances, may be subject to constraint and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. If actual results vary, we adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.\n\nDiscounts include trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives. Trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives primarily relate to estimated obligations for credits to be granted to wholesalers for remitting payment on their purchases within established incentive periods and credits to be granted to wholesalers for compliance with various contractually-defined inventory management practices, respectively. We determine these reserves based on our historical experience, including the timing of customer payments.\n\nContractual adjustments primarily relate to Medicaid and managed care rebates in the U.S., pharmacy rebates, copayment (copay) assistance, VA and PHS discounts, specialty pharmacy program fees and other governmental rebates or applicable allowances.\n\n- \u00b7 Medicaid rebates: relate to our estimated obligations to states under established reimbursement arrangements. Rebate accruals are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expense and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Our liability for Medicaid rebates consists of estimates for claims",

The wholesaler charges us for the difference between what the wholesaler pays for the products and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. Rebate and chargeback reserves are established in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and a reduction in the net accounts receivable. Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the qualified healthcare provider from the wholesaler, and we generally issue credits for such amounts within a few weeks of the wholesaler notifying us about the resale. Our reserves for VA, PHS and other chargebacks consist of amounts for inventory that exists at the wholesalers that we expect will be sold to qualified healthcare providers and chargebacks that wholesalers have claimed for which we have not issued a credit.\n- \u00b7 Managed care rebates: represent our estimated obligations to third-parties, primarily pharmacy benefit managers. Rebate accruals are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expense and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. These rebates result from performance-based goals, formulary position and price increase limit allowances (price protection). The calculation of the accrual for these rebates is based on an estimate of the coverage patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual period.\n- \u00b7 Copay assistance: represents financial assistance to qualified patients, assisting them with prescription drug copayments required by insurance. The calculation of the accrual for copay is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with inventory that exists in the distribution channel at period end.\n- \u00b7 Pharmacy rebates: represent our estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to specific pharmacies. Rebate accruals are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expense and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. These rebates result from contracted discounts on product purchased or product dispensed. The calculation of the accrual for these rebates is based on an estimate of the pharmacy's buying or dispensing patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over the contractual period.\n- \u00b7 Other governmental rebates: non-U.S. pharmaceutical taxes or applicable allowances primarily relate to mandatory rebates and discounts in international markets where government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payors for healthcare.\n\nProduct return reserves are established for returns made by wholesalers and are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to product revenue. In accordance with contractual terms, wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product. The majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration. Expired product return reserves are estimated through a comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product.\n\nIn addition to discounts, rebates and product returns, we also maintain certain customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel that provide us with inventory management, data and distribution services, which are generally reflected as a reduction of revenue. To the extent we can demonstrate a separable benefit and fair value for these services we classify these payments in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Revenue from Anti-CD20 Therapeutic Programs\n\nOur collaboration with Genentech is within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Agreements , which provides guidance on the presentation and disclosure of collaborative arrangements. For purposes of this footnote, we refer to RITUXAN and RITUXAN HYCELA collectively as RITUXAN.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\nOur share of the pre-tax co-promotion profits on RITUXAN, GAZYVA and LUNSUMIO and royalty revenue on sales of OCREVUS, resulted from an exchange of a license. As we do not have future performance obligations under the license or collaboration agreement, revenue is recognized as the underlying sales occur.\n\nRevenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs consist of:\n\n- (i)   our share of pre-tax profits and losses in the U.S. for RITUXAN, GAZYVA and LUNSUMIO;\n- (ii) royalty revenue on sales of OCREVUS; and\n- (ii)   other revenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, which consists of our share of pre-tax co-promotion profits on RITUXAN in Canada, royalties on net sales of COLUMVI in the U.S. and royalties on sales of LUNSUMIO outside the U.S.\n\nPre-tax co-promotion profits on RITUXAN, GAZYVA and LUNSUMIO are calculated and paid to us by Genentech and the Roche Group. Pre-tax co-promotion profits consist of net sales to third-party customers less applicable costs to manufacture, third-party royalty expense, distribution, selling and marketing expense and joint development expense incurred by Genentech and the Roche Group. Our share of the pre-tax profits on RITUXAN, GAZYVA and LUNSUMIO include estimates that are based on information received from Genentech and the Roche Group. These estimates are subject to change and actual results may differ.\n\nWe recognize royalty revenue on sales of OCREVUS based on our estimates from third party and market research data of OCREVUS sales occurring during the corresponding period. Differences between actual and estimated royalty revenue will be adjusted for in the period in which they become known, which is generally expected to be the following quarter.\n\nPrior to regulatory approval, we record our share of the expense incurred by the collaboration for the development of anti-CD20 products within research and development expense and pre-commercialization costs within selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income. After an anti-CD20 product is approved, we record our share of the development and sales and marketing expense related to that product as a reduction of our share of pre-tax profits in revenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs.\n\nAccordingly, Biogen recorded its share of the expense incurred in connection with the development of LUNSUMIO within research and development expense and its share of pre-commercialization costs within selling, general and administrative expense through December 2022, when regulatory approval was granted by the FDA. Beginning in January 2023 our share of pre-tax profits and losses in the U.S. for LUNSUMIO was reflected as a component of revenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs within our consolidated statements of income.\n\nFor additional information on our relationship with Genentech, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Contract Manufacturing, Royalty and Other Revenue\n\n## Contract Manufacturing Revenue\n\nWe record contract manufacturing revenue primarily from amounts earned under contract manufacturing agreements with our strategic customers. Revenue under contract manufacturing agreements is recognized when the customer obtains control of the product, which may occur at a point in time or over time depending on the terms and conditions of the agreement. During the first quarter of 2023 we began recognizing contract manufacturing revenue for LEQEMBI, upon accelerated approval of LEQEMBI in the U.S. Prior to accelerated approval, our share of contract manufacturing amounts related to LEQEMBI were recognized in research and development expense within our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Royalty and Other Revenue\n\nRoyalty and other revenue primarily reflects the royalties we receive from net sales on products related to patents that we have out-licensed, as well as royalty revenue on biosimilar products from our collaboration arrangements with Samsung Bioepis and our 50.0% share of LEQEMBI product revenue, net and cost of sales, including royalties, as we are not the principal. These arrangements resulted from an exchange of a license and utilize the sales and usage based royalty exception. Therefore, royalties received are recognized as the underlying sales occur.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\n## Collaborative and Other Relationships\n\nWe also have a number of significant collaborative and other third-party relationships for revenue and for the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of certain of our products and product candidates. Where we are the principal on sales transactions with third parties, we recognize revenue, cost of sales and operating expense on a gross basis in their respective lines in our consolidated statements of income. Where we are not the principal on sales transactions with third parties, our share of the revenue, cost of sales and operating expense is recorded as a component of other revenue in our consolidated statements of income.\n\nOur development and commercialization arrangements with Genentech, Eisai, Sage and Samsung Bioepis represent collaborative arrangements as each party is an active participant in one or more joint operating activities and is exposed to significant risks and rewards of these arrangements. These arrangements resulted from an exchange of a license and utilize the sales and usage based royalty exception, as applicable. Therefore, revenue relating to royalties or profit-sharing amounts received is recognized as the underlying sales occur.\n\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, Eisai, Sage and Samsung Bioepis, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nWe have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements.\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 - Fair values are determined utilizing quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access;\n- \u00b7 Level 2 - Fair values are determined by utilizing quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other market observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, foreign currency spot rates and option pricing valuation models; and\n- \u00b7 Level 3 - Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.\n\nThe majority of our financial assets have been classified as Level 2. Our financial assets (which typically include our cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and certain of our marketable equity securities, derivative contracts and plan assets for deferred compensation) have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, at the end of each reporting period, utilizing third-party pricing services or option pricing valuation models. The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income and market-based approaches and observable market inputs to determine value. These observable market inputs include reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers, current spot rates and other industry and economic events.\n\nWe validate the prices provided by our third-party pricing services by understanding the models used, obtaining market values from other pricing sources and analyzing pricing data in certain instances. The option pricing valuation models use assumptions within the model, including the term, stock price volatility, constant maturity risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. After completing our validation procedures, we did not adjust or override any fair value measurements provided by our pricing services as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Other Assets and Liabilities\n\nThe carrying amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets for current accounts receivable, due from antiCD20 therapeutic programs, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expense and other, approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nWe consider only those investments that are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash and that mature within three months from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, cash equivalents were comprised of money market funds, commercial paper, overnight reverse repurchase agreements and other debt securities with maturities less than three months from the date of purchase.",

        "page_content": "## BIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\n## Accounts Receivable\n\nThe majority of our accounts receivable arise from product sales and primarily represent amounts due from our wholesale and other third-party distributors, public hospitals, pharmacies and other government entities and have standard payment terms that generally require payment within 30 to 90 days.\n\nWe do not adjust our receivables for the effects of a significant financing component at contract inception if we expect to collect the receivables in one year or less from the time of sale.\n\nWe provide reserves against accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from a customer's inability to pay. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged or written-off against the reserve.\n\n## Receivables from Samsung BioLogics\n\nIn April 2022 we completed the sale of our 49.9% equity interest in Samsung Bioepis to Samsung BioLogics, which resulted in a receivable of approximately $1.3 billion in cash to be deferred over two payments. The first deferred payment of $812.5 million was received in April 2023 and the second deferred payment of $437.5 million is due at the second anniversary of the closing of this transaction in April 2024. The payments due to us from Samsung BioLogics have been recorded at their estimated fair values through the use of risk-adjusted discount rates. For additional information on the accounting for the sale of our equity interest in Samsung Bioepis, please read Note 3, Dispositions , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Concentration of Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk include cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivatives and accounts receivable. We attempt to minimize the risks related to cash and cash equivalents and investments by investing in a broad and diverse range of financial instruments as previously defined by us. We have established guidelines related to credit ratings and maturities intended to safeguard principal balances and maintain liquidity. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. We minimize credit risk resulting from derivative instruments by choosing only highly rated financial institutions as counterparties.\n\nConcentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables, which are typically unsecured, are somewhat mitigated due to the wide variety of customers and markets using our products, as well as their dispersion across many different geographic areas. We monitor the financial performance and creditworthiness of our customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile. We continue to monitor these conditions and assess their possible impact on our business.\n\n## Marketable Securities and Other Investments\n\n## Marketable Debt Securities\n\nAvailable-for-sale marketable debt securities are recorded at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are included in AOCI in equity, net of related tax effects, unless the security has experienced a credit loss, we have determined that we have the intent to sell the security or we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the security before its expected recovery. Realized gains and losses are reported in other (income) expense, net on a specific identification basis.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2023 we sold all of our marketable debt securities and used the proceeds to partially fund our acquisition of Reata. For additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read Note 2, Acquisitions , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Marketable Equity Securities and Venture Capital Funds\n\nOur marketable equity securities are recorded at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are included in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income. Our marketable equity securities represent investments in publicly traded equity securities and are included in investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nOur investments in venture capital funds are recorded at net asset value, which approximates fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are included in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\nThe underlying investments of the venture capital funds in which we invest are in equity securities of certain biotechnology companies and are included in investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Non-Marketable Equity Securities\n\nWe also invest in equity securities of companies whose securities are not publicly traded and where fair value is not readily available. These investments are recorded using either the equity method of accounting or the cost minus impairment adjusted for observable price changes, depending on our ownership percentage and other factors that suggest we have significant influence. We monitor these investments to evaluate whether any increase or decline in their value has occurred, based on the implied value of recent company financings, public market prices of comparable companies and general market conditions. These investments are included in investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Evaluating Marketable Debt Securities for Other-than-Temporary Impairments\n\nWe conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in AOCI.\n\nFor available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, management performs an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis. Where we intend to sell a security, or may be required to do so, the security's decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss is reflected in earnings as an impairment loss.\n\nRegardless of our intent to sell a security, we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security. Credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security.\n\n## Equity Method of Accounting\n\nIn circumstances where we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of a company in which we have an investment, we utilize the equity method of accounting for recording investment activity. In assessing whether we exercise significant influence, we consider the nature and magnitude of our investment, the voting and protective rights we hold, any participation in the governance of the other company and other relevant factors such as the presence of a collaborative or other business relationship. Under the equity method of accounting, we record in our consolidated statements of income our share of income or loss of the other company. If our share of losses exceeds the carrying value of our investment, we will suspend recognizing additional losses and will continue to do so unless we commit to providing additional funding.\n\n## Inventory\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost based on the first-in, first-out method. We classify our inventory costs as long-term when we expect to utilize the inventory beyond our normal operating cycle and include these costs in investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Inventory that can be used in either the production of clinical or commercial products is expensed as research and development costs when identified for use in a clinical manufacturing campaign.\n\n## Capitalization of Inventory Costs\n\nWe capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval, when, based on management's judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. We consider numerous attributes in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a particular product should be capitalized as an asset. We assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process, including any known safety or efficacy concerns, potential labeling restrictions and other impediments to approval. We evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used. We consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could hamper approval or commercialization. We consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or delay commercialization. We also",

Finally, we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize. We expense previously capitalized costs related to pre-approval inventory upon changes in such judgments, due to, among other potential factors, a denial or significant delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies.\n\n## Obsolescence and Unmarketable Inventory\n\nAt each reporting period we review our inventories for excess or obsolescence and write-down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us, or if it is determined that inventory utilization will further diminish based on estimates of demand, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Additionally, our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring that we perform throughout the manufacturing process. In the event that certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality specifications, we will record a charge to cost of sales to write-down any unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. In all cases, product inventory is carried at the lower of cost or its estimated net realizable value. Amounts written-down due to unmarketable inventory are charged to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are carried at cost, subject to reviews for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The cost of normal, recurring or periodic repairs and maintenance activities related to property, plant and equipment are expensed as incurred. The cost for planned major maintenance activities, including the related acquisition or construction of assets, is capitalized if the repair will result in future economic benefits.\n\nInterest costs incurred during the construction of major capital projects are capitalized until the underlying asset is ready for its intended use, at which point the interest costs are amortized as depreciation expense over the life of the underlying asset. We also capitalize certain direct and incremental costs associated with the validation effort required for licensing by regulatory agencies of new manufacturing equipment for the production of a commercially approved drug. These costs primarily include direct labor and material and are incurred in preparing the equipment for its intended use. The validation costs are either amortized over the life of the related equipment or expensed as cost of sales when the product produced in the validation process is sold.\n\nIn addition, we capitalize certain internal use computer software development costs. If the software is an integral part of production assets, these costs are included in machinery and equipment and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related software, which generally range from three to five years.\n\nWe generally depreciate or amortize the cost of our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are summarized as follows:\n\n| Asset Category                 | Useful Lives                                                  |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Land                           | Not depreciated                                               |\n| Buildings                      | 15 to 40 years                                                |\n| Leasehold Improvements         | Lesser of the useful life or the term of the respective lease |\n| Furniture and Fixtures         | 5 to 7 years                                                  |\n| Machinery and Equipment        | 5 to 20 years                                                 |\n| Computer Software and Hardware | 3 to 5 years                                                  |\n\nWhen we dispose of property, plant and equipment, we remove the associated cost and accumulated depreciation from the related accounts in our consolidated balance sheets and include any resulting gain or loss in our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based upon the present value of lease payments over the lease term. When determining the lease term, we include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\nWe use the implicit rate when readily determinable and use our incremental borrowing rate when the implicit rate is not readily determinable based upon the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is determined using a secured borrowing rate for the same currency and term as the associated lease.\n\nThe lease payments used to determine our operating lease assets may include lease incentives, stated rent increases and escalation clauses linked to rates of inflation when determinable and are recognized in our operating lease assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Our lease agreements may include both lease and non-lease components, which we account for as a single lease component when the payments are fixed. Variable payments included in the lease agreement are expensed as incurred. For certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease assets and liabilities.\n\nOur operating leases are reflected in operating lease assets, accrued expense and other and long-term operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWe also have real estate lease agreements which are subleased to third-parties. Operating leases for which we are the sublessor are included in accrued expense and other and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. We recognize sublease income on a straight-line basis over the lease term in our consolidated statements of income.\n\nFor additional information on our leases, please read Note 12, Leases , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nOur intangible assets consist of completed technology (comprised of acquired and in-licensed rights and patents, developed technology and other), IPR&D acquired after January 1, 2009, priority review vouchers and trademarks and trade names. Our intangible assets are recorded at fair value at the time of their acquisition and are stated in our consolidated balance sheets net of accumulated amortization and impairments, if applicable.\n\nIntangible assets related to acquired and in-licensed rights and patents, developed technology and other are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the economic consumption method if anticipated future revenue can be reasonably estimated. The straight-line method is used when revenue cannot be reasonably estimated. Amortization is recorded within amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets in our consolidated statements of income.\n\nWe amortize the intangible assets related to our marketed products using the economic consumption method based on revenue generated from the products underlying the related intangible assets. An analysis of the anticipated lifetime revenue of our marketed products is performed annually during our long-range planning cycle and whenever events or changes in circumstances would significantly affect anticipated lifetime revenue of the relevant products.\n\nIntangible assets related to trademarks, trade names, IPR&D prior to commercialization and priority review vouchers are not amortized because they have indefinite lives; however, they are subject to review for impairment. We review our intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, as of October 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\n## Acquired In-process Research and Development\n\nAcquired IPR&D represents the fair value assigned to research and development assets that have not reached technological feasibility. The value assigned to acquired IPR&D is determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting revenue from the projects and discounting the net cash flow to present value. The revenue and cost projections used to value acquired IPR&D are, as applicable, reduced based on the probability of success of developing a new drug. Additionally, the projections consider the relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors. The rates utilized to discount the net cash flow to present value are commensurate with the stage of development of the projects and uncertainties in the economic estimates used in the projections. Upon the acquisition of IPR&D, we complete an assessment of whether our acquisition constitutes the purchase of a single asset or a group of assets. We consider multiple factors in this assessment, including the nature of the technology acquired, the presence or absence of separate cash flow, the development process and stage of completion, quantitative significance and our rationale for entering into the transaction.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\nIf we acquire a business as defined under applicable accounting standards, then the acquired IPR&D is capitalized as an intangible asset. If we acquire an asset or group of assets that do not meet the definition of a business under applicable accounting standards, then the acquired IPR&D is expensed on its acquisition date. Future costs to develop these assets are recorded to research and development expense in our consolidated statements of income as they are incurred.\n\nWhen performing our impairment assessment, we calculate the fair value using the same methodology as described above. If the carrying value of our acquired IPR&D exceeds its fair value, then the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. Changes in estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our acquired IPR&D could result in an impairment. Impairments are recorded within amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets in our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets when accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually, as of October 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable.\n\nWe compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of our reporting unit, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. As described in Note 25, Segment Information, to these consolidated financial statements, we operate as one operating segment, which is our only reporting unit.\n\n## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nLong-lived assets to be held and used, including property, plant and equipment, and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable.\n\nDetermination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flow resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flow is not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to their fair values. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are carried at fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## Contingent Consideration\n\nThe consideration for our acquisitions often includes future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular event or events. We record an obligation for such contingent payments at fair value on the acquisition date. We estimate the fair value of contingent consideration obligations through valuation models that incorporate probability-adjusted assumptions related to the achievement of the milestones and thus likelihood of making related payments. We revalue our contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations are recognized in our consolidated statements of income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes to one or multiple inputs, including adjustments to the discount rates, changes in the amount or timing of expected expenditures associated with product development, changes in the amount or timing of cash flow and reserves associated with products upon commercialization, changes in the assumed achievement or timing of any cumulative sales-based and development milestones, changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval.\n\nDiscount rates in our valuation models represent a measure of the credit risk associated with settling the liability. The period over which we discount our contingent obligations is based on the current development stage of the product candidates, our specific development plan for that product candidate adjusted for the probability of completing the development step and when the contingent payments would be triggered. In estimating the probability of success, we utilize data regarding similar milestone events from several sources, including industry studies and our own experience. These fair value measurements are based on significant inputs not observable in the market. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\n## Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\n## Cash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments\n\nWe recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are recognized each period in current earnings or AOCI, depending on whether the derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. We classify the cash flow from these instruments in the same category as the cash flow from the hedged items. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nWe assess at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flow or fair values of the hedged items. We exclude the forward points portion of the derivative instruments used in a hedging transaction from the effectiveness test and record the fair value gain or loss related to this portion each period in our consolidated statements of income in the same line as the underlying hedged item. If we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, we discontinue hedge accounting for the affected portion of the hedge instrument, and any related unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in current earnings.\n\n## Net Investment Derivative Instruments\n\nDesignated net investment hedges are recognized as either assets or liabilities, at fair value, in our consolidated balance sheets. We hedge the changes in the spot exchange rate in AOCI and exclude changes to the forward rate and amortize the forward points in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income over the term of the contract. We classify the cash flow from these instruments in the same category as the cash flow from the hedged items.\n\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2022 we no longer held net investment hedges as they were closed with the sale of our 49.9% equity interest in Samsung Bioepis in April 2022. For additional information on the sale of our equity interest in Samsung Bioepis, please read Note 3, Dispositions , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\nFor additional information on our derivative instruments and hedging activities, please read Note 10, Derivative Instruments , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Translation of Foreign Currencies\n\nThe functional currency for most of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. For our non-U.S. subsidiaries that transact in a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated at current rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average foreign currency exchange rates for the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars are excluded from the determination of net income and are recorded in AOCI, as a separate component of equity. For subsidiaries where the functional currency of the assets and liabilities differ from the local currency, non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the date assets were acquired while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current rates of exchange as of the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average foreign currency rates for the period. Translation adjustments of these subsidiaries are included in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Royalty Cost of Sales\n\nWe make royalty payments to a number of third-parties under license or purchase agreements associated with our acquisition of intellectual property. These royalty payments are typically calculated as a percentage (royalty rate) of the sales of our products in a particular year. That royalty rate may remain constant, increase or decrease within each year based on the total amount of sales during the annual period. Each quarterly period, we estimate our total royalty obligation for the full year and recognize the proportional amount as cost of sales based on actual quarterly sales as a percentage of full year estimated sales. For example, if the level of net sales in any calendar year increases the royalty rate within the year, we will record our cost of sales at an even rate over the year, based on the estimated blended royalty rate.",

Compensation expense is recognized based on the estimated fair value of the awards at grant date. We recognize compensation expense for the number of awards expected to vest after taking into consideration an estimate of award forfeitures over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Where awards are made with non-substantive vesting periods (for instance, where a portion of the award vests upon retirement eligibility), we estimate and recognize expense based on the period from the grant date to the date the employee becomes retirement eligible.\n\nThe fair values of our stock option grants are estimated as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The estimated fair values of the stock options are then expensed over the options' vesting periods.\n\nThe fair values of our MSUs and PSUs that settle in stock and have market-based metrics are estimated using a lattice model with a Monte Carlo simulation. We apply an accelerated attribution method to recognize share-based compensation expense over the applicable service period for these awards. The probability of actual shares expected to be earned is considered in the grant date valuation, therefore the expense is not adjusted to reflect the actual units earned.\n\nThe fair values of our RSUs are based on the market value of our stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense for RSUs is recognized straight-line over the applicable service period.\n\nWe apply an accelerated attribution method to recognize share-based compensation expense when accounting for our PSUs that settle in cash, and the fair value of the liability is remeasured at the end of each reporting period through expected settlement. Compensation expense associated with PSUs that settle in cash are based upon the stock price and the number of units expected to be earned after assessing the probability that certain performance criteria will be met and the targeted payout level associated with the performance criteria expected to be achieved. Cumulative adjustments are recorded each quarter to reflect changes in the stock price and estimated outcome of the performance-related conditions until the date results are determined and settled. If performance criteria are not met or not expected to be met, any compensation expense previously recognized to date associated with the awards will be reversed.\n\nThe fair values of PSUs that settle in stock and do not have market-based metrics are based upon the stock price on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized for the number of units expected to be earned after assessing the probability that certain performance criteria will be met and the targeted payout level associated with the performance criteria expected to be achieved. Cumulative adjustments are recorded each quarter to reflect the estimated outcome of the performance-related conditions until the date results are determined and settled. If performance criteria are not met or not expected to be met, any compensation expense previously recognized to date associated with the awards will be reversed.\n\n## Research and Development Expense\n\nResearch and development expense consists of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities, which include compensation and benefits, facilities and overhead expense, clinical trial expense and fees paid to CROs, clinical supply and manufacturing expense, write-offs of inventory that was previously capitalized in anticipation of product launch and determined to no longer be realizable and other outside expense and upfront fees and milestones paid to third-party collaborators. Research and development expense is expensed as incurred. Upfront and milestone payments made to third-party collaborators are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Milestone payments made upon regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Payments we make for research and development services prior to the services being rendered are recorded as prepaid assets in our consolidated balance sheets and are expensed as the services are provided. We also accrue the costs of ongoing clinical trials associated with programs that have been terminated or discontinued for which there is no future economic benefit at the time the decision is made to terminate or discontinue the program.\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into development agreements in which we share expenses with a collaborative partner. We record payments received from our collaborative partners for their share of the development costs as a reduction of research and development expense, except as discussed in Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to these consolidated financial statements.

For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, advertising costs totaled $71.4 million, $54.1 million and $98.7 million, respectively.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. We recognize deferred taxes associated with our GILTI tax calculations.\n\nThe income tax consequences from the intra-entity transfers of inventory within our consolidated group, both current and deferred, are recorded as a prepaid tax or deferred charge and recognized through our consolidated statements of income when the inventory is sold to a third-party. The income tax consequences from the intra-entity transfer of assets other than inventory and associated changes to deferred taxes are recognized when the transfer occurs.\n\nWe account for uncertain tax positions using a 'more likely than not' threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. We also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax (benefit) expense in our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Loss contingency provisions are recorded if the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated or a range of loss can be determined. These accruals represent management's best estimate of probable loss. Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. On a quarterly basis, we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may change our estimates. Legal costs associated with legal proceedings are expensed when incurred.\n\n## Earnings per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing undistributed net income attributable to Biogen Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the treasury method by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus potentially dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding.",

The results of operations of the acquired company are included in our results of operations beginning on the acquisition date, and assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on the acquisition date at their respective fair values. Any excess of consideration transferred over the net carrying value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date is recognized as goodwill.\n\nWe use the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a form of the income approach, utilizing post-tax cash flow and discount rates in estimating the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired when allocating the purchase consideration paid for the acquisition. The estimates of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets involve significant judgment by management and include assumptions with measurement uncertainty, such as the amount and timing of projected cash flow, long-term sales forecasts, discount rates and additionally for IPR&D intangible assets, the timing and probability of regulatory and commercial success.\n\nWe use the net realizable value method in estimating the fair value of acquired finished goods and work-in-process inventory. Raw materials acquired are valued using the replacement cost method.\n\nTransaction and restructuring costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. If we determine the assets acquired do not meet the definition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination.\n\n## New Accounting Pronouncements\n\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that we adopt as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed below, we do not believe that the adoption of recently issued standards have or may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n\n## Segment Reporting\n\nIn November 2023 the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosure . This standard requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items to reconcile to segment profit or loss and the title and position of the entity's CODM. The amendments in this update also expand the interim segment disclosure requirements. All disclosure requirements under this standard are also required for public entities with a single reportable segment. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the amendments in this update are required to be applied on a retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the potential impact that this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nIn June 2022 the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions . This standard clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. This standard became effective for us on January 1, 2024. We elected to early adopt this standard on a prospective basis during the third quarter of 2022. Upon adoption, we recorded an immaterial amount in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income.",

As a result of this transaction we acquired SKYCLARYS (omaveloxolone), the first and only drug approved in the U.S. and the E.U. for the treatment of Friedreich's Ataxia in adults and adolescents aged 16 years and older, as well as other clinical and preclinical pipeline programs. The acquisition of Reata is expected to complement our global portfolio of neuromuscular and rare disease therapies. The addition of SKYCLARYS is anticipated to provide potential operating synergies with SPINRAZA and QALSODY.\n\nUnder the terms of this acquisition, we paid Reata shareholders $172.50 in cash for each issued and outstanding Reata share, which totaled approximately $6.6 billion. In addition, we agreed to pay approximately $983.9 million in cash for Reata's outstanding equity awards, inclusive of employer taxes, of which approximately $590.5 million was attributable to pre-acquisition services and is therefore reflected as a component of total purchase price paid. Of the $983.9 million paid to Reata's equity award holders, we recognized approximately $393.4 million as compensation attributable to the post-acquisition service period, of which $196.4 million was recognized as a charge to selling, general and administrative expense with the remaining $197.0 million as a charge to research and development expense within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023 . These amounts were associated with the accelerated vesting of stock options and RSUs previously granted to Reata employees that required no future services to vest.\n\nWe funded this acquisition through available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, supplemented by the issuance of a $1.0 billion term loan under our term loan credit agreement. For additional information on our term loan credit agreement, please read Note 13, Indebtedness , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe accounted for this acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations , and recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date.\n\n## Purchase Price Consideration\n\nTotal consideration transferred for the acquisition of Reata is summarized as follows:\n\n| (In millions)                                                                          | As of September 26, 2023   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Cash consideration paid to Reata shareholders (1)                                      | $  6,602.9                 |\n| Fair value of Reata equity compensation pre-acquisition services and related taxes (2) | 590.5                      |\n| Total consideration                                                                    | $  7,193.4                 |",

The measurement period adjustments summarized below resulted from updates to our valuation assumptions related to the estimated amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with certain intangible assets, updates of our assumptions related to the quantities, selling location and remaining manufacturing and selling costs of acquired inventory, and other assets and liabilities. The related impact to our consolidated statements of income that would have been recognized in previous periods if the adjustments were recognized as of the acquisition date is immaterial.\n\n| (In millions)                                       | Amounts Recognized as of  Acquisition Date (as previously reported)   | Measurement Period  Adjustments   | Amounts Recognized as of  Acquisition Date (as adjusted)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                           | $  267.3                                                              | $  -

The fair value was determined based on the estimated selling price of the inventory, less the remaining manufacturing and selling costs and a normal profit margin on those manufacturing and selling efforts. This fair value step-up adjustment will be amortized to cost of sales within our consolidated statements of income when the inventory is sold, which is expected to be within approximately 3 years from the acquisition date. For the year ended December 31, 2023, amortization from the fair value step-up adjustment as a result of inventory sold during the fourth quarter was approximately $31.5 million.\n\nIntangible assets: Intangible assets are comprised of $4.2 billion related to SKYCLARYS commercialization rights in the U.S., $2.3 billion of IPR&D related to the omaveloxolone program outside the U.S., which had not yet received regulatory approval in the E.U. as of the acquisition date, $100.0 million related to a rare pediatric disease priority voucher which may be used to obtain priority review by the FDA for a future regulatory submission or sold to a third party and $40.0 million related to other clinical programs. The estimated fair values of the program related intangible assets were determined using a multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, utilizing a discount rate of 14.3% and the estimated fair value of the priority review voucher was based on recent external purchase and sale transactions of similar vouchers.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\nOur valuation of the SKYCLARYS commercialization rights reflects the assumption that, using an economic consumption model, the related $4.2 billion intangible asset will be amortized over its expected economic life. Our valuation of the $2.3 billion IPR&D asset relates to omaveloxolone, which was submitted to the EMA in 2023 and subsequently approved in the E.U. in February 2024. We expect sales to commence in certain countries in Europe during 2024, at which time we will begin amortizing the intangible asset over its expected economic life.\n\nThese fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 fair value measurements.\n\nLeases: We assumed responsibility for a single-tenant, build-to-suit building of approximately 327,400 square feet of office and laboratory space located in Plano, Texas, with an initial lease term of 16 years. We recorded a lease liability of approximately $151.8 million, which represents the net present value of rental expense over the remaining lease term of approximately 15 years, with a corresponding right-of-use asset of approximately $121.2 million, which represents our estimate of the fair value for a market participant of the current rental market in the Dallas, Texas area. Included in our estimate of the market rental rate is the value of any leasehold improvements or tenant allowances related to the building. We do not intend to occupy this building and are evaluating opportunities to sublease the property.\n\nGoodwill: Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. We recognized goodwill of approximately $464.5 million, which is not deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill recognized from our acquisition of Reata is primarily the result of the deferred tax consequences from the transaction recorded for financial statement purposes.\n\nAcquisition-related expenses: Acquisition-related expenses, which were comprised primarily of regulatory, advisory and legal fees, and other transaction costs, totaled approximately $28.4 million and are included within selling, general and administrative expense within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## Assumptions in the Allocations of Purchase Price\n\nT he results of operations of Reata, along with the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Reata acquisition, have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the closing of the Reata acquisition on September 26, 2023 .\n\nOur preliminary estimate of the fair value of the specifically identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition is subject to the finalization of management's analysis related to certain matters, such as finalizing our assessment of income taxes. The final determination of these fair values will be completed as additional information becomes available but no later than one year from the acquisition date. The final determination may result in asset and liability fair values that are different than the preliminary estimates.\n\nSubsequent to the acquisition date, our results of operations include the results of operations of Reata. Due to the immateriality of Reata's revenue and expense, additional pro forma information combining the results of operations of Biogen and Reata have not been included.\n\n## Note 3:\n\nDispositions\n\n## Sale of Joint Venture Equity Interest in Samsung Bioepis\n\nIn April 2022 we completed the sale of our 49.9% equity interest in Samsung Bioepis to Samsung BioLogics in exchange for total consideration of approximately $2.3 billion. Under the terms of this transaction, we received approximately $1.0 billion in cash at closing, with approximately $1.3 billion in cash to be deferred over two payments. The first deferred payment of $812.5 million was received in April 2023 and the second deferred payment of $437.5 million is due at the second anniversary of the closing of this transaction in April 2024.\n\nPrior to the sale, the carrying value of our investment in Samsung Bioepis totaled $581.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.5 billion related to this transaction, which was recorded in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income. This pre-tax gain included reclassifications from AOCI to net income of approximately $58.9 million in cumulative translation losses, partially offset by approximately $57.0 million in gains resulting from the termination of our net investment hedge.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\nWe concluded that the divestment of Samsung Bioepis did not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, as our decision to divest this business did not represent a strategic shift that would have a major effect on our operations and financial results.\n\nWe elected the fair value option and measured the payments due to us from Samsung BioLogics at fair value. As of December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of the remaining second deferred payment using a risk-adjusted discount rate of 5.8% was approximately $430.0 million. This payment has been classified as a Level 3 measurement and is reflected in other current assets within our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a gain of approximately $13.7 million to reflect the change in fair value related to the first deferred payment due to us, which was received in April 2023. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a gain of approximately $24.6 million to reflect the change in fair value related to the second deferred payment due to us. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a gain of approximately $10.7 million and a loss of approximately $1.4 million to reflect the changes in fair value related to the first and second deferred payments due to us, respectively. These changes were recorded in other (income) expense, net within our consolidated statements of income.\n\nAs part of this transaction, we are also eligible to receive up to an additional $50.0 million upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones. Our policy for contingent payments of this nature is to recognize the payments in the period the payments become realizable, which is generally the same period in which the payments are earned.\n\nIf any payments due to us remain outstanding after the second anniversary of the closing of this transaction, we may elect to receive shares of Samsung BioLogics common stock at a 5.0% discount in lieu of a cash payment for the remaining amount due. Currently, we believe that the likelihood of Samsung BioLogics failing to make the second deferred payment due to us is remote.\n\nAdditionally, for the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a discrete tax expense of approximately $257.9 million related to this transaction, which is reflected in income tax (benefit) expense in our consolidated statements of income.",

The Fit for Growth program is expected to generate approximately $1.0 billion in gross operating expense savings by 2025, some of which will be reinvested in various initiatives. The Fit for Growth program is currently estimated to include net headcount reductions of approximately 1,000 employees and we expect to incur restructuring charges ranging from approximately $260.0 million to $280.0 million.\n\nTotal charges incurred from our 2023 cost saving initiatives are summarized as follows:\n\n|                                     | For the Year Ended December 31, 2023   | For the Year Ended December 31, 2023       | For the Year Ended December 31, 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| (In millions)                       | Severance Costs                        | Accelerated  Depreciation and Other  Costs | Total                                  |\n| Selling, general and administrative | -                                      | $  23.3                                    | $  23.3                                |\n| Research and development            | -                                      | 1.2                                        | 1.2                                    |\n| Restructuring charges               | 153.4                                  | 34.6                                       | 188.0                                  |\n| Total charges                       | 153.4                                  | $  59.1                                    | $  212.5                               |\n\nOther Costs: includes costs associated with items such as asset abandonment and write-offs, facility closure costs, pretax gains and losses resulting from the termination of certain leases, employee non-severance expense, consulting fees and other costs.\n\n## Reata Integration\n\nFollowing the close of our Reata acquisition, we implemented an integration plan designed to realize operating synergies through cost savings and avoidance. These amounts are primarily related to severance and are expected to be paid by the end of 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized approximately $30.4 million of net pre-tax restructuring charges related to employee severance costs.\n\n## 2022 Cost Saving Initiatives\n\nIn December 2021 and May 2022 we announced our plans to implement a series of cost-reduction measures during 2022. These savings are being achieved through a number of initiatives, including reductions to our workforce, the substantial elimination of our commercial ADUHELM infrastructure, deprioritization of certain research and development programs, the consolidation of certain real estate locations and operating efficiencies across our selling, general and administrative and research and development functions. Charges related to our 2022 cost saving initiatives were substantially incurred during 2022 with remaining payments expected to be made through 2026.\n\nTotal charges incurred from our 2022 cost saving initiatives are summarized as follows:\n\n|                       | For the Years Ended December 31,   | For the Years Ended December 31,           | For the Years Ended December 31,   | For the Years Ended December 31,   | For the Years Ended December 31,               | For the Years Ended December 31,   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                       | 2023                               | 2023                                       | 2023                               | 2022                               | 2022                                           | 2022                               |\n| (In millions)         | Severance Costs                    | Accelerated  Depreciation  and Other Costs | Total                              | Severance  Costs                   | Accumulated  Depreciation and  Other Costs (1) | Total                              |\n| Restructuring charges | $  (2.2)  $                        | 2.6                                        | $  0.4                             | $  112.6                           | $  18.5                                        | $  131.1                           |\n| Total charges         | $  (2.2)  $                        | 2.6                                        | $  0.4                             | $  112.6                           | $  18.5                                        | $  131.1                           |",

During the first quarter of 2023 we began recognizing contract manufacturing revenue for LEQEMBI, upon accelerated approval of LEQEMBI in the U.S. Prior to accelerated approval, our share of contract manufacturing amounts related to LEQEMBI were recognized in research and development expense within our consolidated statements of income.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we amended our agreement with a contract manufacturing customer pursuant to which we licensed certain of our manufacturing-related intellectual property to the customer. In the second quarter of 2020, the customer received regulatory approval for its product that is being manufactured using certain of our manufacturing-related intellectual property. As a result we were entitled to $500.0 million in a series of three payments. The first payment became due upon a regulatory approval of such product and was received during the second quarter of 2020. The second payment became due upon the first anniversary of the regulatory approval and was received during the second quarter of 2021. The third payment became due upon the second anniversary of the regulatory approval and was received during the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Royalty and Other Revenue\n\nRoyalty and other revenue primarily reflects the royalties we receive from net sales on products related to patents that we have out-licensed, as well as royalty revenue on biosimilar products from our license arrangements with Samsung Bioepis and our 50.0% share of LEQEMBI product revenue, net and cost of sales, including royalties, as we are not the principal.\n\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Eisai and our license arrangements with Samsung Bioepis, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships , to these consolidated financial statements.",

We recognized approximately $136.0 million related to Eisai's 45.0% share of these charges in collaboration profit sharing/(loss reimbursement) within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021 we wrote-off approximately $120.0 million of inventory in excess of forecasted demand related to ADUHELM, which was recognized in cost of sales within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have recognized approximately $59.0 million related to Eisai's 45.0% share of these charges in collaboration profit sharing/(loss reimbursement) within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of ADUHELM inventory was zero. In November 2023 we notified Neurimmune of our decision to terminate our collaboration and license agreement with Neurimmune and to discontinue the development and commercialization of ADUHELM.\n\nFor additional information on our collaboration with Eisai, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships , to these consolidated financial statements.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had no impairment charges.\n\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets, excluding impairment charges, totaled $240.6 million, $246.3 million and $252.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets, excluding impairment charges, over the three years was primarily due to a lower rate of amortization for acquired intangible assets.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets reflects the impact of a $119.6 million impairment charge related to vixotrigine (BIIB074) for the potential treatment of DPN.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets reflects the impact of a $365.0 million impairment charge related to BIIB111 (timrepigene emparvovec), a $220.0 million impairment charge related to BIIB112 (cotoretigene toliparvovec) and a $44.3 million impairment charge related to vixotrigine for the potential treatment of TGN.\n\nWe monitor events and expectations regarding product performance. If new information indicates that the assumptions underlying our most recent analysis are substantially different than those utilized in our current estimates, our analysis would be updated and may result in a significant change in the anticipated lifetime revenue of the relevant products. The occurrence of an adverse event could substantially increase the amount of amortization expense related to our acquired intangible assets as compared to previous periods or our current expectations, which may result in a significant negative impact on our future results of operations.\n\n## Completed Technology\n\nCompleted technology primarily relates to our other marketed products and programs acquired through asset acquisitions, licenses and business combinations. Completed technology intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range between 2 to 31 years, with a remaining weighted average useful life of 12 years for acquired and in-licensed rights and patents and 10 years for developed technology and other. In connection with our acquisition of Reata in September 2023 we acquired SKYCLARYS, a commercially-approved product in the U.S., with an estimated fair value of approximately $4.2 billion, which includes measurement period adjustments.\n\n## IPR&D Related to Business Combinations\n\nIPR&D represents the fair value assigned to research and development assets that we acquired as part of a business combination and had not yet reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition. Included in IPR&D balances are adjustments related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We review amounts capitalized as",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\nacquired IPR&D for impairment annually, as of October 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate to us that the carrying value of the assets might not be recoverable. The carrying value associated with our IPR&D assets as of December 31, 2023, relates to the IPR&D programs we acquired in connection with our acquisition of Reata in September 2023 with an estimated fair value of approximately $2.3 billion, which includes measurement period adjustments.\n\n## Priority Review Voucher\n\nIn connection with our acquisition of Reata in September 2023 we acquired a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher that may be used to obtain priority review by the FDA for a future regulatory submission or sold to a third party. We recorded the priority review voucher based on its estimated fair value of $100.0 million as an intangible asset. The estimated fair value was based on recent external purchase and sale transactions of similar vouchers.\n\nFor additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read Note 2, Acquisitions , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Vixotrigine\n\nIn connection with our acquisition of Convergence, we recognized $424.6 million of acquired IPR&D intangible assets for vixotrigine. In the periods following our acquisition of vixotrigine, there were numerous delays in the initiation of Phase 3 studies for the potential treatment of TGN and for the potential treatment of DPN, another form of neuropathic pain. We engaged with the FDA regarding the design of the potential Phase 3 studies of vixotrigine for the potential treatment of TGN and DPN and performed an additional clinical trial of vixotrigine, which was completed during 2022.\n\nThe performance of this additional clinical trial delayed the initiation of the Phase 3 studies of vixotrigine for the potential treatment of TGN, and, as a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $44.3 million related to vixotrigine for the potential treatment of TGN during the first quarter of 2021.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022 we discontinued further development of vixotrigine based on regulatory, development and commercialization challenges. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $119.6 million related to vixotrigine for the potential treatment of DPN, reducing the remaining book value of this IPR&D intangible asset to zero. We also adjusted the value of our contingent consideration obligations related to this asset resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $209.1 million, which was recognized in (gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## BIIB111 and BIIB112\n\nIn connection with our acquisition of Nightstar Therapeutics plc, we recognized $480.0 million and $220.0 million of acquired IPR&D intangible assets for BIIB111 and BIIB112, respectively. During the second quarter of 2021 we announced that our Phase 3 STAR study of BIIB111 and our Phase 2/3 XIRIUS study of BIIB112 did not meet their primary endpoints. In the third quarter of 2021 we suspended further development on these programs based on the decision by management as part of its strategic review process. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized an impairment charge of $365.0 million related to BIIB111 and an impairment charge of $220.0 million related to BIIB112, reducing the remaining book values of these IPR&D intangible assets to zero.\n\nIn addition, as a result of our decision to suspend further development of BIIB111 and BIIB112, we recorded charges of approximately $39.1 million during the third quarter of 2021 related to our manufacturing arrangements and other costs that we expect to incur as a result of suspending these programs. These charges were recognized in research and development expense in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2021.",

In addition, there have been no changes in valuation techniques as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nFor a description of our validation procedures related to prices provided by third-party pricing services and our option pricing valuation model, please read the Fair Value Measurements section within Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Held at Fair Value\n\nThere were no transfers of assets or liabilities into or out of Level 3 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\n## Contingent Consideration Obligations\n\nIn connection with our acquisition of Convergence, we agreed to make additional payments based upon the achievement of certain milestone events. The following table provides a roll forward of the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations, which were classified as Level 3 measurements:\n\n| (In millions)                 | As of December 31,  2022   |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Fair value, beginning of year | $  209.1                   |\n| Changes in fair value         | (209.1)                    |\n| Fair value, end of year       | $  -                       |\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the changes in fair value of our contingent consideration obligations were primarily due to the discontinuation of further development efforts related to vixotrigine for the potential treatment of TGN and DPN, resulting in a reduction of our contingent consideration obligations of approximately $195.4 million, reducing the remaining fair value of vixotrigine to zero, as well as changes in the interest rates used to revalue our contingent consideration liabilities.\n\nChanges in the fair values of our contingent consideration obligations are recorded in (gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration in our consolidated statements of income. The fair values of the contingent consideration liabilities were based on a probability-adjusted discounted cash flow calculation using Level 3 fair value measurements and inputs. For additional information on the valuation techniques and inputs utilized in the valuation of our financial assets and liabilities, please read Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Convergence Pharmaceuticals Holdings Limited\n\nIn connection with our acquisition of Convergence in February 2015 we recorded a contingent consideration obligation of $274.5 million. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of this contingent consideration obligation was $209.1 million. During the fourth quarter of 2022 we discontinued further development of vixotrigine based on regulatory, development and commercialization challenges. As a result, the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations related to Convergence has been adjusted to zero, resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $209.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This pre-tax gain was recorded in (gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration within our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded impairment charges of $119.6 million related to vixotrigine. As a result, the remaining book values associated with these programs were reduced to zero. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded impairment charges of $365.0 million related to BIIB111 and $220.0 million related to BIIB112. As a result, the remaining book values associated with these programs were reduced to zero.\n\nFor additional information on our impairments for intangible assets, please read Note 7, Intangible Assets and Goodwill , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value\n\n## Other Financial Instruments\n\nDue to the short-term nature of certain financial instruments, the carrying value reflected in our consolidated balance sheets for current accounts receivable, due from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expense and other, approximates fair value.",

As of December 31, 2022, our strategic investment portfolio comprised of investments totaling $846.0 million which are included in investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe decrease in our strategic investment portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of our investments in Denali, Sangamo and Sage common stock. Additionally, during 2023 we sold a portion of our Sangamo and Denali common stock and the remainder of our Ionis common stock.\n\nFor additional information on our investments in Denali, Sangamo, Sage and Ionis common stock, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 10: Derivative Instruments\n\n## Foreign Currency Forward Contracts - Hedging Instruments\n\nDue to the global nature of our operations, portions of our revenue and operating expense are recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The value of revenue and operating expense measured in U.S. dollars is therefore subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options with financial institutions with the primary objective to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our international revenue and operating expense.\n\nForeign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options in effect as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, had durations of 1 to 12 months. These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and unrealized gains and losses on the portion of these foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options that are included in the effectiveness test are reported in AOCI. Realized gains and losses of such contracts and options are recognized in revenue when the sale of product in the currency being hedged is recognized and in operating expense when the expense in the currency being hedged is recorded. We recognize all cash flow hedge reclassifications from AOCI and fair value changes of excluded portions in the same line item in our consolidated statements of income that have been impacted by the hedged item.",

In June 2018 we exercised our option under our joint venture agreement to increase our ownership percentage in Samsung Bioepis from approximately 5.0% to approximately 49.9%. Our investment in the equity of Samsung Bioepis related to this transaction was exposed to the currency fluctuations in the South Korean won.\n\nIn order to mitigate the currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and South Korean won, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts. These contracts were designated as net investment hedges. In April 2022 we completed the sale of our 49.9% equity interest in Samsung Bioepis to Samsung BioLogics and closed these foreign currency forward contracts. Upon completing this sale, the cumulative gains on our net investment hedges of $57.0 million were reclassified from AOCI and reflected within the total pre-tax gain recognized from the sale, which was recorded in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. For additional information on the sale of our equity interest in Samsung Bioepis, please read Note 3, Dispositions , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\nPrior to the sale of our 49.9% equity interest in Samsung Bioepis, we recognized changes in the spot exchange rate of these foreign currency forward contracts in AOCI. The pre-tax portion of the fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts that were included in AOCI in total equity reflected net gains of $10.6 million as of December 31, 2021. We excluded fair value changes related to the forward rate from our hedging relationship and amortized the",

This facility includes 393,000 square feet related to a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility, 290,000 square feet of warehouse, utilities and support space and 51,000 square feet of administrative space. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had approximately $728.8 million and $711.1 million, respectively, capitalized as construction in progress related to this facility. In the second quarter of 2021 a portion of this facility (the first manufacturing suite) received a GMP multi-product license from the SWISSMEDIC, resulting in approximately $1.2 billion of fixed assets being placed into service during the second quarter of 2021. The second manufacturing suite became operational in January 2024, resulting in approximately $710.7 million of fixed assets being placed into service during the first quarter of 2024. Solothurn has been approved for the manufacture of ADUHELM and LEQEMBI by the FDA.\n\n## 125 Broadway Building Sale\n\nIn September 2022 we completed the sale of our building and land parcel located at 125 Broadway for an aggregate sales price of approximately $603.0 million, which is inclusive of a $10.8 million tenant allowance. This sale resulted in a pre-tax gain on sale of approximately $503.7 million, net of transaction costs, which is reflected within gain on sale of building in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. This transaction included approximately $79.2 million of property, plant and equipment, net, which comprised of approximately $72.6 million for buildings, approximately $1.6 million for land and approximately $5.0 million for machinery and equipment.\n\n## Note 12: Leases\n\nWe lease real estate, including laboratory and office space, and certain equipment.\n\nOur leases have remaining lease terms ranging from less than one year to fifteen years. Certain leases include one or more options to renew, exercised at our sole discretion, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one year to ten years.\n\nIn addition, we sublease certain real estate to third parties. Our sublease portfolio consists of operating leases, with remaining lease terms ranging from one year to six years.",

We recorded a lease liability of approximately $151.8 million, which represents the net present value of rental expense over the remaining lease term of approximately 15 years, with a corresponding right-of-use asset of approximately $121.2 million, which represents our estimate of the fair value for a market participant of the current rental market in the Dallas, Texas area. Included in our estimate of the market rental rate is the value of any leasehold improvements or tenant allowances related to the building. We do not intend to occupy this building and are evaluating opportunities to sublease the property.\n\nFor additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read Note 2, Acquisitions , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 125 Broadway Building Sale and Leaseback Transaction\n\nIn connection with the sale of our 125 Broadway building during the third quarter of 2022, we simultaneously leased back the building for a term of approximately 5.5 years, which resulted in the recognition of approximately $168.2 million in a new lease liability and right-of-use asset recorded within our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022. The sale and immediate leaseback of this building qualified for sale and leaseback treatment and is classified as an operating lease. For additional information on the sale of our 125 Broadway building, please read Note 11, Property, Plant and Equipment , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 300 Binney Street Lease Modification\n\nIn September 2022 we entered into an agreement to partially terminate a portion of our lease located at 300 Binney Street, as well as to reduce the lease term for the majority of the remaining space. The agreement was driven by our 2022 efforts to reduce costs by consolidating real estate locations. The transaction was treated as a lease modification as of the effective date and resulted in the derecognition of a right-of-use asset of approximately $47.4 million and a lease liability of approximately $52.7 million, which resulted in a gain of approximately $5.3 million, which was recorded within restructuring charges in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022.",

On the closing date of the Reata acquisition we drew $1.0 billion from the 2023 Term Loan, comprised of a $500.0 million floating rate 364-day tranche and a $500.0 million floating rate three-year tranche. The remaining unused commitment of $500.0 million was terminated. During the fourth quarter of 2023 we repaid $350.0 million of the 364-day tranche. As of December 31, 2023, we had $650.0 million outstanding under the 2023 Term Loan, of which $150.0 million was outstanding under the 364-day tranche and $500.0 million was outstanding under the three-year tranche.\n\n## 2021 Exchange Offer\n\nIn February 2021 we completed our private offer to exchange (Exchange Offer) our tendered 5.200% Senior Notes due September 15, 2045 (2045 Senior Notes) for a new series of 3.250% Senior Notes due February 15, 2051 (2051 Senior Notes) and cash, and an offer to purchase our tendered 2045 Senior Notes for cash.\n\nAn aggregate principal amount of approximately $624.6 million of our 2045 Senior Notes was exchanged for an aggregate principal amount of approximately $700.7 million of our 2051 Senior Notes and aggregate cash payments of approximately $151.8 million. Our Exchange Offer has been accounted for as a debt modification; as such, the cash component has been reflected as additional debt discount and is amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of our 2051 Senior Notes.\n\nIn addition, we redeemed an aggregate principal amount of approximately $8.9 million of our 2045 Senior Notes for aggregate cash payments of approximately $12.1 million, excluding accrued and unpaid interest. The redemption has been accounted for as a debt extinguishment; as such, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $3.2 million upon the extinguishment of such 2045 Senior Notes. This charge, which was recognized in interest expense in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflects the payment of an early call premium and the write-off of the remaining unamortized original debt issuance costs and discount balances associated with such 2045 Senior Notes.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\n## Share-Based Compensation Plans\n\nWe have three share-based compensation plans pursuant to which awards are currently being made: (i) the Biogen Inc. 2006 Non-Employee Directors Equity Plan (2006 Directors Plan); (ii) the Biogen Inc. 2017 Omnibus Equity Plan (2017 Omnibus Equity Plan); and (iii) the Biogen Inc. 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2015 ESPP).\n\n## Directors Plan\n\nIn May 2006 our shareholders approved the 2006 Directors Plan for share-based awards to our directors. Awards granted from the 2006 Directors Plan may include stock options, shares of restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights and other awards in such amounts and with such terms and conditions as may be determined by a committee of our Board of Directors, subject to the provisions of the 2006 Directors Plan. We have reserved a total of 1.6 million shares of common stock for issuance under the 2006 Directors Plan. The 2006 Directors Plan provides that awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights will be counted against the total number of shares reserved under the plan in a 1.5-to-1 ratio. In June 2015 our shareholders approved an amendment to extend the term of the 2006 Directors Plan until June 2025.\n\n## Omnibus Plan\n\nIn June 2017 our shareholders approved the 2017 Omnibus Equity Plan for share-based awards to our employees. Awards granted from the 2017 Omnibus Equity Plan may include stock options, shares of restricted stock, RSUs, performance shares, stock appreciation rights and other awards in such amounts and with such terms and conditions as may be determined by a committee of our Board of Directors, subject to the provisions of the 2017 Omnibus Equity Plan. Shares of common stock available for grant under the 2017 Omnibus Equity Plan consist of 8.0 million shares reserved for this purpose, plus shares of common stock that remained available for grant under the Biogen Idec Inc. 2008 Omnibus Equity Plan (2008 Omnibus Equity Plan) as of June 7, 2017, or that could again become available for grant if outstanding awards under the 2008 Omnibus Equity Plan as of June 7, 2017, are cancelled, surrendered or terminated in whole or in part. The 2017 Omnibus Equity Plan provides that awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights will be counted against the total number of shares available under the plan in a 1.5-to-1 ratio.\n\nWe have not made any awards pursuant to the 2008 Omnibus Equity Plan since our shareholders approved the 2017 Omnibus Equity Plan, and do not intend to make any awards pursuant to the 2008 Omnibus Equity Plan in the future, except that unused shares under the 2008 Omnibus Equity Plan have been carried over for use under the 2017 Omnibus Equity Plan.\n\n## Stock Options\n\nIn 2022 we granted approximately 81,000 stock options to our CEO (2022 CEO Grant) under the 2017 Omnibus Plan with a grant date fair value of $139.10 per option for a total of approximately $11.2 million. The fair value of the stock option grant is estimated as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The estimated fair value of the stock option is then expensed over the options' vesting periods. The 2022 CEO Grant is eligible to vest in equal annual installments over a three-year period from the grant date, subject to the CEO's continued employment. The outstanding stock option has a 10-year term and is exercisable at a price per share not less than the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023               | December 31, 2023                            |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Shares              | Weighted Average Exercise Price | Weighted Average Remaining  Contractual Term |\n| 81,000              | 301.85                          | 9.9 years                                    |\n| -                   | -                               |                                              |\n| -                   | -                               |                                              |\n| -                   | -                               |                                              |\n| 81,000              | 301.85                          | 8.9 years                                    |\n| 27,000              | 301.85                          | 8.9 years                                    |",

The Transition Toll Tax was assessed on our share of our foreign corporations' accumulated foreign earnings that were not previously taxed. Earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of 8.0%.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have accrued income tax liabilities of $419.5 million and $558.0 million, respectively, under the Transition Toll Tax. Of the amounts accrued as of December 31, 2023, approximately $185.4 million is expected to be paid within one year. The Transition Toll Tax is being paid in installments over an eight--year period, which started in 2018, and will not accrue interest.\n\n## Unremitted Earnings\n\nAt December 31, 2023, we considered our earnings not to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. and therefore recorded deferred tax liabilities associated with an estimate of the total withholding taxes expected as a result of our repatriation of earnings. Other than for earnings, we are permanently reinvested for book/tax basis differences of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2023, primarily arising through the impacts of purchase accounting. These permanently reinvested basis differences could reverse through sales of the foreign subsidiaries, as well as various other events, none of which were considered probable as of December 31, 2023. The residual U.S. tax liability, if these differences reverse, would be between $300.0 million and $400.0 million as of December 31, 2023.",

The change in the valuation allowance between December 31, 2023 and 2022, was primarily driven by a reduction of approximately $470.3 million related to the elimination of Neurimmune's tax basis in ADUHELM as a result of its deconsolidation and reduction of approximately $230.3 million due to movements in net operating loss deferred tax assets in Switzerland. The net income tax impact of the changes in the valuation allowance was an expense of approximately $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change in the valuation allowance between December 31, 2022 and 2021, and between December 31, 2021 and 2020, was primarily driven by additions of $85.0 million and $390.0 million, respectively, related to Neurimmune's tax basis in ADUHELM. For additional information on the deconsolidation and our collaboration arrangement with Neurimmune, please read Note 20, Investments in Variable Interest Entities , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn addition to deferred tax assets and liabilities, we have recorded deferred charges related to intra-entity sales of inventory. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total deferred charges were $69.3 million and $56.6 million, respectively.\n\n## Inflation Reduction Act\n\nIn August 2022 the IRA was signed into law in the U.S. The IRA introduced new tax provisions, including a 15.0% corporate alternative minimum tax and a 1.0% excise tax on stock repurchases. The provisions of the IRA are effective for periods after December 31, 2022. The IRA did not result in any material adjustments to our income tax provision or income tax balances as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Preliminary guidance has been issued by the IRS and we expect additional guidance and regulations to be issued in future periods. We will continue to assess its potential impact on our business and results of operations as further information becomes available.",

The change also benefits from the resolution of an uncertain tax matter during the first quarter of 2023 related to tax credits.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021, the increase in our effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the net Neurimmune deferred tax asset, as discussed below, includes the tax impacts of the litigation settlement agreement and the sale of our building at 125 Broadway. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the current year tax benefits related to an international reorganization to align with global tax developments, the impacts of the sale of our equity interest in Samsung Bioepis and the tax impacts of the decision to discontinue development of vixotrigine. Further in 2021, our effective tax rate benefited from the tax effects of the BIIB111 and BIIB112 impairment charges and the non-cash tax effects of changes in the value of our equity instruments.\n\nFor additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read Note 2, Acquisitions , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\nFor additional information on the litigation settlement agreement, please read Note 18, Other Consolidated Financial Statement Detail , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Neurimmune Deferred Tax Asset\n\nDuring 2021 we recorded a net deferred tax asset in Switzerland of approximately $100.0 million on Neurimmune's tax basis in ADUHELM, the realization of which was dependent on future sales of ADUHELM.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, upon issuance of the final NCD related to ADUHELM, we recorded an increase in a valuation allowance of approximately $85.0 million to reduce the net value of this deferred tax asset to zero.\n\nThese adjustments to our net deferred tax asset were each recorded with an equal and offsetting amount assigned to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of income, resulting in a zero net impact to net income attributable to Biogen Inc.",

        "page_content": "## BIOGEN INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023 Neurimmune was deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements. For additional information on the deconsolidation and our collaboration arrangement with Neurimmune, please read Note 20, Investments in Variable Interest Entities , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Tax Attributes\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had general business credit carry forwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes of approximately $141.8 million that begin to expire in 2030 and net operating losses of approximately $913.1 million that do not expire. For U.S. state income tax purposes, we had research and investment credit carry forwards of approximately $140.5 million that begin to expire in 2027 and net operating losses of approximately $21.0 million that begin to expire in 2036. For foreign income tax purposes, we had $13.0 billion of federal net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2027 and $12.2 billion of Swiss cantonal net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2027.\n\nIn assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we have considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In making this determination, under the applicable financial reporting standards, we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and income tax liability and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are utilizable, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the net benefits of the deferred tax assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries, net of the recorded valuation allowance. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods, we may need to adjust or establish a valuation allowance, which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\n\n## Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\n\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of our unrecognized tax benefits is summarized as follows:\n\n| (In millions)                                                  | 2023     | 2022     | 2021     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Beginning balance                                              | $  606.4 | $  563.4 | $  75.7  |\n| Additions based on tax positions related to the current period | 5.2      | 36.3     | 4.2      |\n| Additions for tax positions of prior periods                   | 60.2     | 23.4     | 509.9    |\n| Reductions for tax positions of prior periods                  | (485.0)  | (14.9)   | (18.8)   |\n| Statute expirations                                            | (2.1)    | (1.6)    | (3.2)    |\n| Settlement refund (payment)                                    | (11.3)   | (0.2)    | (4.4)    |\n| Ending balance                                                 | $  173.4 | $  606.4 | $  563.4 |\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we increased our gross unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $455.0 million, related to a deferred tax asset for Swiss tax purposes for Neurimmune's tax basis in ADUHELM. This unrecognized tax benefit was recorded as a reduction to the gross deferred tax asset, resulting in the net deferred tax asset, as discussed above, and not as a separate liability on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022, the unrecognized tax benefits related to Neurimmune was approximately $450.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we decreased our gross unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $450.0 million related to this item as a result of the deconsolidation of Neurimmune.\n\nWe file income tax returns in various U.S. states and in U.S. federal and other foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examination for years before 2019 or state, local or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2013.\n\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other national tax authorities routinely examine our intercompany transfer pricing with respect to intellectual property related transactions and it is possible that they may disagree with one or more positions we have taken with respect to such valuations.\n\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, are $147.6 million, $134.0 million and $87.5 million (net of the federal benefit on state issues), respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate in future periods.",

Terms of the various collaboration agreements may require us to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain product research and development objectives and pay royalties on future sales, if any, of commercial products resulting from the collaboration.\n\nDepending on the collaborative arrangement, we may record funding receivable or payable balances with our collaboration partners, based on the nature of the cost-sharing mechanism and activity within the collaboration. Our significant collaborative arrangements are discussed below.\n\n## Genentech, Inc. (Roche Group)\n\nWe have certain business and financial rights with respect to RITUXAN for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, CLL and other conditions; RITUXAN HYCELA for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and CLL; GAZYVA for the treatment of CLL and follicular lymphoma; OCREVUS for the treatment of PPMS and RMS; LUNSUMIO for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma; COLUMVI, a bispecific antibody for the treatment of nonHodgkin's lymphoma, which was granted accelerated approval by the FDA during the second quarter of 2023; and have the option to add other potential anti-CD20 therapies, pursuant to our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, a wholly-owned member of the Roche Group.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\nIf we undergo a change in control, as defined in our collaboration agreement, Genentech has the right to present an offer to buy the rights to RITUXAN and we must either accept Genentech's offer or purchase Genentech's rights on the same terms as its offer. Genentech will also be deemed concurrently to have purchased our rights to the remaining products in the collaboration on the terms set forth below.\n\nOur collaboration with Genentech was created through a contractual arrangement and not through a joint venture or other legal entity.\n\n## RITUXAN\n\nGenentech and its affiliates are responsible for the worldwide manufacture of RITUXAN as well as all development and commercialization activities as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 U.S.: We have co-exclusively licensed our rights to develop, commercialize and market RITUXAN in the U.S.\n- \u00b7 Canada: We have co-exclusively licensed our rights to develop, commercialize and market RITUXAN in Canada.\n\n## GAZYVA\n\nThe Roche Group and its sub-licensees maintain sole responsibility for the development, manufacture and commercialization of GAZYVA in the U.S. The level of gross sales of GAZYVA in the U.S. has impacted our percentage of the co-promotion profits for RITUXAN and LUNSUMIO, as summarized in the table below.\n\nIf we undergo a change in control, as defined in our collaboration agreement, Genentech will be deemed to have purchased our rights to GAZYVA in exchange for the continued payment of the current compensation payable for GAZYVA under the collaboration arrangement until the 11 year anniversary of the first commercial sale of GAZYVA in the U.S.\n\n## OCREVUS\n\nPursuant to the terms of our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, we receive a tiered royalty on U.S. net sales from 13.5% and increasing up to 24.0% if annual net sales exceed $900.0 million. There will be a 50.0% reduction to these royalties if a biosimilar to OCREVUS is approved in the U.S.\n\nIn addition, we receive a gross 3.0% royalty on net sales of OCREVUS outside the U.S., with the royalty period lasting 11 years from the first commercial sale of OCREVUS on a country-by-country basis.\n\nThe commercialization of OCREVUS does not impact the percentage of the co-promotion profits we receive for RITUXAN, LUNSUMIO or GAZYVA. Genentech is solely responsible for development and commercialization of OCREVUS and funding future costs. Genentech cannot develop OCREVUS in CLL, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nOCREVUS royalty revenue is based on our estimates from third party and market research data of OCREVUS sales occurring during the corresponding period. Differences between actual and estimated royalty revenue will be adjusted for in the period in which they become known, which is generally expected to be the following quarter.\n\nIf we undergo a change in control, as defined in our collaboration agreement, Genentech will be deemed to have purchased our rights to OCREVUS in exchange for the continued payment of the current royalties on net sales (as defined in our collaboration agreement and summarized above) in the U.S. only, until the 11 year anniversary of the first commercial sale of OCREVUS in the U.S.",

In connection with this exercise, we recorded a $30.0 million option exercise fee payable to Genentech in December 2021, which was recognized in research and development expense in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. We also recorded a charge of approximately $20.0 million to reimburse Genentech for our 30.0% share of the costs incurred in developing this product candidate during 2021, which was recognized in research and development expense in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded approximately $28.4 million in research and development expense and approximately $13.0 million in sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of income related to this collaboration. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we began to record our share of LUNSUMIO development and sales and marketing expense as a reduction of our share of pre-tax profits in revenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs within our consolidated statements of income.\n\nUnder our collaboration with Genentech, we were responsible for 30.0% of development costs for LUNSUMIO prior to FDA approval and will be entitled to a tiered share of co-promotion operating profits and losses in the U.S., as summarized in the table below. In addition, we receive low single-digit royalties on sales of LUNSUMIO outside the U.S. In December 2022 LUNSUMIO was granted accelerated approval by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma.\n\nIf we undergo a change in control, as defined in our collaboration agreement, Genentech will be deemed to have purchased our rights to LUNSUMIO in exchange for 30.0% of the U.S. co-promotion operating profits or losses until the 11 year anniversary of the first commercial sale of LUNSUMIO in the U.S.\n\n## COLUMVI (glofitamab)\n\nIn December 2022 we entered into an agreement with Genentech related to the commercialization and sharing of economics for COLUMVI, a bispecific antibody for the treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which was subsequently granted accelerated approval by the FDA in June 2023. Under the terms of this agreement, we will have no payment obligations. Genentech will have sole decision-making rights on the commercialization of COLUMVI within the U.S. and we will receive tiered royalties in the mid-single digit range on net sales of COLUMVI in the U.S. The commercialization of COLUMVI does not impact the percentage of the co-promotion profits we receive for RITUXAN, LUNSUMIO or GAZYVA.\n\nIf we undergo a change in control, as defined in our collaboration agreement, Genentech will be deemed to have purchased our rights to COLUMVI in exchange for a mid-single digit royalty on net sales (as defined in our collaboration agreement) in the U.S. only, until the 11 year anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product in the U.S.\n\n## Profit-sharing Formulas\n\n## RITUXAN and LUNSUMIO Profit Share\n\nOur current pretax co-promotion profit-sharing formula for RITUXAN and LUNSUMIO in the U.S. provides for a 30.0% share on the first $50.0 million of combined co-promotion operating profits earned each calendar year. As a result of the FDA approval of LUNSUMIO our share of the combined annual co-promotion profits for RITUXAN and LUNSUMIO in excess of $50.0 million varies upon the following events, as summarized in the table below:\n\n| After LUNSUMIO Approval until the First Threshold Date     | 37.5 %   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| After First Threshold Date until the Second Threshold Date | 35.0 %   |\n| After Second Threshold Date                                | 30.0 %   |\n\nFirst Threshold Date means the earlier of (i) the first day of the calendar quarter following the date U.S. gross sales of GAZYVA within any consecutive 12-month period have reached $500.0 million or (ii) the first date in any calendar year in which U.S. gross sales of LUNSUMIO have reached $150.0 million.\n\nSecond Threshold Date means the later of (i) the first date the gross sales in any calendar year in which U.S. gross sales of LUNSUMIO reach $350.0 million or (ii) January 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the First Threshold Date occurs.",

As of December 31, 2023, we paid approximately $16.0 million of the $31.0 million payable. The remaining portion was subsequently paid in January 2024. This termination fee is included in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## LEQEMBI (lecanemab) Collaboration\n\nWe have a collaboration agreement with Eisai to jointly develop and commercialize LEQEMBI (lecanemab), an antiamyloid antibody for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (the LEQEMBI Collaboration).\n\nEisai serves as the lead of LEQEMBI development and regulatory submissions globally with both companies cocommercializing and co-promoting the product, and Eisai having final decision-making authority. All costs, including research, development, sales and marketing expense, are shared equally between us and Eisai. We and Eisai copromote LEQEMBI and share profits and losses equally. We currently manufacture LEQEMBI drug substance and drug product and in March 2022 we extended our supply agreement with Eisai related to LEQEMBI from five years to ten years for the manufacture of LEQEMBI drug substance.\n\nThe LEQEMBI Collaboration also provided Eisai with an option to jointly develop and commercialize ADUHELM (aducanumab) (ADUHELM Option), and an option to jointly develop and commercialize one of our anti-tau monoclonal antibodies (Anti-Tau Option). In October 2017 Eisai exercised its ADUHELM Option and we entered into a new collaboration agreement for the joint development and commercialization of ADUHELM (aducanumab) (the ADUHELM Collaboration Agreement).",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\nOn March 14, 2022, we amended our ADUHELM Collaboration Agreement with Eisai. As of the amendment date, we have sole decision making and commercialization rights worldwide on ADUHELM, and beginning January 1, 2023, Eisai receives only a tiered royalty based on net sales of ADUHELM, and no longer participates in sharing ADUHELM's global profits and losses. In March 2022 we also amended the LEQEMBI Collaboration Agreement with Eisai to eliminate the Anti-Tau Option.\n\nIf either company undergoes a change of control, as defined in our LEQEMBI Collaboration Agreement, the nonacquired party may elect to initiate an operational separation, as defined in the LEQEMBI Collaboration Agreement. In the event of an operational separation, we would work with Eisai to effect a timely transition of any development, manufacturing or commercial responsibilities regarding LEQEMBI from us to Eisai. In this scenario, as of six months following the change of control, our ongoing responsibility for LEQEMBI related cost-sharing would be reduced to an amount equal to 80.0% of what we would have owed prior to the operational separation, and all other economic rights would remain unchanged.\n\nIn addition, in the event either company undergoes a change of control in which the acquirer is engaged in commercialization of a competing product, as defined in the LEQEMBI Collaboration Agreement, the non-acquired party may also request that the acquired party cease commercializing the competing product. Should the acquired party elect to continue commercializing the competing product, the non-acquired party may terminate the LEQEMBI Collaboration Agreement. Furthermore, in the event we are the non-acquired party, we may choose either to sell our interest in LEQEMBI to Eisai or purchase Eisai's interest in LEQEMBI, subject to the parameters set forth in the LEQEMBI Collaboration Agreement.\n\nIn July 2023 the FDA granted traditional approval of LEQEMBI. Prior to receiving traditional approval, LEQEMBI had been granted accelerated approval by the FDA in January 2023, at which time it became commercially available in the U.S. Additionally, in September 2023 the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approved LEQEMBI in Japan, which was subsequently launched in Japan in December 2023.\n\nUpon commercialization of LEQEMBI, we began recognizing our 50.0% share of LEQEMBI product revenue, net and cost of sales, including royalties, within other revenue in our consolidated statements of income, as we are not the principal.\n\nOur share of LEQEMBI sales and marketing expense and development expense are recorded within selling, general and administrative expense and research and development expense, respectively, within our consolidated statements of income.\n\nA summary of development and sales and marketing expense related to the LEQEMBI Collaboration is as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                            | For the Years Ended December 31,   | For the Years Ended December 31,   | For the Years Ended December 31,   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                                                              | 2023                               | 2022                               | 2021                               |\n| Total development expense incurred by the collaboration related to the advancement of  LEQEMBI                                                                             | $  371.9                           | $  347.2                           | $  323.0                           |\n| Biogen's share of the LEQEMBI Collaboration development expense reflected in research  and development expense in our consolidated statements of income                    | 186.0                              | 173.6                              | 161.5                              |\n| Total sales and marketing expense incurred by the LEQEMBI Collaboration                                                                                                    | 304.4                              | 104.6                              | 27.2                               |\n| Biogen's share of the LEQEMBI Collaboration sales and marketing expense reflected in  selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income | 152.2                              | 52.3                               | 13.6                               |\n\n## ADUHELM Collaboration Agreement\n\nThe LEQEMBI Collaboration also provided Eisai with an option to jointly develop and commercialize ADUHELM (aducanumab) (ADUHELM Option).

In October 2019 the FDA approved VUMERITY in the U.S. for the treatment of RMS. During the fourth quarter of 2021 VUMERITY was approved for the treatment of RRMS in certain international markets.\n\nUnder this agreement, we received an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize VUMERITY and we pay Alkermes royalties of 15.0% on worldwide net commercial sales of VUMERITY, which are recognized in cost of sales within our consolidated statements of income. Royalties payable on net commercial sales of VUMERITY are subject, under certain circumstances, to tiered minimum annual payment requirements for a period of five years following FDA approval. Royalty cost of sales related to sales of VUMERITY for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, totaled approximately $87.4 million, $83.0 million and $61.6 million, respectively.\n\nAlkermes is eligible to receive royalties in the high-single digits to sub-teen double digits of annual net commercial sales upon successful development and commercialization of new product candidates, other than VUMERITY, developed under the exclusive license from Alkermes.\n\nAlkermes currently supplies both VUMERITY and FAMPYRA to us pursuant to separate supply agreements. In October 2019 we entered into a new supply agreement and amended our license and collaboration agreement with Alkermes for VUMERITY. We have elected to initiate a technology transfer and, following a transition period, to manufacture VUMERITY or have VUMERITY manufactured by a third party we have engaged in exchange for paying an increased royalty rate to Alkermes on any portion of future worldwide net commercial sales of VUMERITY that is manufactured by us or our designee. In January 2023 we entered into a new supply agreement with Alkermes for FAMPYRA through January 2025. In December 2023 Alkermes entered into a definitive agreement to sell its development and manufacturing facility to Novo Nordisk, which is expected to close in mid-2024. Alkermes and Novo Nordisk plan to enter into subcontracting arrangements to continue work currently performed at the facility for a period of time after closing the transaction, which may continue through the end of 2025.\n\n## Acorda Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nIn June 2009 we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Acorda to develop and commercialize products containing fampridine, such as FAMPYRA, in markets outside the U.S.\n\nUnder this agreement, we pay tiered royalties based on the level of ex-U.S. net sales and we may pay potential milestone payments based on the successful achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones.\n\nIn January 2024 we notified Acorda of our decision to terminate our collaboration and license agreement, effective January 1, 2025. As a result of this termination, Acorda will regain global commercialization rights to FAMPYRA.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, total cost of sales related to royalties and commercial supply of FAMPYRA reflected in our consolidated statements of income were approximately $55.2 million, $46.1 million and $46.6 million, respectively.",

We may pay Sage development and commercial milestone payments that could total up to approximately $1.6 billion if all the specified milestones set forth in this collaboration are achieved.\n\nIn August 2023 the FDA approved ZURZUVAE for adults with PPD, pending DEA scheduling, which was completed in October 2023. Upon approval, ZURZUVAE became the first and only oral, once-daily, 14-day treatment that can provide rapid improvements in depressive symptoms by day 15 for women with PPD. ZURZUVAE for PPD became commercially available in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally, the FDA issued a CRL for the NDA for zuranolone in the treatment of adults with MDD. The CRL stated that the application did not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness to support the approval of zuranolone for the treatment of MDD and that an additional study or studies would be needed. We and Sage are continuing to seek feedback from the FDA and evaluating next steps.\n\nUnder this collaboration, both companies will share equal responsibility and costs for development as well as profits and losses for commercialization in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we are responsible for development and commercialization, excluding Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, with respect to zuranolone and may pay Sage potential tiered royalties in the high teens to low twenties. During the fourth quarter of 2023 we accrued a milestone payment due to Sage of $75.0 million upon the first commercial sale of ZURZUVAE for PPD in the U.S., which was recorded within intangible assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets, and subsequently paid in January 2024.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized net reductions to our operating expense of approximately $4.7 million to reflect Sage's 50.0% share of net collaboration losses in the U.S., which is recognized in collaboration profit sharing/(loss reimbursement) in our consolidated statements of income.\n\nA summary of development and sales and marketing expense related to the Sage collaboration is as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | For the Years Ended December 31,   | For the Years Ended December 31,   | For the Years Ended December 31,   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 2023                               | 2022                               | 2021                               |\n| Total Sage collaboration development expense                                                                                                                                                                                   | $  176.7                           | $  173.3                           | $  167.7                           |\n| Biogen's share of the Sage collaboration development expense reflected in  research and development expense in our consolidated statements of income                                                                           | 88.3                               | 86.7                               | 83.8                               |\n| Total sales and marketing expense incurred by the Sage collaboration                                                                                                                                                           | 187.0                              | 109.9                              | 36.4                               |\n| Biogen's share of the Sage collaboration sales and marketing expense  reflected in selling, general and administrative expense and collaboration  profit sharing/(loss reimbursement) in our consolidated statements of income | 93.5                               | 55.0                               | 18.2                               |",

We may pay Denali development and commercial milestone payments that could total up to approximately $1.1 billion if the milestones related to the LRRK2 Collaboration are achieved.\n\nIn April 2023 we exercised our option with Denali to license the ATV-enabled anti-amyloid beta program. In connection with this exercise, we assumed responsibility for all development and commercial activities and associated expenses related to this program. In addition, we made a one-time option exercise payment to Denali and, should certain milestones be achieved, may pay Denali additional development and commercial milestone payments and royalties based on future net sales. Our agreement with Denali was amended in August 2023, whereby certain milestone criteria were changed, while the total amount of development, regulatory and commercial milestones remains the same. In addition, we agreed to waive our option right to the second option program.\n\nUnder the LRRK2 Collaboration, both companies share responsibility and costs for global development based on specified percentages as well as profits and losses for commercialization in the U.S. and China.

Samsung BioLogics contributed 280.5 billion South Korean won (approximately $250.0 million) for an 85.0% ownership interest in Samsung Bioepis and we contributed 49.5 billion South Korean won (approximately $45.0 million) for the remaining 15.0% ownership interest. In June 2018 we exercised our option under our joint venture agreement to increase our ownership percentage in Samsung Bioepis from approximately 5.0%, which reflected the effect of previous equity financings in which we did not participate, to approximately 49.9%. The share purchase transaction was completed in November 2018 and, upon closing, we paid 759.5 billion South Korean won ($676.6 million) to Samsung BioLogics.\n\nIn April 2022 we completed the sale of our 49.9% equity interest in Samsung Bioepis to Samsung BioLogics in exchange for total consideration of approximately $2.3 billion. Under the terms of this transaction, we received approximately $1.0 billion in cash at closing, with approximately $1.3 billion in cash to be deferred over two payments. The first deferred payment of $812.5 million was received in April 2023 and the second deferred payment of $437.5 million is due at the second anniversary of the closing of this transaction in April 2024.\n\nAs part of this transaction, we are also eligible to receive up to an additional $50.0 million upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones. Our policy for contingent payments of this nature is to recognize the payments in the period that they become realizable, which is generally the same period in which the payments are earned.\n\nPrior to this sale, we recognized our share of the results of operations related to our investment in Samsung Bioepis under the equity method of accounting one quarter in arrears when the results of the entity became available, which was reflected as equity in (income) loss of investee, net of tax in our consolidated statements of income.\n\nUpon our November 2018 investment, the equity method of accounting required us to identify and allocate differences between the fair value of our investment and the carrying value of our interest in the underlying net assets of the investee. These basis differences were being amortized over their economic life, until the completion of the sale in April 2022, as discussed above. The total basis difference was approximately $675.0 million and related to inventory, developed technology, IPR&D and deferred tax balances. The basis differences related to inventory were amortized, net of tax, over their estimated useful lives of 1.5 years, and the basis differences related to developed technology and IPR&D for marketed products were being amortized, net of tax, over their estimated useful lives of 15 years.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized net income on our investment of $2.6 million, reflecting our share of Samsung Bioepis' operating profits, net of tax, totaling $17.0 million offset by amortization of basis differences totaling $14.4 million. Following the sale of Samsung Bioepis we no longer recognize gains or losses associated with Samsung Bioepis' results of operations and amortization related to basis differences.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized net income on our investment of $34.9 million, reflecting our share of Samsung Bioepis' operating profits, net of tax, totaling $64.6 million offset by amortization of basis differences totaling $29.7 million.\n\nNet income on our investment for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflects a $31.2 million benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets associated with Samsung Bioepis. The valuation allowance was released in the second quarter of 2021 based on a consideration of the positive and negative evidence, including the historic earnings of Samsung Bioepis.",

We have an option to extend this agreement by an additional five years, subject to payment of an option exercise fee of $60.0 million by August 2024. We also have an option to acquire exclusive rights to commercialize these products in China.\n\nWe reflect revenue on sales of BENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI to third parties in product revenue, net in our consolidated statements of income and record the related cost of revenue and sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of income to their respective line items when these costs are incurred.

In exchange, we receive single digit royalties on biosimilar products developed and commercialized by Samsung Bioepis. Royalty revenue under the license agreement is recognized as a component of contract manufacturing, royalty and other revenue in our consolidated statements of income.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $13.6 million, $20.6 million and $20.7 million, respectively, as a component of contract manufacturing, royalty and other revenue in our consolidated statements of income related to the license agreement and other services performed under our collaboration with Samsung Bioepis.\n\nAmounts receivable from Samsung Bioepis related to the agreements discussed above were $9.9 million and $2.0 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The following are our significant variable interest entities.\n\n## Neurimmune SubOne AG\n\nBeginning in 2007 we consolidated the results of Neurimmune as we determined we were the primary beneficiary because we had the power through the collaboration to direct the activities that most significantly impacted the entity's economic performance and we were required to fund 100.0% of the research and development costs incurred in support of the collaboration. The collaboration and license agreement with Neurimmune was for the development and commercialization of antibodies for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease, including ADUHELM (as amended, the Neurimmune Agreement).\n\nIn November 2023 we notified Neurimmune of our decision to terminate the Neurimmune Agreement. Subsequent to the termination, we reconsidered our relationship with Neurimmune and determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. As a result, we recorded a net gain on the deconsolidation of Neurimmune of approximately $3.0 million, which was recorded in other (income) expense, net within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nIn June 2021 ADUHELM was granted accelerated approval by the FDA. Under the terms of the Neurimmune Agreement, we were required to pay Neurimmune a milestone payment of $100.0 million related to the launch of ADUHELM in the U.S. During the second quarter of 2021 we made this $100.0 million payment, which was recognized as a charge to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of income. In addition, during the second quarter of 2021 we recognized net profit-sharing income of $45.0 million to reflect Eisai's 45.0% share of the $100.0 million milestone payment, which was recognized in collaboration profit sharing/(loss reimbursement) in our consolidated statements of income.\n\nDuring 2021 we recorded a net deferred tax asset in Switzerland of approximately $100.0 million on Neurimmune's tax basis in ADUHELM, the realization of which was dependent on future sales of ADUHELM. During the first quarter of 2022, upon issuance of the final NCD related to ADUHELM, we recorded an increase in a valuation allowance of approximately $85.0 million to reduce the net value of this deferred tax asset to zero. These adjustments to our net deferred tax asset were each recorded with an equal and offsetting amount assigned to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of income, resulting in a zero net impact to net income attributable to Biogen Inc.\n\nExcluding the impact of the Neurimmune deferred tax asset, the assets and liabilities of Neurimmune are not significant to our consolidated financial position or results of operations as it is a research and development organization. We have provided no financing to Neurimmune other than contractually required amounts.\n\nResearch and development costs for which we reimbursed Neurimmune are reflected in research and development expense in our consolidated statements of income. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, amounts reimbursed were immaterial.\n\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Eisai, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities\n\nWe have relationships with various variable interest entities that we do not consolidate as we lack the power to direct the activities that significantly impact the economic success of these entities. These relationships include investments in certain biotechnology companies and research collaboration agreements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of our investments in certain biotechnology companies representing potential unconsolidated variable interest entities totaled $16.4 million and $27.8 million, respectively. Our maximum exposure to loss related to these variable interest entities is limited to the carrying value of our investments.\n\nWe have also entered into research collaboration agreements with certain variable interest entities where we are required to fund certain development activities.

Royalty payments are recognized as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## SPINRAZA\n\nWe make royalty payments to Ionis on annual worldwide net sales of SPINRAZA using a tiered royalty rate between 11.0% and 15.0%, which are recognized as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income.

Royalties payable on net sales of VUMERITY are subject, under certain circumstances, to tiered minimum annual payment requirements for a period of five years following FDA approval.\n\nIn October 2019 we entered into a new supply agreement and amended our license and collaboration agreement with Alkermes for VUMERITY. We have elected to initiate a technology transfer and, following a transition period, to manufacture VUMERITY or have VUMERITY manufactured by a third party we have engaged in exchange for paying an increased royalty rate to Alkermes on any portion of future worldwide net commercial sales of VUMERITY that is manufactured by us or our designee. For additional information on our collaboration arrangement with Alkermes, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## SKYCLARYS\n\nIn connection with our acquisition of Reata in September 2023 we assumed additional contractual obligations related to royalty payments.

Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones was not considered probable as of December 31, 2023, such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023 we accrued a milestone payment due to Sage of $75.0 million upon the first commercial sale of ZURZUVAE for PPD in the U.S., which was recorded within intangible assets, net in our",

Under the terms of the Neurimmune Agreement, we were required to pay Neurimmune a milestone payment of $100.0 million related to the launch of ADUHELM in the U.S. During the second quarter of 2021 we made this $100.0 million payment, which was recognized as a charge to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Other Funding Commitments\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have several ongoing clinical studies in various clinical trial stages. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. The contracts with CROs are generally cancellable, with notice, at our option. We recorded accrued expense of approximately $47.2 million in our consolidated balance sheets for expenditures incurred by CROs as of December 31, 2023. We have approximately $669.0 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## Tax Related Obligations\n\nWe exclude liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2023, we have approximately $172.0 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have accrued income tax liabilities of approximately $419.5 million and $558.0 million, respectively, under the Transition Toll Tax.

Under these provisions, we generally indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of our activities. These indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. However, to date we have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. As a result, the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Note 24: Employee Benefit Plans\n\nWe sponsor various retirement and pension plans. Our estimates of liabilities and expense for these plans incorporate a number of assumptions, including expected rates of return on plan assets and interest rates used to discount future benefits.\n\n## 401(k) Savings Plan\n\nWe maintain a 401(k) Savings Plan, which is available to substantially all regular employees in the U.S. over the age of 21.

All matching contributions and participant contributions vest immediately. The 401(k) Savings Plan also holds certain transition contributions on behalf of participants who previously participated in the Biogen, Inc. Retirement Plan.

The SSP also provides certain credits to highly compensated U.S. employees that are paid by the company. These credits are known as the Restoration Match. The deferred compensation amounts are accrued when earned. Such deferred compensation is distributable in cash in accordance with the rules of the SSP. Deferred compensation amounts under such plan as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, totaled approximately $134.6 million and $131.9 million, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.

Under the Swiss plan, both we and certain of our employees with annual earnings in excess of government determined amounts are required to make contributions into a fund managed by an independent investment fiduciary. Employer contributions must be in an amount at least equal to the employee's contribution. Minimum employee contributions are based on the respective employee's age, salary and gender. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Swiss plan had an unfunded net pension obligation of $51.5 million and $49.9 million, respectively, and plan assets that totaled $239.6 million and $193.7 million, respectively.

        "page_content": "## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Biogen Inc.\n\n## Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Biogen Inc. and its subsidiaries (the 'Company') as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flow for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'consolidated financial statements'). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\nAs described in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Reata) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2023. We have also excluded Reata from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Reata is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenue excluded from management's assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 1.0% and 0.6%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in",

        "page_content": "accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Reserves for Medicaid and Managed Care Rebates in the U.S.\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized revenue from product sales, net of reserves, including contractual adjustments related to Medicaid and managed care rebates in the U.S. Within accrued expense and other, revenue-related reserves amounted to $926.5 million as of December 31, 2023. A portion of this balance includes contractual adjustments for Medicaid and managed care rebates in the U.S. Medicaid rebates relate to the Company's estimated obligations to states under established reimbursement arrangements. The Company's liability for Medicaid rebates consists of estimates for claims that a state will make for the current quarter, claims for prior quarters that have been estimated for which an invoice has not been received, invoices received for claims from the prior quarters that have not been paid and an estimate of potential claims that will be made for inventory that exists in the distribution channel at period end. Managed care rebates in the U.S. represent the Company's estimated obligations to third-parties, primarily pharmacy benefit managers. These rebates result from performance-based goals, formulary position and price increase limit allowances (price protection). The calculation of the accrual for these rebates is based on an estimate of the coverage patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual period. Rebate accruals for Medicaid and managed care in the U.S. are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expense and other current liabilities. The estimates of the reserves for Medicaid and managed care in the U.S. reflect historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to reserves for Medicaid and managed care rebates in the U.S. is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty when developing the estimate of the reserves and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating assumptions related to historical experience, current contractual requirements, specific known market events, and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's estimate of the reserves for Medicaid and managed care rebates in the U.S. These procedures also included, among others (i) developing an independent estimate of the reserves for Medicaid and managed care rebates in the U.S. by utilizing third-party data related to product demand, data related to price changes, the terms of the specific rebate programs, the historical trend of actual rebate claims paid and consideration of contractual requirement changes and market events; (ii) comparing the independent estimate to management's estimate to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimate; and (iii) testing, on a sample basis, rebate claims paid by the Company, including evaluating the claims for consistency with the contractual terms of the Company's rebate agreements.",

        "page_content": "Acquisition of Reata - Valuation of Completed Technology and In-Process Research and Development Intangible Assets\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of Reata for total consideration of $7,193.4 million. Of the acquired intangible assets, $4,200.0 million of completed technology and $2,300.0 million of in-process research and development (IPR&D) were recorded. Management uses the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a form of the income approach, utilizing post-tax cash flows and discount rates in estimating the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired when allocating the purchase consideration paid for the acquisition. The estimates of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets involve significant judgment by management and include assumptions with measurement uncertainty, such as the amount and timing of projected cash flows, long-term sales forecasts, discount rate, and additionally for the IPR&D intangible asset, the timing and probability of regulatory and commercial success.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of completed technology and IPR&D intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Reata is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty when developing the fair value estimate of the completed technology and IPR&D intangible assets acquired; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to long-term sales forecasts and discount rate for the completed technology intangible asset and long-term sales forecasts, discount rate, and probability of regulatory and commercial success for the IPR&D intangible asset; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management's valuation of the completed technology and IPR&D intangible assets acquired. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management's process for developing the fair value estimate of the completed technology and IPR&D intangible assets acquired; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method used by management; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of certain of the data used in the multi-period excess earnings method; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to long-term sales forecasts and discount rate for the completed technology intangible asset and long-term sales forecasts, discount rate, and probability of regulatory and commercial success for the IPR&D intangible asset. Evaluating management's assumptions related to long-term sales forecasts for the completed technology and IPR&D intangible assets and probability of regulatory and commercial success for the IPR&D intangible asset involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the acquired business and (ii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Evaluating management's assumption related to long-term sales forecasts also involved considering the consistency with external market and industry data. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate significant assumption for the completed technology and IPR&D intangible assets.\n\n/s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 13, 2024\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2003.",
