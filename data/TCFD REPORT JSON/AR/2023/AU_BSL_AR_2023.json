The entire 16,500-strong BlueScope team has been critical to delivering this result, as they continue to find innovative solutions that maintain our safe and reliable operations, better service our customers, and support our local communities.\n\nKey highlights for BlueScope in FY2023 include further execution of our US growth strategy, with the ramp up of the North Star mill and integration of both BlueScope Recycling and Materials and BlueScope Coated Products progressing well. Underpinning future growth, in Australia work has commenced on a new $415 million metal coating line in Western Sydney to underpin future demand for our value-added suite of products, such as our iconic COLORBOND \u00ae steel range - which saw record sales volumes in FY2023.\n\nAnother highlight this year was the announcement of an accelerated feasibility study to build a new electric arc furnace at New Zealand Steel's Glenbrook plant. With a target of being operational by 2026, this NZ$300 million project will be cofunded by the New Zealand Government and will reduce New Zealand Steel's Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by at least 45 per cent.\n\nIn addition, BlueScope delivered $518 million in shareholder returns in FY2023, and retained a strong balance sheet, finishing the year with $703 million in net cash. With strong cash flow and a robust balance sheet, BlueScope is very well positioned to continue to grow and deliver value.\n\n## FY2023 Highlights\n\nReported NPAT $1.01Bn\n\nUnderlying NPAT $1.10Bn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Safety\n\nAs always, safety comes first at BlueScope.\n\nAfter evolving our overall approach to health and safety in recent years, BlueScope has now embraced a people-centred approach and embedded a culture of learning from our people. Across the business, BlueScope is implementing innovative and practical risk control improvements to enhance resilience, while empowering all people to identify opportunities for improvement, and be part of the solution.\n\nIn FY2023, we continued the strong performance across our lead indicators, including team-based risk control improvement projects and business-led learning programs which seek to build capacity in how we understand and manage material risks, to reduce the likelihood of life-changing and significant events. The lag indicator of TRIFR was 7.5 for FY2023, above the long term range of 5-7, with the inclusion of recent scrap recycling asset acquisitions.\n\nUnderlying EBIT $1.61Bn\n\nUnderlying EBIT ROIC 14.6%",

        "page_content": "## FY2023 Shareholder Returns\n\n## Dividends paid 50 cps\n\n## Share buy-backs $285M\n\n## Rewarding shareholders\n\nA core part of BlueScope's Financial Framework is balancing the competition between capital for growth initiatives and returns to shareholders. The Company returned $518 million to shareholders in FY2023, comprised of $233 million in dividends and $285 million in on-market buy-backs 1 .\n\nThe Board has approved a final dividend of 25.0 cents per share. Having resumed Australian tax payments and recommencing franking of the interim dividend in FY2023, the final dividend will also be fully franked. Additionally, the Board has approved an increase in the scale and tenor of the share buy-back program to allow up to $400 million to be bought over the next 12 months.\n\n## Port Kembla Blast Furnace Reline & Upgrade\n\nThe Board has approved the $1.15 billion comprehensive reline and upgrade of the No.6 Blast Furnace (6BF) at the Port Kembla Steelworks. Implementing the reline and upgrade project allows us the necessary time to develop, test and pilot alternative viable lower emissions ironmaking pathways.  It also recognises the practical reality of the time frames required for the establishment of the critical enablers to lower emissions steelmaking; enablers that underpin BlueScope's 2050 net zero goal 2 .\n\nThe reline does not lock us in to a full 20-year blast furnace campaign. In contrast, it secures our immediate future while enabling a transition to lower emissions steelmaking as soon as it is commercially feasible. In this sense the reline project is our bridge to the future and critical to maintaining the sovereign capability of flat steelmaking in Australia. The relined 6BF is expected to be commissioned in mid to late 2026.\n\nAs we progress the reline project, we are also building a pathway to our longer term vision of low emissions iron and steelmaking in Australia, by exploring options for the longer term, large-scale decarbonisation of our operations.\n\n## Delivering our Strategy\n\nFY2023 marks four years of BlueScope's 'Transform, Grow, Deliver' strategy, under which the Company has made significant progress in pursuit of Our Purpose.\n\nThe Company has sought to Transform the business, particularly as it relates to addressing climate change. While there is still much to be done, highlights over the last four years include the formation of the Corporate Climate Change function and the establishment of our climate strategy, including defining 2030 targets and a 2050 net zero goal 2 . To date, BlueScope is progressing in line with its medium term targets, and with projects such as the accelerated feasibility study into an electric\n\narc furnace at New Zealand Steel, the Company is well placed for its transition to a low carbon world.\n\nSignificant strides have been made under the Grow pillar of the strategy, most notably in the US, where we are building a platform for quality earnings growth. BlueScope's US presence has grown materially since FY2019, with an additional $2.5 billion invested in two strategic acquisitions and the expansion of our North Star mini-mill. The ramp up of the expansion is advancing well, and the team is also considering future debottlenecking opportunities. BlueScope Recycling and Materials has continued to gain momentum including via the acquisition of a third site. As the second largest metal coil painter in the US, BlueScope Coated Products provides a great opportunity for BlueScope to take its key painting capabilities into the large US market. In Australia, work has commenced on a new metal coating line in Western Sydney, to support growing demand for our value-added coated and painted products, evidenced by a record level of COLORBOND \u00ae steel sales in FY2023.\n\nBlueScope has also continued to Deliver during this period. The evolution of our safety culture to a people-centred approach is well embedded, with approximately 900 risk control projects completed since FY2020. The Company has also made solid progress in better reflecting the communities in which it operates, with a range of inclusion and diversity initiatives, while also bolstering our approach to ensuring sustainable supply chains. Over the last four years, BlueScope has demonstrated the financial strength of its business model, with an average underlying EBIT of $1.9 billion, an average return on invested capital of 22%, and an aggregate $1.8 billion returned to shareholders.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, BlueScope continued to progress a range of initiatives in support of the delivery against our key sustainability outcomes.\n\nOn climate, a key highlight for the year was the aforementioned announcement of the accelerated feasibility study to build a new electric arc furnace at New Zealand Steel's Glenbrook plant. Additionally, in Australia, BlueScope made significant progress in its collaboration agreement with Rio Tinto, completing a concept study into Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) melter technology. We have broadened our review of the most likely decarbonisation project options for ironmaking, including a focus on the necessary enablers. We have also expanded our technology collaborations with global steelmakers, such as thyssenkrupp, Tata Steel and POSCO.\n\nIn the nearer term, our steelmaking emissions intensity is tracking ahead of target with a total 8.3 per cent reduction 3 since FY2018 with a particularly strong performance in FY2023 driven by the\n\n- 1. Includes $12.5 million of shares settled on 1 and 4 July 2022 that relate to shares bought back in late FY2022.\n- 2. Achieving the 2050 net zero goal is highly dependent on several enablers, including: the development and diffusion of ironmaking technologies to viable, commercial scale; access to affordable, firmed large-scale renewable energy; availability of appropriate volumes of affordable green hydrogen (with natural gas enabling the transition); access to appropriate quality and sufficient quantities of economic raw materials; and supportive policies across all these enablers to underpin decarbonisation investment and avoid carbon leakage.\n- 3. Preliminary data. Final emissions intensity figures will be published in BlueScope's FY2023 Sustainability Report. All GHG emissions data are reported on an equity accounted basis.",

Non-steelmaking emissions intensity is tracking close to target, having decreased 8.8 per cent overall since FY2018 1 .\n\nIn seeking to ensure sustainable supply chains, we have focussed on conducting supplier on-site audits for key suppliers identified as being high-risk following pandemic-related interruptions in recent years. The broader procurement teams continued to focus on increasing responsible sourcing knowledge both internally and externally through the year, which also saw the launch of BlueScope's new Responsible Sourcing Policy, to align with ResponsibleSteel\u2122 requirements.\n\nThis year as part of our Social Impact due diligence process, a desktop review of potential modern slavery issues was completed across all our sites. This led to an audit at several of our own sites in Malaysia to assess controls and protections in place for contract workers. Through this proactive process, we identified a number of modern slavery matters impacting some of our contract workers in our Malaysian business which require remediation. The remediation approach has prioritised the wellbeing of those affected through all stages of the process, demonstrating our primary consideration for the safety and welfare of all workers on our sites. We will set out more information on this in our FY2023 Modern Slavery Statement, to be released in September.\n\nFY2023 saw BlueScope continue to build an inclusive workforce which reflects the communities in which we operate, while also working to drive positive social impact. Female representation continues to grow in pursuit of the Company's 40:40:20 target, while beyond gender strategies are gathering significant pace across the business, designed to suit local community needs such as a focus on ethnicity in the US.\n\n## Board renewal\n\nWith more than half our revenues and earnings now coming from outside Australia, it is important that our Board reflects all the regions in which we operate, and in which we will continue to invest and grow. In addition, with the natural renewal of the Board, it is critical that the Board retains the diversity and breadth of skill and experience - particularly those relevant to BlueScope as a large-scale manufacturer of value-added steel products and solutions.\n\nAccordingly, ahead of the FY2022 Annual General Meeting, in September 2022 we welcomed two new independent nonexecutive Directors. Ms Jane McAloon, based in Melbourne, is an experienced non-executive director and Chair, with extensive experience across natural resources, energy, infrastructure and utilities industries. Ms McAloon is Chair and a non-executive director of EnergyAustralia, and a non-executive director of Newcrest Mining Ltd and Allianz Australia Ltd. Prior to this, Ms McAloon spent nine years as Group Company Secretary at BHP Billiton, including two years on the Group Management Committee as President Governance.\n\nMr Peter Alexander, based in the US, brings considerable experience in US building materials and distribution, technology products and services industries. Mr Alexander was previously a non-executive director of Boral Ltd, following a significant senior executive career, most recently as CEO of Building Materials Holding Corporation and then President and CEO of the merged NASDAQ listed group BMC Stock Holdings Inc (BMC), a building materials distributor and construction solutions provider.\n\nIn July 2023, BlueScope announced the appointment of leading industry executive and soon to retire Sims Ltd Managing Director & CEO, Mr Alistair Field, as a non-executive director to the BlueScope Board, effective from 15 January 2024. A mechanical engineer, he has more than 25 years' experience in the mining, metals and manufacturing sector and worked at senior executive level in North America, the Middle East, South Africa and the UK. Prior to the Sims role, Mr Field most recently led the Patrick Terminals and Logistics Division of Asciano and was Chief Operating Officer of Rio Tinto's Alcan Bauxite and Alumina Division.\n\nAnd in one final piece of Board renewal for this calendar year, as announced, I've decided to retire as BlueScope Chair and Non-Executive Director effective from the November AGM. My successor is Jane McAloon, who will be an excellent Chair. I have spent 10 years as a Director and eight years as Chair, during which BlueScope survived and thrived through really challenging corporate and commercial issues.\n\nThroughout, I have been inspired by the dedication and professionalism of our people who are always seeking to find solutions, to grow and to deliver. I've had the privilege of serving on the Board with very fine directors who have brought skills and experience to benefit the Company. Together with employees and management, we all have made BlueScope a different type of steel company.\n\nI'm proud to end this phase of my professional career with BlueScope as a resilient and successful global steelmaker, and I'm confident in the future of this outstanding company.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile BlueScope saw a changing macroeconomic environment in FY2023, the robust performance across the Group reflects not only the success of its strategy at work, but also the resilience of its diversified business model.\n\nThe Board of Directors and I extend our thanks to our team of over 16,500 people across all 16 countries in which we operate who continue to work safely, support each other's health and wellbeing and serve our customers and communities. I also wish to thank our customers, our shareholders and my fellow Directors for their support.\n\nLooking forward to the immediate term, in 1H FY2024, the Company expects underlying EBIT to be in the range of $700 million to $770 million, subject to spread, foreign exchange and market conditions.\n\nWe will provide a further update on trading conditions at our Annual General Meeting on 21 November 2023.\n\nJohn Bevan Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are actively exploring options for the longer term, large-scale decarbonisation of our operations, in order to realise our vision of low emissions iron and steelmaking in Australia.\n\nImplementing the reline and upgrade project allows us the necessary time to develop, test and pilot alternative viable lower emissions iron making pathways. It also recognises the practical reality of the time frames required for the establishment of the critical enablers to lower emissions steelmaking 1 .\n\nThe reline does not lock us in to a full 20-year blast furnace campaign. In contrast, it secures our immediate future while enabling a transition to lower emissions steelmaking as soon as it is commercially feasible. In this sense the reline project is our bridge to the future and critical to maintaining the sovereign capability of flat steelmaking in Australia. The relined 6BF is expected to be commissioned in mid to late 2026.\n\nWe are seeking to deliver the next wave of customer, growth and productivity improvements through robotics, automation and digital resources. Examples of projects already implemented are a predictive maintenance program using asset intelligence, digital twin models and production and supply chain optimisation tools.\n\nAs part of planning for the next 100 years in the Illawarra, BlueScope is nearing the completion of the development of a Master Plan for around 200 hectares of excess landholdings adjacent to the Port Kembla Steelworks. The concept is now taking shape with broader themes focussed around modern manufacturing, clean energy, education and training, and community - which build upon the industrial foundations and capabilities of the Illawarra region.\n\n- 1. In addition to the development and diffusion of ironmaking technologies to viable, commercial scale, enablers include: access to affordable, firmed large-scale renewable energy; availability of appropriate volumes of affordable green hydrogen (with natural gas enabling the transition); access to appropriate quality and sufficient quantities of economic raw materials; and supportive policies across all these enablers to underpin decarbonisation investment and avoid carbon leakage.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability Update\n\nSafety\n\n~900\n\nHSE risk control projects completed since 2020\n\n## Health, Safety and Environment (HSE)\n\nAfter evolving our overall approach to health and safety in recent years, BlueScope has now embraced a people-centred approach and embedded a culture of learning from our people. Across the business, BlueScope is implementing innovative and practical risk control improvements to enhance resilience, while empowering all people to identify opportunities for improvement, and be part of the solution.\n\nKey to this evolved approach is the use of balanced leading and lagging indicators, to align with our strategic direction and industry standards, allowing us greater insight into HSE performance. Leading indicators provide visibility over risk management, including risk control improvement projects and participation in leadership workshops. Lag indicators provide meaningful context from observed injury indicators, particularly relating to the presence of capacity in our processes and systems to reduce injury severity, both actual and potential.\n\nIn FY2023, BlueScope employees completed 249 of the 250 identified team-based HSE risk control improvement projects for the year. These projects build capacity in how we manage material risks, to reduce the likelihood of life-changing and significant events. In addition, during the year 48 environmental improvement projects were submitted as entries in the annual BlueScope Environmental Awards, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 13,000 megawatt hours in electricity consumption, a saving of around 200,000 kilolitres of fresh water and approximately $4.2M in annualised cost savings.\n\nSince 2020, 1,657 of BlueScope's leaders have participated in expert-led HSE risk management workshops, with over 250 of BlueScope's supply chain and industry partners also participating during this time. In addition, 1,541 employees were involved in business-led HSE learning programs in FY2023, as this lead metric shifts from leaders to incorporate broader workforce participation and learning.\n\nThe lagging injury metric TRIFR was 7.5 per million hours worked in FY2023, above the top end of the long term historical range of 5-7, with the inclusion of recent scrap recycling asset acquisitions. The injury profile during the year continued to be lower severity injuries (e.g. sprains, lacerations), with two of the injuries resulting in a permanent incapacity, and eight having had the potential to be a fatal incident. These figures remained stable on previous financial years' lag indicators, from which the Company derives meaningful insights.\n\n## Climate Change 8.3%\n\nReduction in steelmaking GHG emissions intensity since FY2018 1\n\n## Climate Change\n\nBlueScope made progress towards its 2030 emissions intensity reduction targets through the financial year. Steelmaking emissions intensity is tracking ahead of target with a total 8.3 per cent reduction 1 since FY2018, with a particularly strong performance in FY2023 driven by the the ramp up of the North Star expansion and energy and resource efficiency projects at New Zealand Steel and the Port Kembla Steelworks. Nonsteelmaking emissions intensity is tracking close to target, having decreased 8.8 per cent overall since FY2018.\n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced an accelerated feasibility study to build a new electric arc furnace (EAF) at New Zealand Steel's Glenbrook works. With a target of being operational by 2026, this NZ$300 million project will be co-funded by the New Zealand Government and will reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by at least 45 per cent. The business also continues to support research into hydrogen-based ironmaking processes for New Zealand iron sand, in partnership with the Victoria University, Wellington.\n\nIn Australia, BlueScope made significant progress in its collaboration agreement with Rio Tinto, completing a concept study into DRI Melter technology. We have broadened our review of the most likely decarbonisation project options for ironmaking in Australia, including a focus on the necessary enablers. We have also expanded our technology collaborations with global steelmakers, such as thyssenkrupp, Tata Steel and POSCO.\n\nFurther progress has been made on a range of projects to optimise existing operating assets at Port Kembla. Trials have been completed on the potential use of biochar to replace PCI in the blast furnace, with positive initial results. Other projects underway include a new humidity control process for the blast furnace reducing coke consumption, trialling higher scrap rates and a feasibility study for a new waste gas heat recovery plant.\n\nMultiple projects across non-steelmaking sites are set to deliver gas and electricity use improvements. Projects include the replacement of a gas-fired oven for the paint line at our Western Port facility in Australia and extending the pre-heat section of a metal coating line furnace at the Kapar facility in Malaysia. Solar projects across many sites globally are delivering efficiency in our energy use and emissions reductions.\n\n- 1. Preliminary data. Final emissions intensity figures will be published in BlueScope's FY2023 Sustainability Report, due to be released in September 2023. All GHG emissions data are reported on an equity accounted basis.",

Around 60% of all assessments have been through the EcoVadis process, 72% of which have been low risk, 25% have been medium risk and 3% have been high risk.\n\nIn FY2023, 229 assessments were completed, which included a mix of new supplier assessments, re-assessments and shared assessments. During the year there was significant focus on conducting on-site audits for key suppliers identified as being high risk. Of the twelve on-site audits undertaken during FY2023, five were assessed as being low risk, four as medium risk and three as high risk. The local procurement teams are working with suppliers on improvement opportunities identified through the audits.\n\nThe broader procurement teams continued to focus on increasing responsible sourcing knowledge both internally and externally. In February, an internal global procurement and supply chain learning community was launched with a strong focus on human rights, modern slavery, responsible sourcing, and sustainability upskilling material.\n\nBlueScope's Supplier Code of Conduct was reviewed and updated to align with increased global focus on ESG and our continuous improvement approach. The new Code is being translated into our key supplier languages and will be launched in early FY2024 with an internal and external education campaign.\n\n## Human Rights and Social Impact\n\nThis year as part of our Social Impact due diligence process, a\n\ndesktop review of potential modern slavery issues was completed across our operations. A third-party consultant was then engaged to conduct a Labour and Working Conditions Audit in Malaysia. Through this proactive due diligence process, we identified a number of International Labour Organisation forced labour indicators impacting some of our contract workers in Malaysia, which requires remediation. More information on our progress will be included in the Modern Slavery Statement.\n\n## Inclusion and Diversity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n24%\n\nFemale participation in the BlueScope workforce\n\nThe Social Impact Steering Committee established our social impact due diligence process to identify potential or actual risk, track remedy and business unit actions, and drive a continuous improvement mindset in the context of human rights. Our aim is to ensure problems and concerns are discovered, acknowledged and addressed (being mindful of the safety and welfare of the affected parties), and that we learn from any experiences and take preventative measures by implementing improved practices across the business.\n\nIncreasing awareness of human rights issues is one way BlueScope can deliver positive social impact. In December 2022, we continued the conversation on Human Rights. We celebrated a number of events, including International Day for the Abolition of Slavery, International Day of People with Disability and Human Rights Day. These forums are designed for our employees to understand how these topics impact our work.\n\n## Inclusion and Diversity\n\nWe strive to build a workforce which reflects the diversity of the communities in which we operate. Female representation overall is unchanged at 24 per cent. Female representation on the Executive Leadership team exceeds 50 per cent, with the Board also having 50 per cent female representation, aligned to our 40:40:20 target. While recruitment of women in some of our businesses has been challenging, we remain optimistic that the innovative strategies that have been implemented in recent years are continuing to have a positive effect. Beyond gender strategies continue to emerge across the business units, designed to suit local community needs - such as a focus on ethnicity in the US and First Nations in Australia.\n\nLiving Our Bond and Our Purpose, and continuing to build on the strong foundation of our inclusive culture remains important for FY2024. Our focus areas continue to evolve to reflect our environment and progress, and include the following themes; belonging, equity, capability and continuously improving our data insights.\n\n## Regulatory Proceedings\n\nOn 9 December 2022, the Federal Court found against BlueScope and a former employee in a proceeding initiated by the ACCC alleging contraventions of the Australian competition law cartel provisions. A remedies hearing was held on 12 April 2023. BlueScope is awaiting the outcome of that hearing and no decision has been made about any appeal. An accounting provision of $45M was recognised as at June 2023.",

Underlying results in this report are categorised as non-IFRS financial information provided to assist readers to better understand the financial performance of the underlying operating business. Underlying adjustments included discontinued operations, acquisitions and disposals of businesses, asset impairments/write-backs and restructuring costs. Tables 12, 13 and 14 explain why the Company has disclosed underlying results and provide reconciliations of underlying earnings to reported earnings.\n\n## Revenue\n\nThe 4% decrease in sales revenue from continuing operations was primarily due to lower selling prices driven by lower global steel prices, partially offset by higher despatch volumes and favourable impacts from a weaker Australian dollar exchange rate (A$:US$).\n\n## Earnings Before Interest & Tax\n\nThe 58% decrease in underlying EBIT reflects:\n\n- \u00b7 $1,911.0M spread decrease, primarily due to:\n- - lower domestic and export prices due to lower global steel prices ($2,066.7M)\n- - partially offset by lower raw material costs, primarily due to lower steelmaking raw material costs at North Star and lower steel feed costs at Buildings and Coated Products North America and Coated Products Asia, partially offset by higher steelmaking raw material costs at ASP ($155.7M)\n- \u00b7 $55.1M favourable impact of volume/mix\n- \u00b7 $358.6M unfavourable movement in costs, comprised of:\n- - $46.5M cost improvement initiatives, primarily at ASP, Coated Products Asia and Buildings & Coated Products North America\n- - $145.1M unfavourable volume impact on costs\n- - $226.6M unfavourable impact of general cost escalation, including a non-cash cost of $28M from the revaluation of the Finley Solar Farm Power Purchase Agreement derivative, which compares to a benefit of $56M in FY2022, partially offset by lower remuneration expense linked to financial performance\n- - $33.4M unfavourable movement in other costs\n- \u00b7 $70.2M favourable translation impact from a weaker A$:US$ exchange rate\n- \u00b7 $35.2M unfavourable movement in other items.\n\nThe $2,361.6M (61%) decrease in reported EBIT reflects the movement in underlying EBIT discussed above and $182.0M unfavourable net underlying adjustments as outlined in Tables 13 and 14. The most significant underlying adjustments in FY2023 were impairment of Building Products Malaysia ($50.0M pretax), an estimate of penalty and legal costs associated with the ongoing ACCC civil cartel proceedings against BlueScope ($45.0M) and costs associated with business development and acquisitions ($30.4M), together with net favourable adjustments in the prior period.\n\n## Finance Costs and Funding\n\nNet finance costs decreased by $21.3M largely due to higher interest income on cash and investments due to rising interest rates.\n\nIn November 2022, BlueScope extended and increased its core bilateral loan facilities to $1,310M, from $1,005M, with the support of its group of 10 key banks. In January 2023, a wholly owned subsidiary of BlueScope repaid from cash its US$300M senior unsecured Reg-S notes ahead of their May 2023 maturity. These transactions bring BlueScope the benefit of increased funding tenor and decreased finance costs, while maintaining robust financial liquidity.\n\nFinancial liquidity was $3,317.1M at 30 June 2023 ($3,116.6M at 30 June 2022), comprised of $1,827.3M committed undrawn bank debt capacity and $1,489.8M cash. Liquidity in the NS BlueScope Coated Products JV was $677.9M, which is included in the Group liquidity measure.\n\n## Tax\n\nFY2023 tax expense of $352.0M (FY2022 $806.7M), equivalent to an effective tax rate of 24.6% (FY2022 21.5%), was impacted by the foreign tax rate differential predominantly relating to lower tax rates on profits earned in North America and to a lesser extent, Asia, and an impairment of property, plant and equipment at Building Products Malaysia.",

        "page_content": "The BlueScope Australian consolidated tax group made $162.8M in corporate income tax payments in FY2023, generating franking credits to allow both the interim dividend paid in FY2023 to be fully franked, and franking credits to be attached to the FY2023 final dividend.\n\n## Dividend and Capital Management\n\nBlueScope's capital management policy:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group pursues a returns-focussed process with disciplined competition for capital that balances annual shareholder returns and long term profitable growth.\n- \u00b7 Having regard to the above, the current policy is to distribute at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of consistent dividends and buy-backs.\n- \u00b7 In the short to medium term, BlueScope will retain balance sheet capacity to fund investment for growth and major projects.\n- \u00b7 In the longer term, BlueScope will continue to target around $400M net debt.\n\nDuring FY2023, BlueScope paid an unfranked final ordinary dividend in respect of FY2022 of 25.0 cents per share and a fully franked interim ordinary dividend in respect of 1H FY2023 of 25.0 cents per share.\n\nThe Board of Directors has approved the payment of a final ordinary dividend of 25.0 cents per share, which will be fully franked for Australian tax purposes. As the dividend is fully franked, there is no requirement for it to be declared to be conduit foreign income, and there are no New Zealand imputation credits attached to the final dividend. BlueScope's dividend reinvestment plan will not be active for the final dividend.\n\nRelevant dates for the final dividend are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Ex-dividend share trading commences: 12 September 2023.\n- \u00b7 Record date for dividend: 13 September 2023.\n- \u00b7 Payment of dividend: 17 October 2023.\n\n## Buy-back:\n\n- \u00b7 BlueScope will continue to use on-market share buy-backs to supplement the payment of consistent dividends. Buy-backs are attractive given the flexibility they provide in managing BlueScope's capital and for the EPS enhancement they can deliver.\n- \u00b7 During FY2023, $285M of shares were bought through the buyback program.\n- \u00b7 The Board has approved an increase in the scale and tenor of the buy-back program to allow up to $400M to be bought over the next 12 months. The timing and value of stock purchased will be dependent on the prevailing market conditions, share price and other factors.\n\n## Financial Position\n\nNet assets increased $582.6M to $11,030.7M at 30 June 2023 from $10,448.1M at 30 June 2022. Net assets were higher as a result of foreign exchange translation (approximately $230M) primarily as a result of a weaker A$:US$, along with an increase in net assets in their functional currency. Significant movements in underlying currency were:\n\n- \u00b7 $537M decrease in borrowings and lease liabilities\n- \u00b7 $417M decrease in trade payables, mainly due to lower raw material prices\n- \u00b7 $235M increase in property, plant and equipment, including assets associated with the North Star expansion project\n- \u00b7 $112M decrease in capital payables, mainly at North Star due to the completion of the expansion project\n- \u00b7 Partially offset by a $577M decrease in inventories, where a decrease in rate was partially offset by higher volumes, a $319M decrease in receivables driven by lower steel prices, and a $196M decrease in cash due to net cash flow during the period.",

        "page_content": "## Sales and operations\n\n## Domestic mill sales\n\nFY2023 domestic sales volumes ex-mill decreased 10% on FY2022 to 2,252.4kt. The reduction in domestic despatches were observed predominantly in the more commoditised product range, due to destocking across the distribution channel and supply chain disruptions, including wet weather, rail outages, and labour shortages.\n\n- \u00b7 These disruptions were more pronounced during 1H FY2023 with despatch levels improving across 2H FY2023. The improvement was aided by favourable building weather conditions on the eastern seaboard in the last quarter of the financial year.\n\nTotal annual sales of COLORBOND\u00ae steel were the highest on record for the ASP business, supported by specific sales and marketing initiatives and a robust pipeline of demand.\n\nSales into the residential construction segment declined in FY2023 compared to FY2022. Targeted campaigns continued to focus on consumers, builders, and fabricators and while activity across this segment remains strong, activity levels were challenged by several factors, in particular significant material and labour shortages, wet weather, delayed import arrivals and other supply chain disruptions which all contributed to weaker activity, particularly during 1H FY2023.\n\nDespite these challenges, builders continued to work through the extended pipeline coming out of the Federal Government's 'HomeBuilder' program, covering both new detached dwellings and alterations and additions. Furthermore, some of the supply chain disruptions experienced in 1H FY2023 eased in 2H FY2023, facilitating stronger despatches.\n\nStrength in activity across the alterations and additions segment continued in FY2023, supported by the ongoing trend towards regional living and working and redirected discretionary spend. A resilient labour market and softer than expected house price declines of just over 5% nationally also provided the confidence for households to renovate.\n\nRemuneration Report\n\nSales into non-residential construction declined in FY2023 compared to FY2022 however remained broadly resilient supported by a number of factors.\n\n- \u00b7 A strong approvals pipeline has supported both Commercial and Industrial as well as Social and Institutional activity.\n- \u00b7 The Social and Institutional sub-segment continues to be supported by government investment in major hospital health projects and education, particularly for steel intensive products.\n- \u00b7 The pipeline of projects across the Commercial and Industrial sub-segment continues to support demand, with improving supply chains further strengthening sentiment. Investment in factories and retail segments was stronger, with the latter rebounding post a muted pandemic period of investment.  Demand for new warehousing continued to be buoyed by the shift towards e-commerce.\n\nSales into the engineering and mining sectors were also down during FY2023 compared to FY2022, with activity in these sectors impacted by labour and material shortages across the construction industry in general. Sales continued to be supported by the national infrastructure plan, particularly in roads and rail.\n\nDemand in the agriculture segment was impacted by wet weather, particularly during 1H FY2023. The pullback in FY2023 also follows three years of solid investment in this sector.\n\nDemand in the manufacturing sector also declined in FY2023 compared to the prior year, largely impacted by the lower activity levels across residential construction during the financial year.\n\n## Export sales\n\nDespatches to export customers in FY2023 (950.0kt) were higher than FY2022 (456.9kt), driven by a reduction in domestic sales. Export margins were lower in FY2023 than the prior financial year due to lower global steel prices\n\n## Export coke sales\n\nIn FY2023, despatch volumes were 584.1kt, down 11% on FY2022 due to timing of shipments. Margins were lower in FY2023 on weaker global demand, resulting in lower coke prices relative to coal costs .\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## North America\n\nBlueScope operates five businesses in North America, employing around 4,500 people. BlueScope's North American operations are represented in two reporting segments; North Star and Buildings and Coated Products North America (BCPNA). The North Star reporting segment comprises the North Star BlueScope Steel (North Star) and BlueScope Recycling and Materials (BRM) businesses. The BCPNA segment comprises Buildings North America (BNA), BlueScope Coated Products (BCP) and NS BlueScope Coated Products (Steelscape and ASC Profiles).\n\nEstablished in 1996 in Delta, Ohio, North Star is one of the most efficient steel mills in North America producing high quality hot rolled coil from electric arc furnaces, using scrap metal, pig iron and alloys. North Star is consistently rated as one of the top producers of flat rolled steel in North America in the annual Jacobson Survey of steel customers measuring customer satisfaction. The business's end customer segment mix is broadly comprised of 50% automotive, 35% construction, 10% manufacturing/industrial and 5% agricultural.\n\nBRM is a full-service, ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal recycler, primarily focussed on supplying North Star's scrap requirements. The business operates across three sites in Delta, Ohio (adjacent to North Star), Waterloo, Indiana and Mansfield, Ohio.\n\nServicing the low-rise non-residential construction segment, BNA is a leader in engineered building solutions (EBS), prefabricating the likes of distribution centres, factories and stores. BNA provides an integrated offering of building products and services through its portfolio of brands, including the highly recognised BUTLER\u00ae and VARCO PRUDEN\u2122 engineered building brands. The BNA business also includes the BlueScope Properties Group (BPG), which develops industrial real estate, consisting predominantly of warehouses and distribution centres.\n\nBCP was established via acquisition in June 2022. BCP is the second largest metal painter in the US, with a total capacity of around 900,000 tonnes per annum across seven facilities; five light gauge and two heavy gauge coil painting facilities. The business predominantly serves commercial and industrial construction applications, and is known for its customer service levels, particularly related to flexibility of paint systems on both steel and aluminium substrates.\n\nBlueScope operates the NS BlueScope Coated Products business on the West Coast of the US as part of its 50/50 joint venture with Nippon Steel Corporation (NSC). This includes the Steelscape metal coating and painting business and the ASC Profiles building products business, both of which primarily serve the Western US non-residential construction industry.\n\n## Financial Performance FY2023 vs. FY2022\n\n## Sales revenue\n\nThe $379.1M decrease in sales revenue was due to lower prices at North Star, which declined with benchmarks. This impact was largely offset by stronger despatch volume at North Star, the inclusion of BCP revenue, higher prices at BNA, and the favourable translation impact of a weaker A$:US$.\n\n## EBIT performance\n\nThe $1,294.8M decrease in underlying EBIT was due to:\n\n## Key Financial and Operational Measures\n\n## Table 4: North America performance\n\nTable 5: North Star performance\n\n| $M                    |         | FY2023 FY2022   | Var %        | 2H FY2023    |\n|-----------------------|---------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Sales Revenue         | 7,019.9 | 7,399.0         |              | (5%) 3,509.2 |\n| Reported EBIT         | 930.8   | 2,244.0         | (59%)        | 466.4        |\n| Underlying EBIT       | 964.7   | 2,259.5         | (57%)        | 481.2        |\n| NOA (pre tax)         | 5,443.4 | 5,243.6         |              | 4% 5,443.4   |\n| Underlying  EBIT ROIC | 18.0%   |                 | 57.4% -39.4% | 18.0%        |\n| Despatches            | 3,251.7 | 2,606.8         |              | 25% 1,689.5  |\n\nTable 6: North Star performance in US$M\n\n| $M                    |         | FY2023 FY2022   | Var %   | 2H FY2023     |\n|-----------------------|---------|-----------------|---------|---------------|\n| Sales Revenue         | 3,479.6 | 4,494.5         |         | (23%) 1,846.0 |\n| Reported EBIT         | 433.0   | 1,887.5         | (77%)   | 238.4         |\n| Underlying EBIT       | 443.0   | 1,900.1         | (77%)   | 241.5         |\n| NOA (pre tax)         | 3,561.6 | 3,319.5         |         | 7% 3,561.6    |\n| Underlying  EBIT ROIC | 12.6%   | 66.7% -54.1%    |         | 12.6%         |\n| Despatches            | 2,353.9 | 2,043.0         |         | 15% 1,264.5   |\n\nTable 7: BCPNA performance\n\n| US$M              |         | FY2023 FY2022   | Var %   | 2H FY2023     |\n|-------------------|---------|-----------------|---------|---------------|\n| Sales Revenue     | 2,340.8 | 3,259.6         |         | (28%) 1,244.8 |\n| Underlying EBITDA | 379.6   | 1,446.9         | (74%)   | 206.2         |\n| Underlying EBIT   | 297.3   | 1,380.3         | (78%)   | 161.2         |\n\n| $M                    |         | FY2023 FY2022   | Var %   | 2H FY2023    |\n|-----------------------|---------|-----------------|---------|--------------|\n| Sales Revenue         | 3,640.8 | 2,980.1         |         | 22% 1,737.3  |\n| Reported EBIT         | 503.1   | 348.4           | 44%     | 237.9        |\n| Underlying EBIT       | 527.0   | 351.3           | 50%     | 249.6        |\n| NOA (pre tax)         | 1,891.3 | 1,928.5         |         | (2%) 1,891.3 |\n| Underlying  EBIT ROIC | 27.7%   | 32.5%           | -4.8%   | 27.7%        |\n| Despatches            | 960.1   | 594.8           | 61%     | 469.1        |\n\n- \u00b7 North Star: Delivered an underlying EBIT of $443.0M in FY2023, compared to $1,900.1M in FY2022.

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 BCPNA: Delivered an underlying EBIT of $527.0M in FY2023, compared to $351.3M in FY2022. The increase was mainly due to margin expansion at BNA, which saw significantly higher selling prices. This favourable impact was partially offset by higher costs and lower despatch volumes.\n\nUnderlying adjustments in reported EBIT are set out in tables 13 and 14.\n\n## Return on invested capital\n\nROIC decreased to 18.0% driven by lower EBIT and higher net operating assets. Net operating assets at 30 June 2023 were $199.8M higher than at 30 June 2022, primarily due to the translation impact of a weaker A$:US$.\n\n## Sales and operations\n\n## North Star and BRM\n\nBenchmark Midwest steel prices and spreads softened in early FY2023 following significant declines in 2H FY2022, before rising again in the third quarter of the financial year.\n\nDemand for North Star's product remained solid throughout FY2023 - with North Star dispatching at full capacity. Approximately 250kt was produced from the expansion project during its ongoing ramp up in FY2023, which is progressing well. Full run rate is expected to be achieved in 1H FY2025, representing a slight delay on initial expectations as scheduling and product flows of dual casting are refined. Activity levels in the automotive segment remained stable however US automotive industry sales remain at subdued levels due to ongoing supply chain impacts.\n\nThe integration of BRM continues to progress well, including the process to integrate the third site acquired in August 2022. During FY2023, BRM processed 30% of North Star's scrap volume requirement.\n\nSupply of hot briquetted iron continued in FY2023 under the multi-year contract with Cleveland-Cliffs from their Toledo HBI plant, as part of North Star's diversified metallics supply arrangements.\n\n## Buildings and Coated Products North America\n\n## Buildings North America\n\nEarnings in FY2023 improved significantly compared to FY2022; with margins remaining at expanded levels driven by orders that were priced in a higher steel price environment but were subsequently produced and shipped following the significant softening of steel costs. FY2023 despatches were 9% lower than the prior corresponding period due to timing of shipments.\n\nKey initiatives being progressed to drive improved performance and support future growth potential include:\n\n- \u00b7 a focus on segmentation to better understand, identify, prioritise and organise around the greatest opportunities for growth\n- \u00b7 the design and development of a data platform, to generate efficient, accurate and reliable business intelligence and customer insights\n- \u00b7 foundational technology investment to modernise and provide a holistic digital engineering and customer experience\n- \u00b7 continued investment in engineering and manufacturing capacity to enable business expansion.\n\nRemuneration Report\n\nAt BlueScope Properties Group (BPG), no projects were sold in FY2023. During the year, BPG continued to expand its development pipeline, completing construction of three projects and commencing three more, for realisation in future periods. As noted in its 2H FY2023 guidance in February 2023, BlueScope expected a BPG property sale late in FY2023. Given the changes in the macro-economic environment throughout 2H FY2023, BPG decided to defer the sale until conditions improve. The asset is fully leased and will generate revenue from August 2023.\n\n## BlueScope Coated Products\n\nFY2023 was the first full year of BlueScope Coated Products, which was established via acquisition on 28 June 2022. Significant progress was made in integrating the business over the past year; employee and customer sentiment has been positive and the business progressed longer term growth initiatives such as its single-bill and COLORBOND\u00ae offerings. The BCP business delivered a small contribution to segmental earnings in FY2023.\n\n## NS BlueScope Coated Products (Steelscape & ASC Profiles)\n\nSteelscape (coating and painting) sales volume decreased by 12% in FY2023 compared to FY2022. While underlying demand remained stable, customers reduced their inventory holdings on declining steel prices and project delays due to labour shortages and weather conditions. Various customer-centric strategic initiatives are ongoing, with a focus on the growth of the design solution product and service offering.\n\nASC Profiles (building components) continued to maintain strong margins in its key end use segments, primarily in the decking segment despite softer volumes which were also impacted by customers reducing inventory.",

Collectively, these businesses employ around 3,500 people, and form the Coated Products Asia reporting segment.\n\nBlueScope is a technology leader in metal coated and painted steel building products, with a wide range of branded products that include pre-painted COLORBOND\u00ae steel, zinc/aluminium alloy-coated ZINCALUME\u00ae steel and the LYSAGHT\u00ae range of building products.\n\nBlueScope operates its South East Asian businesses in partnership with Nippon Steel Corporation (NSC) and in India with Tata Steel. Both are 50/50 joint ventures, with BlueScope controlling and therefore consolidating the joint venture with NSC, and jointly controlling and therefore equity accounting the joint venture with Tata Steel.\n\nThe BlueScope China business is wholly owned by BlueScope and is comprised of metal coating, painting and Lysaght operations, and Engineered Buildings Solutions (EBS).\n\n## Financial Performance FY2023 vs. FY2022\n\n## Sales revenue\n\nThe $139.9M decrease in sales revenue was primarily due to lower prices and despatch volumes in South East Asia, partially offset by higher despatch volumes in China.\n\n## EBIT performance\n\nThe $23.8M decrease in underlying EBIT was due to:\n\n- \u00b7 South East Asia: Delivered an underlying EBIT of $38.3M in FY2023, compared to $85.7M in FY2022. This was primarily driven by weaker despatch volumes across the region.\n- \u00b7 China: Delivered an underlying EBIT of $90.8M in FY2023, compared to $63.3M in FY2022. This is a record result, driven by higher margins and despatch volumes.\n- \u00b7 India: The TBSL joint venture delivered an underlying EBIT of $20.5M (50% basis) in FY2023, compared to $29.3M in FY2022, mainly due to weaker margins, partially offset by higher despatch volumes.\n\n## Return on invested capital\n\nROIC decreased to 12.4% driven by lower EBIT, partially offset by lower net operating assets. Net operating assets at 30 June 2023 were $171.9M lower than at 30 June 2022, primarily due to lower inventories, fixed assets and receivables, partially offset by lower payables.\n\n## Sales and operations\n\n## South East Asia\n\nFY2023 sales volumes across the South East Asian business decreased by 16% on FY2022 levels, driven by lower channel demand as customers sought to reduce inventory holdings on declining steel prices.\n\nDespite recovering construction activity, demand in the project segment slowed down as some projects were delayed due to labour shortages and tightened credit control from financiers.\n\n## Key Financial and Operational Measures\n\n## Table 8: CPA performance\n\nChart 2: FY2023 Segment geographic sales revenue, $M 1\n\n| $M                    |         | FY2023 FY2022   | Var %   | 2H FY2023    |\n|-----------------------|---------|-----------------|---------|--------------|\n| Sales Revenue         | 2,630.6 | 2,770.5         |         | (5%) 1,196.9 |\n| Reported EBIT         | 91.7    | 202.9           | (55%)   | 29.7         |\n| Underlying EBIT       | 141.7   | 165.5           | (14%)   | 79.7         |\n| NOA (pre tax)         | 998.4   | 1,170.3         | (15%)   | 998.4        |\n| Underlying  EBIT ROIC | 12.4%   | 14.2%           | -1.8%   | 12.4%        |\n| Despatches            | 1,432.4 | 1,435.2         | (0%)    | 677.9        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.

However, ongoing pandemic-related restrictions impacted the attempts to stimulate the property market and household spending, which remained subdued throughout the remainder of the financial year.\n\nBlueScope China delivered record annual underlying EBIT in FY2023, mainly driven by a 13% increase in despatch volumes compared to FY2022. Notwithstanding broader pandemic impacts to the economy, BlueScope China sales were supported by the continuation of the business's strategy in targeting premium highgrowth segments including automotive, advanced manufacturing, chemicals and electronics. Pre-engineered buildings demand was particularly strong in the growing electric vehicle manufacturing segment.\n\nSales volumes of coated products increased marginally in FY2023 on the prior year, supported by robust demand both from external customers and the Buildings and Components businesses. The ongoing successful promotion of Next Generation ZINCALUME \u00ae steel continues to position the business as a premium supplier of coated steel.\n\n## India (in joint venture with Tata Steel (50/50) for all operations)\n\nDespatch volumes from the Jamshedpur facility of Tata BlueScope for FY2023 were stable on FY2022 levels, with demand supported by ongoing end-use segment demand and the withdrawal of the Government's 15% export duty in November 2022. While volume was stable, margins softened in FY2023 compared to FY2022.\n\nIn April 2023, Tata BlueScope signed a supply agreement with Tata Steel for the supply of coated and painted product from Tata Steel's plants located at Angul and Khopoli, which were part of the former Bhushan Steel group. Supply of seeding tonnes started in May 2022, with 68kt of products supplied from these facilities in FY2023.\n\nThis supply agreement provides an exciting growth opportunity for Tata BlueScopeSteel, which has been operating at full capacity utilisation for the last few years. With a total capacity of 350kt, this additional capacity comes without the capital requirement of new metal coating and paint lines, with volumes supplied under the agreement expected to progressively increase over the coming 36 months.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## New Zealand & Pacific Islands\n\nThe New Zealand & Pacific Islands (NZPI) business comprises the Waikato North Head mine, New Zealand Steel, Pacific Steel and the Pacific Islands businesses.\n\nAs the only steel producer in New Zealand, New Zealand Steel uses locally sourced iron sand to manufacture up to approximately 650,000 tonnes each year of steel slab and billet at the Glenbrook Steelworks, south of Auckland. NZPI produces a range of flat and long steel products for domestic and export use, and supplies all major industries including construction, manufacturing, infrastructure, packaging and agriculture.\n\nNZPI employs around 1,500 people and includes Pacific Steel New Zealand (rolling mill and wire drawing facilities), and the Pacific Islands business, with facilities in Fiji, New Caledonia and Vanuatu which manufacture and distribute the LYSAGHT\u00ae range of products and long steel products through Pacific Steel Fiji.\n\n## Financial Performance FY2023 vs. FY2022\n\n## Sales revenue\n\nThe $162.6M decrease in sales revenue was primarily due to lower domestic despatch volumes, partially offset by higher domestic prices.\n\n## EBIT performance\n\nThe $100.0M decrease in underlying EBIT primarily reflects lower despatch volumes, combined with marginally weaker spreads. Weaker spreads largely resulted from higher thermal coal costs, which more than offset higher domestic prices.\n\n## Return on invested capital\n\nROIC decreased to 18.0% driven by lower EBIT and higher net operating assets. Net operating assets at 30 June 2023 were $289.9M higher than at 30 June 2022, mainly on higher fixed assets, higher inventories, lower provisions and lower payables.\n\n## Sales and operations\n\n## Domestic sales\n\nWhile activity levels remained robust, despatch volumes were lower in FY2023 compared to FY2022, as distribution customers reduced inventories in a falling price environment, and following the arrival of delayed imports. Poor weather early in the financial year also impacted despatches.\n\nDespite the growth trend tapering off throughout the year on rising interest rates, the number of new residential dwelling consents remained at elevated levels during the period but declined in the second half of FY2023, to end the year 9% down from FY2022. In terms of product demand:\n\n- \u00b7 Demand for metal coated and COLORSTEEL\u00ae products declined compared to FY2022 as customer inventory levels rebalanced and significant weather events slowed residential roofing activity. However, FY2023 commercial construction levels remained strong.\n- \u00b7 Demand for AXXIS\u00ae steel for light gauge residential steel framing into new builds remained robust in the first half of FY2023 with a decline in the second half, due to a softening in residential new builds, especially for project home builders.\n\n## Key Financial and Operational Measures\n\n## Table 10: NZPI financial performance\n\nTable 11: NZPI steel sales volume\n\n| $M                    |       | FY2023 FY2022   | Var %   | 2H FY2023   |\n|-----------------------|-------|-----------------|---------|-------------|\n| Sales Revenue         | 962.6 | 1,125.2         | (14%)   | 500.9       |\n| Reported EBIT         | 128.6 | 265.4           | (52%)   | 42.9        |\n| Underlying EBIT       | 128.6 | 228.6           | (44%)   | 42.9        |\n| NOA (pre tax)         | 820.8 | 530.9           | 55%     | 820.8       |\n| Underlying  EBIT ROIC | 18.0% | 54.7% -36.7%    |         | 18.0%       |\n\n| 000 tonnes     |       |   FY2023 FY2022 | Var %   |   2H FY2023 |\n|----------------|-------|-----------------|---------|-------------|\n| Domestic flats | 214.4 |           275   | (22%)   |       106.4 |\n| Domestic longs | 163.4 |           220.7 | (26%)   |        86.1 |\n| Domestic       | 377.8 |           495.7 | (24%)   |       192.5 |\n| Export flats   |  83.4 |            89.7 | (7%)    |        57.3 |\n| Export longs   |  16   |             1.3 | 12.3x   |        10.8 |\n| Export         |  99.4 |            91   | 9%      |        68.1 |\n\n- \u00b7 Demand for heavy plate products remained strong on the back of robust infrastructure demand.\n\nThe dual head coater upgrade on the Glenbrook paint line was commissioned during FY2023, which has increased paint line capacity and flexibility to meet growing domestic demand for premium painted products.\n\nSales of domestic long products in FY2023 decreased 26% on FY2022 levels largely on the back of the weather-related impacts to construction activity early in the financial year. Demand continues to be predominantly driven by the infrastructure sector, underpinned by a mix of 'shovel-ready' projects, and the 'NZ Upgrade' program driven by the New Zealand Government.\n\n## Export sales\n\nExport volumes of flat products in FY2023 were marginally lower (6.3kt) than FY2022, while volumes of export long products were up from 1.3kt in FY2022 to 16.0kt in FY2023, on the back of lower domestic demand.\n\n## Vanadium\n\nSales of Vanadium slag by-products have been an ongoing costoffset for the business for a number of years. The business also buys in both ferro and nitrided vanadium as inputs into the steelmaking process, mainly for rebar strengthening purposes, which has the effect of dampening any price related increase in the vanadium slag contribution. The FY2023 net vanadium contribution was approximately $4.5M lower than FY2022, primarily due to softer global index pricing.",

Lower benchmark spreads are expected to be largely offset by favourable realised pricing 3 . An increasing contribution is expected from expansion volumes as the ramp up continues.\n- - For Buildings and Coated Products North America, expect a result around three quarters of 2H FY2023, with margins easing after a period of particular strength. This includes the sale of a BPG project during the half.\n- \u00b7 Asia:\n- - Expect a slightly better result than 2H FY2023.\n- - China is expected to benefit from favourable seasonality.\n- - South East Asia is expected to deliver a slightly weaker result following a strong 2H FY2023 performance in Thailand.\n- - India is expected to deliver a slightly lower result than 2H FY2023.\n- \u00b7 New Zealand and Pacific Islands:\n- - Expect a similar result to 2H FY2023.\n- - Expect similar domestic volumes.\n- \u00b7 Intersegment, Corporate & Group:\n- - Expect a more favourable performance compared to 2H FY2023 mainly driven by profit in stock benefit.\n- 1. US mini-mill benchmark spreads quoted on a lagged basis in metric tonnes. Expected 1H FY2024 US mini-mill benchmark spread of ~US$415/t, compared to US$465/t in 2H FY2023.\n- 2. Quoted on an unlagged basis for the six-month period; volumes quoted in metric tonnes.\n- 3. Benchmark prices may not be representative of realised mill prices due to a range of factors. Movements in prices across the majority of sales correlate with Midwest regional benchmark pricing, on a short lag; a minority of sales are priced on a longer term basis. Accordingly the degree of correlation between realised and benchmark prices can vary in a given half but is more fully reflected over the medium term.",

The financial report has been prepared in accordance with the Australian Accounting Standards issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board, which are compliant with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). References to 'reported' financial information throughout this report are consistent with IFRS financial information disclosed in the financial report.\n- 2. References to 'underlying' information are to non-IFRS financial information prepared in accordance with ASIC Regulatory Guide 230 (Disclosing non-IFRS financial information) issued in December 2011. Non-IFRS financial information, while not subject to audit or review, has been extracted from the financial report, which has been audited by our external auditors.\n- 3. Performance of operating segments is based on EBIT which excludes the effects of interest and tax. The Company considers this a useful and appropriate segment performance measure because Group financing (including interest expense and interest income) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments.",

These items have been considered in relation to their size and nature, and have been adjusted from the reported information to assist readers to better understand the financial performance of the underlying operating business. Throughout this report the Group has used the term 'reported' to reference IFRS financial information and 'underlying' to reference non-IFRS financial information. These adjustments are assessed on a consistent basis from period to period and include both favourable and unfavourable items. Non-IFRS financial information while not subject to audit or review has been extracted from the financial report which has been audited by BlueScope's external auditors. An explanation of each adjustment and reconciliation to the reported IFRS financial information is provided in the table below.\n\nTable 13: Reconciliation of Underlying Earnings to Reported Earnings\n\n|                                                      | EBITDA $M   | EBITDA $M   | EBIT $M   | EBIT $M   | NPAT $M   | NPAT $M   | EPS $ 1   | EPS $ 1   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|                                                      | FY2023      | FY2022      | FY2023    | FY2022    | FY2023    | FY2022    | FY2023    | FY2022    |\n| Reported Earnings                                    | 2,145.7     | 4,398.3     | 1,487.3   | 3,848.9   | 1,009.2   | 2,810.1   | 2.17      | 5.72      |\n| Underlying adjustments:                              |             |             |           |           |           |           |           |           |\n| Net (gains) / losses from  businesses discontinued 2 | (8.5)       | (3.0)       | (8.5)     | (3.0)     | (5.7)     | (1.9)     | (0.01)    | (0.00)    |\n| Impairment expense / (write-backs) 3                 | 50.0        | (37.3)      | 50.0      | (37.3)    | 25.0      | (11.5)    | 0.05      | (0.02)    |\n| Business development and  acquisition costs 4        | 30.4        | 24.4        | 30.4      | 24.4      | 24.0      | 19.0      | 0.05      | 0.04      |\n| Operating disruptions 5                              | 3.4         | -           | 3.4       | -         | 2.7       | -         | 0.01      | -         |\n| Pension fund adjustment 6                            | -           | (40.6)      | -         | (40.6)    | -         | (30.0)    | -         | (0.06)    |\n| Gain on lease termination 7                          | -           | (5.1)       | -         | (5.1)     | -         | (3.2)     | -         | (0.01)    |\n| Legal provisions 8                                   | 45.0        | -           | 45.0      | -         | 42.0      | -         | 0.09      | -         |\n| Tax asset impairment 9                               | -           | -           | -         | -         | 1.6       | (81.5)    | 0.00      | (0.17)    |\n| Underlying Operational Earnings                      | 2,266.0     | 4,336.7     | 1,607.7   | 3,787.3   | 1,098.8   | 2,701.0   | 2.37      | 5.49      |\n\n- 1.

The FY2023 Earnings Report is incorporated by reference into, and forms part of, this Directors' report.\n\n## Remuneration Report\n\nThe FY2023 Remuneration Report is set out on pages 46-83 of this Annual Report and is incorporated by reference into, and forms part of, this Directors' report.\n\n## Environmental Regulation\n\nIn FY2023, BlueScope notified relevant authorities of forty-three incidents resulting in environmental non-compliance, seventeen of which occurred in Australia, where BlueScope's manufacturing operations are subject to significant environmental reporting obligations. This is numerically high in comparison to recent reporting by BlueScope of non-compliances, however, BlueScope's investigations into several of the non-compliances identified that key causes included factors over which BlueScope has or had little control, such as extreme weather events in Auckland in January and February 2023, reporting from new business acquisitions, and adverse impacts of native wildlife (in the form of e-coli) on water discharge quality. All the reported non-compliances were low severity, with no material environmental or health impacts. The operations continue to treat low level incidents seriously, focusing on opportunities to minimise the likelihood of re-occurrence.\n\nThe NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) issued Australian Steel Products an advisory letter in relation to an incident at the Port Kembla Steelworks relating to a shred steel scrap spill at Berth 113 on 24 November 2022. Australian Steel Products also received a formal warning from the EPA in relation to two separate incidents at the Port Kembla Steelworks. The first incident related to No.5 Blast Furnace granulate bath overflow, and subsequent discharge to No.5 Blast Furnace Drain, on 3 July 2022. The second incident related to a Coke Ovens No.6 Battery raw gas emission, on 27 August 2022.\n\nAustralian Steel Products also received three official cautions from the EPA in relation to incidents at the Port Kembla Steelworks. The first related to a No.5 Blast Furnace thickener overflow, and subsequent discharge to the No.5 Blast Furnace and No.2 Blower Station Drains, on 29 July 2022. The second related to burst pipework resulting in the discharge of clarified water to No.5 Blast Furnace Drain on 11 March 2023. The third related to two Cokemaking air emission incidents on 17 February and 23 March 2023.\n\nNo environment-related penalty infringement notices have been reported across BlueScope's operations.\n\nFurther environmental information will be provided in BlueScope's Sustainability Report due for release in September 2023.\n\n## Indemnification and Insurance of Officers\n\nThe Company has entered into directors' and officers' insurance policies and paid an insurance premium in respect of the insurance policies, to the extent permitted by the Corporations Act 2001 . The insurance policies cover former Directors of the Company along with the current Directors of the Company (listed on page 38).

        "page_content": "## Message from the Board\n\n## Year in Review\n\nThrough FY2023, BlueScope's team of over 16,500 employees continued in their efforts to maintain safe and efficient operations, to deliver for our customers and to support our local communities. While operating under a shifting macroeconomic environment, BlueScope delivered robust performance, reflecting the depth of our capability and the resilience of our diversified business model to deliver our Transform, Grow and Deliver strategy.\n\nOur financial performance across the year was solid, with underlying Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) of $1.61 billion and a return of over $518 million to shareholders in dividends and on-market share buy-backs. This was delivered while retaining a strong balance sheet.\n\nIn the US, our growth strategy is progressing well and in Australia significant investment was announced to bolster future growth. In New Zealand, we continue with the accelerated feasibility study into an electric arc furnace, which is to be co-funded by the New Zealand government. If this project progresses, this will materially reduce New Zealand Steel's emissions by at least 45 per cent.\n\nWe completed the concept study into direct reduced iron (DRI) melter technology with Rio Tinto, and broadened our review of the most likely decarbonisation project options for ironmaking in Australia, including a focus on the necessary enablers. We have also expanded our technology collaborations with global steelmakers, such as thyssenkrupp, Tata Steel and POSCO. Further, we continued to progress a range of initiatives to support key sustainability outcomes.\n\nAbove all else, operating safely is of paramount importance. After evolving our overall approach in recent years, BlueScope has now embraced a people-centred approach to health and safety and has embedded a culture of learning from our people. In FY2023, we continued the strong performance across our lead safety indicators.\n\n## Remuneration Outcomes\n\nThe FY2023 remuneration outcomes reflect our business performance and are aligned to shareholder returns delivered during the year. The Board is satisfied that management has performed well, delivering solid financial outcomes that resulted in a return on invested capital (ROIC) in FY2023 of 14.6 per cent and Free Cash flow of $1.34 billion.\n\nThe lagging injury metric TRIFR was 7.5 per million hours worked in FY2023, above the top end of the long term historical range of 5-7, with the inclusion of recent scrap recycling asset acquisitions.\n\nBlueScope continued to make good progress against our 2030 climate targets in FY2023 through an array of projects. Since we set our targets in FY2018, we have delivered an 8.3 per cent reduction in steelmaking emissions and a 8.8 per cent decrease in non-steel making emissions. 1\n\nWe strive to build a workforce which reflects the diversity of the communities in which we operate. Female representation overall is unchanged at 24 per cent. Female representation on the Executive Leadership team exceeds 50 per cent, with the Board also having 50 per cent female representation, aligned to our 40:40:20 target. Beyond gender strategies are gathering significant pace across the business, designed to suit local community needs - such as a focus on ethnicity in the US.\n\n## Short Term Incentive\n\nThe Short Term Incentive (STI) scorecard is designed so that each objective can be assessed between 0 and 200 per cent, while the total scorecard is capped at 150 per cent of target (equal to 100 per cent of maximum). The collective strength of our performance across the year has been recognised in our STI Scorecard, where the MD&CEO received an outcome of 88.9 per cent of maximum. This equates to 58.7 per cent of fixed pay out of a possible 67 per cent. Other Executive Key Management Personnel (KMP) awards ranged from 31.7 to 50.8 per cent of fixed pay, or 60.4 to 96.7 per cent of the maximum opportunity. More detail on the STI outcomes is available in Section 4.2.\n\nAcross the Company, over 60 per cent of our employees participate in business unit Profit Share Plans. Payouts under these plans in FY2023 also reflect our business performance in a more challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\n## Alignment Rights (Long Term Incentive)\n\nThe Alignment Rights Plan (Long Term Incentive), combined with the minimum shareholding requirements, are designed to align the experience of ELT with that of shareholders through direct share ownership. The Alignment Rights hurdles, which are set at threshold levels, are intended to reduce the impact of external cyclicality on remuneration outcomes and reward consistent, sustainable performance even during extremes in the cycle. In recognition of an increased certainty of vesting, awards are lower in quantum compared to market peers. This approach differs to the traditional long term incentive plans with linear vesting outcomes based on threshold to outperformance and a higher quantum of award.\n\nFor the three-year period to 30 June 2023, management delivered robust ROIC outcomes and maintained a strong balance sheet, consistent with the objectives of our Financial Framework. As a result, both performance conditions of the FY2021 Alignment Rights have been met and awards will vest in full in September 2023.\n\n## Fixed Remuneration\n\nIn September 2022, the Executives received a modest increase in their fixed remuneration following a thorough remuneration benchmarking exercise to test remuneration levels relative to comparative companies and robust assessment of competitive market conditions. The MD&CEO received an approximately 3 per cent increase and the Executive KMP were awarded a 3.5 per cent increase to their fixed pay.",

Our framework is designed to maintain a deliberate and continued focus on financial fundamentals and provide more value to executives at less cost to shareholders.  To achieve this: transformation and growth agenda, despite the economic and operational volatility experienced during the year. The Board is committed to ensuring that BlueScope's remuneration policies and practices reflect the Company's forward-looking strategy and Our Bond, and are consistent with the need to attract and retain the right global talent for the future.\n\nThe Board remains cognisant of the importance of ensuring market competitive fixed remuneration for executive KMP. We monitor and review remuneration annually, with regard to economic indicators, market movements and talent attraction and retention challenges. In recognition of the significant inflationary pressures in our operating markets, the Board has decided to increase the fixed remuneration of the MD&CEO by 3.5 per cent in FY2024. Due to the changing shape of the Board to reflect BlueScope's growth strategy and the increasing amount of travel, particularly to the US, an international travel allowance was introduced to ensure that Board members are remunerated adequately. This reflects the increased difficulty and risk in travel inherent in the post-COVID landscape.

The STI scorecard is\n\n## In summary\n\nOur current approach to remuneration has been in place since FY2018 and has proven successful not only in a cyclical environment but also one facing unprecedented disruption through the COVID-19 era and post pandemic volatility. Our remuneration framework has received strong shareholder support and the Board believes this approach will continue to underpin the long term success of the business. We remain focussed on ensuring that Executive remuneration supports our future strategy, to reflect overall business performance and deliver value to all our stakeholders through the cycle.

How does  the remuneration  framework align to the  Company's strategy?                                                  | The remuneration framework aligns to our investment proposition to deliver returns  through the cycle and supports the delivery of BlueScope's strategy. The STI rewards Executives for: \u00b7 growing the business and delivering ROIC and cash flow targets annually \u00b7 influencing what sustains the business - cost control, debt management and balance  sheet integrity \u00b7 delivery on key non-financial areas critical to business success, such as safety,  ESG measures, strategic projects such as investments in new and emerging                                                                                                                                                                        | Section 5              |\n| 2. Why is fixed pay  market positioning set  high and variable  reward opportunity set  low relative to the  market median? | BlueScope's fixed remuneration is set at or slightly above the median of our market  competitors but is offset by lower variable reward - so total reward is lower than the  market median for comparable organisations. The lower total reward is balanced against  increased certainty of payment, while the significant weighting to equity encourages  optimal management in favour of shareholders through the cycle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Section 3              |\n| 3. Why is there significant  focus on non-financial  measures in the  STI plan?                                             | Under the FY2023 STI plan, financial and non-financial measures are weighted equally,  each carrying a weighting of 50 per cent. The non-financial measures are aligned with  BlueScope's strategy and have a strong focus on long term sustainable success and the  future growth of the Company. The non-financial measures were carefully selected by the  Board after considering feedback received from investors and other stakeholders. The  STI scorecard was rebalanced in FY2022 to reflect the importance of ESG and safety  indicators as a measure of sustainable success. The individual strategic objectives are  aligned with our strategy and heavily focussed on transformation and growth. | Section 5.2            |",

Why is there no linear vesting of Alignment Rights when hurdles are not met?\n\nBlueScope Response\n\nFurther Info\n\nOur Alignment Rights Plan is designed to focus Executives on sustainable growth through\n\nthe cycle, and reward them for generating shareholder returns. The hurdles are set at\n\nthreshold level to reduce the impact of external cyclicality on reward outcomes. It is\n\nexpected that the plan will vest regularly and in recognition of this increased certainty,\n\nawards are lower in quantum relative to the market.\n\nThese awards have a threshold ROIC hurdle of 10 per cent and a net debt to EBITDA\n\nratio hurdle of less than 1.3x averaged over the three-year performance period. When the\n\nthreshold hurdles are met, the rights vest in full. It should be noted that if the business\n\ndelivers above the threshold, Executives do not receive any additional awards.\n\nThe three-year rolling ROIC of 10 per cent was set in relation to the median long term ROIC performance, relative to our remuneration peers, major steel companies and the ASX100, and with reference to broadly achieving our cost of capital. This peer information is used to ensure we set a challenging threshold, not to assess actual performance outcomes.\n\nThe table below shows the second quartile ROIC performance for each of these comparator groups, for the three-year periods, from FY16-FY18 to FY20-FY22.\n\nIndustry Comparison - 2nd Quartile three-year ROIC Performance\n\n|                       | FY16-FY18   | FY17-FY19   | FY18-FY20   | FY19-FY21   | FY20-FY22   |\n|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Bluescope             | 16%         | 19%         | 16%         | 17%         | 25%         |\n| ASX100 1              | 13%         | 13%         | 12%         | 11%         | 12%         |\n| Remuneration Peers    | 14%         | 13%         | 12%         | 10%         | 10%         |\n| Major Steel Companies | 8%          | 12%         | 9%          | 9%          | 13%         |\n\n- 1.

Board discretion may be applied to the reward outcomes where warranted.\n\nSection 3,\n\nSection 5.3\n\nSection 5.3",

This role was critical to the delivery of the North Star expansion, and therefore P Finan  participated in an annual Project Incentive plan in addition to the STI plan. The Project  Incentive reflected both the criticality of the project to BlueScope and remuneration  practices in the competitive US market.

At the end of the performance period a number of  share rights may lapse, depending on the actual STI outcome assessed. This allows Executives the opportunity to boost their shareholding in the Company,  further aligning their interests with those of shareholders.

The Group has performed well against a wide range of of business objectives and delivered a robust result in FY2023, demonstrating the resilience of its diversified business model.\n\nUnderlying EBIT for the financial year was robust at $1.61 billion, albeit coming off a record previous year. The continued strong EBIT performance demonstrates the resilience of the business model, particularly in the context of volatile macroeconomic and industry cycles. Operating cash flow, after capital expenditure, was $1.34 billion and the balance sheet remains strong with $703 million net cash. During the year, BlueScope delivered $518 million in shareholder returns through dividends and onmarket share buy-backs. For FY2023, the Board approved a fully franked final dividend of 25.0 cents per share, and an increase to the share buy-back program, to allow up to $400 million to be bought over the next 12 months.\n\nThe lagging injury metric TRIFR was 7.5 per million hours worked in FY2023, above the top end of the long term historical range of 5-7, with the inclusion of recent scrap recycling asset acquisitions. After a period of evolution, BlueScope has embedded its people-centred approach to safety and a culture of learning from our people. In FY2023, the Company continued its strong performance across lead indicators, including businessled learning programs and team-based risk control improvement projects, with 249 projects completed against a plan of 250.\n\nBlueScope continued to make progress against its 2030 climate targets through the financial year through an array of projects. Steelmaking emissions intensity is tracking ahead of target with a total 8.3 per cent reduction 1 since FY2018, with a particularly\n\n## FY2023 Performance\n\n## Underlying EBIT ROIC 14.6%\n\nDown from 41.6% in FY2022\n\n## Free Cash Flow\n\n$1.34Bn\n\nDown $366M on FY2022\n\nThree-year average ROIC\n\n27.0%\n\nFY2021, FY2022, FY2023\n\nstrong performance in FY2023 driven by the ramp up of the North Star expansion and energy and resource efficiency projects at New Zealand Steel and the Port Kembla Steelworks. Nonsteelmaking emissions intensity is tracking close to target, having decreased 8.8 per cent 1 overall since FY2018.\n\nWe strive to build a workforce which reflects the diversity of the communities in which we operate. Female representation overall is unchanged at 24 per cent. Female representation on the Executive Leadership team exceeds 50 per cent, with the Board also having 50 per cent female representation, aligned to our 40:40:20 target. Beyond gender strategies are gathering significant pace across the business, designed to suit local community needs - such as a focus on ethnicity in the US.\n\nThe Company also announced that the Board has approved the $1.15 billion comprehensive reline and upgrade of the No.6 Blast Furnace (6BF) at the Port Kembla Steelworks, which secures our immediate future while enabling a transition to lower emissions steelmaking as soon as it is commercially available. In this sense the reline project is our bridge to the future and critical to maintaining the sovereign capability of flat steelmaking in Australia. The relined 6BF is expected to be commissioned in mid to late 2026.\n\nSignificant strides have been taken under BlueScope's strategy, most notably in the US, with two strategic acquisitions and the expansion of the Company's best-in-class North Star minimill completed in the last two years. In Australia, work has commenced on a new metal coating line in Western Sydney to meet future demand for BlueScope's value-added products - the demand for which continues to grow, evidenced by a record level of COLORBOND \u00ae steel sales in FY2023.\n\n## Safety\n\n7.5 TRIFR (302 injuries) 1,657 leaders involved in HSE workshops (plus 1,541 employees involved in business-led workshops) 249 team based risk control projects completed\n\n## Sustainability\n\n\u2714 8.3% reduction in steelmaking GHG emissions intensity \u2714 Accelerated feasibility study into an EAF at NZ Steel \u2714 24% female workforce participation \u2714 229 supplier assessments completed\n\n## Strategy Execution\n\n\u2714 Progressed ramp up of North Star expansion \u2714 Continued integration of BRM & BCP businesses \u2714 Approved new metal coating line in Western Sydney \u2714 6BF reline and upgrade project on track\n\n1.",

The targets vary each year based on the prevailing market conditions. Alignment Rights have vested in each year since FY2020, aligning Executive reward with shareholder interests through equity ownership, and reflect sustainable multi-year performance even when taking into account the variability in market conditions between years.\n\n|                                                | FY2019              | FY2020              | FY2021              | FY2022              | FY2023              |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Underlying NPAT ($M)                           | 966                 | 353                 | 1,166               | 2,701               | 1,099               |\n| Underlying EBIT ($M)                           | 1,348               | 564                 | 1,724               | 3,787               | 1,608               |\n| Share price at beginning of period ($)         | 17.26               | 12.25               | 11.67               | 22.24               | 15.80               |\n| Share price at end of period ($)               | 12.05               | 11.69               | 21.96               | 15.90               | 20.55               |\n| Dividends per ordinary share (cents)           | 14                  | 14                  | 50                  | 50                  | 50                  |\n| Buy-backs ($M) 1                               | 510                 | 229                 | 0                   | 638                 | 285                 |\n| Reported earnings per share (cents)            | 189.9               | 19.0                | 237.0               | 549.4               | 217.4               |\n| Underlying EBIT ROIC                           | 19.5%               | 7.6%                | 24.8%               | 41.6%               | 14.6%               |\n| Annual total shareholder return 2              | (30%)               | (2%)                | 89%                 | (25%)               | 33%                 |\n| MD&CEO STI award  (% of maximum) 3             | 80%                 | 75%                 | 97.6%               | 82%                 | 88.9%               |\n| 3-year average annual ROIC                     | 19.3% (FY17 - FY19) | 15.7% (FY18 - FY20) | 17.3% (FY19 - FY21) | 24.7% (FY20 - FY22) | 27.0% (FY21 - FY23) |\n| 3-year total shareholder return 2              | 94% (FY17 - FY19)   | (9%) (FY18 - FY20)  | 31% (FY19 - FY21)   | 39% (FY20 - FY22)   | 90% (FY21 - FY23)   |\n| Alignment Rights Vesting  (performance period) | N/A                 | \u2714 (FY18 - FY20)     | \u2714 (FY19 - FY21)     | \u2714 (FY20 - FY22)     | \u2714 (FY21 - FY23)     |\n\n- 3. The current remuneration framework was introduced in FY2018, with the first award under the STI in FY2018 and the first performance test of Alignment Rights following the end of FY2020.\n\n## 4.2  FY2023 Short Term Incentive Outcomes\n\nIn assessing performance, the Board considers both what has been achieved and how it was achieved. Each Executive's behaviour is considered against the expectations outlined in Our Bond, which are the guiding principles for our conduct and how we work. The actual STI awarded can be adjusted where these expectations are deemed not to have been met.\n\nThe Board also considers the application of discretion against pre-determined principles that are outlined in Section 7.4. These include consideration of the shareholder experience, the broader employee experience and the impact of factors both within and outside of management's control. In FY2023, the Board applied their discretion to reduce the maximum award from 150 per cent to 145 per cent, to reflect below threshold performance on TRIFR.\n\nIn FY2023, management responded well to external conditions and demonstrated strong leadership to deliver significant value.  Key outcomes for the year were:\n\n- \u00b7 Total shareholder return of 33.0 per cent in FY2023\n- \u00b7 Full-year result of $1.61 billion underlying EBIT and ROIC of 14.6 per cent\n- \u00b7 Operating cash flow for the year, after capital expenditure (excluding the North Star expansion), was $1.43 billion\n- \u00b7 Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) of 7.5 exceeded STI threshold of 7\n- \u00b7 For FY2023, we identified 250 team-based risk control improvement projects, and completed 249\n- \u00b7 1,657 leaders have now participated in our expert-led training program since 2020, with a further 1,541 employees in business-led HSE learning workshops in FY2023\n- \u00b7 Steelmaking GHG emissions intensity tracking ahead of target with a total 8.3 per cent reduction since FY2018\n- \u00b7 Maintained total female participation at 24%, female representation on ELT now at 55%\n\nThe Board assessed the outcomes in light of business performance and the broader experience of our shareholders, customers and employees, and is satisfied that management has delivered significant value in FY2023.\n\nMore details on the MD&CEO's performance against the STI objectives is provided in the STI scorecard shown below, including a description of each performance measure and the MD&CEO's level of achievement, as determined by the Board.",

        "page_content": "## 5. Executive Remuneration Framework\n\nBlueScope's remuneration framework is guided by the principles outlined in Section 3. The principles extend to all elements of remuneration as described in detail below.\n\n## 5.1 Fixed Pay\n\nFixed pay recognises the market value of an individual's skills, experience, accountability and their expected sustained contribution in delivering the requirements of their role. To attract and retain experienced and capable leaders, fixed pay at BlueScope needs to be competitive, and is set at slightly above the median of the peer group noted below. A separate peer group is used as an additional reference point for US-based Executive KMP. Fixed pay includes base pay and superannuation or local retirement plans.\n\n## Remuneration peer group\n\nThe ROC has selected (and reviews annually) a peer group of companies for the purposes of benchmarking both fixed and variable remuneration. The peer group reflects the size and complexity of BlueScope with similarities on one or more of the following dimensions:\n\n- \u00b7 Operate in multiple geographies\n- \u00b7 Have manufacturing or logistics operations in Australia\n- \u00b7 Are involved in the building and construction industry\n- \u00b7 Have similar number of employees\n- \u00b7 Have similar revenue, or similar market capitalisation on the ASX.\n\nThe peer group is not solely based on market capitalisation, as the ROC believes that this would lead to unmanageable fluctuations in Executive remuneration, and could result in an inability to attract and retain the skills required to manage a business operating in the complex and volatile environment in which BlueScope operates globally.\n\nThe peer group for FY2023 is broadly consistent with last year and is listed below:\n\n- \u00b7 Adbri Ltd\n- \u00b7 AGL Energy Ltd\n- \u00b7 ALS Ltd\n- \u00b7 Ampol Ltd\n- \u00b7 Aurizon Holdings Ltd\n- \u00b7 Boral Ltd\n- \u00b7 Brambles Ltd\n- \u00b7 CSR Ltd\n- \u00b7 Downer EDI Ltd\n- \u00b7 Fletcher Building Ltd\n- \u00b7 Incitec Pivot Ltd\n- \u00b7 Lendlease Group\n- \u00b7 Orica Ltd\n- \u00b7 Origin Energy Ltd\n- \u00b7 Orora Ltd\n\nIn addition to the peer group noted above, remuneration for Executive KMP is also benchmarked against local peers in international markets, where this is appropriate for the role and the incumbent. This ensures that BlueScope is able to attract and retain local talent in regions outside Australia, particularly where pay practices are quite different, such as in the US.\n\nAs disclosed in the FY2022 remuneration report, a US-based peer group of steel and material companies was selected to benchmark both fixed and variable remuneration in the US.\n\nThe US peer group for FY2023 is listed below:\n\n- \u00b7 Allegheny Technologies Corporation\n- \u00b7 Alpha Metallurgical Resources Inc.\n- \u00b7 Carpenter Technology Corporation\n- \u00b7 Century Aluminum Company\n- \u00b7 Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.\n- \u00b7 Compass Minerals International, Inc.\n- \u00b7 Kaiser Aluminum Corporation\n- \u00b7 Materion Corporation\n- \u00b7 Noranda Aluminum Holding Corporation\n- \u00b7 Nucor Corporation\n- \u00b7 Olympic Steel, Inc.\n- \u00b7 Ryerson Holding Corporation\n- \u00b7 Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc.\n- \u00b7 Steel Dynamics, Inc.\n- \u00b7 SunCoke Energy, Inc.\n- \u00b7 Worthington Industries, Inc.\n- \u00b7 Qantas Airways Ltd\n- \u00b7 Qube Holdings\n- \u00b7 South32 Ltd\n- \u00b7 Worley Ltd",

Maximum Alignment  Rights levels (as a percentage of fixed pay) are shown below.                                            |\n|                        | % of fixed pay Maximum                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|                        | MD&CEO 100%                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|                        | Other Executive KMP 65%                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Allocation Value       | The allocation of share rights is based on face value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|                        | The quantum of Alignment Rights awards is calculated based on the percentage of fixed pay divided by  the face value of shares using the volume weighted average price (VWAP) over the three-month period to  31 August at the beginning of the performance period. No amount is payable by participants on exercise. |\n|                        | The Alignment Rights are specifically designed for the cyclicality of our sector, market and share price  volatility. The allocation methodology, using a three-month VWAP, smooths out much of the share  price variation.                                                                                           |\n| Instrument             | Each Alignment Right vests into one fully paid ordinary share in the Company subject to time and  performance conditions being met.

The vesting conditions are:                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|                        | \u00b7 As a 'gateway' condition, to be eligible for any vesting, an Executive must conduct themselves in  accordance with Our Bond. An assessment for each Executive against this criterion is completed by  the Board each year                                                                                           |\n|                        | \u00b7 Minimum 10 per cent rolling three-year average underlying ROIC, which is set at a level representative  of long term median performance across BlueScope's peer groups and which broadly achieves the  Company's risk-adjusted cost of capital.

If they  are not achieved, then no Rights will vest. Board discretion continues to apply to protect against  unintended outcomes.                                                                                        |\n|                        | Alignment Rights are not eligible for re-testing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Target setting         | Targets for the Alignment Rights have been deliberately set at a threshold level of performance  expectations to deliver vesting to participants and alignment with shareholders through the  performance cycle.                                                                                                      |\n|                        | While the Board, on recommendation from the ROC, considers and approves the targets at the  commencement of the performance period, they are not expected to fluctuate from year to year.                                                                                                                             |\n| Performance assessment | The Board, on recommendation from the ROC, assesses the performance outcomes after the end of the  performance period.                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|                        | Performance against the financial measures includes verification of financial results by the Audit Committee.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|                        | Each participant is subject to an individual assessment of their conduct against Our Bond, which is  undertaken by the MD&CEO for the ELT (including KMP), and by the Board in respect of the MD&CEO.                                                                                                                 |",

The Board therefore monitors and reviews remuneration annually, with regard to economic indicators, market movements and talent attraction and retention challenges. In recognition of the significant inflationary pressures in our operating markets, the Board has decided to increase the fixed remuneration of the MD&CEO by 3.5 per cent in FY2024\n\n## 5.5  Executive Service Agreements\n\nThe following table outlines the summary terms of employment for the MD&CEO and other Executive KMP.\n\n| Role                | Term of agreement   | Notice period  by Executive   | Maximum notice period  by Company   | Termination benefits   |\n|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| MD&CEO              | Open                | 12 months                     | 12 months                           | 12 months fixed pay    |\n| Other Executive KMP | Open                | 6 months                      | 6 months                            | 12 months fixed pay    |\n\nAgreements are also in place for Executive KMP detailing the approach the Group will take with respect to termination payments and with respect to exercising its discretion on the vesting of Alignment Rights in the event of a 'Change of Control' of the organisation.\n\nExecutive KMP are also subject to restraints which will apply upon cessation of employment to protect the business interests of BlueScope. No separate amount is payable in relation to these restraints over and above the contractual entitlements outlined above.\n\nThe maximum payment on termination (including notice) is capped at 12 months fixed pay for these Executives.",

        "page_content": "## 5.7 FY2023 Realised Pay\n\nThe following table outlines actual pay earned or realised by Executive KMP during FY2023. This is a voluntary disclosure and is provided as additional information to the statutory remuneration table contained in Section 5.6. This table is different from the amounts shown in the statutory table, as it excludes accruals and estimations and is therefore a closer measure of 'take home pay' earned by Executives in respect of the current year. Amounts are presented inclusive of any income tax that is payable.\n\nRealised pay includes the base salary, superannuation/retirement and other benefits paid or payable in relation to FY2023. It also includes the realised value of STI awards earned in relation to the FY2023 performance year (both cash and equity components), and the realised value of LTI awards with a performance period ending on 30 June 2023.\n\nThe realised value of equity awards is calculated as the difference between the allocation price, or price on grant, and the closing share price at the end of the performance period. This is different from the valuation of equity awards presented in the statutory table which uses the accounting standard for expensing equity awards over time.\n\nOther benefits includes Executive health checks, fringe benefits tax, benefits provided under the Company's relocation policy and spouse flights. Tax equalisation payments that include the difference between the amounts withheld by the Company and the actual tax paid on behalf of international assignees, are not included in the calculation of realised pay, however are included in the statutory table.\n\n| Name                    | Year                    | Fixed  Remuneration 1 $   | Other  Benefits 2 $     | STI (Cash) 3 $          | STI  (equity) 4 $       | LTI (value  at grant) 5 $                 | Total $                 | Share  price  change  (STI) 6 $   | Share  price  change  (LTI) 6 $   | Total  including  share  price  change $   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| M Vassella              |                         | 2023 1,936,038            | 100,799                 |                         |                         | -

Fixed Remuneration is salary inclusive of superannuation and allowances.\n- 2. Other benefits includes Executive health checks, fringe benefits tax, benefits provided under the Company's relocation policy and spouse flights.\n- 3. STI (cash) is the amount relating to performance in the FY2023 financial year which will be paid in cash in September. For P Finan, this amount includes a Project Incentive for the period 1 January - 30 December 2022 that was paid during FY2023.\n- 4. STI (equity) is the amount relating to performance in FY2023 which the Executive elected to take as equity (share price at grant of $16.4715 based on 3 month VWAP to 31 August 2022).\n- 5. The FY2021 LTI award will vest in September, the value at allocation was $11.8609 per share (3 month VWAP to 31 August 2020).\n- 6. Share price change is equal to the number of rights vested multiplied by the difference in the allocation price and the closing price at the end of the performance period (30 June 2023).\n- 7. K Keast commenced as KMP effective 1 February 2023.\n- 8. P Finan and J Nowlan ceased being KMP effective 31 January 2023.\n\nA portion of the value realised by Executives from STI equity and LTI is due to changes in the share price from the time of grant to vesting. In this way, reward for the Executives is automatically aligned with the outcomes for shareholders over the performance period.\n\nBlueScope's share price growth over the vesting periods for the FY2021 LTI and FY2023 STI resulted in an increase in value for these awards since grant. The charts below indicate the portion of the vested value attributed to the growth in share price.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|    | glyph<c=4,font=/DMEMRQ+MaisonNeue-Medium>\u00f5\u00e2\u00d9\u00fd\u00fc\u00c8\u00fd\u0125glyph<c=3,font=/DMEMRQ+MaisonNeue-Medium>n\u00e2\u00d9\u00de\u0125\u011c 2\u0118\u00aa\u00fd\u0125glyph<c=3,font=/DMEMRQ+MaisonNeue-Medium>\u0115\u0118\u00e2\u00bd\u00c8 \u021a\u0188\u0188\u01e2\u018f\u018d   | rzW 2\u0118\u00aa\u00fd\u0125glyph<c=3,font=/DMEMRQ+MaisonNeue-Medium>\u0115\u0118\u00e2\u00bd\u00c8 \u021a\u0188\u018d\u01e2\u018b\u018e   | k\u0118\u00e2\u00bd\u00c8glyph<c=3,font=/DMEMRQ+MaisonNeue-Medium>\u00aa\u0125glyph<c=3,font=/DMEMRQ+MaisonNeue-Medium> \u018a\u0187glyph<c=3,font=/DMEMRQ+MaisonNeue-Medium>c\u012b\u00fd\u00c8glyph<c=3,font=/DMEMRQ+MaisonNeue-Medium>\u0189\u0187\u0189\u018a \u021a\u0189\u0187\u01e2\u018c\u018c   |\n|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| M\u009e\u0189\u0187\u0189\u0188glyph<c=3,font=/DMEMRQ+MaisonNeue-Bold> \u00f5\u00e2\u00d9\u00fd\u00fc\u00c8\u00fd\u0125glyph<c=3,font=/DMEMRQ+MaisonNeue-Bold>n\u00e2\u00d9\u00de\u0125\u011c    |                                                                                                                                                               | \u018b\u0189\u0245glyph<c=3,font=/DMEMRQ+MaisonNeue-Bold>\u00d9\u00aa\u00e2\u00fd                   | \u018b\u0189\u0245glyph<c=3,font=/DMEMRQ+MaisonNeue-Bold>\u00d9\u00aa\u00e2\u00fd                                                                                                                                                  |\n| M\u009e\u0189\u0187\u0189\u018aglyph<c=3,font=/DMEMRQ+MaisonNeue-Bold>rzWglyph<c=3,font=/DMEMRQ+MaisonNeue-Bold>\u01ee\u00c8\u0117\u012b\u00e2\u0125\u0143\u01ef    |                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                  | \u0189\u0187\u0245glyph<c=3,font=/DMEMRQ+MaisonNeue-Bold>\u00d9\u00aa\u00e2\u00fd                                                                                                                                                  |",

Non-Executive Director Fees\n\n## 6.1 Policy and approach\n\n## Board and Committee Fees\n\nThere was no increase in the fees payable to Non-Executive Directors during FY2023.\n\nNon-Executive Directors receive a base fee in relation to their service as a Director of the Board, and an additional fee for membership of, or for chairing a Committee. The Chairman, considering the greater time commitment required, receives a higher fee but does not receive any additional payment for service on Committees.\n\n## Non-Executive Director Fee Sacrifice Plan\n\nNon-Executive Directors can participate in a fee sacrifice plan, which enables them to build meaningful levels of equity over time. The plan provides an automated mechanism for participants to acquire shares, recognising that Non-Executive Directors may be limited in their ability to purchase shares because of Australian insider trading laws. From 1 July 2022, the plan was extended to allow US-resident Directors to participate and ensure it operates effectively in the US tax environment. Details of the plan are shown in the table below.\n\n| Role                              | Role                   | Base Fees (incl super)   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Chairman 1                        | Chairman 1             | $521,725                 |\n| Non-Executive Director            | Non-Executive Director | $183,370                 |\n| Audit Committee                   | Chair                  | $41,000                  |\n|                                   | Member                 | $21,000                  |\n| Remuneration and                  | Chair                  | $41,000                  |\n| Organisation Committee            | Member                 | $21,000                  |\n| Health, Safety and                | Chair                  | $41,000                  |\n| Environment Committee             | Member                 | $21,000                  |\n| Risk and Sustainability Committee | Chair                  | $41,000                  |\n|                                   | Member                 | $21,000                  |\n\n- 1.

The interaction with the Board, other Committees, management, and other stakeholders is shown in the diagram below.\n\n## Consultation with shareholders and other stakeholders\n\n- \u00b7 Management may seek its own independent advice with respect to information and recommendations relevant to remuneration\n\n## Management\n\n- \u00b7 Provides information relevant to remuneration decisions and makes recommendations to the ROC\n- \u00b7 Obtains remuneration information from external advisors to assist the ROC (i.e. market data, legal, tax and accounting advice)\n\n## Board\n\n## The Board is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 approving BlueScope's remuneration strategy\n- \u00b7 determining the quantum of remuneration for Nonexecutive Directors and MD&CEO\n\nThe Board has overarching discretion with respect to any awards made under the Company's incentive plans\n\n## Remuneration and Organisation Committee (ROC)\n\nThe ROC is delegated responsibility by the Board to review and, where relevant, make recommendations on:\n\n- \u00b7 the People and Remuneration strategy\n- \u00b7 monitoring and measuring culture\n- \u00b7 remuneration policies and framework for the Company's Directors and Executives\n- \u00b7 ELT succession planning and talent development\n- \u00b7 ELT terms of appointment\n- \u00b7 performance and remuneration outcomes for the ELT\n- \u00b7 Inclusion and diversity principles and objectives\n- \u00b7 Social impact priority areas and plans\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee supports the ROC by:\n\n- \u00b7 reviewing earnings figures which form the basis for variable pay awards\n\n## Risk & Sustainability Committee\n\nThe Risk & Sustainability Committee supports the ROC by:\n\n- \u00b7 providing advice relating to material risk issues, behaviours and/or compliance breaches that may affect deliberations\n\n## Remuneration consultants and other external advisors\n\n- \u00b7 Provide independent advice, information and recommendations relevant to remuneration decisions\n- \u00b7 Any advice provided by external advisors is used to assist the Board - it is not a substitute for the Board and ROC procedures\n- \u00b7 No remuneration recommendations as defined in section 9B of the Corporations Act 2001 were provided in FY2023",

Such consultants report directly to the ROC. Potential conflicts of interest are considered in selecting remuneration consultants and their terms of engagement regulate their level of access to, and require independence from, BlueScope's management. In addition, the ROC requires that advisors on KMP remuneration not independently receive fees from management for work not approved by the Committee.\n\nAny advice from external consultants is used as a guide and is not a substitute for thorough consideration of all the issues by the ROC. The Chairman of the Board does not participate in any discussions relating to the determination of his own fees.\n\nDuring FY2023, the ROC employed the services of independent remuneration advisors to provide information and advice on remuneration strategy and structure including market practice which covers Executive KMP. No remuneration recommendations as defined in section 9B of the Corporations Act 2001 were provided.\n\n## 7.4  Board discretion\n\nThe ROC and the Board consider it critical to be able to exercise appropriate discretion to ensure that remuneration outcomes for Executives appropriately reflect the performance of the Group and individuals and meet shareholders' expectations. Some of the ways this discretion can be exercised are outlined below.\n\n| Element                   | Terms                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Variable reward  outcomes | The Board retains the discretion to limit, defer or cancel any STI or LTI awards in exceptional circumstances,  including determining that a reduced award or even no award should be paid/vest.

Misconduct includes  misrepresentation or material misstatements due to errors, omissions or negligence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Clawback           | The Board has discretion in certain circumstances to claw back Alignment Rights awards, resulting shares or the  financial benefit of those shares. These circumstances include fraud or gross misconduct, breach of law, material  breach of policies or standards, bringing BlueScope into disrepute, material misstatement in financial statements,  certain oversight failures or any other circumstances where there would be an inappropriate benefit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Change of  control | The Board may permit Share Rights or Alignment Rights to vest if, at any time while there are Share Rights or  Alignment Rights which have not lapsed or vested, a takeover bid is made to acquire the whole of the issued  ordinary share capital of the Company or a transaction is announced by the Company which, if implemented, would  result in a person owning all of the issued shares in the Company. The Company must permit the Share Rights and  Alignment Rights to vest if a person acquires more than 50 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company  provided that the Board determines that the performance hurdles have been satisfied as assessed at that time  having regard to the shorter performance period. |\n\n## 7.5  Securities Trading Policy\n\nThe Company's Securities Trading Policy prohibits employees from dealing in the Company's securities while in possession of material non-public information relevant to the entity. It also prohibits entry into transactions in associated products that limit the economic risk of participating in unvested entitlements under equity-based remuneration schemes. In addition, nominated employees, including KMP, are prohibited from dealing in the Company's securities outside prescribed trading periods.\n\n## 7.6  Minimum shareholding requirements\n\nA key principle of the remuneration framework is to encourage Executives to behave like owners. The Board believes that the interests of all KMP should be closely aligned to those of shareholders through significant exposure to the Company's share price and dividends. Accordingly, the minimum shareholding requirements, as outlined in this table, are in place.\n\n|                                           | Minimum Shareholding Requirement   |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Non-Executive Directors                   | 100% of base fees                  |\n| MD&CEO                                    | 200% of fixed pay                  |\n| Executive Leadership Team (including KMP) | 100% of fixed pay                  |\n\nThe minimum shareholding requirement includes the aggregate value of current shareholdings and 50 per cent of vested, but unexercised share right awards for Executive KMP. For Australian Non-Executive Directors, it includes the aggregate value of current shareholdings. For US-based Directors, the requirement includes the aggregate value of current shareholdings and vested rights held under the Non-Executive Director fee sacrifice plan.\n\nMembers of the ELT, including Executive KMP, are expected to build their shareholding progressively over a reasonable period. The ROC regularly monitors the shareholding of the ELT. The Alignment Rights plan is an important mechanism to drive Executive share ownership through the regular vesting of rights on the achievement of the threshold performance hurdles. As at 30 June 2023, most Executive KMP hold shares greater than their minimum shareholding requirement, and those who do not are new to the KMP role and are on track to achieving this requirement.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\n## About this report\n\nThis section provides information about the basis upon which the Group's financial statements are prepared. It includes an overview of the reporting entity, a summary of certain accounting policies that are not disclosed elsewhere, and highlights the key accounting judgements and estimates applied by management and where that information is disclosed in this report.\n\n## Reporting entity\n\nBlueScope Steel Limited is a for-profit company incorporated and domiciled in Australia and limited by shares publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange. The registered office of the Company is Level 24, 181 William Street, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia 3000. The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Group are described in note 1.1 and the Directors' Report.\n\nThe financial report of BlueScope Steel Limited for the year ended 30 June 2023 was authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 21 August 2023.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial report is a general purpose financial report, which:\n\n- \u00b7 Has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 , Australian Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n- \u00b7 Has been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain derivative financial instruments and other investments which are measured at fair value.\n- \u00b7 Is presented in Australian dollars rounded to the nearest hundred thousand dollars, unless otherwise stated, in accordance with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191.\n- \u00b7 Presents reclassified comparative information where required for consistency with the current year's presentation.\n- \u00b7 Adopts all new and amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the AASB that are relevant to the Group and effective for reporting periods beginning on or before 1 July 2022.\n- \u00b7 Does not early adopt any Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have been issued or amended but are not yet effective.\n- \u00b7 Has been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting as, at the time of approving the financial statements, the Directors' have reasonable grounds to believe that the Company will be able to pay its debts as and when they become due and payable.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of BlueScope Steel Limited ('the Company' or 'parent entity') and its controlled entities (together 'the Group'). Details of controlled entities (subsidiaries) of the Company are contained in note 23.\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are consolidated in the Group financial statements from the date that the Group obtains control until the date that control ceases. The subsidiary financial statements are prepared using consistent accounting policies and for the same reporting period as the parent company.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in full.\n\n## Foreign currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements of entities within the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity generates and expends cash ('the functional currency'). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is BlueScope Steel Limited's functional and presentation currency.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate as at the date of the initial transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from translation are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow or net investment hedges, or where those gains or losses are attributable to part of the net investment in a foreign operation.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\nOn consolidation at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of entities within the Group that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency, are translated into Australian dollars at the rate of exchange at the reporting date and the income statements are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. Exchange differences arising from the translation are recognised in other comprehensive income and in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity.\n\n## Goods and services tax (GST) / value added tax (VAT)\n\nRevenues, expenses, liabilities and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST/VAT, unless the GST/VAT incurred is not recoverable from the tax authority. In this case, it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense. Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST/VAT receivable or payable.\n\nCash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST/VAT components of cash flows arising from investing and financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority are presented as operating cash flows.\n\nCommitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST/VAT recoverable from, or payable to, a taxation authority.\n\n## Other accounting policies\n\nSignificant and other accounting policies that summarise the measurement basis used and are relevant to an understanding of the financial statements, are provided throughout the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the same accounting policies as used in the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2022. There were no significant changes in accounting policies during the year ended 30 June 2023 nor did the introduction of new accounting standards or amendments lead to any change in measurement or disclosure in the financial statements as described in note 34.1.\n\n## Changes in comparatives\n\n## Change in reporting segments - note 1 segment information\n\nChanges have been made to the Group's reporting segments for the current period to consolidate and simplify the reporting of the North America operations. With this change the Group now has two reporting segments that represent the North America operations, and a single reporting segment representing Asia operations. Comparatives have been restated to account for the changes, and this has been disclosed in note 1.\n\n## Restatement of comparatives - consolidated statement of financial position\n\nThe comparative balances for intangible assets (non-current), property, plant and equipment (non-current) and inventories (current) have been restated in the consolidated statement of financial position to reflect the adjustments made within the measurement period for the acquisition of Coil Coatings. This restatement is also reflected in the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements. Refer to note 21.2.\n\n## The notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe notes to the consolidated financial statements includes information which is material and relevant to the operations, financial position and performance of the Group. Information is considered material and relevant due to its size or nature, or the information is important for understanding current and future performance or significant changes in operations.\n\nThe notes to the consolidated financial statements have been organised into logical groupings to help users find and understand the information reported. Where possible, related information has been provided in the same place.\n\n## Key accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group's accounting policies. It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are material to the financial statements, are disclosed in the following notes:\n\n| Accounting judgements and estimates                             | Note                                           |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Uncertain tax matters                                           | Note 4 Income tax                              |\n| Recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets           | Note 4 Income tax                              |\n| Recognition and calculation of provisions                       | Note 10 Provisions                             |\n| Determination of retirement benefit obligations                 | Note 11 Retirement benefit obligations         |\n| Estimation of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment | Note 12 Property, plant and equipment          |\n| Impairment of non-financial assets                              | Note 14 Carrying value of non-financial assets |\n| Determining lease contract terms and lease components           | Note 17 Leases                                 |\n| Fair value measurement of business acquisitions                 | Note 21 Business combinations                  |\n| Fair value measurement of share-based payments                  | Note 28 Share-based payments                   |",

The revenue from external parties is measured in a manner that is consistent with the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\nSegment assets and liabilities are measured in a manner consistent with the consolidated statement of financial position. Cash and liabilities arising from borrowings and leases are not considered to be segment assets and liabilities due to these being managed by the Group's centralised treasury function.",

In addition to delivering goods, the Group also provides design, construction or installation services in our Buildings and Building Product businesses. Other than the provision of service warranties, the Group's performance obligations are typically satisfied within one year or less.\n\nRevenue is recognised at a point in time for goods on delivery to the customer or once goods have passed the ship's rail and a mate's receipt has been received from the ship's captain. For bundled goods and services such as design, construction or installation services, revenue is recognised over time, where required by accounting standards, as progress is made towards completion of a performance obligation. The input method is used for measuring progress to completion for bundled goods and services. Revenue is recognised for bundled good based on the proportion of goods delivered relative to the total expected goods to be delivered and for services based on the costs incurred relative to the total costs expected to be incurred in satisfying a performance obligation.\n\nThe transaction price in a contract can vary due to volume and steel pricing rebates, early payment discounts and credits for product shipped and billed to the customer that did not meet previously agreed specifications. Variable consideration is estimated using the 'most likely amount method' for contracts with a single volume threshold and the 'expected value method' for contracts with more than one volume threshold.\n\nThe majority of the Group ' s product warranties are assurance type warranties. However, the North American Buildings and Building Product businesses offer service warranties to customers, ranging from 5 to 30 years. These service warranties are treated as a separate performance obligation with revenue from premiums recognised over the warranty period.\n\n## 3.

Emission unit permits (EU), granted on a calendar year, are recorded as intangible assets at their fair value with a corresponding entry to deferred income. Income is recognised based on production outputs.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\nOverseas subsidiaries have undistributed earnings, which, if paid out as dividends, would be subject to withholding tax. An assessable temporary difference exists, however no deferred tax liability has been recognised as the parent entity is able to control the timing of distributions from its subsidiaries and is not expected to distribute these profits in the foreseeable future.\n\nUnrecognised deferred tax assets for the Group totalling $112.8M (2022: $135.1M) in respect of temporary differences have not been recognised as they are not probable of realisation.\n\nUnused tax losses predominantly relate to the China business which expire within 5 years of being incurred.\n\n## 4.4 Recognition and measurement\n\nIncome tax expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income comprises current and deferred tax, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income, in which case it is also recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, respectively.\n\n## Current taxes\n\nThe income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable on the current period taxable income using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates, and generates taxable income, and any adjustment to tax payable with respect to prior years.\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the tax base. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority and there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill in a business combination or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction (other than from a business combination or the adoption of a new accounting standard) that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit.\n\nFurthermore, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in foreign operations where the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. For the current year a $2.0M deferred tax expense, relating to investments in foreign operations, was recognised in other comprehensive income (2022: $3.5M).\n\nDeferred tax assets are only recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.\n\nThe Group has and will continue to apply the temporary exception in AASB 112 Income Taxes not to recognise or disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities that could arise from OECD Pillar Two model rules.\n\n## 4.5 Key accounting judgements and estimates\n\n## Uncertain tax matters\n\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in Australia and foreign jurisdictions and as a result the calculation of the Group's tax payable involves estimation and judgement, including assumptions made in respect of the application of tax legislation. There are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, these differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which the determination is made.\n\n## Recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future forecast taxable profits are available to utilise those temporary differences and losses, and the tax losses continue to be available having regard to the relevant tax legislation associated with their recoupment. Judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of probable future taxable profits.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\n## 6.3 Transferred financial assets that are derecognised\n\nThe Group has receivables securitisation programs totalling $345.3M (2022: $393.6M) that mature in September 2023 ($45.3M) and December 2024 ($300.0M). These programs involve the sale of relevant trade receivables across Australian Steel Products and North Star BlueScope Steel. The business services the programs and collects cash from its customers on behalf of the program provider for which a fee is received.\n\nRelevant trade receivables under the receivables securitisation programs are required to be derecognised in their entirety, when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the trade receivables have expired or are transferred. The Group maintains a continuing involvement in the derecognised financial assets by virtue of reserving requirements under the programs. The maximum exposure to loss for the Group from its continuing involvement is $64.5M which is determined by the amount of reserves funded by BlueScope, less customer collections during the month. Interest income and service fees earned were $12.7M (2022: $8.8M). Total costs from selling the receivables and running the programs were $30.7M (2022: $24.0M), presented within other expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\nIn the event bad or doubtful debts exceed a specified limit, the Group is required to recognise the trade receivables on the balance sheet. Under these securitisation programs, the program provider is exposed to the first loss and to qualify for derecognition bad or doubtful debts must not exceed the first loss limit. Current experience and bad debt history is below this level. In the event this limit is exceeded, the Group would have to recognise the trade receivable on the balance sheet with the program recorded as borrowings.\n\nThe carrying amount of trade receivables de-recognised as at 30 June 2023 is $350.0M (2022: $397.1M) which is reflected in a decrease in trade receivables of $151.4M (2022: $189.5M), and an increase in sundry payables of $263.1M (2022: $273.4M) offset by a $64.5M (2022: $65.8M) increase in sundry receivables which approximates fair value.\n\n## 6.4 Recognition and measurement\n\nTrade receivables not included in securitisation programs are held in a business model to collect contractual cash flows which are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amounts outstanding. These trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less allowance for expected credit losses. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 30 to 90 days.\n\n## Loss allowance for trade receivables and contract assets\n\nThe Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) associated with trade receivables and contract assets using the simplified approach, based on lifetime expected credit losses. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due under a contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive. The Group calculates loss allowances using a provision matrix that is based on the Group's historically observed credit loss experience and risk of default, adjusted for current and any forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.\n\nCustomer credit risk is managed by each business in accordance with the procedures and controls set out in the Group's credit risk management policy. Credit limits are established for all customers based on external and internal credit rating criteria and letters of credit or other forms of credit insurance cover are obtained where appropriate.\n\nThe Group assesses the recoverability of receivables continuously and debts are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Where there is objective evidence that amounts due may not be received, specific allowances are recognised. Indicators that amounts due may not be received include financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments.\n\nThe amount of the loss allowance is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Cash flows relating to current receivables are not discounted if the effect of discounting is immaterial.",

The write-back has been included in 'raw materials and consumables used' in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\n## 7.1 Recognition and measurement\n\nRaw materials and stores, work in progress and finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs to sell.\n\nCost comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of variable and fixed overhead expenditure, the latter being allocated on the basis of normal operating capacity. Cost includes the transfer from equity of any gains/losses on qualifying cash flow hedges relating to purchases of raw materials. Costs are assigned to inventory on the basis of weighted average costs. Costs of purchased inventory are determined after deducting rebates and discounts.\n\n## 8.

Intangible EU assets are not amortised as the economic benefits are realised from surrendering the rights to settle obligations arising from the emissions trading scheme.\n\n## Energy certificates\n\nEnergy certificates represent acquired permits in the Australian Steel Products segment generated from the Finley NSW solar farm as part of the Solar PPA agreement (refer to note 32.4) and various local state schemes. Energy certificates which are not held for trading are classified as intangible assets and are carried at cost.",

Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.\n\n## Annual leave and long service leave\n\nThe liability for annual leave and long service leave is measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, including on-costs, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields on high quality corporate bonds other than New Zealand where Government bonds are used, with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.\n\n## Amounts not expected to be settled within 12 months for current leave provisions\n\nThe current provision for long service leave includes all unconditional entitlements where employees have completed the required period of service. The Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement, so the entire annual leave amount and vested portion of long service leave are presented as current. However, based on past experience, the Group does not expect all employees to take the full amount of accrued annual leave and long service leave or require payment within the next 12 months. Current annual leave and long service leave obligation expected to be settled after 12 months is $125.3M (2022: $150.8M).\n\n## Redundancy or termination benefits\n\nLiabilities for termination benefits, not in connection with a business combination or the closure of an operation, are recognised when the Group is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a formal plan without possibility of withdrawal, or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to present value.\n\nThe employee redundancy provision balance reflects a range of internal reorganisations. All redundancies are expected to take effect within 12 months of the reporting date.\n\n## Other employee benefits - short-term incentive plans\n\nThe Group recognises a liability and an expense for short-term incentive plan payments made to employees. The Group recognises a provision where past practice and current performance indicates that a probable constructive obligation exists. This is recorded in other employee benefits.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\n## Restructuring costs\n\nLiabilities arising directly from undertaking a restructuring program, defined as the closure of an operating site, are recognised when a detailed plan of the restructuring activity has been developed and implementation of the restructuring program as planned has commenced, by either entering into contracts to undertake the restructuring activities or making a detailed announcement such that affected parties are in no doubt the restructuring program will proceed.\n\nThe provision primarily relates to Australian Steel Products segment to cover estimated future costs of site closures which are to be utilised over various terms up to a maximum period of 11 years.\n\n## Product claims\n\nProvision for claims is based on modelled data combining sales volumes with past experiences of repair and replacement levels in conjunction with any specifically identified product faults.\n\n## Workers compensation\n\nIn Australia and North America, the Company is a registered self-insurer for workers compensation. Provisions are recognised based on calculations performed by an external actuary in relation to the expectation of future events. A contingent liability exists in relation to guarantees given to various state workers compensation authorities, due to self-insurance prerequisites (refer to note 26.1).\n\nFor the Group, an actuarially determined asset of $28.2M (2022: $28.9M) has been recognised for expected future reimbursements associated with workers compensation recoveries from third parties. This amount is included in non-current other receivables (refer to note 6) as there is no legal right offset against the workers compensation provision.\n\n## Restoration and rehabilitation\n\nRestoration and rehabilitation provisions include $4.6M (2022: $5.1M) for New Zealand Steel in relation to its operation of its iron sands mine in Waikato North Head. The provision has been classified as non-current as the timing of payments to remedy the site will not be made until cessation of operation which is not expected in the near future.\n\nThe balance of the provision relates to leased sites that require rectification and restoration work at the end of their respective lease periods, primarily within the Australian Steel Products Segment for $29.6M (2022: $28.1M).\n\nRecognising restoration, remediation and rehabilitation provisions requires assumptions to be made as to the application of environmental legislation, site closure dates, available technologies and engineering cost estimates. These uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided.\n\n## Carbon emissions\n\nThe Group is a participant in the New Zealand Government's uncapped Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).\n\nA provision for carbon emissions is recognised, measured at the carrying amount of Emission Units (EUs) held. Any excess units, held for trading are measured at the current market value of EUs. ETS costs passed through from suppliers are included as part of the underlying cost of the good or service rendered. The liability is either included within trade creditors or recorded as an emissions liability within the carbon provision account when an agreement has been reached with the supplier to settle the ETS cost by transferring EUs.\n\nWhen EUs are delivered to the government or a third party, the EU asset along with the corresponding carbon provision are derecognised from the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## Other - outstanding legal matters\n\n## ACCC civil cartel proceedings\n\nIn August 2019 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) commenced civil proceedings against BlueScope and one of its former employees in the Federal Court alleging contraventions of the Australian competition law cartel provisions.\n\nOn 9 December 2022, the Federal Court found against BlueScope and its former employee on nine allegations of its former employee attempting to induce certain suppliers of flat steel products in Australia to reach an understanding on pricing.\n\nA remedies hearing was held on 12 April 2023. BlueScope is awaiting the outcome of that hearing and no decision has been made about any appeal. Whilst the outcome of the penalty orders is uncertain, a provision of $45M has been recorded at 30 June 2023. The Court retains absolute discretion to determine penalty composition and quantum. BlueScope considers this figure a reasonable estimate of penalty and legal costs that may be awarded against BlueScope and it is consistent with BlueScope's submissions to the court.\n\n## 10.3 Key accounting judgements and estimates\n\nProvisions are measured at the present value of management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.",

The objective of funding is to ensure that the benefit entitlements of members and other beneficiaries are fully funded by the time they become payable. Total employer contributions expected to be paid for the year ending 30 June 2024 are $6.5M.\n\n## 11.8 Key accounting judgements and estimates\n\nA liability or asset in respect of defined benefit plans is measured as the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the fund's assets. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is based on expected future payments which arise from membership of the fund to the end of the reporting period, calculated half yearly by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service.\n\nExpected future payments are discounted using market yields on government or corporate bonds where a deep market exists, with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.\n\nActuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, in other comprehensive income.\n\nPast service costs are recognised in profit or loss, unless the changes to the superannuation plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Upon settlement the net defined benefit liability is remeasured using the current fair value of plan assets and current actuarial assumptions, including current market yields. A gain or loss on settlement, being the difference between the benefits of the plan prior to the settlement and the benefits of the plan post settlement, is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nFuture taxes that are funded by the entity and are part of the provision of the existing benefit obligation (e.g. taxes on investment income and employer contributions) are taken into account in measuring the net liability or asset.",

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Cost may also include transfers from equity of any gains or losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of a replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are expensed to profit or loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\n## 13.1 Recognition and measurement\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid in a business combination over the fair market value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Customisation and configuration costs for cloud computing arrangements (SaaS) are capitalised when the Company has control of a separate identifiable asset. All software data migration and training costs are expensed.\n\nIntangible assets are subsequently measured at cost less amortisation and any impairment losses. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful life. The amortisation period and method are reviewed at each reporting date.\n\nA summary of the useful lives of intangible assets is as follows:\n\n| Category                             | Useful life                          |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Patents, trademarks and other rights | Indefinite and finite (7 - 15 years) |\n| Computer software                    | Finite (3 - 10 years)                |\n| Customer relationships               | Finite (10 - 20 years)               |\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. For the year ended 30 June 2023, $29.0M (2022: $26.6M) was recognised for research and development expenditure within other expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Costs incurred on development projects are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will, after considering its commercial and technical feasibility, be completed and generate future economic benefits and its costs can be measured reliably.\n\n## 14. Carrying value of non-financial assets\n\n## 14.1 Impairment assessment\n\nThe Group tests property, plant and equipment (note 12), right-of-use assets (note 17) and intangible assets with definite useful lives (note 13) when there is an indicator of impairment. In testing for impairment, the recoverable amount is estimated for an individual asset or, if it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount for the individual asset, the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful life are tested at least annually for any impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs according to the level at which management monitors goodwill.\n\nFor assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life or not yet available for use, an assessment is made at each reporting period to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods.",

All of the above CGUs were tested for impairment at the reporting date.\n\n## 14.3 Key accounting judgements and estimates (carrying value assessment)\n\nThe recoverable amount of each CGU is determined on the basis of value-in-use (VIU), unless there is evidence to support a higher fair value less costs of disposal. BlueScope operates in markets which are impacted by economic cycles and short-term volatility. The price, cost and demand for BlueScope's products are uncertain and the Company considers a range of recognised external forecasters when assessing possible future market conditions.\n\nThe key assumptions the Group has used in its VIU calculation when determining the recoverable amount of each CGU were:\n\n| Key  assumptions    | Basis of estimation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Future cash  flows  | \u00b7 VIU calculations use post-tax cash flows, inclusive of working capital movements which are based on financial  projections approved by the Group covering a three-year forecast period, being the basis of the Group's  forecasting and planning processes, or up to five years where circumstances pertaining to a specific CGU support  a longer period. |\n|                     | \u00b7 Cash flows beyond the forecast period are extrapolated to provide a maximum of 30 years of cash flows with  adjustments where necessary to reflect changes in long-term operating conditions.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\nThe impairment was based on a recoverable amount of $191.0M for the CGU determined on a VIU basis using a pre-tax discount rate of 13.6%.\n\n## 14.5 Cash generating units with significant goodwill\n\nThe results of impairment testing for CGUs with significant goodwill, and consideration of changes in key assumptions, are as follows:\n\n## Buildings North America CGU\n\nBuildings North America is tested for impairment on a VIU basis using three-year cash flow projections, followed by a long-term growth rate of 2.5% for a further 27 years. Post-tax VIU cash flows are discounted utilising a 8.8% post-tax discount rate (2022: 8.0%).\n\nAt 30 June 2023 the recoverable amount of this CGU is 1.5 times (2022: 1.4 times) the carrying amount of $544M (2022: $601M), including non-current assets and net working capital. This CGU is most sensitive to assumptions in relation to North American nonresidential building and construction activity. Taking into account external forecasts the Group expects non-residential building and construction activity to decrease in the longer term from FY2023 levels. However, non-residential building and construction activity in North America is uncertain. To illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions, if they were to differ such that the expected cash flow forecasts for Buildings North America were to decrease by approximately 31% (2022: 27%) across the forecast period, without implementation of mitigation plans, the recoverable amount would be equal to the carrying amount.\n\n## BlueScope Coated Products CGU\n\nBlueScope Coated Products is tested for impairment on a VIU basis using three-year cash flow projections, followed by a long-term growth rate of 2.5% for a further 27 years. Post-tax VIU cash flows are discounted utilising post-tax discount rate of 8.8%.\n\nAt 30 June 2023 the recoverable amount of the CGU is 1.4 times the carrying amount of $753M, including non-current assets and net working capital. This CGU is also most sensitive to assumptions in relation to North American non-residential building and construction activity, as noted above for the Buildings North America CGU. To illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions, if they were to differ, such that the expected cash flow forecasts for BlueScope Coated Products were to decrease by approximately 30% across the forecast period, without implementation of mitigation plans, the recoverable amount would be equal to the carrying amount.\n\n## North Star BlueScope Steel CGU\n\nNorth Star BlueScope is tested for impairment on a VIU basis using five-year cash flow projections, followed by a long-term growth rate of 2.5% for a further 25 years. Post-tax VIU cash flows are discounted utilising post-tax discount rate of 9.1% (2022: 9.5%).\n\nAt 30 June 2023 the recoverable amount of the CGU is 2.1 times (2022: 2.3 times) the carrying amount of $3,562M (2022: $3,320M), including non-current assets and net working capital. This CGU is most sensitive to assumptions in relation to the spread between North American hot rolled coil and purchased scrap steel prices. Recognised external forecasters expect spreads to be broadly in line relative to FY2023 levels. To illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions, if they were to differ, such that the expected cash flow forecasts for North Star BlueScope Steel were to decrease by approximately 52% (2022: 56%) across the forecast period, without implementation of mitigation plans, the recoverable amount would be equal to the carrying amount.\n\n## 14.6 Sensitivity of carrying amounts\n\nThe carrying value of property, plant and equipment of the Group is sensitive to the cash forecasts of the Australian Steel Products and New Zealand and Pacific Islands CGUs, as they are exposed to global steel macroeconomic factors. For Australian Steel Products, its recoverable value is also sensitive to the outcomes of the SGM. The recoverable amount of these CGUs is determined taking into account the key assumptions set out above.\n\n## Australian Steel Products (ASP) CGU\n\nFor ASP, recognised external forecasters estimate the Australian dollar relative to the US dollar to strengthen in the long-term relative to the year ended 30 June 2023 and estimate Asian commodity steel prices to be similar, with a decrease in iron ore and coking coal average costs relative to the year ended 30 June 2023. The Group believes that the long-term assumptions adopted are appropriate.\n\nASP is exposed to variable macroeconomic factors and domestic demand, and to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions, if they were to differ such that the expected cash flow forecasts were to decrease by approximately 19% (2022: 34%) across the forecast period, without implementation of mitigation plans, the recoverable amount would be equal to the carrying amount.\n\nThe SGM presents potential risk to the carrying value of ASP to the extent it results in incremental costs being borne in the form of acquiring ACCUs to offset emissions above the relevant Scope 1 emission intensity baseline. The potential additional cost to comply with the SGM is dependent on a range of factors including future emissions intensity, production volume, ACCU prices and the Scope 1 baseline reductions rates applied under the SGM, including consideration of PKSW as a trade exposed baseline adjusted facility. Although assumptions and estimates have been made about these factors, the final outcome may be different. To express the sensitivity of the ASP recoverable value to the cost of complying with the SGM, an increase in the cost to comply with the SGM by 20% in each year of the 30-year cash flow forecast for impairment testing, without any mitigating strategies, would reduce the recoverable amount of ASP by $50M.",

The Group believes that the long-term assumptions adopted are appropriate.\n\nNZPI recognised partial impairment of its non-financial assets in FY2016 and FY2020 and as at 30 June 2023 has approximately $160M available to be reversed. NZPI is exposed to variable global macroeconomic factors such as commodity steel prices and exchange rates, together with regional New Zealand factors such as domestic demand and energy costs, which impact its cash flows. While the CGU has delivered cash flows over the last two years which, if such cash flows were to continue, could support a reversal, after taking into account the variable historical earnings performance of the CGU through the economic cycle and the range of possible long-term forecast scenarios, the Company has determined that the recoverable value is consistent with the carrying value.",

Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are consequently recognised in profit or loss over the term.\n\nBorrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\n## 17.4 Recognition and measurement\n\n## Group as a lessee\n\nThe Group, as a lessee, is required to recognise right-of-use assets representing its right to use the underlying assets and lease liabilities representing its obligation to make lease payments.\n\n## Definition of a lease\n\nA contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nA contract that conveys rights to use an asset is regarded as a lease to the extent of such rights, notwithstanding that the contract may deal to a greater or lesser extent with other matters. Service contracts may be, in substance, wholly or partly leases.\n\nIn determining whether all or part of a contract should be recognised as a lease it may be necessary to identify the components of the contract. The component of the contract that represents service costs are not included as part of the lease rentals.\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nThe Group recognises a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. Cost comprises of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability,\n- \u00b7 Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received,\n- \u00b7 Any initial direct costs; and\n- \u00b7 Restoration costs.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight line basis over the term of the lease or over the life of the asset if ownership of the underlying asset is to be transferred at the end of the lease term. The right-of-use assets are subject to impairment and are assessed at either individual asset level, if it generates cash flows which are largely independent from other assets, or at a cash generating unit level.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any incentives receivable,\n- \u00b7 Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate as at the commencement date; and\n- \u00b7 The exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option.\n\nVariable lease payments that vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time (e.g. rentals based on usage) are excluded from lease payments recognised on balance sheet and are recognised in the profit or loss as incurred. Variable leases for the Group primarily relate to leases embedded within service agreements relating to transport and steel mill services.\n\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses the lessee's incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently increased by interest on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase option, extension option or lease termination is reasonably certain to be exercised or when there is a lease modification.\n\n## Short-term and leases of low value assets\n\nThe Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases, being a period of 12 months or less from the commencement date, and one which does not contain a purchase option. It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption, being a distinct asset worth less than $10,000 when brand new. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low value assets are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## 17.5 Key accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe Group has applied judgement when determining the relative standalone prices of the lease and non-lease components contained within service agreements. The lease asset rentals have been determined using estimated asset depreciation uplifted for specific contract margins.",

Lease terms have been assessed based on whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such options. This assessment impacts the value of the lease liability and right-of-use asset recognised. Lease extension options are at the Group's discretion of being exercised and are primarily associated with property leases within the ASP building product businesses. The use of extension options provides the Group flexibility when determining the future use of leasehold properties that meets ever changing business requirements.\n\nGross lease extension options, for which the Group is not reasonably certain of exercise and has been excluded from the lease liability, total $626.2M (2022: $515.4M). Of this amount, $339.6M (2022: $320.5M) relates primarily to property lease extension options beyond 2030.\n\n## 18.

On occasions, the Group will take advantage of certain investment opportunities where an increased level of net debt will be tolerated, provided there is sufficient future cash flow strength and flexibility to be confident of credit strengthening rather than uncertainty and risk of credit weakening.\n\nIn managing equity, all methods of returning funds to shareholders outside of dividend payments or raising funds are considered within the context of its balance sheet objectives. In managing debt, the Group seeks a diversified range of funding sources and maturity profiles. Sufficient flexibility is maintained within committed facilities in order to provide the business with the desired liquidity support for operations and to pursue its strategic objectives.\n\n|                                 | Note   | 2023 $M   | 2022 $M   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|\n| Total borrowings                | 16     | 244.8     | 777.2     |\n| Lease liabilities               | 17.2   | 541.7     | 538.4     |\n| Less: Cash and cash equivalents | 15     | (1,489.8) | (1,682.7) |\n| Net (cash) debt                 |        | (703.3)   | (367.1)   |\n| Total equity                    |        | 11,030.7  | 10,448.1  |\n| Total capital                   |        | 10,327.4  | 10,081.0  |\n| Gearing ratio                   |        | 0.0%      | 0.0%      |\n\n## 18.4 Recognition and measurement\n\n## Ordinary shares\n\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity and have no par value.

It includes the accounting policies and key judgements and estimates relevant to understanding these areas.\n\n## 21. Business combinations\n\n## 21.1 Ohio scrap business acquisition\n\nOn 8 August 2022, the Group acquired a ferrous scrap metal processing business in Ohio (USA) for US$84.9M. This acquisition complements the December 2021 purchase of the US ferrous scrap metal recycling business of MetalX LLC. The acquired scrap businesses operate as BlueScope Recycling and Materials.\n\nDuring the year ending 30 June 2023, the purchase price accounting for the acquisition was finalised. Details of the purchase consideration, and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired are provided below:\n\n|                                                                      | $M US$   | $M A$   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|\n| Fair value of identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed: |          |         |\n| Inventories                                                          | 11.2     | 16.7    |\n| Property, plant and equipment                                        | 30.9     | 45.3    |\n| Intangible assets 1                                                  | 23.1     | 34.2    |\n| Total identifiable net assets at fair value                          | 65.2     | 96.2    |\n| Goodwill recognised on acquisition                                   | 19.7     | 26.4    |\n| Purchase consideration transferred                                   | 84.9     | 122.6   |\n| Outflow of cash to acquire business, net of cash acquired:           |          |         |\n| Purchase consideration                                               | 84.9     | 122.6   |\n| Add: Acquisition costs                                               | 1.1      | 1.6     |\n| Outflow of cash                                                      | 86.0     | 124.2   |\n\n- 1. Intangibles represent external customer relationships (US$10.5M) to be amortised over 10 years and supplier relationships (US$12.6M) to be amortised over 3 years.\n\nGoodwill recognised on acquisition represents the premium paid above the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. The balance relates to intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition, which are not separately identifiable. Management has identified the goodwill on the basis of the acquisition providing the Company an important presence and expertise in scrap processing further supporting the supply of scrap steel to the North Star business. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes over 15 years.\n\nFrom the date of acquisition, the business has contributed revenues of $209.4M and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of $12.0M to the Group.\n\n## 21.2 Coil Coatings acquisition\n\nOn 28 June 2022, the Group acquired the Coil Coatings business from Cornerstone Buildings Brands, Inc. Coil Coatings is the second largest metal painter in the US, with a total capacity of around 900,000 tonnes per annum across seven facilities, predominantly serving commercial and industrial construction applications. The acquired businesses operate as BlueScope Coated Products.\n\n## Finalisation of purchase price accounting - restatement of comparative financial information\n\nGiven the proximity of the acquisition to the prior year end 30 June 2022, the identifiable net assets recognised on acquisition were reported on a provisional basis at that time. Since 30 June 2022, the provisional amounts have been finalised based on new information obtained, including external valuations on identifiable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.",

A final adjustment to the purchase price (receivable of US$9.8M) also decreased total consideration transferred to US$490.2M. These adjustments have decreased the value of goodwill by US$149.6M to US$235.2M from the provisionally accounted position as at 30 June 2022.\n\nThe comparative balances for intangible assets (non-current), property, plant and equipment (non-current) and inventories (current) have been restated to reflect these adjustments made within the measurement period for the acquisition of Coil Coatings.

Management has identified the goodwill on the basis of the acquisition providing immediate access to the large and growing Eastern US region in addition to near-term synergies and potential for medium to longer-term growth through facility upgrades, product development, and branded products. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes over 15 years.\n\nDuring the year, additional acquisition expenses totalling US$8.7M ($12.7M) have been paid.\n\n## 21.3 MetalX acquisition\n\nIn the prior year, the Group acquired the US ferrous scrap metal recycling business of MetalX LLC, for a purchase consideration of US$218.3M ($306.8M). Contingent consideration of US$20M ($29.1M) was included in the purchase price which has since been paid in full during the current reporting period.\n\n## 21.4 Key accounting judgements and estimates\n\nJudgement is required to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, which can have a material impact on the determination of goodwill. This includes the use of external experts who use various valuation techniques to determine an appropriate fair value for working capital, land and buildings, plant and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets such as customer and supplier relationships.",

Investments in associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting, after initially being recognised at cost.\n\nThe Group's share of its associates' post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in profit or loss, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. Dividends receivable from associates in the consolidated financial statements reduce the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nWhen the Group's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.",

A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement ('joint operators') have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement ('joint venturers') have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\n\nThe interests in joint ventures are accounted for in the financial statements using the equity method. Under the equity method, the share of the profits or losses of the joint venture is recognised in profit or loss, and the share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nProfits or losses on transactions establishing a joint venture and transactions with a joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the Group's ownership interest until such time as they are realised by the joint venture partnership on consumption or sale. However, a loss on the transaction is recognised immediately if the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets, or an impairment loss.",

Contingencies\n\n## 26.1 Contingent liabilities\n\nThe Group had contingent liabilities as at 30 June 2023 in respect of:\n\n## Outstanding legal matters\n\nThere are a range of individually immaterial outstanding legal matters that were contingent on court decisions, arbitration rulings and private negotiations to determine amounts required for settlement.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nIn Australia, BlueScope Steel Limited has provided $89.2M (2022: $88.7M) in guarantees to various state workers compensation authorities as a prerequisite for self-insurance. An amount, net of recoveries, of $62.7M (2022: $58.9M) has been recognised as recommended by independent actuarial advice.\n\nBank guarantees have been provided to customers and suppliers in respect of the performance of goods and services provided and purchases of goods and services which are immediately callable by default. Bank guarantees outstanding as at 30 June 2023 totalled $144.7M (2022: $143.8M).\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe Group operates in many countries across the world, each with separate taxation authorities, which results in significant complexity. At any point in time there are tax computations which have been submitted but not agreed by those tax authorities and matters which are under discussion between Group companies and the tax authorities. The Group provides for the amount of tax it expects to pay taking into account those discussions and professional advice it has received. While the conclusion of such matters may result in amendments to the original computations, the Group does not believe that such adjustments will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, although such adjustments may be significant to any individual year's income statement.\n\n## Regulatory\n\nThe Group is subject to extensive government laws and regulation, including environmental, greenhouse gas emissions, tax, occupational health and safety, competition law and trade restrictions in each of the countries in which it operates. The Group is also subject to risks posed by the conduct of our employees and other participants in the supply chain and to the risk of regulatory investigations into compliance with government laws and regulations which could be lengthy and costly.\n\n## 26.2  Contingent assets\n\nThere are no material contingent assets required for disclosure as at 30 June 2023 (2022: Nil).\n\n## 27.  Subsequent events\n\nOther than matters outlined elsewhere in the financial report, no other matters or circumstances have arisen since the end of the financial year that have significantly affected, or may significantly affect, the operations, results of operations or state of affairs of the Group in subsequent accounting periods.",

Share-based payments\n\n## 28.1 Share award schemes\n\nEligible employees of the Group have the right to participate in the Group's share plans. Shares, share rights and performance rights are offered in these share plans and are granted by the Company to eligible employees of the Group. This note should be read in conjunction with the Remuneration Report which forms part of the Directors' Report and contains detailed information regarding remuneration for Key Management Personnel.\n\n## STI share award (STI)\n\nThe Board approved the annual FY2023 STI for the CEO and executives, being a one-year equity program. No amount will be paid in cash. Performance was assessed against a range of financial and other measures aligned with the returns delivered to shareholders from the implementation of initiatives under the Group's strategic plan.\n\n## Long Term Alignment Rights Plan (LTAR)\n\nThe LTAR plan is a program determined annually by the Board, which awards share rights to the CEO and eligible senior management. The share rights are designed to build share ownership and reward senior management for long-term value creation, and are part of the Group's overall recognition and retention strategy. The share rights give the right to receive an ordinary share at a later date subject to the satisfaction of certain performance criteria and continued employment with the Group.\n\nThe share rights available for exercise are contingent on the Group's achievement of a three-year rolling average Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and debt leverage, as well as individual adherence to Our Bond. Share rights that fail to meet performance vesting conditions will lapse upon the expiry date, or sooner upon employee resignation or termination. Plans have been granted at $Nil exercise price.\n\n## Deferred Equity / Retention Rights Award (RR)\n\nThe Board awarded deferred equity awards to senior management throughout the Group, with no performance hurdles required to be met. The equity award gives the right to receive an ordinary share at a later date subject to continued employment with the Group.\n\n## Talent Retention Equity Rights (TRE)\n\nThe Board awarded talent retention equity rights to selected senior management. The equity award gives the right to receive an ordinary share at a later date subject to maintaining personal performance ratings above the required level and continued employment with the Company.\n\n## Non-Executive Director Salary Sacrifice Share Plan (NED)\n\nThe Board awarded a fee sacrifice plan to non-executive directors, designed to provide them the opportunity to acquire share rights through sacrificing a fixed portion of their fees covering periods of 6 months intervals. The share rights are being settled by an on-market purchase of BlueScope Steel Limited shares.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\nNon-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of share awards or share rights that are expected to vest. The expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are expected to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of share awards and share rights that are expected to vest based on non-market vesting conditions. The Group recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.\n\nThe cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until vesting date reflects the extent to which the expected vesting period has expired and the number of rights that are expected to ultimately vest. This number is based on the best available information at the reporting date. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest due to a performance condition not being met, except for share rights where vesting is only conditional upon a market condition. No adjustment is made for the likelihood of market performance conditions being met as the effect of these conditions is included in the determination of fair value at grant date.\n\nUpon the exercise of equity settled share awards, the balance of the share-based payments reserve relating to those rights and awards is transferred to share capital. The dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding rights is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.\n\n## Cash settled transactions\n\nThe ultimate expense recognised in relation to cash-settled transactions will be equal to the actual cash paid to the employees, which will be the fair value at settlement date. The expected cash payment is estimated at each reporting date and a liability is recognised to the extent that the vesting period has expired and in proportion to the amount of the awards that are expected to ultimately vest.\n\n## 28.6  Key accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe fair value of equity settled awards at grant date is independently determined by an external valuer using a Black-Scholes option pricing model that includes a Monte Carlo simulation analysis, which takes into account the exercise price, the term of the share right, the impact of dilution, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the share right.\n\n## 29.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\n## 30.4  Recognition and measurement\n\nThe financial information for the parent entity BlueScope Steel Limited has been prepared on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements, except as set out below.\n\n## Investment in subsidiaries\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less accumulated impairment losses in the financial statements of BlueScope Steel Limited.\n\n## Tax consolidation legislation\n\nBlueScope Steel Limited and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities have entered into a tax sharing and funding agreement in relation to their participation in the tax consolidation regime. Under the terms of this agreement, the wholly-owned entities reimburse BlueScope Steel Limited for any current tax payable assumed and are compensated by BlueScope Steel Limited for any current tax receivable and deferred tax assets relating to unused tax losses or unused tax credits that are transferred to BlueScope Steel Limited under the tax consolidation legislation. The funding amounts are determined by reference to the amounts recognised in the wholly-owned entities' financial statements.\n\nThe amounts receivable/payable under the tax funding agreement are due upon receipt of the funding advice from BlueScope Steel Limited, which is issued as soon as practicable after the end of each financial year. BlueScope Steel Limited may require payment of interim funding amounts to assist with its obligations to pay tax instalments.\n\nThe tax sharing agreement limits the joint and several liability of the wholly-owned entities in the case of a default by BlueScope Steel Limited. At the reporting date, the possibility of default is considered remote.\n\nThe tax consolidated group has applied the group allocation approach in determining the appropriate amount of current taxes to allocate to members of the tax consolidated group. Intercompany receivables of $102.6M (2022: $389.9M) and intercompany payables of $4.4M (2022: nil) of BlueScope Steel Limited have been recognised as a tax consolidated adjustment.\n\n## 31. Deed of cross-guarantee\n\nBlueScope Steel Limited and certain Australian wholly owned subsidiaries are parties to a deed of cross-guarantee (Deed) under which each company guarantees the debts of the others. The companies in the Deed are referenced in Note 23.1, and are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Amari Wolff Steel Pty Ltd\n- \u00b7 BlueScope Building and Construction Ltd\n- \u00b7 BlueScope Distribution Pty Ltd\n- \u00b7 BlueScope Pacific Steel (Fiji) Pty Limited\n- \u00b7 BlueScope Steel Limited\n- \u00b7 BlueScope APT Holdings Pty Ltd\n- \u00b7 BlueScope Water Australia Pty Ltd\n- \u00b7 Fielders Manufacturing Pty Ltd\n- \u00b7 Lysaght Building Solutions Pty Ltd\n- \u00b7 Laser Dynamics Australia Pty Ltd\n- \u00b7 Metalcorp Steel Pty Ltd\n- \u00b7 New Zealand Steel (Aust) Pty Ltd\n- \u00b7 Orrcon Distribution Pty Ltd\n- \u00b7 Orrcon Manufacturing Pty Ltd\n- \u00b7 Permalite Aluminium Building Solutions Pty Ltd\n- \u00b7 The Roofing Centre (Tasmania) Pty Ltd\n\nBy entering into the Deed, wholly owned subsidiaries which are large proprietary companies have been relieved from their requirement to prepare a financial report and Directors' Report under ASIC (wholly-owned Companies) Instrument 2016/785 issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\n## Forward foreign exchange contracts\n\nThe Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges relating to foreign currency sales and purchases, plant and equipment purchases and hedging of net working capital exposures. For the cash flow hedges relating to future commitments not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position the effective portion of gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. Otherwise, they are being marked to market through profit or loss in line with the Group's risk management strategy.\n\n## Forward commodity contracts\n\nIn September 2019, the Group entered into a Gas Supply Agreement with Esso Australia for its Australian business from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2025, with the contract price linked to Brent Oil in US dollars. Given exposure to a variable Brent Oil price, 95% of the first three year's exposure has been hedged. The forward contract has been designated as cash flow hedge with the effective portion of gains and losses recognised in equity.\n\n## Commodity option\n\nAs part of the sale agreement of New Zealand Steel Mining Limited to Taharoa Mining Investments Limited (TMIL), BlueScope is eligible to receive future royalties of US$1.66 per dry metric tonne (DMT) when the Platts Index Quotation is equal or greater than US$65 per DMT. The royalty period is for iron sand shipments made between years 2 and 11 from 1 May 2017. The royalty agreement ends on 10 May 2028.\n\nThe key inputs impacting the value of the derivative are the Platts index iron ore price, the historical volatility of iron ore prices, the credit worthiness of TMIL and production risk. The royalty was valued at US$7.3M as at 30 June 2023 (2022: US$7.9M). The royalty value is reassessed at each reporting date with any movement in the fair value of the derivative fair valued through the profit and loss and included in discontinued operations. Royalties received for the year were $6.5M (2022: $6.0M).\n\n## Solar PPA\n\nThe Group entered into a solar power purchase agreement (Solar PPA) in June 2018 for a period of seven years from the commencement of commercial production of a 133MW solar farm situated in Finley NSW. The project was completed in February 2020 and the Group's percentage offtake is 88MW or 66% of the total output. The Group has no involvement in financing, operating and maintaining the solar farm.\n\nThe Solar PPA is not a physical electricity supply contract. It operates as a 'contract for differences' (CfD) whereby the parties have agreed to a 'strike price'. If the NSW electricity spot price is higher than the strike price then the solar farm will pay the difference to the Company and vice versa if the spot price is lower than the strike price. The CfD is a derivative and is required to be fair valued at each reporting date with any movements recorded in the profit or loss.\n\nThe key inputs impacting the value of the derivative are the strike price, the contract period, forward NSW electricity spot prices (level 3 unobservable input), future estimates of the Group's share of solar output and the credit worthiness of the service provider. The 30 June 2023 PPA derivative receivable was valued at $13.4M (2022: receivable $42.3M). The fair value decreased due to lower forecast future spot electricity prices. The profit impact from a reasonably possible movement in spot electricity prices (+/- 10 %) is +/- $3.5M net of tax.\n\n## NZ electricity PPA\n\nIn May 2023 New Zealand Steel Limited (NZS) entered into an agreement with Contact Energy Limited to provide price certainty for a fixed amount of electricity from 1 December 2025 to 30 November 2035. No physical transfer of electricity will take place under the agreement which is structured as a CfD, whereby the parties have agreed a 'strike price' for a fixed quantity of electricity for a 10-year term. Where the spot price exceeds the strike price, Contact Energy will pay the difference to NZS and vice versa if the spot price is lower than the strike price.\n\nThe CfD has been designated in a hedging relationship against NZS's highly probable future electricity purchases with the CfD's fair value movements, that are deemed to be an effective hedge, being recognised in other comprehensive income until the forecast transactions occur in future. Any ineffective portion of the CfD's fair value movements is presented in profit or loss.\n\nThe key inputs impacting the value of the CfD are the strike price, the contract period, forward electricity spot prices (level 3 unobservable input) and the credit worthiness of the service provider. The 30 June 2023 CfD payable was valued at $20.8M. The fair value decreased primarily due to lower forecast future spot electricity prices. The profit impact from a reasonably possible movement in spot electricity prices (+/- 10 %) is +/- $10M net of tax.",

These valuations reference forward pricing using present value calculations. The forward price incorporates various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, and forward rate curves of the underlying commodity. The fair value of forward commodity exchange contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts are considered level 2 valuations (note 32.4) and the commodity royalty option is considered level 3.\n\n## 32.6  Recognition and measurement of derivatives\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognised assets and liabilities and highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges).\n\nThe relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking hedge transactions, is documented at the inception of the hedge transaction. The effectiveness of the derivatives in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items is assessed and documented on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nCumulative changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated in a cash flow hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income, to the extent that the movements are an effective hedge, and accumulated in the hedging reserve in equity. Any cumulative changes in the fair value of a derivative that are deemed to be ineffective are recognised immediately in profit or loss within other income or other expenses.\n\nAmounts accumulated in the hedging reserve are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. However, when a hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory or fixed assets) the gains and losses previously deferred in the hedging reserve are reclassified from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in profit or loss as cost of goods sold in the case of inventory, or as depreciation in the case of fixed assets.",

Gains and losses accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve are reclassified to profit or loss when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.\n\n## Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting\n\nCertain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss and are included in other income or other expenses.\n\n## Discontinuation of hedge accounting\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in the hedging reserve at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in the hedging reserve is immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## 33.

Giving a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2023 and of its consolidated financial performance for the year ended on that date; and\n- b. Complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001 .\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor ' s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board ' s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor ' s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial report.",

Carrying value of property, plant & equipment (PPE) and intangible assets (including goodwill)\n\n## Why significant\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nAs required by Australian Accounting Standards the Group annually tests goodwill for impairment and tests other non-current assets where indicators of impairment or impairment reversals exist, using a discounted cash flow model to estimate recoverable value.\n\nAt 30 June 2023, the Cash Generating Units (CGUs) with significant goodwill balances include North Star BlueScope Steel (goodwill balance of $1,205m), BlueScope Coated Products (goodwill balance of $356m) and Buildings North America (goodwill balance of $331m). The CGUs with a significant property, plant and equipment (PPE) balance are Australian Steel Products and North Star BlueScope Steel.\n\nAs disclosed in Note 14, the Group recorded an impairment charge during the financial year relating to PPE of the Building Products Malaysia CGU of $50m.\n\nThe carrying value of PPE and intangible assets, (including goodwill) was a key audit matter due to the significance of these balances, the complex judgements in the impairment assessment process such as forecast foreign exchange rates, steel, iron ore, coal pricing, domestic sales volumes, climate change and other sustainability related risks that are affected by future market or economic conditions.\n\nThe Group's disclosures are included in Note 14 of the financial report, which specifically explain the key assumptions used; and sensitivity of changes in the key assumptions which could give rise to an impairment loss of the PPE and intangible assets (including goodwill) balance, or impairment reversal on previously impaired PPE balances, in the future.\n\nOur audit procedures included assessing the appropriateness of the Group's determination of its CGUs where impairment testing was performed, taking into consideration the levels at which management monitors business performance and the interdependency of cash flows.\n\nIn respect of the Group's cashflow forecasts, for relevant CGUs, where indicators of impairment or impairment reversal were present or in CGUs that contained significant goodwill balances as at 30 June 2023, we:\n\n- \uf084 Assessed key assumptions such as forecast steel, iron ore and coal pricing, foreign exchange rates and domestic sales volumes in comparison to external independent data where relevant\n- \uf084 Assessed the Group's results in comparison to historical forecasts to assess forecast accuracy\n- \uf084 Compared future cash flows to approved budgets\n- \uf084 Assessed the Group's assumptions for long term growth rates in comparison to economic and industry forecasts\n- \uf084 Assessed the adequacy of capital expenditure forecasts\n- \uf084 Assessed discount rates through comparing the cost of capital for the Group with comparable businesses\n- \uf084 Assessed the Group's assumptions related to climate change risks, including consideration of the reformed Safeguard Mechanism in Australia, and capital expenditure and costs required to meet its committed decarbonisation plans\n- \uf084 Considered the indicative EBITDA multiples against comparable companies as a valuation cross check\n- \uf084 Tested the mathematical accuracy of the discounted cash flow model\n- \uf084 Assessed whether the required impairment expense was appropriately recorded in the financial statements.\n\nWhere considered necessary, we performed a sensitivity analysis in respect of the assumptions noted above which were considered to have the most significant impact on carrying values, to ascertain the extent of changes in those assumptions which either individually or collectively would be required for the PPE and intangible assets (including goodwill) to be impaired, or for a previous impairment to be reversed where applicable. We assessed the likelihood of these changes in assumptions arising.\n\nWe assessed the adequacy of the Group's disclosures of those assumptions to which the outcome of the impairment test is most sensitive, that is, those that have the most significant effect on the determination of the recoverable amount of PPE and intangible assets (including goodwill).",

Business Combinations\n\n## Why significant\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nOn 8 August 2022, the Group acquired a ferrous scrap steel processing business in Ohio, USA for consideration of $124m. The allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities was finalised during the period with a goodwill balance of $26m recognised.\n\nOn 17 December 2021 the Group acquired the ferrous scrap recycling business of Metal X LLC in the USA, for consideration of $307m. The allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities was finalised during the period with no change to the goodwill balance previously recognised.\n\nOn 28 June 2022, BlueScope acquired the Coil Coatings business in the USA for consideration of $696m. The allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities was finalised during the period with a goodwill balance of $333m recognised.\n\nAccounting for these transactions was complex, requiring judgement to be exercised to determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities assumed, including identifying and valuing intangible assets other than goodwill.\n\nFor each of the acquisitions we performed the following procedures:\n\n- \uf084 Read the purchase agreements to gain an understanding of the key terms and conditions and assessed whether the accounting treatment applied were in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards\n- \uf084 Assessed the determination of the total consideration paid.\n\nWhere applicable, with the involvement of our valuation specialists, we assessed the:\n\n- \uf084 Reasonableness of the valuation assumptions used by the Group's external experts in their determination of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities and the amount recognised as goodwill\n- \uf084 Competence, qualifications and objectivity of the external experts used by the Group to assist with determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired\n- \uf084 Recording of the fair values in the financial report.\n\nWe assessed the adequacy of the related financial report disclosures included at Note 21.\n\nDisclosure in relation to these acquisitions can be found at Note 21 of the financial report.\n\n## Information other than the financial report and auditor ' s report thereon\n\nThe directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Company ' s 2023 annual report, but does not include the financial report and our auditor ' s report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report and our related assurance opinion.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u25ba Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u25ba Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group ' s internal control.\n- \u25ba Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n- \u25ba Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors ' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group ' s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor ' s report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor ' s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u25ba Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.",
