As well as ensuring  that  strategic  decisions  are  taken  and  implemented effectively, it is based on a genuine balance of powers.\n\n## Unified governance, well suited to Kering's specific features\n\nKering has opted to combine the roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, taking the view that this governance arrangement is  the  one  that  best  suits  the  Group's specific features, in which each of its Houses have autonomy. The arrangement takes into account Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault's special position as controlling shareholder and his active involvement in conducting  the  Group's  business  affairs,  of  which  he  has  longstanding, in-depth operational knowledge.\n\n## The Lead Independent Director: ensuring the balance of powers within the governance structure and the smooth running of the Board\n\nWith a view to achieving a genuine balance of power on its Board, the Group takes steps to ensure that its membership is balanced, diverse and mostly independent.\n\nIn  addition,  given  that  the  roles  of  Chairman  of  the  Board  and Chief  Executive  Officer  are  combined  and  to  provide  additional assurance with regard to the Board's smooth running, in 2019 the Board of Directors created the role of Lead Independent Director.\n\nThe Lead Independent Director is consulted on the schedule of Board meetings and may propose additional agenda items to the Chairman.  He/she  liaises  between  the  independent  directors, other  Board  members  and  Executive  Management,  and  helps prevent  conflicts  of  interest  from  occurring.  He/she  monitors compliance with the Board's internal rules and takes part in the process of assessing the Board of Directors. In coordination with the Chairman of the Board, the Lead Independent Director also represents  the  Board  in  its  dealings  with  investors  concerning environmental, social and governance matters.\n\nThe  duties  of  the  Lead  Independent  Director  are  detailed  in section 1.4 of chapter 3 of this Document.\n\n## The Climate Change Lead: ensuring that climate issues are taken into account by the Board\n\nIn line with the Group's commitments in terms of climate action, the role of Climate Change Lead was created within the Board of Directors in 2022.\n\nIn  coordination  with  the  Chair  of  the  Sustainability  Committee and the Lead Independent Director, the Climate Change Lead's role includes ensuring that climate issues are considered by the Board as part of a long-term approach.\n\nThe duties of the Climate Change Lead are detailed in section 1.5 of chapter 3 of this Document.",

It  remains  vital  to  preserve heritage  and  offer  high-end  expertise,  but  this  is  not  enough. Consumers today want to express their unique individuality and our vision  of  Luxury  supports  this  radical  shift.  We  dare  to  take risks, think  differently,  and  constantly  propose  fresh  and innovative  ideas  that  inspire  emotion  and  enthusiasm  for  our exceptional  products,  as  well  as  allowing  all  clients  to  express their distinctive personality.\n\nWhat Kering and its Houses propose is an experience. Our values are  closely  related  to  the  powerful  creative  content  of  our products, which imbues them with modernity. Those values are\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our business model\n\n## A multi-brand model built on a long-term approach and creative autonomy for our Houses\n\nKering is a global Luxury group that manages the development of a  series  of  renowned  Houses  in  Fashion,  Leather  goods  and Jewelry:  Gucci,  Saint  Laurent,  Bottega  Veneta,  Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen, Brioni, Boucheron, Pomellato, DoDo, Qeelin, Ginori 1735, Kering Eyewear and Kering Beaut\u00e9.\n\nThanks  to  our  international  footprint  and  the  strength  of  our Houses combined with the creative autonomy they enjoy and the unique  quality  of  our  creations,  Kering  is  among  the  foremost players  in  the  luxury  goods  market.  The  numerous  initiatives being  undertaken  by  our  Houses  are  making  them  yet  more attractive  and  exclusive,  and  are  laying  the  foundations  for sustained, profitable growth.\n\n\"Our multi-brand approach is built on a long-term vision and combines agility, balance and responsibility\"\n\n## AGILITY\n\n## Kering provides its Houses with an organizational structure that unlocks their potential for excellence\n\n## \u00b7   Continuity\n\nKering began as a family company more than 60 years ago and is now  controlled  by  Artemis,  a  holding  company  owned  by  the Pinault  family.  Thanks  to  this  strong  and  stable  shareholder, Kering boasts an attractive and sustainable profile conducive to developing  its  vision  in  the  luxury  goods  market  over  the  longterm.\n\n## \u00b7 Transformation\n\nFrom a conglomerate of diversified retail activities until the early 2000s, Kering has transformed itself into a Luxury group focusing on  personal  goods.  We  are  now  an  integrated  group  bringing together  and  developing  some  of  the  world's  most  prestigious Houses.  We  are  also  committed  to  expanding  in  business segments  that  are  adjacent  to  the  Luxury  industry  and  show strong growth potential, such as Eyewear and Beauty.\n\n## \u00b7   Clarity\n\nKering helps its Houses realize their full growth potential. At each stage of their development, they benefit from innovative logistics platforms,  digital  services  and  technological  infrastructure,  and common support functions. By encouraging imagination in all its forms, our organization fosters strict management while enabling our Houses to unleash the best of their talent and creativity. The Group ensures that the brands' success is aligned with their longterm visions and objectives. Thanks to our curiosity, capacity for self-reflection and big-picture thinking, we can achieve the clarity necessary to set a successful course for the Group and its Houses.\n\ncomplemented by the entrepreneurial spirit that permeates each of  our  brands and by the vision of our creative teams. Kering is made  up  of  women  and  men  who  strive  each  day  to  create authentic, ever-changing, engaged and inclusive Luxury.\n\n## Kering = Caring\n\nWe  want  to  play  our  part  in  the  emergence  of  a  more environmentally  friendly  world.  We  are  constantly  raising  our creative and production standards to ensure greater traceability and respect for the planet while at the same time having positive social  impacts.  We  aim  to  create  value  that  is  equitably distributed among all our stakeholders.\n\nKering  is  pronounced  ''caring'',  which  is  much  more  than  a simple allusion - it gives meaning to everything we do.\n\n## Strong business performance\n\nKering is a Group focused exclusively on Luxury. It has several Houses that have achieved critical mass in the luxury industry, along with some jewels of the future.These two characteristics make it highly profitable and cash-generative, and its financial strength is a genuine growth driver for its brands.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Following our successful transformation into a leading luxury  goods  player,  we  boast  some  of  the  industry's  most prestigious Houses. They complement each other well with their distinctive  market positions, and each play a role in a coherent ensemble.\n\n## \u00b7   A multi-brand model\n\n## \u00b7   An ensemble of complementary Houses\n\nWhile  our  most  firmly  established  Houses  are  reinventing themselves and engaging with their audiences in new ways, our other  brands  are  focused  on  realizing  their  full  potential  and gaining  new  clients.  As  a  result,  due  to  the  variety  of  its customers,  products,  brands  and  locations,  as  well  as  its balanced geographical positions, Kering is well placed to weather changes in market conditions and seize growth opportunities.\n\nWe use our strength as a Group to help forge a distinctive identity for  each  House.  Our  brands  find  ways  to  express  their  unique characters.  The  Group  supports  the  brands  by  providing expertise,  exercising  its  power  as  a  group  to  exert  influence, improving  supply  chain  reliability  and  opening  up  access  to distribution networks, as well as enhancing the client experience, especially  in  digital  channels.  It  also  encourages  the  Houses  to share best practice with a view to driving innovation.\n\n## \"Our business model is built on exceptional Houses with complementary market positions and varying degrees of maturity\"\n\n## RESPONSIBILITY\n\n## All our operations are founded on a responsible economic model. Our comprehensive, sustainable approach is a structural competitive advantage.\n\n## \u00b7   Toward sustainable Luxury\n\nCan a responsible economic approach change the very nature of Luxury?  For  Kering,  the  answer  is  a  resounding  \"yes\".  For  our Houses, sustainability is in line with our vision of modern Luxury. Businesses  have  an  ethical  obligation  to  be  more  responsible, reflecting  society's  new  expectations. This situation can also be viewed as an opportunity to grow, and is a source of inspiration and innovation. Methods, materials, resources and products are being  reinvented,  and  client  usage  and  expectations  are changing. Kering is changing the way it designs luxury products by  incorporating  the  criterion  of  sustainable  value,  for  our customers as well as for society. The targets identified to improve the Group's social and environmental performance are detailed in chapter 4 (\"Sustainability\") of the present document.\n\n## \u00b7   An inclusive approach\n\nThe  aim  of  the  responsible  model  is  to  rethink  Kering's relationships  with  its  stakeholders  to  ensure  fairness  and responsibility.  Affecting  all  dimensions  of  Kering's  ecosystem, from the Group's strategy and the Houses' creative decisions to operational production, processing and distribution choices, the model aims to reduce the social and environmental impacts of the Group's operations. Placing people at the heart of the model brings  an  entrepreneurial  spirit,  engaging  employees  and stakeholders.\n\n## \u00b7   Creative potential\n\nResponsibility is deeply embedded in the Group's organizational structure  and  promotes  business  growth  through  ever  more innovative  and  attractive  products.  It  is  prompting  us  to modernize  our  production  processes  and  closely  control  all aspects  of  our  value  chain.  In  a  context  of  limited  natural resources,  new  high-quality  materials  are  being  fashioned  and more  sustainable  processes  devised.  We  are  constantly  on  the lookout  for  innovative  and  disruptive  technologies.  For  our brands, this represents a vast expanse of creative territory yet to be explored.\n\n## \u00b7   Governance and ethics\n\nBuilt  on  the  Group's  core  values,  Kering's  responsible  model leverages  an  ambitious  governance  structure.  Our  governance was  further  strengthened  in  2023  by  the  appointment  of  two Deputy  CEOs,  one  in  charge  of  Brand  Development  and  one  in charge  of  Operations  and  Finance.  Reporting  to  the  Board  of Directors and taking their lead from its Sustainability Committee, they drive the Group's sustainability strategy, which the Houses put  into  action  every  day  under  the  guidance  of  dedicated experts.  The  Group's  Ethics  Committees,  Compliance  structure and  whistleblowing  procedure  for  employees  and  third  parties ensure that Kering's Code of Ethics and principles for responsible business conduct are properly applied.\n\n\"Being a responsible Luxury group means crafting the Luxury of tomorrow - we perceive change as an opportunity and a positive prospect for our growth\"\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the coming years, the Group will continue to strengthen and sustain its growth momentum.\n\n## Promoting organic growth\n\n## \u00b7   Increasing market share in an industry set to deliver growth in the medium and long-term\n\nThe future of the Luxury goods market is fundamentally bright. The  growth  of  emerging  economies,  the  development  of  new audiences  that  are  culturally  open  to  global  brands  and  the increasing  use  of  new  technologies  are  major  sources  of  value creation  for  Kering.  The  challenge  for  each  of  our  Houses  is  to outperform its respective market.\n\n## \u00b7   Creativity at our core\n\nEnergized by their creative teams, our Houses are setting trends. Backed by the Group, they are constantly coming up with fresh ideas and creations that appeal to their customers' desire, inspire their  dreams  and  tap  into  their  emotions.  This  approach  to creativity  is  built  on  our  Houses'  heritage  and  the  iconic  codes that  form  part  of  their  history.  We  are  proud  of  this  alliance between contemporary creativity and timeless heritage.\n\n## \u00b7 Making our Houses more exclusive\n\nWith  their  unique  heritage  and  creativity,  Kering's  Houses  have considerably raised their profile and enhanced their desirability, and have therefore achieved significant revenue growth over the last  10  years.  They  are  now  substantial  in  scale,  and  intend  to become more exclusive.\n\nThis  \"brand  elevation\"  strategy  starts  with  product  design, paying particular attention to the quality of materials and knowhow, and allows our Houses to develop an upscale offering that complements existing ranges. The strategy is implemented at the marketing stage by gaining ever greater control over distribution and  by  gradually  upgrading  directly  operated  stores.  It  is accompanied by a quest for excellence and greater personalization  as  regards  the  customer  experience.  These initiatives  are  supported  and  amplified  by  investments  in communications and events.\n\n## \u00b7 Achieving excellence in terms of the customer experience\n\nOffering high quality products and customer experience through our  distribution  network  is  vital.  Supporting  customers  before, during  and  after  sales  are  made  -  in  stores  or  online  -  is  what enables  our  Houses  to  create  and  sustain  lasting  connections.\n\nA  personalized  customer  experience  helps  make  each  client interaction  unique.  The  decisions  to  have  in-house  customer relations and e-commerce  platforms, to speed up the development  of  distance  selling  tools  and  to  increase  the proportion  of  sales  coming  from  retail  stores  we  control,  were guided by the same aim.\n\n## \u00b7   Sales efficiency\n\nOur  Houses  generated  78%  of  their  revenue  from  their  own distribution networks (stores and e-commerce sites) in 2023. By having greater control over our own distribution, we can provide the best possible customer service. Our brands deploy initiatives to boost sales performance, capitalizing on increasingly effective merchandizing and in-store operational excellence, supported by the Group and its dedicated teams. Optimizing same-store sales performance on an ongoing basis is a key organic growth driver for Kering.\n\n## \u00b7   Omnichannel approach\n\nOur  customers  are  connected  and  mobile,  constantly  moving between  distribution  channels,  from  digital  platforms  to  brickand-mortar  stores  and  vice-versa.  Our  customer  relations strategy  is  epitomized  by  continuity  across  all  communication and distribution channels. This holistic omnichannel approach is supported by the directly operated store network, which is being selectively  extended,  and  by  distribution  agreements,  travel retail, e-commerce, social media and digital communication.\n\n## \u00b7   Digital expertise, CRM and innovation\n\nA  number of  projects  have  been  set  up  to  support  Kering  in  its digital  transformation  and  drive  forward  its  e-commerce,  CRM, data  science  and  innovation  activities.  Our  Digital  and  Client Relations team is developing One-to-Many, One-to-Few and Oneto-One  tools  that  are  improving  the  customer  experience  and customer  service.  We  are  using  artificial  intelligence  to  make better  predictions  in  our  production  planning.  The  Group's Innovation  team  is  continuing  to  instill  an  internal  culture  of innovation  and  work  on  disruptive  technologies  to  enrich  our business models and support our sustainability efforts.\n\n\"Digital is simultaneously accelerating and deepening our relationships with our clients, allowing us to offer them an exceptional shopping experience\"\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our brands benefit from Group-wide synergies while preserving their unique characters and exclusivity.\n\n## \u00b7 Resource pooling\n\nOur  Houses  share  certain  support  functions,  allowing  them  to concentrate on what really counts: creativity, production quality, product range development and renewal, client relations, as well as brand  and  product  communication.  The  Group  pools resources  and  streamlines  certain  strategic  functions  such  as logistics, indirect purchasing, legal affairs, property, accounting, media  relations,  IT  and  the  development  of  new  tools  (in particular  with  respect  to  the  omnichannel  approach).  Relieved of this burden, our Houses can focus their energy on creativity.\n\n## \u00b7 Cross-business expertise\n\nIn order to enrich its brands' offerings, the Group draws on crossbusiness  expertise.  A  notable  success  story  in  this  domain  is Kering Eyewear, which has been developed internally since 2014. Our Houses benefit from having a dedicated specialist entity that ensures full control over the value chain in their eyewear frame and  sunglasses  businesses,  comprising  creation,  development, supply  chain,  brand  strategy,  marketing  and  distribution.  Our eyewear  unit  has  been  strengthened  by  the  acquisitions  of Lindberg  and  Maui  Jim  in  the  last  two  years.  The  creation  of Kering Beaut\u00e9 will enable the Group to develop expertise in the Beauty segment and help its brands develop this category, while taking  advantage  of  acquisition  opportunities.  The  Group  also stepped up its ambitions last year with the acquisition of Creed, giving it significant scale and a growth platform.\n\n## \u00b7 Growth platforms and operating efficiency\n\nKering is constantly improving and adapting its operating model to  ensure  that  its  structures  are  ever  more  up-to-date  and\n\nflexible. The  Group  has  been  rolling  out  an  ambitious transformation  project  focusing  on  its  information  systems, supply chain and logistics. The aim is to adapt these functions to the Group's new scope, as well as to changing consumer trends and  client  expectations.  With  shared  IT  systems  and  redefined logistics operations  that  include  the  construction  of  new warehouses  in  the  United  States  (2019),  Italy  (2020-2021),  Asia (Singapore  in  2022)  and  the  Middle  East  (Dubai  in  2023),  the Group's brands will be in a better position to anticipate demand, respond more quickly and adapt their inventory management in order to optimize costs.\n\n## \u00b7 Talent excellence\n\nWe pay particular attention to the professional development and fulfillment of the women and men working for the Group. Based on  ever-greater  mobility,  our  ambitious  worldwide  human resources strategy facilitates the growth of the Houses through a shared  pool  of  talented  individuals,  expertise  and  excellence. Kering  helps  employees  reach  their  potential  and  express  their creativity  by  developing  skills  and  performance,  as  well  as  by offering aspirational development opportunities.\n\nOur policy of promoting diversity, gender parity and inclusiveness is a source of collective intelligence and enrichment. It also lies at the heart of equal opportunities actions and initiatives taken by the Group.\n\nKering pays particular attention to the role of women, who make up  the  majority  of  our  employees  and  clients.  Internal  systems are  in  place  to  guarantee  gender  equality,  as  evidenced  by  our ambitious  global  parental  policy.  The  Kering  Foundation  is committed to combating violence against women and children. Women In Motion , finally, shines a light on women in the arts and culture, since 2015.\n\n## \"The Group strives to create value for its Houses and is geared to unlocking their creative potential\"\n\n## Strengthening the Group's position in the Luxury industry through targeted, strategic acquisitions and partnerships\n\n## \u00b7 Development of the brand portfolio in the Group's established categories\n\nOver  the  years,  Kering  has  developed  a  powerful  portfolio  of dominant  Fashion  &  Leather  Goods  and  Jewelry  brands,  partly through  acquisitions.  In  2023,  Kering  acquired  a  30%  stake  in iconic Italian house Valentino, a byword for beauty and elegance, whose standing  in  the  field  of  Haute  Couture  is  recognized  the world  over.  Kering  has  an  option  to  increase  its  stake  to  100% between now and 2028.\n\n## \u00b7 Kering's  expansion  in  new  categories  of  Luxury  with  major value creation potential\n\nKering  wants  to  take  advantage  of  growth  opportunities  in  its sector  and  adjacent  business  areas.  The  acquisition  of  Creed  in 2023,  a  leading  high-end  luxury  fragrance  brand,  marks  an important  milestone  in  the  Group's  ambitions  in  the  Beauty segment. This is a natural extension of its Houses' universe and one that offers significant long-term potential for value creation.",

However, after a very good first half, there was a significant slowdown in the second half of the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2023: a two-speed year\n\nExperts  and  analysts  estimate  that  the  luxury  market  grew around  8-11% (1) in  2023  compared  to  2022  at  constant exchange rates.\n\n- \u00b7 The first half of 2023 brought robust growth of around 17% at constant exchange rates. That was driven in particular by the reopening  of  the  Chinese  market,  at  a  time  when  demand from US customers was decelerating after several very strong years.\n- \u00b7 Market growth slowed in the third quarter, due in particular to  a  higher  base  for  comparison in China. In addition, local demand fell in most regions of the world because of inflation and  macroeconomic uncertainty,  and  the  deceleration  was particularly visible in Europe. Spending by travelers also fell, particularly  among  Americans  in  Europe.  These  trends continued into the fourth quarter, leading to more moderate growth of 4% for the second half as a whole.\n- \u00b7 Chinese  consumers  made  a  very  large  contribution  to  the luxury industry's growth in 2023. Despite a mixed macroeconomic  environment  in  China,  local  demand rebounded  significantly,  although  from  a  less  challenging base  in  the  second  and  fourth  quarters.  The  number  of Chinese  people  traveling  abroad  gradually  recovered, particularly  to  Asian  destinations,  although  the  upturn  in those traveling to Europe was limited by ongoing constraints related to airline capacity, the time required to obtain visas and rising travel and overall trip costs.\n- \u00b7 Japan  saw  double-digit  growth,  driven  by  Asian  tourists attracted by favorable price differentials.\n- \u00b7 In 2023, the ultra-premium segment continued to outperform  the  aspirational  segment,  which  is  more sensitive to the macroeconomic environment.\n- \u00b7 Growth  was  driven  to  a  large  extent  by  directly  operated stores:  sales  taking  place  through  third-party  distributors and online suffered, partly because they are more exposed to the more aspirational segment.\n\n(1)",

Uncertainty  related  to  geopolitical events  and  the  US  presidential  election,  along  with  the crisis in China's real-estate market, are factors that require ongoing  attention.  A  recovery  in  the  consumption  of services,  which  are  also  being  affected  by  inflation,  could adversely  affect  the  consumption  of  goods.  Finally,  price increases  for  luxury  goods  are  expected  to  be  smaller  in 2024.\n- \u00b7 In  the  circumstances,  experts  and  analysts  expect  the Luxury sector to see growth of 1-7%, less than in the last three years. They agree that the first half of the year is likely to  be  more  difficult  than  the  second.  The  most  optimistic scenarios involve an upturn in the second half, supported by significant interest-rate cuts and considerably stronger growth in Chinese people traveling abroad, particularly to Europe.\n\nExperts expect the luxury market to grow at a rate of 5-7% per  year  over  the  medium  to  long-term  (source:  BainAltagamma, Euromonitor), driven by four major trends:\n\n- \u00b7 the  development  of  an  urban  middle  class  in  emerging countries;\n- \u00b7 growth in local and tourist customer bases;\n- \u00b7 a larger number of wealthy individuals and an increase in the value of their assets;\n- \u00b7 the appeal of the value proposition offered by luxury goods brands.\n\nExperts  emphasize  that  the  sector's  best  performers  have built  the  reputation  of  their  Houses  over  a  long  period  and have  reinforced  entry  barriers  through  heavy  investment, along with increasing vertical integration. Those players will be the ones best able to deal with constant changes in the sector, particularly as regards:\n\n- \u00b7 growing  demand  for  personalization  in  terms  of  the customer  relationship  and  experience  through  the  use  of more sophisticated CRM tools;\n- \u00b7 the  challenge  of  generating  loyalty  among  domestic customers;\n- \u00b7 greater demand for transparency and social and environmental responsibility.",

The Luxury goods market has historically been fragmented, but is now characterized by the presence of a few large global players, often  part  of  multi-brand  groups,  as  well  as  a  large  number  of smaller  independent  players.  These  various  players  compete  in several segments, which differ in terms of both product category and geographic location.\n\nKering  operates  alongside  the  most  prominent  global  Luxury groups:  LVMH,  Richemont,  Herm\u00e8s,  Chanel  and  Prada.  One  key feature  in  2023  was  the  strong  relative  performance  of  the  VIC (Very Important Consumer) segment, which was less exposed to inflationary  pressure  and  the  deteriorating  macroeconomic environment.

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Apparel\n\nApparel represented between 21% and 27% of the luxury market in 2023. The difference between the upper and lower ends of this estimate  results  from  differences  in  price  ranges  taken  into account  in  the  analyses.  2023  confirmed  customers'  renewed interest  in  clothing  to  be  worn  at  special  events  and  parties  formalwear and casual chic - and China's reopening also had a positive  impact.  All  Kering  couture  and  leather  goods  Houses operate in the Apparel category, especially Gucci, Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, and to a lesser extent Bottega Veneta, while Brioni operates in the menswear segment.\n\n## Leather goods\n\nThe revenue generated by Leather goods in 2023 is estimated at \u20ac75-80  billion,  representing  21%  of  the  total  Luxury  goods market.  This  category  covers  all  leather  products,  such  as handbags,  luggage  and  small  leather  goods  (wallets,  purses, etc.). The leather goods category has been moving more upscale in  recent  years,  and  sales  have  been  boosted  by  the  resulting changes in the product mix and prices. However, experts expect this  phenomenon  to  be  less  pronounced  in  the  next  few  years. Kering  operates  in  this  category  primarily  through  the  Gucci, Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta brands and, to a lesser extent, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen.\n\n## Shoes\n\nRevenue  in  this  category  is  estimated  at  \u20ac30  billion.  Growth  in sales of formal footwear such as black shoes (loafers and hybrid boots)  and  pumps  stabilized  after  very  strong  performance  in 2022. The sneakers segment continued to underperform. Kering operates  in  this  category  primarily  through  the  Gucci,  Saint Laurent,  Bottega  Veneta,  Balenciaga  and  Alexander  McQueen brands.\n\n## Watches\n\nIn 2022, the Watches category recovered strongly, with revenue of around \u20ac50 billion,  and  significantly  closed  its  growth  gap  with the other categories. In 2023, it accounted for around 15% of the Luxury  goods  market.  Kering  operates  in  this  category  across different  price  points,  particularly  via  Gucci  Timepieces  and Boucheron.\n\n## IV. Sales by region and nationality\n\n## Sales by region\n\nSince 2021, the American continent has established itself as the world's  largest  luxury  consumer  goods  market,  overtaking Europe.  However,  growth  in  the  American  market  has  slowed since the end of 2022, and the deceleration became more marked in early 2023.\n\n## Jewelry\n\nIt remains difficult to estimate the scale of this category because it  is  dominated  by  independent  producers.  This  is  why  it  is  the category  in  which  experts'  estimates  vary  the  most.  Overall, however, 2023 was a good year for Jewelry, which was buoyed by the creativity of producers and the investment value of the items they  make.  Major  names  -  specialist  jewelry  brands  and  the jewelry ranges of couture and leather goods houses - continued to gain market share from independents, a trend that has been in place  for  more  than  a  decade  now.  Kering  operates  in  this category  primarily  through  Boucheron,  Pomellato,  DoDo  and Qeelin.  Its  Couture  Houses,  particularly  Gucci,  offer  products ranging  from  costume  jewelry  to  high  jewelry  pieces.  Saint Laurent launched its first fine jewelry collection, while Bottega Veneta's range of costume jewelry was a big hit in 2023.\n\n## Perfumes & Cosmetics\n\nThis  category  has  estimated  revenue  of  \u20ac56-72  billion.  On February  3,  2023,  Kering  announced  the  creation  of  Kering Beaut\u00e9  in  order  to  develop  its  Beauty  expertise  for  Bottega Veneta,  Balenciaga,  Alexander  McQueen,  Pomellato and Qeelin. Beauty  is  a  natural  extension  of  Kering's  Luxury  universe.  On June 26, 2023, Kering also announced the acquisition of Creed, an established  high-end  luxury  fragrance  House.  The  high-end luxury  fragrance  segment  was  worth  an  estimated  \u20ac5  billion  in 2022  according  to  Bain  and  is  growing  rapidly,  with  growth expected to average 15% per year between 2022 and 2026.\n\nKering  also  operates  in  the  Perfumes  &  Cosmetics  category through  licensing  agreements  with  certain  leading  industry players,  such  as  L'Or\u00e9al,  Coty  and  Interparfums,  for  its  Saint Laurent, Gucci and Boucheron brands.\n\n## Other (eyewear, textile accessories, etc.)\n\nThe  global  eyewear  market  is  estimated  to  be  worth  around \u20ac130 billion (at retail prices) according to Euromonitor data. The industry comprises several product segments including spectacles,  contact  lenses,  sunglasses  and  other  products. Euromonitor estimates annual sales in the luxury eyewear subsegment at \u20ac20 billion. In 2023, the category continued to make progress. Kering Eyewear is positioned as a leading player in the strategically  important  high-end  eyewear  segment,  with  a comprehensive,  balanced  portfolio  comprising  brands  such  as Gucci,  Cartier,  Ala\u00efa,  Alexander  McQueen,  Balenciaga,  Bottega Veneta,  Brioni,  Chlo\u00e9,  Dunhill,  Montblanc,  Saint  Laurent  and Puma.  The  eyewear  market  is  gradually  consolidating  through acquisitions:  for  example,  Kering  added  to  its  eyewear  brand portfolio in 2021 by acquiring Denmark's Lindberg and in 2022 by acquiring Maui Jim.\n\nOverall,  the  products  that  make  up  this  \"Other\"  category represent revenue of \u20ac25 billion.\n\nAlthough the European market was resilient in 2022 and the first half of 2023, it has seen a sharp slowdown since the third quarter of 2023. Local consumer spending has been affected by inflation and higher interest rates. Tourist numbers also fell relative to the previous year, particularly among those traveling from America, although  from  a  very  high  base.  In  addition,  the  increase  in Chinese tourist numbers was smaller than initially predicted.\n\nJapan, meanwhile, posted strong growth, underpinned mainly by Asian tourists attracted by large price differentials.",

        "page_content": "In mainland China, the situation was positive but mixed, and the base  for  comparison  varied  because  of  the  \"zero-Covid\"  policy adopted  the  previous  year.  While  the  first  half  of  2023  brought strong growth from a low base, growth in the third quarter was significantly  lower  because  of  a  high  base  for  comparison. Because China's lockdown measures peaked in December 2022, the base for comparison then fell again in the fourth quarter.\n\n## Worldwide luxury market: estimated breakdown by region in 2023\n\n## (2)\n\n(in \u20ac billions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## V. Distribution channels\n\n## Retail channel\n\nIn 2023, the retail channel accounted for 52% of in-person sales in the  worldwide  personal  luxury  goods  market,  higher  than  the 2022 figure of 50%. For the first time, therefore, the majority of the  market's  sales  came  through  the  retail  channel.  A  solid network of directly operated stores is crucial to a luxury brand's success, since it strengthens its relationship with end-consumers, gives  it  control  over  its  commercial  offering  and  allows  it  to safeguard its brand image.\n\nKering's Houses generate a much larger proportion of their sales from  the  retail  channel  (78%  in  2023).  This  is  due  to  Kering's strategic  aim  of  giving  its  customers  the  best  possible  service, and also reflects the critical mass of its brands and their exposure to  Leather  Goods,  a  category  in  which  brands  control  their distribution more tightly.\n\n## Wholesale channel\n\nThe  wholesale  channel  mainly  consists  of  department  stores, independent  high-end  multi-brand  stores  and  franchise  stores, and  accounted  for  approximately  48%  of  the  total  worldwide personal  luxury  goods  market  in  2023.  This  channel  usually accounts  for  a  larger  percentage  of  sales  in  the  Ready-to-Wear and Watches categories, and for brands at an early stage of their development.\n\n## Sales by nationality\n\nIn  2023,  China's  reopening  boosted  growth  in  spending  by Chinese consumers, who accounted for 22-24% of luxury goods sales,  five  percentage  points  more  than  in  2022.  However, Chinese  consumers  show  further  growth  potential  in  2024, particularly  due  to  the  expected  increase  in  the  number  of Chinese tourists visiting Asia and Western Europe.\n\nAmerican consumers' share of total sales fell by three points in 2023  relative  to  the  previous  year,  while  that  of  European consumers was down one point.\n\n## Worldwide luxury market: (2)\n\nestimated breakdown by nationality in 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nnationalities\n\nFor Kering's Houses, the wholesale channel (which also includes other  revenues)  accounted  for  22%  of  revenue  in  2023.  That proportion has fallen in recent years due to the Group's strategy of increasing its control over distribution and working with fewer partners.\n\n## E-commerce\n\nIn 2023, online sales underperformed sales in physical stores and made up 20% of the Luxury market, compared to 21% in 2022. This includes sales made through brand websites (retail channel) and via department store websites and e-tailers (wholesale).\n\nKering's Houses manage their e-commerce sites directly. In 2021 and  2022,  they  took  greater  control  in  terms  of  multi-brand distribution,  moving  away  from  wholesale  models  and  toward e -concession models. In 2023, online sales accounted for around 12% of retail sales on average, three points less than in 2022.",

The House's timeless  appeal  lies  in  its  Italian  heritage  and  its  positioning  at the intersection of fashion and luxury.\n\nGucci represents the pinnacle of Italian artisanal excellence, and its  designs  are  renowned  for  their  extremely  high  quality  and attention  to  detail.  Gucci  has  a  history  stretching  back  over 100  years  and  it  is  constantly  redefining  Luxury  by  focusing  on creativity and innovation through its collections of ready-to-wear women's,  men's,  kids'  leather  goods,  shoes,  bags,  jewelry, watches, home d\u00e9cor, and more.\n\nGucci  strategically  balances  Fashion  and  Luxury  in  its  product portfolio, showcasing a range that includes both entry-level and high-end  creations.  The  House's  commitment  to  expansion encompasses  core  categories,  including  travel  and  the  iconic handbag  lines.  Rooted  in  its  history  as  a  Leather  goods  brand, Gucci  demonstrates  a  steadfast  commitment  to  preserving  and elevating its rich heritage.\n\nIn recent years, Gucci has significantly streamlined both its offline and  online  wholesale  presence  while  maintaining  strategic partnerships through concessions. Its network comprises 538  directly  operated  stores,  together  with  selected  specialty stores  and  franchises.  Its  digital  footprint  mainly  consists  of  its website,  active  in  36  markets,  along  with  a  limited  number  of digital concessions.\n\n## Key highlights 2023\n\nGucci's  2023  strategy  enhances  the  core  fundamentals  of  the business.  The  House  continued  to  expand  its  reach  among upscale  clients,  maintaining  a  healthy  demographic  mix  across generations.\n\nThe  physical  store  network  expanded  through  a  consistent program of refurbishments, focusing on key flagship stores such as those  in  London  (New  Bond  Street)  and  Milan  (Via Montenapoleone).  At  the  same  time,  Gucci  strengthened  its  ecommerce operations in key countries. The House also enhanced omnichannel  services  to  create  more  seamless  customer journeys, attracting more remote customers through Gucci 9, its global  client  service,  and  opening  Gucci  9  offices  in  China. Additionally, efforts were made to expand in-store digital services and implement Collect In-Store.\n\nCreativity  remains  the  cornerstone  of  the  brand  under  the guidance of the new Creative Director, Sabato De Sarno. De Sarno adeptly  draws  upon  the  House's  rich  heritage  and  iconic  codes while  strengthening  its  position  of  authority  in  fashion,  luxury and  Florentine  identity.  A  noteworthy  illustration  is  De  Sarno's debut collection, Gucci Ancora: marked by a keen sensibility for contemporary culture and fashion, it remains loyal to the brand's illustrious history, embracing heritage codes.\n\n(1)\n\nThe  House  invests  in  preserving  craftsmanship  and  enhancing product  quality  while  promoting  creativity  in  all  its  product segments,  currently  developing  a  long-term  elevation  concept that extends beyond the raw materials used in collections. This concept  covers  project  including  exclusive  events,  customer experiences, and brand experiences. In Florence, Gucci ArtLab is poised  to  play  a  pivotal  role  in  this  initiative,  serving  as  a futuristic hub  dedicated  to  the  in-house  prototyping  and sampling  of  the  House's  leather  goods  and  shoes,  seamlessly blending tradition with innovation. In addition, the Gucci Atelier in Novara brings creative visions to life, with its talented fashion designers  and  craftspeople,  developing  pieces  and  creating designs for the brand's ready-to-wear collections.\n\nGucci Equilibrium embodies the House's dedication to fostering positive change with strong, enduring environmental and social sustainability  strategies.  The  House  is  dedicated  to  advancing transparency, accountability, and circular innovation by conscientiously minimizing Gucci's environmental impact. Social commitments include promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion. In  2023,  Gucci  became  the  first  Italian  House  to  obtain  the Certification for Gender Parity voluntarily, covering key indicators such as culture, governance, human resources, opportunities for women, gender pay equity, and parenting support.\n\nGucci's rich heritage was also prominently displayed in the 2023 campaign schedule, anchoring Gucci's legacy in a tradition that continues to inspire generations. Gucci highlighted iconic pieces such as its Jackie 1961, Horsebit 1955, and Bamboo 1947, along with  the  signature  Horsebit  1953  loafer,  while  introducing  its second  Gucci  Valigeria  campaign.  The  House's  102-year-long history  was  further  encapsulated  in  the  exhibition  itineraries  of Gucci Cosmos and Gucci Visions, offering historical explorations that provided a visual journey encompassing both tradition and innovation.\n\nThroughout the year, Gucci made significant adjustments to its operating model, including strengthening its corporate governance  and  overhauling  the  management  of  its  creative studios.  The  House  appointed  a  new  President  and  Chief Executive  Officer,  a  new  Chief  Brand  Officer  in  charge  of  brand and  customer  engagement,  and  a  new  Chief  Industrial Operations and Supply Chain Officer.\n\nFor  2024  and  beyond,  the  House  is  poised  to  elevate  Luxury quality, exclusivity, and fashion creativity, thereby solidifying the brand's long-term presence. Seizing this opportunity, Gucci aims to  fortify  business  fundamentals  and  streamline  processes  for enhanced  efficiency.  This  initiative  includes  strengthening  the new  operating  model  to  consolidate  leadership  in  the  Luxury industry,  achieve  its  ambitions (1) and  ensure  sustainable  longterm growth.",

        "page_content": "## Business concept and strategy\n\nFounded in 1961 by Yves Saint Laurent, the House is one of the most  prominent  and  influential  fashion  names  in  the  world. Originally a House of Haute Couture, Saint Laurent revolutionized the way fashion and society merge and interact in 1966 with the introduction  of  pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter,  high-end  ready-to-wear  produced on a larger scale than the exclusive collections.\n\nSince  then,  in  addition  to  women's  and  men's  ready  to  wear, Saint Laurent's  offering  has  expanded  to  include  shoes, handbags,  small  leather  goods,  jewelry,  scarves,  ties  and eyewear,  defining  a  unique  highly  desirable  and  contemporary silhouette.\n\nUnder  the  creative  vision  of  Anthony  Vaccarello  and  the leadership  of  Francesca  Bellettini,  Saint  Laurent  has  built  very strong  foundations  for  sustainable,  long-term  growth.  Much  of the House's success stems from its uncompromising approach to creativity,  quality  and  craftsmanship.  With  clear  and  distinctive codes  expressed  in  continually  compelling  collections,  Saint Laurent has become one of the most desired houses in Luxury.\n\n## Key highlights 2023\n\nIn  2023,  Saint  Laurent  continued  to  build  on  its  heritage  while capturing the zeitgeist, without ever compromising its image or position.\n\nThe House further extended its store network: net of closures, it added  28  new  stores  around  the  world,  including  the  brand's largest flagship on the Avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es in Paris. That store features a new concept that reflects the brand's elevation strategy and offers customers a one-of-a-kind luxury experience.\n\nConsistent  with  its  focus  on  retail,  Saint  Laurent  further rationalized wholesale distribution in the United States and EMEA in  2023,    focusing  on  the  most  qualitative  partners.  The  House has thus reinforced the exclusivity and quality of its distribution, guaranteeing  the  integrity  of  the  brand  while  facilitating optimized management of its assortment.\n\nThrough  its  network  of  308  directly  operated  stores  as  of December 31, 2023, along with its digital platforms and carefully selected wholesale clients, Saint Laurent competes globally with the  most  exclusive  houses.  Retail  excellence  and  strong  client relationships have been strategic priorities for Saint Laurent for many years.  With  a  new  architectural  vision  for  its  retail  stores introduced  in  2023,  the  House  will  further  enhance  the  client experience.\n\nAs part of its strategy to take full internal control of prototyping and  product  development,  Saint  Laurent  opened  the Atelier Maroquinerie , a new 28,700 square-meter (or 309,000 square feet) Centre of Excellence for accessories and leather goods. Located in Scandicci, Florence, the Atelier will be home to Saint Laurent's full  array  of  research  and  development  activities,  encouraging innovation in terms of materials and components used to create pieces  that  express  the  timeless  heritage  and  contemporary appeal.\n\nThe gradual return of international travel had a favorable impact on  store  footfall  in  some  regions  in  2023.  Saint  Laurent's  client advisors  treat  each  visitor  as  a  regular  customer,  helping  to generate  loyalty  and  engagement  among  both  locals  and tourists.\n\nWith  the  opening  of  the  Atelier  Maroquinerie  in  Scandicci, Florence, Saint Laurent further demonstrated its commitment to sustainability,  bringing  new  life  to  a  long-abandoned  building and regenerating the local area.\n\nSaint  Laurent  expanded  its  cultural  reach  and  impact  in  2023 with  a  series  of  exhibitions  and  collaborations  with  leading artists.  Saint  Laurent  Productions  premiered  \"Strange  Way  of Life\" by Pedro Almodovar and \"A trailer of a movie that will never exist:  Phony  Wars\"  by  Jean-Luc  Godard  as  official  selections  in the 76th Cannes Film Festival.\n\nIn the future, Saint Laurent will continue to implement its brand elevation  strategy  through  its  commitment  to  creativity  and excellence in execution. The House is confident in sustaining its planned growth trajectory (1) .\n\n(1)",

Bottega Veneta is regarded as a legacy House, globally recognized for its leather  mastery  and  its  signature intrecciato . Its  aesthetic  is highly regarded for its bold discretion, celebrating individuality, embracing  non-conformity,  honoring  timelessness,  and  paying homage to cultural advocacy.\n\nWith  the  appointment  of  Bartolomeo  Rongone  as  CEO  in  2019 and Matthieu Blazy as Creative Director in 2021, Bottega Veneta continues to elevate its brand positioning within the ultra-highend Luxury universe. With an instinct aligned with the founding principles of Bottega Veneta -Labor et Ingenium, i.e. craftmanship  and  creativity  -,  Matthieu  Blazy's  collections  have become highly acclaimed.\n\nIn  recent years, Bottega Veneta has successfully evolved from a leather House to a luxury House, with collections highlighting a full  silhouette  and  a  wider  range  of  products,  appealing  to  an international  clientele  of  men  and  women.  This  strategy  has propelled Bottega Veneta into new territories: while continuing to highlight subtlety, the House is engaging with a broader audience\n\n## Key highlights 2023\n\nBottega Veneta continued to affirm its long-term strategy with an ultra-high-end  Luxury  positioning,  focusing  on  brand  elevation and  desirability.  As  regards  fashion  shows  and  communication campaigns, the House remained at the forefront of international fashion weeks and received high praise from specialist critics.\n\nIn  addition  to  its  best-selling  handbags  and  existing  categories, Bottega Veneta expanded its product portfolio by introducing its Home  collection.

From the 1990s to the early 2000s, the House experienced a rebirth, extending its product  universe  beyond  its  core  Ready-to-wear  segment  to include  handbags,  and  developing  new  lines  of  Shoes  and Accessories. Demna was appointed Artistic Director of Balenciaga in  2015. His innovative approach, combined with his mastery of techniques  and  use  of  volumes,  make  him  a  powerful  force  in today's creative world.\n\nBalenciaga  has  recently  re-entered  the  Haute  Couture  segment after a 50-year hiatus, further consolidating the House's status as a  fashion  authority.  Its  creative  vision  is  also  realized  through various  collaborations  with  artists,  cultural  and  technological partners, as well as other brands.\n\n## Key highlights 2023\n\nIn  line  with  its  positioning  and  strategy,  Balenciaga  achieved some significant strategic milestones in 2023.

Along this show, Balenciaga announced the expansion of the historic address of 10 avenue George V in Paris.\n\nRetail  and  e-commerce  development  have  been  Balenciaga's priority in recent years, with the aim of increasing control over its distribution. The House has pursued its retail expansion and the Balenciaga online store has strengthened its presence across all territories  since  migrating  to  a  new  and  directly  operated controlled  platform.  This  focus  on  directly  operated  retail  has opened  business  development  opportunities,  by  increasing  the House's omnichannel capabilities and improving time to market.\n\nBalenciaga is fully committed to pursuing sustainable development  by  fostering  the  values  of  inclusion  and  diversity and promoting responsible Luxury.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the House had a network of 262 directly operated stores and its online activity covers 49 countries across all Regions.\n\nCommunication-wise,  Balenciaga  unveiled  its  first  ever  brand ambassadors.

The  House wants to help ensure the safety and well-being of children, and develop cognitive-behavioral therapies to help children deal with trauma. Through this partnership, Balenciaga provides the NCA with its creativity and media space resources.\n\nLast  but  not  least,  the  House  kept  pursuing  its  commitment  to reduce the environmental impact of its creativity. Balenciaga was notably  recognized  for  its  work  in  developing  alternative,  more sustainable materials, and has received for the second year in a row  the  PETA  Best  Luxury  Product  for  the  Balenciaga  Maxi Bathrobe Coat, introduced in the Summer 24 collection, made of Lunaform\u2122, a biomaterial developed specifically for the House.",

Looking  through  the  House's  archives, Creative Director Claire Choisne was inspired by a brooch given to Queen  Elizabeth  II  for  her  18th  birthday:  a  piece  that  was  of exceptional sentimental value to the Queen, who wore it all her life.  The  brooch's  Art  Deco-inspired  motif  was  reinterpreted  to enliven a range of pieces in multiple colors.\n\nIn 2023, Boucheron also presented More is More, an entirely new \"Carte Blanche\"  collection designed  during  the  Covid-19 pandemic with the aim of bringing joy. The collection consists of pieces  that  are  extravagant  in  size,  vivid  in  color,  made  from materials never before used in High Jewelry, and designed to be works of art.

This new flagship has more than 1,000 square meter (or 10,800 square feet) of space over four levels, and is intended to act as a bridge between French and Japanese culture. It now acts as the House's showcase in Asia. Boucheron has been in Japan since 1973, and the new store strengthens its presence in this key market.\n\nFinally, and in line with its desire to adopt ever more sustainable practices,  Boucheron  reimagined  the  Jewelry  sector's  most symbolic  object:  the  jewelry  case.  Its  teams  worked  on  this project  for  two  years,  using  innovation  and  creativity  to  reduce the  number  of  cases  from  twelve  to  seven  and  to  make  them from only two natural, recyclable materials: aluminum and wool felt.",

This strategy is implemented within each of the Houses, which translate the Group's objectives into practical  action  plans  and  report  on  the  progress  made  with respect to each of the strategy's three pillars on a regular basis.\n\nMore than 50 specialists reporting to the Chief Sustainability and Institutional  Affairs  Officer  -  who  is  a  member  of  the  Executive Committee - assist  the  Houses  with  the  implementation  of  the Group's strategy by systematically looking for potential synergies and  continuous  improvement.  In  addition,  each  House  has  at\n\n## 8.2 Our strategy for 2025\n\nSustainability  has  always  played  a  central  role  in  Kering's strategy.  Many  of  Kering's  activities  rely  on  high-quality  raw materials and exceptional expertise, and so depend directly on balanced, smooth-running ecosystems and respect for individuals. Protecting resources and the planet, and having a positive impact on its employees, partners, suppliers and their communities,  is  therefore  vital  for  the  Group  to  continue growing in a sustainable way. The focus on sustainability is also an  opportunity  to  reinvent  the  luxury  industry  as  a  whole,  in order  to  devise  a  more  sustainable  and  responsible  form  of luxury.  Accordingly,  Kering  is  implementing  an  ambitious sustainability strategy for the period until 2025, based on three inputs:\n\n- \u00b7 the  vision  and  ambition  adopted  by  the  Group's  top management, i.e.,  to  be  the  world's  most  influential  Luxury group  in  terms  of  creativity,  sustainability  and  long-term economic performance;\n- \u00b7 a  materiality  analysis  highlighting  priority  issues,  consistent with  the  Group's  own  priorities  and  the  expectations  of stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 an  analysis  of  non-financial  risks,  pinpointing  the  main  nonfinancial risks in all parts of the value chain.\n\nleast one Sustainability Lead, while the larger Houses have entire Sustainability  teams.  As  a  result,  Kering  has  more  than 100 people working solely on sustainability.\n\nThe Board of Directors has also had a Sustainability Committee since  2012.  This  Committee's  role  is  to  assist  and  support  the Group  in  establishing,  implementing  and  monitoring  good corporate  governance  policies  and  sound  sustainability  and corporate citizenship practices. The Board has also increased its ability  to  take  these  issues  into  account  by  appointing  a  Lead Independent  Director  (in  2019)  and  a  Climate  Change  Lead (in 2022) (1) .\n\nThe  Group's  objectives  and  actions  are  organized  around  three pillars  and  are  aligned  with  the  United  Nations'  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nThe Group has a particularly innovative approach to environmental  issues.  Since  2012,  Kering  has  developed  its environmental  profit  and  loss  (EP&L)  account,  which  is  a reporting  tool  to  measure  and  quantify  its  environmental footprint  across  the  whole  value  chain.  The  tool  enables  the Group  to  understand  the  risks  and  opportunities  related  to environmental  challenges,  focusing  on  six  themes:  greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, water pollution, water consumption, waste production and land use. It therefore helps Kering identify the main ways in which it can reduce its environmental footprint. Kering  has  undertaken  to  reduce  its  EP&L  intensity  by  40%  by 2025 compared with 2015, a goal it achieved in 2021, four years ahead of schedule.\n\nThe  Group's  environmental  approach  is  based  on  three complementary aspects: climate, biodiversity and circularity.\n\nKering has identified environmental impacts in each stage of its value chain, as set out below.",

        "page_content": "## 8.3 Climate risks fully integrated into the business strategy\n\nKering has made climate action a key part of its strategy. The Group's 2023 EP&L results show that 37% of Kering's monetized environmental impacts relating to the product life cycle and the sale  of  products  concern  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The strategy  includes  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation measures and aims to transform Kering's entire industry. It has four main aspects, set out below.\n\n- \u00b7 Mitigating  climate-related  risks  by  reducing  emissions: Kering  has  designed  its  targets  according  to  the  reference framework  defined  by  the  Science  Based  Targets  Initiative (SBTi)  and  is  committed  to  a  90%  reduction  in  its  absolute greenhouse gas emissions from its operations (Scopes 1 and 2)  by  2030,  along  with  a  70%  reduction  in  intensity  in  its supply  chains  (Scope  3).  It  also  introduced  a  new  absolute target  in  2023  for  reducing  its  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by 40% between 2021 and 2035. This target is accompanied by an  enhanced  decarbonization  roadmap,  with  a  specific version for each House.\n- \u00b7 Adapting  and  achieving  resilience  with  nature-based solutions: the Group  favors sourcing materials from regenerative  agriculture,  which  aims  to  protect  and  restore biodiversity and soil health.\n- \u00b7 Making a positive contribution to the climate: Kering  has made a commitment to offsetting residual emissions from all of  the  Group's  own  activities  and  those  of  its  supply  chain, aiming for a Net Zero trajectory consistent with the ambition of the Paris agreements.\n- \u00b7 Transforming  the  industry: through  partnerships  and coalitions  like  the  Fashion  Pact  and  the  Watch  &  Jewellery Initiative  2030,  Kering  aims  to  develop  a  new,  holistic approach to managing climate-related risks, mitigating their impact and contributing to global climate-related objectives.\n\nAll these measures form part of a policy of ongoing improvement, with the aim of stepping up its ambitions and aligning with best practices and scientific advances.\n\nKering  implements  the  recommendations  of  the  TCFD  (Task Force  on  Climate-Related  Financial  Disclosures)  and  in  2021 devised  two  Group-specific  climate  scenarios,  which  were updated  in  2023  on  the  basis  of  more  recent  assumptions,  in particular  the  latest  IPCC  (Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate Change)  report.  The  Group  has  mapped  the  main  physical transition  risks  (27)  and  opportunities  (7)  related  to  climate change,  and  the  map  is  set  out  in  section  5.2  of  chapter  4, \"Sustainability\".\n\nThe  Group  plans  to  manage  these  climate-related  risks  and opportunities, anticipate their effects and ensure its resilience by adapting  its  business  model,  governance  and  decision-making processes,  and  its  supply  chain.  The  assessment,  review  and management of climate risk is an integral part of the Group's risk management (see section 1.3.3 and chapter 5 of this document).",

The Group uses a continuous improvement approach, analyzing feedback and taking action accordingly to improve its business processes. In order to manage, anticipate and mitigate its risk exposure, and to ensure that it can develop its business sustainably over the long-term, the Group has set up a risk management system that involves three lines of defense.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## First line of defense: day-to-day risk management\n\nThe  first  line  of  defense  involves  managing  risk.  All  Kering employees  manage  risk  in  their  day-to-day  work,  overseen  by operational  managers  who  are  responsible  for  internal  control measures and who must ensure that those measures reduce risk to an acceptable level.\n\nAccordingly, the first line of defense must:\n\n- \u00b7 identify,  assess,  control  and  mitigate  risks  by  defining  and implementing internal rules and procedures;\n- \u00b7 take remedial action to address process and control failures;\n- \u00b7 oversee the way in which teams apply and formalize controls in the Group's accounts closing and compliance systems.\n\n## Second line of defense:\n\n## day-to-day risk monitoring\n\nThe  second  line  of  defense  consists  of  functions  that  measure and qualify risks, then ensure that they are properly covered.\n\nThose functions must:\n\n- \u00b7 develop risk management guidelines;\n- \u00b7 identify  known  and  emerging  problems  and  deal  with  alerts relating  to  them,  as  well  as  changes  in  the  way  risks  are regulated;\n- \u00b7 issue  directives  and  provide  training  in  risk  management procedures;\n\n- \u00b7 facilitate  monitoring  regarding  the  implementation  of  effective risk procedures and controls devised by management;\n- \u00b7 ensure that the Group's risk assessment approach is implemented  at  the  process  level  by  regional  internal  control officers;\n- \u00b7 test  control  activities  through  self-assessments  and  peer reviews,  and  monitor  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control using tools.\n\n## Third line of defense: independent risk management\n\nInternal  audit  is  the  third  line  of  defense.  It  independently performs risk management operations. Internal audit periodically assesses  the  design  and  effectiveness  of  the  first  two  lines  of defense and helps improve the internal control system through its recommendations.\n\nAccordingly, the third line of defense must:\n\n- \u00b7 depending  on  the  issue,  check  that  the  measures  in  place, including  governance  methods,  comply  with  regulatory  and statutory requirements;\n- \u00b7 carry  out  audits  by  observing  practices,  speaking  to  staff members  involved  in  audit  activities  and  preparing  audit reports;\n- \u00b7 analyze  and  check  the  effectiveness  of  existing  control  and financial reporting procedures;\n- \u00b7 define  an  annual  internal  audit  plan  with  the  Group's governance bodies (Board of Directors and Audit Committee).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Sales growth for the fourth quarter of 2023 is expected around 6% (2) ,  only  a  slight  improvement compared to the thirdquarter. By contrast, growth was almost 17% in the first half of 2023.\n\nIn  2023, Luxury market's development is closely related to the geopolitical,  public  health  and  macroeconomic  context,  the main dynamics in which can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 In May 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the end of the international public health emergency related to COVID-19.  Consequently,  the  endemic  persistence  of  the  illness had  no  impact  on  the  Luxury  market  in  the  first  half  of  2023. However, since China continued its extremely strict \"zero-COVID\" policy  throughout  2022  -  particularly  in  the  second  and  fourth quarters  -  the  base  for  comparison  regarding  Luxury  brands' performance  in  Mainland  China  was  to  some  extent  favorable, although  it  varied  widely  from  one  quarter  to  another  and between provinces.\n- \u00b7 The  armed  conflict  between  Russia  and  Ukraine  that  began  in February 2022 continued to have a very limited direct impact on the  business  activities  of  major  Luxury  brands.  However,  it contributed to inflationary pressure and the deterioration in the global economic outlook.\n- \u00b7 Based  on  Oxford  Economics  projections (3) , expectations regarding  global  economic  growth  have  been  upgraded. Those projections show the world economy growing by 2.6% in 2023, whereas the growth forecast at the start of the year was 1.6%. However, this remains lower than the growth rate of 3.1% achieved on average between 2010 and 2019 and in 2022. The vast majority of OECD members should see growth within  a  range  of  0.5-2.5%.  Growth  in  Gross  World  Product (GWP)  is  likely  to  be  driven  by  the  rebound  in  the  Chinese economy - which is expected at 5.2%, although this  is  well below the 7.7% average rate seen between 2010 and 2019 and  strong  performance  in  Southeast  Asian  economies (4.3%).\n- \u00b7 Inflation, after reaching very high levels in 2022 (8.4% in the eurozone  and  8%  in  the  United  States)  seems  to  be  on  a gradual but significant downtrend, due in particular to lower energy prices. However, inflation has not yet fallen enough to meet  central  bank  targets.  It  continues  to  have  a  material impact  on  the  amount  households  are  spending  on  basic necessities,  and  is  therefore  a  drag  on  their  purchasing power.\n- \u00b7 The rate-hiking cycle carried out by central banks in the main OECD  economies  seems  to  have  come  to  an  end  in  2023. Interest rates are likely to fall gradually in 2024, although they\n\n(1)\n\n- 64\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nare expected to remain relatively high, which could continue to  affect  the  real  estate  market,  as  well  as  dragging  down households'  confidence  levels  and  propensity  to  consume. However, financial markets rallied in 2023 - with the Nasdaq up 43% and the S&P 500 up 24% - which is a positive factor that  is  likely  to  support  demand  for  luxury  goods  at  a  time when excess savings put aside during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have to a large extent been spent.\n\n- \u00b7 After  2022  saw  very  large  movements  in  exchange  rates between the world's main currencies, driven by central bank monetary  policies,  the  Euro  rose  against  other  major currencies  in  2023.  This  resulted  in  an  overall  narrowing  in price  differences  between  regions,  although  in  many  cases they  remained  large  enough  to  encourage  tourists  to  buy luxury goods when traveling.\n- \u00b7 The post-pandemic phase has also brought a renewed desire among  consumers  to  pay  for  experiences,  so  spending  on services  is  now  growing  more  quickly  than  spending  on goods. For consumers with less purchasing power, this is very probably causing them to reallocate their budgets, spending more  on  leisure,  eating  out  and  travel  instead  of  products made by Luxury brands.\n\nThe  aforementioned  trends  are  affecting  the  main  markets  to different extents. In addition, the performances of Luxury brands may differ  materially  from  one  region  to  another  as  a  result  of variations in tourist numbers and bases for comparison.\n\n- \u00b7 The recovery in tourism accelerated in Europe, Asia and the Middle East in the first half of 2023. In the second half, growth rates slowed in Europe and the Middle East because of a high base  for  comparison.  However,  travel  bookings  by  Chinese people  rose  rapidly  in  2023,  primarily  to  Asian  destinations and  gradually  to  Europe,  although  they  have  not  yet recovered  to  their  2019  level  overall.  This  trend  is  boosting the sales of stores in the main tourist destinations.\n- \u00b7 Business levels in Western Europe were very solid in the first half  of  2023,  but  slowed  sharply  from  the  third  quarter onward.  Sales  to  tourists  underpinned  positive  trends  to  a large  extent,  but  the  growth  rate  moved  steadily  back  to more normal levels because of the gradually rising base for comparison.  Domestic  demand  came  under  more  pressure due to the wait-and-see attitude of European consumers.\n- \u00b7 After strong growth between the end of 2020 and mid-2022, North  America  is  the  region  where  business  levels  suffered most  from  weaker  demand  among  the  most  aspirational customers and from American tourists shifting their purchases to other geographies, where they can buy at lower prices.  Trends  appeared  to  improve  toward  the  end  of  the year,  although  this  was  primarily  due  to  a  less  challenging base for comparison.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Despite a slowdown in growth at the end of the year, sales in Japan were very strong in 2023. Growth was largely driven by sales to Asian tourists, attracted by price differentials arising from movements in the exchange rate between the Japanese yen and other currencies. The number of Chinese tourists has also risen in Japan, although in the second half of the year it was still almost 60% below their 2019 level (4) .\n- \u00b7 Growth  in  China  rebounded,  particularly  in  the  second quarter and to a lesser extent in the fourth, compared with the  very  unusual  trends  seen  in  2022.  However,  indicators show  that  the  recovery  in  the  Chinese  economy,  although solid  overall,  remains  exposed  to  certain  risk  factors  including  population  aging,  youth  employment  and  the decline in the real-estate market - which are also weighing on consumer  confidence.  Sales  growth  in  mainland  China  was therefore robust but volatile, and more fragile in the second half. In contrast, sales in Hong Kong SAR and Macau SAR grew strongly in 2023, with large amounts of buying by consumers from Mainland China.\n- \u00b7 In the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, sales continued to rise in Southeast Asia as the region saw firm economic development in its various countries and good levels of tourism. The South Korean market was affected by weaker local demand caused by  slower  growth  in  the  country's  economy,  tighter  credit conditions  and  certain  South  Korean  consumers  buying products  in  other  regional  markets  because  of  price differentials.\n- \u00b7 Finally,  in  the  other  regions  of  the  world,  sales  growth returned to more normal levels after several quarters of very strong growth.\n\nAnother  effect  of  economic  trends  is  that  the  impact  of  deepseated changes in the Luxury industry in recent years, amplified by the COVID-19 crisis, seems to have faded further in 2023.\n\n- \u00b7 Online sales growth is converging with that seen in physical retail  networks,  which  has,  since  2022,  benefited  from  a rebound in tourism and lower bases for comparison. In some regions, online sales may even have started to fall because of the online channel's exposure to more aspirational customers. As a result,  online  sales  as  a  proportion  of  total sector sales are stabilizing or falling slightly depending on the region and brand.\n\n(4)\n\n- \u00b7 In  the  short  and  medium-term, demand from Generations Y and  Z  remains  one  of  the  principal  growth  drivers  for  the global  Luxury  market.  The  proportion  of  sales  coming  from this  customer  segment  increased  in  2023,  but  at  a  slower rate, because penetration was already high at the end of 2022 (an estimated 65% of revenue according to Bain & CompanyAltagamma).\n- \u00b7 The Luxury market is seeing a premiumization trend in terms of both supply and demand, and this was confirmed in 2023. This  trend  is  largely  related  to  the  economic  situation,  with high inflation and falling purchasing power affecting the less wealthy customer segments but leaving customers with the highest  income  or  wealth  levels  relatively  unaffected.  In addition,  the  most  timeless  and  upscale  products  are regarded as safe-haven assets at a time of uncertainty about other asset classes. As a result, the market has recently been more  positive  for  Jewelry,  Watches  and  certain  types  of Leather goods. Ready-to-wear clothing is also benefiting from this  trend,  supported  by  the  renewed  popularity  of  more formal  clothing  among  consumers,  the  upturn  in  Chinese demand  and  the  resilience  of  the  wealthiest  customers. Distribution  channels  are  also  being  affected,  particularly online sales or US department stores.\n\nAt this stage, it remains difficult to predict how the Luxury market will develop in 2024. The ongoing recovery in Chinese demand particularly  among  Chinese  tourists  -  and  the  lower  base  for comparison in several regions of the world could have a positive impact on growth in the coming months, and particularly in the second  half  of  the  year.  However,  demand  from  domestic customers  could  remain  under  pressure  due  to  economic uncertainties,  since  2024  growth  forecasts  for  the  global economy have been downgraded.\n\n- As an illustration of ongoing uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic and geopolitical context, forecasts regarding the Luxury  sector's  growth  in  full-year  2024  vary  widely:  Bain  & Company-Altagamma  expects  growth  of  between  1%  and  7%, although forecasts in financial analysts' recent reports have been more  optimistic,  predicting  growth  of  6%  on  average.  Experts agree  that  growth  is  likely  to  be  very  limited  in  the  first  half  of 2024.",

It  follows  similar  dynamic  as  the  first  half  of  the  year  in North America and Japan. Performance is nonetheless affected by  weaker local  demand and lower numbers of tourists, whose\n\ncontribution stabilized due to a high base for comparison and the absence  of  any  large-scale  rebound  in  Chinese  customers.  The recovery in China was also weaker than expected.\n\nSales  in  the  fourth  quarter  (down  4%  on  a  comparable  basis) remained stable in our own stores. However, as it did throughout the  year,  revenue  suffered  from  lower  wholesale  revenue  and lower online sales, which were particularly affected by a return to normal in demand among aspirational customers.\n\n## Quarterly revenue by segment\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)              | First quarter   | Second quarter   | Third quarter   | Fourth quarter   | 2023   |\n|------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|--------|\n| Gucci                        | 2,616           | 2,512            | 2,217           | 2,528            | 9,873  |\n| Yves Saint Laurent           | 806             | 770              | 768             | 835              | 3,179  |\n| Bottega Veneta               | 395             | 438              | 381             | 431              | 1,645  |\n| Other Houses                 | 890             | 966              | 805             | 853              | 3,514  |\n| Kering Eyewear and Corporate | 433             | 436              | 333             | 366              | 1,568  |\n| Eliminations                 | (63)            | (64)             | (40)            | (46)             | (213)  |\n| Revenue                      | 5,077           | 5,058            | 4,464           | 4,967            | 19,566 |\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)              | First quarter   | Second quarter   | Third quarter   | Fourth quarter   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|--------|\n| Gucci                        | 2,591           | 2,582            | 2,581           | 2,733            | 10,487 |\n| Yves Saint Laurent           | 739             | 742              | 916             | 903              | 3,300  |\n| Bottega Veneta               | 396             | 438              | 437             | 469              | 1,740  |\n| Other Houses                 | 973             | 982              | 995             | 924              | 3,874  |\n| Kering Eyewear and Corporate | 308             | 283              | 253             | 295              | 1,139  |\n| Eliminations                 | (51)            | (53)             | (45)            | (40)             | (189)  |\n| Revenue                      | 4,956           | 4,974            | 5,137           | 5,284            | 20,351 |\n\n| (comparable change (1) )     | Q1 2023/2022  change   | Q2 2023/2022  change   | Q3 2023/2022  change   | Q4 2023/2022  change   | 2023/2022  change   |\n|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|\n| Gucci                        | +1%                    | +1%                    | -7%                    | -4%                    | -2%                 |\n| Yves Saint Laurent           | +8%                    | +7%                    | -12%                   | -5%                    | -1%                 |\n| Bottega Veneta               | -                      | +3%                    | -7%                    | -4%                    | -2%                 |\n| Other Houses                 | -9%                    | -1%                    | -15%                   | -5%                    | -8%                 |\n| Kering Eyewear and Corporate | +11%                   | +21%                   | +3%                    | +7%                    | +11%                |\n| Eliminations                 | N/A                    | N/A                    | N/A                    | N/A                    | N/A                 |\n| Revenue                      | +1%                    | +3%                    | -9%                    | -4%                    | -2%                 |\n\n- (1) On a comparable scope and exchange rate basis.

The  rebound  in  tourist  numbers from the rest of Asia, driven by the weak Yen, lay behind this very good performance.\n\nIn  Asia-Pacific  -  the  Group's  largest  region  in  terms  of  revenue, accounting  for  35%  of  the  total  -  revenue  was  up  10%  on  a comparable basis relative to 2022. Sales grew strongly in Greater China,  while  South  Korea  and  Southeast  Asian  countries  saw slower revenue growth after a sharp increase in 2022.\n\nIn  Western  Europe,  after  a  buoyant  first  half,  the  Group's  sales slowed  in  the  second,  affected  by  a  return  to  normal  in  local demand and a stabilization in tourist numbers. The 4% decline in sales  on  a  comparable  basis  was  mainly  the  result  of  lower wholesale revenue, in line with the Group's strategy of making its distribution more exclusive.\n\n## Group revenue by distribution channel\n\nPercentages based on revenue before Eliminations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSales  from  directly  operated  and  online  stores  came  in  at \u20ac15,446 million in 2023, stable on a comparable basis relative to 2022. The previous comments regarding performance by region in 2023 also apply to the growth trajectory of retail sales.\n\nStore  footfall  was  higher  than  in  2022,  although  trends  varied widely  between  regions.  Higher  footfall  was  accompanied  by  a slight  decline  in  the  conversion  rate  (i.e.,  the  number  of  people buying products as a percentage of the total number of people visiting  stores).  As  a  result,  revenue  growth  was  driven  by  an increase  in  average  selling  prices,  resulting  from  the  policy  of taking  the  Houses'  product  ranges  more  upscale.  The  3% increase  in  sales  at  physical  stores  managed  by  the  Houses contrasts  with  the  decline  in  online  sales,  whose  proportion  of retail sales fell to around 12% (as opposed to 15% in 2022). The decline  in  the  online  channel  was  due  to  its  overexposure  to certain product categories and customers more impacted by the macroeconomic context  -  inflation  and  higher  interest  rates.  In addition, the base for comparison is high, since online sales have almost tripled since 2019.\n\nRevenue  in  North  America  fell  22%  on  a  comparable  basis compared  to  2023.  Performance  in  that  region  was  again  held back by a significant decline in local demand and a slowdown in department store sales, particularly among aspirational customers. However, revenue remained around 50% higher than in 2019.\n\nThe  Group's  performance  in  the  Rest  of  the  World  returned  to normal overall after several years of strong growth. Comparisons with 2022 remained partly affected by the shutdown of business activities in Russia  and  Ukraine  from  late-February  2022. However,  the  Group's  exposure  to  the  conflict  between  Russia and Ukraine is limited, since in 2021 Kering generated around 1% of  its  total  revenue  in  those  countries,  and  the  net  value  of  its assets there was not material at the end of 2021 (around 0.1% of the  Group  total  assets).  The  value  of  those  assets  was  written down in full in 2022.\n\nRevenue  from  stores  and  online  sales  directly  operated  by  the Group  accounted  for  around  78%  of  the  Group's  total  sales (before Eliminations), similar to the figure seen in 2022. Excluding Kering Eyewear and Kering Beaut\u00e9, however, this figure is at 85% versus  82%  in  2022.  The  increase  in  this  proportion  in  recent years has resulted from the long-term strategy implemented by all Houses, which is aimed at controlling their distribution more tightly, including online sales, and making them more exclusive.\n\nWholesale  revenue  fell  13%  year-on-year  in  2023  on  a comparable  basis  (before  Eliminations). For the Houses, wholesale  revenue  fell  significantly,  by  21%  on  a  comparable basis. This reflects a reduction in orders placed by US distributors and the reorganization of the wholesale distribution network that is  currently  underway,  resulting  in  sales  being  concentrated among the best-positioned distributors. Although these streamlining efforts are complete at Gucci, they are continuing in the Group's other Fashion and Leather goods Houses. However, Kering Eyewear, which has a wholesale-only distribution model, posted sales growth of 10% on a comparable basis, driven both by  the  development  of  existing  licenses  and  the  successful integration  of  Lindberg.  Including  the  scope  effect  arising  from the  contribution  of  Maui  Jim,  revenue  was  up  37%  at  constant exchange rates.\n\nThe  Houses'  royalty  revenue  from  licenses  and  other  revenue rose by 10% on a comparable basis in 2023, due to very robust growth  in  the  Eyewear  category  and  in  the  Fragrances  and Cosmetics category.",

As  a proportion  of  revenue,  gross  margin  was  76.3%,  up  1.6  points relative  to  2022,  under  the  combined  effects  of  higher  average selling  prices,  the  increasing  proportion  of  sales  from  directly operated  stores  and  the  positive  effect  of  foreign  exchange hedging.\n\nOperating  expenses  rose  by  6%.  This  increase  arose  from investments made by the Group's brands and Kering Eyewear to support their development and expansion, notably by increasing budgets  for  store  expenses,  the  creation,  development  and presentation of collections, communications and digitalization.\n\nThese  efforts,  which  were  necessary  in  view  of  the  competitive environment and the Group's long-term ambitions for its Houses, independent  of  short-term  trends,  affected  brands'  profitability against a background of slowing sales growth, particularly in the second half of the year.

Revenue rose by 1% in the first half but was affected in the second half by demand for luxury goods returning to more normal levels from a high  base  for  comparison,  particularly  among  local  customers, and  by  a  weaker-than-expected  recovery  in  tourist  numbers compared to 2022.\n\nIn  2023  as  a  whole,  the  main  driver  of  sales  growth  in  physical stores was the increase in average selling prices, resulting from changes in the product mix and increases in price to develop a more upscale product range.\n\nAfter  several  years  of  strong  growth  and  a  stabilization  in  2022, revenue  from  online  stores  fell  in  2023  on  a  comparable  basis because of this distribution channel's exposure to the American market  (where  it  accounts  for  almost  half  of  sales)  and  to customers  with  lesser  purchasing  power  more  impacted  by deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. There is also a greater desire to visit physical stores. As a result, sales from online stores accounted for around 12% of total retail revenue in 2023.\n\nDifficulties  encountered  by  wholesalers,  combined  with  their cautious approach to transition collections, led to a 5% decrease in wholesale revenue (at comparable exchange rates) relative to 2022.\n\n## Revenue by region\n\nIn  view  of  the  proportion  of  Gucci's  sales  generated  by  directly operated  stores,  the  following  revenue  analysis  by  region  only concerns  sales  in  its  own  physical  and  online  stores,  on  a comparable basis.\n\nIn  Western  Europe,  sales  grew  by  7%  on  a  comparable  basis  in the first half, driven by tourists, but were affected in the second by  a  decline  in  store  footfall  and  local  demand.  In  2023  as  a whole, sales were stable relative to 2022.\n\nIn Japan, the rebound in tourist numbers, driven in particular by attractive  exchange  rates,  helped  to  boost  sales,  which  rose  by 26% on a comparable basis in 2023.\n\nIn North America, Gucci's revenue was down 20%, with trends in the  second  half  being  very  similar  to  those  seen  in  the  first. However,  sales  to  North  American  customers  in  all  markets remained over 40% higher on a comparable basis than in 2019.\n\nSales were up 5% on a comparable basis in Asia-Pacific and sales growth accelerated in the fourth quarter, partly because the base for  comparison  was  lower  than  in  the  third  quarter.  The resumption  of  inter-regional  tourism  led  to  a  sharp  increase  in sales in Hong Kong SAR and Macau SAR. However, demand fell in South Korea as some local consumers bought products in other countries  within  the  region,  and  because  of  weaker  local demand.\n\nIn the world's other regions, revenue growth was firm relative to 2022, particularly in the Middle East.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Revenue by product category\n\nIn  2023,  sales  of  most  Gucci  product  categories  in  directly operated  stores  were  almost  unchanged  or  slightly  lower compared  to  2022.  The  increase  in  average  selling  prices, resulting both from changes in the product mix and price hikes, offset lower volumes.\n\nSales  of  Leather  goods  were  resilient,  particularly  for  Women's lines, which were driven by the success of certain iconic products such as the Jackie and Valigeria travel bags.\n\nHowever, categories featuring entry-level products, such as small Leather goods, Shoes and Belts, were affected by the return-tonormal  in  demand,  unlike  High  Jewelry,  which  saw  robust growth.\n\nRoyalty  revenue  increased  compared  to  2022.  The  Eyewear category,  managed  by  Kering  Eyewear,  continued  to  see  rising sales.  Royalties  from  the  license  granted  to  Coty  in  the Fragrances and Cosmetics category saw an improvement, from a base that remained fairly favorable for comparison.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nGucci's recurring operating income amounted to \u20ac3,264 million in 2023, down \u20ac468 million year-on-year.\n\nRecurring operating margin was 33.1%, down 2.5 points.\n\nGiven  Gucci's  geographical  exposure,  the  combination  of currency effects and the result of currency hedging had a positive impact  of  around  1.6  points  on  recurring  operating  margin. However, the House continued to invest in initiatives to boost its long-term  growth,  which  consequently  increased  its  cost  base. Given the decline in sales as reported, operational leverage was negative (i.e., expenses rose more quickly than revenue), and this adversely affected margins.\n\nGucci generated EBITDA of \u20ac3,999 million in 2023, a decrease of \u20ac417 million relative to 2022 and representing an EBITDA margin of 40.5%.\n\n## Store network and operating investments\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  Gucci  operated  538  stores  directly. Gucci  opened  10  new  stores  during  the  year  (net  of  closures), mainly in Asia and North America.\n\nThe House therefore continued to prioritize optimizing its store network in support of its brand elevation strategy, increasing its visibility in the best locations and giving customers an exclusive experience, while withdrawing from less productive locations.\n\nGucci's operating investments amounted to \u20ac435 million in 2023, 7%  higher  than  in  2022,  against  a  backdrop  of  further  cost increases  for  materials  and  building  work.  Gross  operating investments equaled 4.4% of revenue (3.9% in 2022), which is a relatively normal level for a House of Gucci's size.",

After double-digit growth in the first half of the year (sales up 11% on  a  comparable  basis),  business  levels  suffered  in  the  second half - and particularly in North America and Europe - from lower store  footfall  caused  by  weaker  local  demand  along  with  a weaker-than-expected recovery in tourist numbers. Yves  Saint  Laurent  continued  the  successful  deployment  of  its brand  elevation  strategy,  which  resulted  in  a  higher  average spend. Online sales fell, with marked differences in performance across the regions.\n\nWholesale  revenue  was  down  26%  at  constant  exchange  rates compared  to  2022.  This  was  due  to  the  ongoing  effort  to streamline distribution, focusing on a small number of partners, and  a  macroeconomic  environment  that  was  less  helpful  for wholesalers, particularly in North America.\n\n## Revenue by region\n\nIn view of the proportion of Yves Saint Laurent's sales generated by  directly  operated  stores,  the  following  revenue  analysis  by region only concerns sales in its own physical and online stores.\n\nIn  2023,  Yves  Saint  Laurent's  revenue  rose  relative  to  2022, although growth rates varied widely between regions.\n\nIn Western Europe, sales rose by 5% on a comparable basis. After a very buoyant first half, the House saw weaker local demand in the second, along with a smaller increase in tourist numbers from a high base in 2022.\n\nIn North America, after two exceptional years in 2021 and 2022 in which  sales  doubled  compared  to  2019,  revenue  fell  15%  on  a comparable  basis  due  to  macroeconomic  conditions,  which seriously affected aspirational customers.\n\nIn  Asia-Pacific,  revenue  was  up  20%  on  a  comparable  basis thanks  to  a  rebound  in  Greater  China.  Trends  in  Korea  and Southeast Asia were less dynamic, after several quarters of very strong growth since 2020.\n\nIn Japan, sales were up 21% on a comparable basis in 2023 due to strong growth in the number of tourists visiting from China and Southeast  Asia,  who  were  attracted  by  the  pricing  differential related to favorable exchange rate.\n\nYves  Saint  Laurent's  performance  in  the  Rest  of  the  World  was solid, with growth of 8%, and particularly so in the Middle East, which has historically been an important market for the brand.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This reflects the initiatives taken by Yves  Saint  Laurent  over  the  last  few  years  to  constantly  renew and refresh its Leather goods offering, which has helped it to both attract new customers and retain existing ones in all its markets.\n\nSales of Ready-to-wear collections for women rose very sharply, continuing trends seen since 2021. This performance is the result of  the  brand's  merchandising  strategy  implemented  during recent  quarters  with  the  aim  of  making  its  offerings  and  price architecture more relevant in this category.\n\nBy  contrast,  sales  in  the  Shoes  category  were  affected  to  a greater extent by slower growth in demand in certain markets.\n\nRoyalty  revenue  generated  by  Kering  Eyewear  surged,  again showing the success of this licensing agreement. Royalties paid by  L'Or\u00e9al  in  the  Fragrances  and  Cosmetics  category  also  rose very sharply.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nIn 2023, Yves Saint Laurent's recurring operating income totaled \u20ac969  million,  down  5%,  although  recurring  operating  margin remained above 30%, down 0.4 points relative to 2022.\n\nThe  House  was  able  to  keep  operating  margin  at  a  high  level through efforts to control costs despite the expansion of the store network.\n\nIn  2023,  EBITDA  totaled  \u20ac1,219  million,  almost  unchanged compared  to  2022.  EBITDA  margin  was  38.3%  as  opposed  to 37.9% in 2022.\n\n## Store network and operating investments\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  the  House  had  308  directly  operated stores.  A  net  28  new  stores  were  added  in  2023  in  its  main markets, in line with the target of a network of 300 to 350 directly operated  stores  in  the  medium  term.  In  particular,  the Saint  Laurent  Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es  flagship  store  opened  in  Paris  in December.  It  is  the  House's  largest  store  and  features  a  new design  concept  that  will  be  rolled  out  across  other  stores  in  its network.  In  addition,  some  existing  stores  were  refurbished, relocated and extended.\n\nThis  resulted  in  a  high  level  of  operating  investments,  which amounted  to  \u20ac186  million,  up  \u20ac74  million  relative  to  2022  and equal to 5.8% of revenue.",

This growth was driven both  by  resilient  sales  at  comparable  scope  and  by  good momentum  in  online  stores. The House is continuing, consistently and with determination, to implement its strategy of developing  its  offering  in  all  product  categories,  raise  brand awareness  and  enhance  the  customer  experience  across  all points of sale.\n\nWholesale  revenue  was  down  24%  on  a  comparable  basis,  as expected.  Bottega  Veneta  has  reorganized  this  distribution channel, with the aim of working only with a limited number of selected partners.\n\n## Revenue by region\n\nGiven the proportion of Bottega Veneta's sales that are generated in  directly  operated  stores,  the  following  revenue  analysis  by region only concerns sales in physical and online stores.\n\nIn  Western Europe, revenue rose by 4% on a comparable basis. Revenue growth was robust in the first half but was affected in the  second  by  a  slowdown  in  demand  among  local  customers from  a  high  base,  and  by  a  weaker-than-expected  recovery  in tourist numbers compared to 2022.\n\nIn  Japan,  revenue  rose  by  12%  at  constant  exchange  rates relative to 2022, with higher tourist numbers offsetting a return to normal in sales to local customers.\n\nIn  North  America,  Bottega  Veneta's  sales  rose  by  2%  on  a comparable basis relative to 2022, showing great resilience in less helpful market conditions.\n\nIn  Asia-Pacific,  the  House's  sales  were  stable.  Bottega  Veneta's improved performance in Greater China reflecting the implementation of its media strategy aimed at raising its brand profile, its efforts to improve the store network and to strengthen teams  offset  lower  revenue  in  South  Korea  and  Southeast  Asia after two years of strong growth.\n\nSales growth in the Rest of the World remained robust.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  House's  strategy  aims  to  maintain  its exclusive  positioning  in  Leather  goods,  particularly  by  focusing on sales growth through higher prices and an improved product mix - including the introduction of new, highly exclusive lines like Andiamo - rather than through volume growth alone.\n\nReady-to-wear revenue posted very solid growth again in 2023 as new  collections,  both  womenswear  but  also  increasingly menswear, were very well received. The House's Jewelry line was also highly successful.\n\nHowever,  sales  momentum  in  the  Shoes  category  was  less buoyant.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nBottega  Veneta's  recurring  operating  income  for  2023  totaled \u20ac312 million, down 15% compared to 2022.\n\nRecurring operating margin was 19%, 2 points less than in 2022. That  was  due  to  negative  operational  leverage,  as  the  House continued to take a more selective approach to distribution and maintained its investment efforts in order to make its revamp a lasting success. In view of its increasing cost base, the House is prioritizing its  allocation of resources in order to focus them on the most strategic areas of expenditure.\n\nEBITDA  amounted  to  \u20ac494  million  in  2023,  equal  to  30%  of revenue.\n\n## Store network and operating investments\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  Bottega  Veneta  had  288  directly operated  stores.  There  were  17  net  store  openings  during  the year.\n\nThe  brand  is  focusing  its  investment  efforts  on  relocating  and refurbishing  its  existing  stores,  while  pursuing  its  strategy  of gradual  and  targeted  openings  as  opportunities  arise,  notably with  the  establishment  of  new  flagships.  This  included  the reopening of the House's flagship store on Avenue Montaigne in Paris,  which  features  a  high-end  esthetic  in  both  its  open  areas and VIP rooms.\n\nOperating  investments  totaled  \u20ac105  million,  higher  than  in previous  years.  However,  they  remained  broadly  stable  as  a proportion of the House's sales (around 6.4%).",

It  saw  strong  sales  growth  in  Japan and  Asia-Pacific  but  a  sharp  deceleration  in  North  America and  Europe.  The  House  also  continued  its  strategy  of reducing  its  number  of  wholesalers  while  macroeconomic conditions were also less helpful for the latter, particularly in North America;\n- \u00b7 Alexander  McQueen  suffered  from  its  exposure  to  the wholesale market, particularly in the United States. However, sales  in  the  House's  stores  rose  due  to  the  success  of  its Ready-to-Wear offering;\n- \u00b7 after  a  good  year  in  2022,  revenue  at  Brioni  continued  to recover;\n- \u00b7 revenue grew strongly at the Jewelry Houses:\n- -Boucheron confirmed its potential with further strong sales growth in 2023,\n- -total revenue growth at Pomellato and Dodo was firm,\n- -Qeelin's  sales  rose  sharply  due  to  the  recovery  in  the Chinese market and in tourist numbers, as well as growth in its store network.\n\n## Revenue by distribution channel\n\nRevenue from the Other Houses' directly operated physical and online  stores  rose  3%  on  a  comparable  basis  relative  to  2022. That growth was partly due to new store openings, in line with the strategy of moving toward more selective distribution. Online\n\nsales  fell  and  held  back  the  segment's  overall  performance. However,  the  proportion  of  total  revenue  coming  from  online sales varied between brands, showing close correlation with the maturity of each House's online stores and product range.\n\nWholesale  revenue  was  down  29%  on  a  comparable  basis.  In accordance  with  the  Group's  strategy,  the  Other  Houses  primarily Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen - are focusing their wholesale  businesses  on  a  limited  number  of  top-quality partners.  Performance  was  also  affected  by  a  decline  in  orders from distributors in North America.\n\n## Revenue by region\n\nThe Other Houses' regional performances followed similar trends to those seen at Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta.\n\nThe  return  to  normal  in  local  consumer  spending  and  weak growth in tourist numbers in the second half of the year dragged down the Other Houses' sales growth in Western Europe, with the notable  exception  of  Brioni  (+9%).  The  Other  Houses'  total revenue in Western Europe fell by 19% on a comparable basis.\n\nRevenue grew 27% on a comparable basis in Japan, boosted by the sharp upturn in the number of tourists traveling within Asia.\n\nIn  North  America,  sales  fell  33%  on  a  comparable  basis,  due  to the decrease in wholesale revenue -particularly at Alexander McQueen - and difficulties encountered by Balenciaga in this market.\n\nIn Asia-Pacific, revenue rose by 19% on a comparable basis, due in particular to very strong performance  at  Balenciaga, Boucheron and Qeelin in Greater China.\n\nIn the Rest of the world, the Other Houses' performance was held back by the decline in Balenciaga's sales in the Middle East.\n\n<!-- image -->",

High Jewelry collections from Boucheron but also Pomellato were particularly well received.\n\nAmong  the  other  categories,  Ready-to-wear  was  the  most resilient,  as  Alexander  McQueen  focused  more  on  this  category within its own stores while Brioni also achieved growth.\n\nHowever, the Shoes and Leather goods category suffered from a very high base for comparison and more moderate demand from aspirational customers in certain markets.\n\nRoyalties fell relative to 2022 as certain licenses and collaborations came to an end. However, royalties from licenses managed by Kering Eyewear increased.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nThe Other Houses' recurring operating income was \u20ac212 million in 2023, 62% less than in 2022.\n\nRecurring  operating  margin  came  to  6%,  down  8.4  points compared to 2022.\n\n- 86\n\nContinued  high  levels  of  expenses  on  supporting  the  Other Houses'  development  in  all  their  main  markets  affected profitability, given the decrease in revenue. This was particularly true at Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen.\n\nEBITDA  totaled  \u20ac585  million,  down  \u20ac303  million  year-on-year. This caused EBITDA margin to fall 6.2 points to 16.7%.\n\n## Store network and operating investments\n\nThe  Other  Houses  had  618  directly  operated  stores  as  of December 31, 2023, a net increase of 34 compared to 2022.\n\nBalenciaga,  Brioni  and  the  Jewelry  brands  were  mainly  behind this  expansion  of  the  network.  Asia-Pacific  had  most  store openings (net of closures), followed by North America.\n\nThese developments led to a slight increase in the Other Houses' operating  investments,  which  totaled  \u20ac247  million,  \u20ac26  million more  than  in  2022.  As  a  proportion  of  annual  revenue, investments remained high at 7% in 2023 as opposed to 6% in 2022.  Although  the  Houses  obviously  worked  on  strengthening their  direct  distribution,  they  also  invested  in  their  production capabilities and the full array of infrastructure needed to develop their businesses.",

Creed,  acquired  in  October  2023,  has  been  consolidated  in Kering's financial statements since November 1, 2023;\n- \u00b7 Kering's  headquarters  teams,  all  corporate  departments reporting  to  them  -  including  in  the  regions  -  and  Shared Services,  which  provide  a  range  of  services  to  the  brands, along  with  the  Kering  Sustainability  Department.  KGS  -  the Kering entity that handled sourcing activities for non-Group brands  including  companies  making  up  the  former  Redcats group  -  was  sold  in  November  2022.  Sales  and  operating income  for  2022  therefore  include  the  contribution  of  KGS until that date.\n\nIn  2023,  the  segment generated total revenue of \u20ac1,568 million, including \u20ac1,502 million from Kering Eyewear.\n\nKering Eyewear's sales were up 35% as reported. However, they included  a  positive  impact  from  a  change  in  scope,  due  to  the consolidation of Maui Jim from October 1, 2022.\n\nAt constant scope and exchange rates, revenue rose by 10%, with the  number  of  licenses  managed  by  Kering  Eyewear  remaining stable  relative  to  2022.  Performance  in  the  first  and  second halves of the year must be analyzed in view of seasonal variations in Kering Eyewear's business, with more sales taking place in the first six months.\n\nGrowth  at  constant  scope  was  extremely  solid  in  all  main markets, and was driven in particular by a very strong upturn in Asia-Pacific and strong growth in Europe.\n\nLocal  chains  and  the  \"three  Os\"  (Opticians,  Optometrists  and Ophthalmologists)  constitute  the  main  channel  for  sales  under license  by  brands  managed  by  Kering  Eyewear  (around  50%  of total  sales  in  both  2023  and  2022).  Revenue  from  those distributors  once  again  saw  very  robust  growth,  showing  the effectiveness  of  Kering  Eyewear's  sales  organization.  Sales  in other distribution channels also rose, particularly in brands' own stores, and continued to recover in travel retail.\n\nThe  segment  made  an  operating  loss  of  \u20ac7  million,  comprising operating  income  of  \u20ac276  million  at  Kering  Eyewear  less Corporate operating expenses of \u20ac283 million.\n\nKering Eyewear's recurring operating margin was 18.4%, similar to  the  2022  figure.  Positive  operational  leverage  was  offset  by increased  investment  at  Maui  Jim,  aimed  particularly  at continuing its development in new markets.\n\nCorporate  operating  expenses  were  stable  compared  to  2022. These expenses arise from the Group's initiatives in the fields of IT, digital and innovation, and also sustainability.\n\nThe segment's operating investments amounted to \u20ac1,638 million in 2023 and included the acquisition of real-estate properties  in  Paris  with  the  aim  of  securing  prime  locations  for the  Group's  Houses.  Adjusted  for  those  acquisitions,  operating investments  amounted  to  \u20ac257  million  in  2023,  up  \u20ac19  million relative to 2022. Corporate (logistics and head office) operations maintained  a  level  of  investment  almost  unchanged  from  last year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consolidated financial statements, Note 31 - Transactions with related parties).\n\n## 8 OUTLOOK\n\nTo achieve its long-term vision, Kering invests in the development of its houses,  so  that  they  continuously  strengthen  their desirability  and  the  exclusivity  of  their  distribution,  strike  a perfect  balance  between  creative  innovation  and  timelessness, and  achieve  the  highest  standards  in  terms  of  quality, sustainability, and  experience  for  their  customers.  In  an environment of ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty, Kering  will  continue  to  execute  on  its  strategy  and  vision,  in pursuit  of  two  key  ambitions:  to  maintain  a  trajectory  of  longterm  profitable  growth,  and  to  confirm  its  status  as  one  of  the most influential groups in the Luxury industry.\n\nIn  2024,  in  a  context  of  ongoing  normalization  of  the  sector's growth, the impact of Kering's investment strategy will weigh on the  group's  full-year  recurring  operating  income  (based  on  the scope  of  consolidation  and  exchange  rates  at  December  31, 2023),  which  should  post  a  decline  compared  to  the  level reported  in  2023,  particularly  in  the  first  half  of  the  year.  The Group  will  prioritize  expenses  and  investments  supporting  the long-term  development  and  growth  of  its  houses,  while remaining  vigilant  and  disciplined  with  regards  to  its  cost structure.\n\n## 9 DEFINITIONS OF NON-IFRS FINANCIAL INDICATORS\n\n## \"Reported\" and \"comparable\" growth\n\nThe  Group's  \"reported\"  growth  corresponds  to  the  change  in reported revenue between two periods.\n\nThe  Group  measures  \"comparable\"  growth  (also  referred  to  as \"organic\" growth) in its business by comparing revenue between two periods at constant scope and exchange rates.\n\n## Recurring operating income\n\nThe  Group's  operating  income  includes  all  revenues  and expenses directly related to its activities, whether these revenues and expenses are recurring or arise from non-recurring decisions or transactions.\n\nOther  non-recurring  operating  income  and  expenses  consist  of items  that,  by  their  nature,  amount  or  frequency,  could  distort the  assessment  of  the  Group's  operating  performance  as reflected in its recurring operating income. They include changes in  scope,  the  impairment  of  goodwill  and  brands  and,  where material, of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, capital  gains  and  losses  on  disposals  of  non-current  assets, restructuring costs and disputes.\n\n- 88\n\nChanges  in  scope  are  dealt  with  as  follows  for  the  periods concerned:\n\n- \u00b7 the  portion  of  revenue  relating  to  acquired  entities  is excluded from the current period;\n- \u00b7 the portion relating to entities divested or in the process of being divested is excluded from the previous period.\n\nCurrency effects are calculated by applying the average exchange rates for the current period to amounts in the previous period.\n\n\"Recurring operating income\"  is  therefore  an  alternative performance  indicator  for  the  Group,  defined  as  the  difference between  operating  income  and  other  non-recurring  operating income and expenses. This indicator is intended to facilitate the understanding of the operating performance of the Group and its Houses and can therefore be used as a way to estimate recurring performance. It is presented in a manner that is consistent and stable  over  the  long-term  in  order  to  ensure  the  continuity  and relevance of financial information.",

A large proportion (over a third) of  the  new  store  openings  were  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region,  but some  brands  also  expanded  their  distribution  networks  with openings in the Middle East, North America and Western Europe. The  year-on-year  increase  was  also  driven  mostly  by  the expansion  of  the  Yves  Saint  Laurent,  Bottega  Veneta  and Balenciaga networks.\n\n## Gucci\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  Gucci  operated  538  stores  directly. Gucci opened 10 net new stores during the year, mainly in Asia and North America. Gucci's focus is on achieving organic growth by maximizing the productivity of the existing store network, but it is also continuing to identify opportunities that will enable it to enhance its distribution in certain regions or sales channels.\n\nGucci's gross operating investments amounted to \u20ac435 million in 2023, 7% higher than in 2022. Most of those investments related to store refurbishments, openings and relocations. The remainder consisted primarily of IT expenditure, but also projects related to production, offices and support functions.\n\n## Yves Saint Laurent\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  the  House  had  308  directly  operated stores. There were 28 net store openings during 2023, reflecting the brand's store network expansion plan implemented over the past few years. Openings reflected both the streamlining of the brand's distribution, its entry into new countries, and relocations and  expansions  in  markets  where  Yves  Saint  Laurent  already operated directly.\n\nThe  House's  operating  investments  totaled  \u20ac186  million,  up \u20ac74 million relative to 2022.\n\n## Bottega Veneta\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  Bottega  Veneta  had  288  directly operated  stores.  There  were  17  net  store  openings  during  the year.  As  in  2022,  the  brand  focused  its  investment  efforts  on relocating and refurbishing its existing stores, while pursuing its strategy of gradual and targeted openings as opportunities arose, notably with the establishment of new flagships.\n\nOperating investments totaled \u20ac105 million in 2023, more than in previous years.\n\n## Other Houses\n\nThe  Other  Houses  had  618  directly  operated  stores  as  of December 31, 2023, 34 more in net than at December 31, 2023. Balenciaga,  Brioni  and  the  jewelry  brands  were  mainly  behind this expansion of the network.\n\nThese  developments  led  to  an  increase  in  the  Other  Houses' operating  investments,  which  totaled  \u20ac247  million,  \u20ac26  million higher than in 2022.\n\n## Kering Eyewear and Corporate\n\nInvestments by Kering Eyewear and Corporate totaled \u20ac1,638 million. This includes the acquisition of real-estate assets in  Paris,  aimed  at  securing  prime  locations  for  the  Group's Houses.  Adjusted  for  those  acquisitions,  operating  investments amounted to \u20ac257 million in 2023, up \u20ac19 million relative to 2022. Investments  in  Corporate  activities  (logistics  and  head  office) were almost the same as in 2022.",

It notably describes the composition of the Board  of  Directors  and  application  of  the  principle  of  balanced representation of women and men on the Board, the conditions of preparation and organization of its work, compliance with the recommendations  of  the  Corporate  Governance  Code  of  Listed Companies  to  which  the  Company  refers  and  includes  the\n\nremuneration  policy  for  corporate  officers  laid  down  by  the Board. In addition, this report indicates any limitations placed by the  Board  on  the  powers  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the Company.\n\nThe Board of Directors approved this report in full, including the remuneration  policy  for  corporate  officers,  at  its  meeting  on February 28, 2024, in accordance with the provisions of Articles L. 225-37 and L. 22-10-8 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n## 1.1 Reference corporate governance code\n\nThe Company refers to the Corporate Governance Code of Listed Corporations drafted by the AFEP and MEDEF (the \"AFEP-MEDEF Code\"). This code, updated on December 20, 2022, is available for download  from  the  websites  of  the  AFEP  (www.afep.com),  the\n\nMEDEF (www.medef.com) and the High Committee on Corporate Governance (Haut Comit\u00e9 de Gouvernement d'Entreprise , www.hcge.fr).\n\n## 1.2 Company's management structure\n\n## 1.2.1 Roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer combined\n\nIn 2005, Kering (then called PPR) adopted a governance structure with  a  Board  of  Directors,  which  appointed  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAt the Combined General Meetings of May 7, 2009, June 18, 2013, April  27,  2017,  and  April  22,  2021,  the  shareholders  decided  to reappoint him as a Director. At its meetings held subsequent to each of these Combined General Meetings, the Board of Directors decided to maintain the combined role structure and reappointed  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  as  Chairman  and  Chief Executive  Officer.  The  decision  to  maintain  the  combined  role structure was considered best suited to the Group's organization, operating arrangements and activities.\n\nThe  Board  took  into  consideration  the  special  position  of Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault.  He  is  related  to  Kering's  controlling shareholder  and  has  been  actively  involved  in  conducting  the Group's  business  affairs,  endowing  him  with  long-standing, intimate operational knowledge, plus a wealth of experience. The Board  also  underlined  the  benefits  of  combining  the  roles following  the  transformation  of  the  Company  into  a  Luxury group.  It  also  stated  the  view  that  this  company  management structure,  through  the  consistent,  responsive  and  effective strategic  decision-making  it  fosters,  best  fits  the  Group's operational requirements,  helps  to  optimize  the  Group's economic  and  financial  performance,  and  ensures  strong  and harmonious communication.\n\nThis  governance  framework  is  also  suited  to  the  Group's shareholder  structure,  which  includes  individual  investors,  a controlling  shareholder  and  institutional  shareholders,  all  of whom have a stake in Kering's long-term development. It is thus aligned  with  the  best  interests  of  the  Company  and  its shareholders.\n\nIn addition, given that the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  are  combined  and  to  provide  additional  assurance  with regard to the proper functioning of the Board and the balance of powers,  the  Board  of  Directors  introduced  in  2019,  on  the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee,\n\nthe role of Lead Independent Director, with the duties described in  section  1.4  of  this  chapter  and  in  the  Board  of  Directors' internal rules.\n\nIn the course of the latest internal assessment of its operations, the Board of Directors unanimously confirmed the effectiveness of this governance  framework  for  Kering  and  the  robust mechanisms put in place (outlined below) to secure a balance of powers.\n\n## 1.2.2 Changes in the Executive Management team in 2023\n\nOn July 18, 2023, Kering announced a series of top appointments aimed at reinforcing stewardship of its Houses, further elevating its  operational  expertise  at  Group  level  and  strengthening  its organization.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Palus, who had served as Group Managing Director (with  the  same  powers  vis-\u00e0-vis  third  parties  as  the  Chief Executive  Officer)  and  a  Director  since  2008,  was  appointed President  and  CEO  of  Gucci  effective  October  3,  2023.  To  allow him to focus fully on his new role within the Group, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Palus resigned from his duties as Group Managing Director and as Director  on  October  3,  2023.  He  was  not  replaced  in  his  role  as Group Managing Director.\n\nThe  Group  also  announced  the  creation  of  two  Deputy  CEO positions  effective  September  1,  2023:  Francesca  Bellettini, President  and  CEO  of  Yves  Saint  Laurent  since  2013,  was appointed  Deputy  CEO  in  charge  of  Brand  Development  in addition to her existing responsibilities. In her new role, she is in charge of steering all the Group's Houses. Jean-Marc Duplaix, the Group's Chief Financial Officer since 2012, was appointed Deputy CEO in charge of Operations and Finance. In this role, he oversees all the Group's corporate functions.\n\nThe  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  is  assisted  in performing  his  duties  by  the  Executive  Committee,  which  had 12  members  as  of  December  31,  2023,  including  both  Deputy CEOs.  A  detailed  presentation  of  the  Executive  Committee members  is  provided  on  pages  22-23  of  this  Universal Registration Document.",

He  shall  ensure  that  the  corporate  structure operates properly and, in particular, that the Directors are able to fulfill  their  duties.  He  convenes,  draws  up  the  agenda  for  and chairs meetings of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn  his  role  as  Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive  Officer  holds  the  broadest  powers  to  act  on  the\n\n## 1.3 Balance of power\n\n## 1.3.1 The Board of Directors\n\nWith a view to achieving an effective balance of power, the Group takes steps to ensure that the Board's composition is harmonious and diverse. The Board of Directors is made up of Directors with a variety  of  complementary,  high-quality  profiles.  They  hold  or have  held  top-level  responsibilities  in  world-class  organizations and possess the expertise required to gain the clearest possible grasp of the Group's businesses and challenges and to fulfill their duties on the Board of Directors.\n\nAs  of  February  28,  2024,  the  Board  of  Directors  include  five independent  Directors  out  of  the  nine  taken  into  account  (the two Directors representing employees are not counted pursuant to  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code),  which  represents  a  degree  of independence of 56%, above the one-third level required by the AFEP-MEDEF Code for controlled  companies.  The  proportion  of women on the Board of Directors was 56% (excluding Directors representing  employees,  pursuant  to  article  L.  225-27  of  the French  Commercial  Code),  above  the  level  of  40%  required  by law.\n\nSince  2019,  the  Board  of  Directors'  members  have  included  a Lead  Independent  Director  with  a  special  remit  for  governance and shareholder relations presented in section 1.4 of this chapter.\n\nThe Board of Directors is also assisted in the conduct of its duties by four specialized Committees (Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee,  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee  and Sustainability  Committee).  These  Committees  prepare  and provide additional insights for the Board's work in the fields and duties  entrusted  to  them.  As  of  February  28,  2024,  60%  of  the members of the Appointments and Governance Committee and 67%  of  the  members  of  the  Sustainability  Committee  were independent (excluding Directors representing employees). Since January  9,  2024,  when  Tidjane  Thiam  left  the  Board,  half  the members  of  the  Audit  Committee  and  of  the  Remuneration Committee have been independent Directors (as of December 31, 2023, the degree of independence was 60%) and three of the four Committees are chaired by an independent Director (namely the Appointments  and  Governance  Committee,  the  Remuneration Committee and the Sustainability Committee).\n\nCompany's  behalf  in  all  circumstances.  He  exercises  these powers within the limits of the corporate purpose subject to the powers that the law expressly confers on shareholders' meetings and  the  Board  of  Directors.  The  internal  rules  of  the  Board  of Directors  place  limitations  on  the  powers  (as  set  forth  below) exceeding the statutory requirements beyond which any decision made  by  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  must  be authorized in advance by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  represents  the Company in its dealings with third parties.\n\nThe Executive Committee members report to him.\n\nExecutive  sessions  are  another  means  by  which  a  balance  of power is maintained between the Company's governance bodies. These  meetings  are  organized  without  the  executive  corporate officers  and  are  held  at  least  once  a  year,  in  line  with  the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code (see section 3.2.3 of this chapter for more details).\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Board of Directors discusses its operations every year and carries  out  a  formal  assessment  every  three  years.  At  the end  of  these  meetings,  the  Directors  set  new  objectives  for improving the quality of their organization and ensure that all important issues are suitably prepared and addressed.\n\nThe conditions of preparation and organization of the work of the Board of Directors are described in section 3 of this chapter.\n\n## 1.3.2 Limitations placed on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nTo  maintain  a  balance  of  powers  and  create  the  conditions  for harmonious governance, the Company has limited the powers of the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAccordingly, notwithstanding the statutory provisions governing  the  authorizations  that  fall  within  the  remit  of  the Board  (related-party  agreements,  endorsements,  suretyships and  guarantees,  divestments  of  shareholdings  or  sale  of  real estate, etc.), article 15 of the Company's Articles of Association and the internal  rules  of  the  Board  of  Directors  state  that  the following  decisions  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  require  the prior approval of the Board:\n\n- \u00b7 matters  and  transactions  that  have  a  substantive  effect  on the strategy of the Company or more generally of the Group, its financial structure or its scope of business activity;\n- \u00b7 except  in  the  event  of  a  decision  by  the  Annual  General Meeting,  issues  of  securities  of  all  types,  that  are  liable  to cause a change in the share capital;\n- \u00b7 the  following  transactions  by  Kering  SA  or  by  any  entity controlled by the Group, insofar as they each exceed \u20ac500 million, an amount set annually by the Board of Directors:\n- -all  investments  or  divestments,  including  the  acquisition, sale  or  exchange  of  holdings  in  all  existing  or  future businesses,\n- -all purchases or sales of Group real estate.",

The  two  Deputy  CEOs  appointed  on  July  18,  2023  effective September  1,  2023,  are  regularly  invited  to  attend  Board  of Directors'  meetings.  Their  involvement  enhances  the  dialogue between Directors and the operational and functional departments.\n\nEach Director is also entitled, if they so wish, to meet the Group's senior executives outside these meetings in order to gain a better insight into the Group's businesses or certain operational issues.\n\n## 1.4 Role and responsibilities of the Lead Independent Director\n\n## 1.4.1 Presentation of the Lead Independent Director\n\nIn  light  of  changes to the composition of the Board of Directors and following a discussion with the Company's shareholders in late  2018,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to  appoint  a  Lead Independent  Director  to  provide  additional  assurance  with regard to the balance of power.\n\nActing  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Appointments  and Governance  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  created  at  its meeting on February 11, 2019, the position of Lead Independent Director.\n\nFollowing  the  appointment  of  V\u00e9ronique  Weill  at  the  Annual General  Meeting  of  April  28,  2022,  the  Board  of  Directors entrusted  this  position  to  her.  She  replaced  Sophie  L'H\u00e9lias whose  term  of  office  expired  on  March  4,  2022.  She  brings  to Kering's Board of Directors her extensive experience, particularly in corporate governance.\n\n## 1.4.2 Lead Independent Director's responsibilities and powers\n\n## Organization of the work of the Board of Directors and relationship with Directors\n\nThe Lead Independent Director:\n\n- \u00b7 is  consulted on the agenda and schedule of Board meetings and may propose additional agenda items to the Chairman;\n- \u00b7 liaises  between  the  independent  Directors,  other  Board members and Executive Management. This includes maintaining  regular,  open  dialogue  with  each  of  the Directors, particularly with the independent Directors. It also involves organizing at least one meeting per year without the executive corporate officers;\n- \u00b7 prevents conflicts of interest. The Lead Independent Director brings  to  the  Board's  attention  any  potential  conflicts  of interest  identified  involving  executive  corporate  officers  or other Board members;\n- \u00b7 ensures  compliance  with  the  Board  of  Directors'  internal rules;\n- \u00b7 participates  in  the  process  of  assessing  the  Board  of Directors.\n\nA loss of independent director status would immediately put an end to the Director's role as Lead Independent Director.\n\nThe Lead Independent Director's responsibilities are described in the internal rules of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Relationship of the Lead Independent Director with shareholders\n\nThe Lead Independent Director:\n\n- \u00b7 in  coordination  with  the  Chairman  of  the  Board,  represents the Board  in its dealings with investors concerning environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG)  matters.  This includes  meeting  with  certain  shareholders  and  reporting their ESG-related questions back to the Board;\n- \u00b7 stays  informed  about  shareholders'  requests  in  relation  to corporate  governance  and  ensures  that  responses  are provided.\n\n## Resources\n\nThe Lead Independent Director:\n\n- \u00b7 has  access  to  all  documents  and  other  information  he/she deems necessary for  the  performance  of  his/her  duties  and may request that external technical studies be carried out, at the Company's expense;\n- \u00b7 is kept informed about the Company's activities on a regular basis.

He/she  may also be asked by the Chairman to report on his/her activities to Annual General Meetings.\n\nAt the end of each term of office served by the Lead Independent Director,  the  Board  of  Directors  reviews  the  resources  made available  to  the  Lead  Independent  Director  to  perform  his/her tasks  and  the  associated  powers  with  a  view  to  making adjustments, if necessary.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Lead  Independent  Director  provides  the  Board with a summary of the work carried out during the year.",

The  Climate  Change Lead's role is to make certain that climate issues are taken into account  at  the  highest  echelons  of  the  Group  and  given  full consideration  in  the  Board's  thinking  and  decision-making process.\n\nAt its meeting of April 28, 2022, the Board of Directors appointed Jean-Pierre  Denis  to  this  role.  He  possesses  expertise  in  risk management, including non-financial risks and the link between financial and non-financial performance, as well as in sustainable development, especially renewable energies and waste management.  Jean-Pierre  Denis  served  as  Chairman  of  Dalkia (renewable  energies)  from  1999  until  2003,  was  a  member  of Veolia  Environnement's  Executive  Board  from  2000  until  2003 and  is  a  director  of  Paprec  Holding  (recycling  and  waste processing). The experience and broad-ranging expertise of JeanPierre Denis, a member of Kering's Audit Committee since 2008 and of the Sustainability Committee since 2020, can be relied on to ensure internal control and risk management procedures are implemented  within  the  Group.  They  give  him  an  accurate picture  of  the  sustainable  development  and  environmental protection policies implemented within the Group.\n\nWorking together with the Chair of the Sustainability Committee and the Lead Independent Director, the main duties of the Climate Change Lead consist in:\n\n- \u00b7 ensuring  that  the  Board  at  large  and  each  of  the  Directors individually  have  a  clear  grasp  and  understanding  of  the climate change  priorities and  impacts,  generally  and specifically for Kering and the Luxury sector;\n- \u00b7 proposing  any  actions  deemed  relevant  to  enhance  the Board's overall expertise in the area (training, involvement of experts, etc.);\n- \u00b7 regularly  informing  the  Board  about  the  latest  advances  in scientific  knowledge  about  global  warming  (largely  focused on  the  IPCC's  work)  and  recent  developments  in  reporting obligations  for  businesses  in  the  area  (regulatory  news  and watch);\n- \u00b7 assessing  and  ranking  risks  and  opportunities  raised  by climate change  within  the  governance  framework  to guarantee  the  issue  is  addressed  strategically  as  part  of  a long-term approach;\n- \u00b7 ensuring the Group's climate ambitions comply with the Paris Agreement  and  are  aligned  with  the  highest  international standards  and  practices  (SBT,  Net  Zero  trajectory,  TCFD, European  Taxonomy,  shareholders'  expectations  and  other stakeholders,  etc.)  and  conducive  to  extending  the  Group's climate leadership;\n- \u00b7 participating in strategic direction discussions concerning the climate  and  transition  financing  trajectory  (resilience  and realignment  of  the  Group's  business  model  with  climate change priorities);\n- \u00b7 ensuring the climate dimension is a factor in all key decisions made  by  the  business  (innovation,  technology  decisions, investments, etc.);\n- \u00b7 reporting to the Board at least twice a year, in coordination with  the  Board's  Sustainability  Committee,  of  which  he  is  a member,  on  deployment  of  the  climate  strategy  within  the Group,  on  the  implementation  of  the  action  plans  and  the results of climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.",

A decision was made to organize this seminar following the internal assessment of the Board of Directors in late 2022, during the course of which the Directors requested specialized climate training. At the seminar held on May 4, 2023, presentations were given to Directors by internal\n\n- and  external  experts  on  a  variety  of  issues  related  to  the climate.  This  gave  them  a  complete  overview  of  the  global, industry and Group-related challenges (see section 3.4.1 below for more details);\n- \u00b7 the Climate Change Lead attended the preparatory meetings ahead  of  the  presentation  to  the  Audit  Committee  of  the measures put in  place  by  the  Group  in  advance  of  the  new sustainability reporting regime (\"CSRD\").\n\n## 1.6 Governance-related dialogue with shareholders\n\nKering  places  great  importance  on  the  dialogue  with  its shareholders and seeks to maintain and strengthen their trust by providing them with regular information on the Company's latest developments,  by  holding  meetings  throughout  the  year  and making sure that it answers any questions and responds to any comments they may have. These valuable discussions enable the Board  of  Directors  to  gain  clearer  insights  into  shareholders' expectations,  consider  new  ideas  and  make  changes  to  the Group's practices from a continuous improvement perspective.\n\nFrom a governance perspective, the Lead Independent Director and  the  Investor  Relations  Department  manage  this  dialogue under the oversight of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, in tandem with the Board Secretary and the Legal Department.\n\nIn  late  2023,  as  every  year  since  2018,  an  ESG  (environmental, social and governance) roadshow was held for major investors in the  Company  (representing  around  40%  of  the  free  float  and 22.5% of total share capital). The Lead Independent Director, the Board Secretary, the Chief Sustainability and Institutional Affairs Officer  and  the  Investor  Relations  Department  took  part  in  the roadshow.  These  meetings  provided  the  Lead  Independent Director with an opportunity to have conversations with investors about  the  Group's  governance,  including  recent  changes  to  its Executive  Management,  the  composition  of  the  Board  of Directors and the remuneration of executive corporate officers.\n\nThe Lead Independent Director reported in detail to the Board of Directors on the observations made and expectations expressed by  investors  at  the  event.  The  Board  considered  the  insights gained  and  in  particular  possible  changes  to  be  made  to  the remuneration  policy  for  executive  corporate  officers,  given  the approval rate of below 80% recorded for the 5th resolution of the Annual  General  Meeting  of  April  27,  2023,  concerning  the remuneration  awarded  and  paid  in  2022  to  the  Chairman  and Chief  Executive  Officer,  and  desirable  changes  to  the  Board's composition in view of the forthcoming expiry of terms of office.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Investor  Relations  Department,  working  in tandem  with  the  Board  Secretary  and  the  Legal  Department, holds  meetings  with  the  Group's  main  institutional  investors every  year  ahead  of  the  Annual  General  Meeting  to  explain  the resolutions  to  be  submitted  to  shareholders  for  their  approval. These meetings also provide a first-class opportunity to discuss the Group's governance arrangements.\n\nThe presentations given by Kering at these various meetings are made available on its website www.kering.com.\n\nPlease refer to section 2.6 \"Financial communications policy\" of chapter  7  \"Investor  information\"  for  further  information  about the Company's dialogue with its shareholders.",

Various  phases  have  been defined. The first  involves  determining  the  potential  changes  in governance that would be required in the event of a change at the Company's  helm,  based  on  an  extensive  study  of organizational practices in the industry and among Kering's CAC 40 peers.\n\nDuring their regular dialog, the Committee Chair discussed with the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  the  process  for appointing his successor, the required skills and expertise and a list of potential candidates.\n\n## 1.7.2 Succession plan for Executive Committee members, House CEOs and Creative Directors\n\nThe  succession  planning  process  for  the  Executive  Committee members, House CEOs and Creative Directors was also reviewed by the Appointments and Governance Committee at its meeting on December 19, 2023.\n\nPotential candidates, their career progress and their promotions are  assessed  on  a  regular  basis  by  the  Human  Resources Department  with  the  assistance  of  an  external  firm  for  the purpose of effective succession planning for these key positions and achieving the strategic goals of the Group and its Houses.\n\nThis assessment is conducted both internally during the annual talent  reviews  and  externally  via  continuously  monitoring.  One person  reporting  to  the  Deputy  CEO  in  charge  of  Brand Development is charged with spotting and tracking the progress of creative talent within the Group's Houses.\n\nThe  internal  and  external  talent  spotting  processes  underpin effective  succession  arrangements  for  key  roles,  remedying  the issues  that  can  arise  if  these  roles  are  vacated.  In  addition,  the collective  expertise  accumulated  by  teams,  especially  at  the creative studios in each of the Houses, remains the best means of safeguarding business continuity and the continued execution of the Group's strategy, especially during transition periods.\n\nIn addition, a gender balance analysis always forms part of talent reviews and succession planning.",

Following  her departure,  the  Board  of  Directors  set  in  motion  the  process  of selecting a new independent Director with solid expertise in the Luxury sector and an international profile, in line with its diversity policy.  The  process  culminated  in  Maureen  Chiquet  being coopted by the Board of Directors as an independent Director at its  meeting  on  July  18,  2023  for  the  remainder  of  Daniela Riccardi's term of office, that is until the Annual General Meeting called  to  approve  the  financial  statements  for  the  year  ended December 31, 2025.

His term of office as a Director was due to expire in April 2024.\n\n## 2.2.2 Changes in the composition of the Board of Directors to be proposed at the April 25, 2024 Annual General Meeting\n\nIn view of recent changes in its composition and terms of office due  to  expire  in  2024,  the  Board  of  Directors  has  pursued  its objective  of  strengthening  its  composition  and  began  in  2023  a\n\n(1)\n\nprocess to recruit new independent Directors. That process was led  by  the  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee  and overseen by its Chair with the help of an external consultancy, in accordance with the procedure for selecting new Directors.\n\nFollowing this  selection  process  and  after  a  thorough  review  of the candidates submitted for its approval, the Board of Directors, at its meeting on February 28, 2024, decided, upon recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, to submit to the Annual General Meeting of April 25, 2024,  the  appointment  of  three  new  independent  Directors: Rachel Duan, Giovanna Melandri and Dominique D'Hinnin. These proposals, in line with the diversity policy applied to the Board, will strengthen (i) the Board's expertise in terms of knowledge of the Asian market,  sustainability and  sustainable  finance, corporate governance and finance, (ii) the internationalization of the Board and (iii) the proportion of independent Directors.\n\nThe  professional  backgrounds  of  these  three  candidates  for election to the Board of Directors are presented below.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors also proposes to the Annual General Meeting of April 25, 2024, to:\n\n- \u00b7 ratify  Maureen  Chiquet's  cooption  as  Director,  decided  on July  18,  2023  and  effective  September  1,  2023.  Maureen Chiquet  brings  to  the  Board  her  sound  expertise  in  the Fashion, Beauty and Luxury sectors, after a 35-year career in these fields;\n- \u00b7 reappoint  Jean-Pierre  Denis  as  a  Director;  he  brings  to  the Board his financial and sustainability expertise, as well as his historical and in-depth knowledge of the Group.\n\nSubject to the corresponding resolutions being approved in the Annual  General  Meeting,  the  Board  of  Directors  will  have 13  members  (including  two  Directors  representing  employees). Of  its  members,  64% (1) will  be  independent  and  55% (1) will  be women. Six nationalities  will  be  represented  (American,  British, Chinese, French, Italian and Turkish).",

A Board with a diverse composition is in the best position to fulfill its duties with the requisite independence, objectivity and critical thinking.\n\nIn  particular,  the  Board  of  Directors  is  careful  to  make  sure  its members  possess  the  most  effective  skills  and  expertise  for addressing  the  Group's  strategic  priorities  and  challenges.  It endeavors  to  maintain  a  balanced  composition  in  terms  of  the Board's gender, independence, age, length of service, nationality and cultural background.\n\nPursuant  to  article  L.  22-10-10  of  the  French  Commercial  Code and  the  recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  the  table below describes the diversity  policy  applied  to  members  of  the Board of Directors. It indicates the criteria taken into consideration,  the  objectives  set  by  the  Board,  the  measures implemented  and  the  results  achieved  during  2023.  The information  is  presented  as  of  December  31,  2023  and  thus includes  Tidjane  Thiam,  who  left  his  role  as  a  Director  on January 9, 2024.",

the Appointments  and  Governance  Committee  and  ratified  by  the Board of Directors when a new director is appointed and, in any event, every year for all members of the Board of Directors.\n\nFor  the  purpose  of  assessing  whether  a  Director  can  be classified  as  independent  and  avoiding  possible  risks  of conflicts  of  interest,  the  Board  applies  as  an  analytical framework the criteria defined in the AFEP-MEDEF Code, which states  that  a  Director  is  considered  to  be  independent  if  they satisfy all the following independence criteria. They must not:\n\n- \u00b7 be  an  employee  or  executive  corporate  officer  of  the Company, or have been in such position in the past five years;\n- \u00b7 be an employee, executive corporate officer or Director of the Company's parent company or of a company that the latter consolidates, or have been in such a position in the past five years;\n- \u00b7 be an executive corporate officer of a company in which the Company  holds  a  directorship,  directly  or  indirectly,  or  in which an employee appointed as such or a corporate officer of  the  Company  (currently  in  office  or  having  held  office within the past five years) is a Director;\n- \u00b7 be  a  significant  customer,  supplier,  investment  banker  or commercial  banker  of  the  Company  or  the  Group,  or  for which  the  Company  or  the  Group  represents  a  significant portion of the activity;\n- \u00b7 have any close family ties with a corporate officer;\n\n- \u00b7 have  been  the  auditor  of  the  Company  within  the  past  five years;\n- \u00b7 have been a Director of the Company for more than twelve years, the maximum period for which a Director is considered independent.\n\nIn  reviewing  independence  with  regard  to  the  direct  or  indirect business  relationship  criteria,  an  additional  quantitative  and qualitative  analysis  is  performed,  if  necessary,  in  order  to determine  the  independence  of  individual  Directors  where  any such business relationship exists.\n\nIn 2023, further to a review by the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors meticulously analyzed - along with  all  other  criteria  -  any  business  relationships  between  the Kering  group  and  the  entities  or  groups  in  which  each Independent  Director  holds  a  directorship  or  exercises  their executive  responsibilities.  Based  on  the  Board's  analysis,  other than Tidjane Thiam, Serge Weinberg and Yonca Dervisoglu, none of the Directors and none of the entities or groups in which they hold a directorship or executive responsibilities have a business relationship  with  the  Company,  its  group  or  its  management team. The relevant Directors did not take part in discussions or the vote concerning their own position.\n\nThe Board of Directors analyzed the situation of Tidjane Thiam, the founder and chairman of Freedom Acquisition Corporation I, a  special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in which Art\u00e9mis (Kering's  controlling  shareholder)  has  invested  alongside  other investors.  The  Committee  found  that  the  company  in  which Tidjane Thiam is a corporate officer has a business relationship with  Art\u00e9mis,  which  is  an  investor  in  the  SPAC,  but  not  with Kering.  Accordingly,  the  Board  of  Directors  considers  Tidjane Thiam to be an Independent Director.",

        "page_content": "The  Board  of  Directors  also  conducted  a  quantitative  and qualitative  review  of  Serge  Weinberg's  status.  The  Group  has invested  in  investment  funds  managed  by  Weinberg  Capital Partners, the asset management company Mr. Weinberg founded and  in  which  he  serves  as  chairman  of  the  board  of  directors. After analyzing the situation, the Appointments and Governance Committee  concluded  that  as  of  the  date  of  Mr.  Weinberg's appointment, the amount of those investments was not material and they did not fall within the scope of the business relationship referred  to  by  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code.  Accordingly,  the  Board  of Directors  considers  Serge  Weinberg  to  be  an  Independent Director.\n\nThe Board of Directors conducted a quantitative and qualitative review regarding the status of Yonca Dervisoglu, Vice-President, Marketing  at  Google  for  the  EMEA  region,  and  of  business relations between Google and Kering in 2023.\n\nGlobal  business  between  these  two  companies  for  all  activities and  for  each  of  the  parties  was  well  below  the  1%  materiality threshold  set  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  and  is  not  likely  to influence the way Ms. Dervisoglu votes at the Board's meetings. Furthermore, Ms. Dervisoglu does not herself have any business connections  and  is  not  a  member  of  any  governance  body capable of giving rise to a conflict of interest. For these reasons, the  Board  of  Directors  considers  Yonca  Dervisoglu  to  be  an Independent Director.\n\nLastly, in connection with the decision to coopt Maureen Chiquet as  a  Director,  the  Board  of  Directors  reviewed  her  status  under the criteria for independence laid down in the AFEP-MEDEF Code and  with  due  consideration  given  to  the  service  agreement entered  into  subject  to  authorization  under  article  L.  225-38  of the French Commercial Code. The Board of Directors noted that the remuneration to be paid to Maureen Chiquet for conducting the  consulting  assignment  was  well  below  the  1%  materiality threshold set by the Board of Directors and that the short length of  the  assignment  (six-month  duration,  non-renewable)  was unlikely to compromise  the  new  Director's  independent judgment. Accordingly, the Board of Directors considers Maureen Chiquet to be an Independent Director.\n\nIn February 2024, the Appointments and Governance Committee conducted a fresh review of each Director's independence. This analysis  came  to  the  conclusion  that  the  2023  assessment remains  valid,  taking  into  account  the  fact  that  Tidjane  Thiam resigned from his role as Director on January 9, 2024.\n\nIn the case of Serge Weinberg, the Appointments and Governance Committee  noted  that  the  management  fees  paid  by  Kering  in relation  to  assets  managed  by  Weinberg  Capital  Partners amounted  to  \u20ac490,240  in  2023,  equal  to  2.51%  of  Weinberg Capital Partners' revenue. This figure is above the 1% materiality threshold set by the Board of Directors as a guideline for carrying out a more in-depth analysis. In Mr. Weinberg's case, the Board confirmed  that  he  is  an  Independent  Director  in  view  of  the general principle set out in the AFEP-MEDEF Code, according to which  a  Director  ceases  to  be  independent  if  their  business relationship  with  the  company  is  capable  of  affecting  their judgment.  The  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee  and subsequently  the  Board  of  Directors  carried  out  a  specific assessment  of  Mr.  Weinberg's  commitment  and  freedom  of expression  and  found  that,  in  any  event,  the  amount  of  assets managed  on  Kering's  behalf  by  the  various  investment  funds referred  to  above  is  likely  to  decrease  in  the  near  future, automatically  reducing  the  fees  paid  by  Kering  to  Weinberg Capital Partners.\n\nAccordingly, five of the nine Directors serving on the Board as of February  28,  2024,  other  than  the  two  Directors  representing employees (2) it being specified that Tidjane Thiam's term of office came to an end on January 9, 2024, were therefore classified as independent pursuant to the AFEP-MEDEF Code's independence criteria  (Maureen  Chiquet,  Yonca  Dervisoglu,  Emma  Watson, Veronique  Weill  and  Serge  Weinberg),  representing  a  degree  of independence of 56%. The Group thus satisfies the recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  namely  that  \"at least  one  third\"  of  Board  members  should  be  independent directors in companies with controlling shareholders.",

Prior to every reappointment of a Director, when a Director  leaves  office  and,  more  generally,  when  the  Board  of Directors  intends  to  increase  its  size  or  modify  its  composition, the  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee  reviews  the composition  of  the  Board  and  its  specialized  Committees  and assesses  the  requirements  in  terms  of  skills,  experience  and profile diversity.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Appointments and Governance Committee introduced a Director selection procedure. It applies to all Board members, other than the Directors representing employees who are chosen, pursuant  to  article  10  of  the  Company's  Articles  of  Association and in  line  with  the  relevant  statutory  provisions,  by  the  Social and Economic Committee or the European Works Council.\n\nWith the support  of  the  Appointments  and  Governance Committee, the Board of Directors lays down the types of profile and skills it is looking for, giving consideration to the findings of the annual internal assessment of the Board. During this process, the Directors are invited to give their opinion on the composition of  the  Board  and  any  needs  that  have  come  to  their  attention. Also  taken  into  account  are  the  conclusions  of  the  external assessment carried out at least once every three years, whereby an  independent  external  consultant  is  entrusted  with  mapping the skills and expertise and identifying any potential requirements.  Investor  expectations  and  observations  stated during  the  shareholder  dialogue,  recommendations  from  the market  authorities  and  best  practices  are  also  taken  into account.\n\n## Selection\n\n- \u00b7 Analysis by the Committee of the candidates put forward: suitability based on the needs identified, confirmation of conformity with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code (independence, number of corporate offices that may be held simultaneously, etc.)\n\n## Decision by the Board\n\n- \u00b7 Review by the Board of Directors of the shortlisted candidates\n- \u00b7 Decision by the Board: appointment or, where appropriate, cooption, of the selected Director subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting\n- \u00b7 Committee's recommendation to the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee  draws  up  the selection criteria for new Directors based on the wishes stated by the  Board  and  in  view  of  the  diversity  policy  concerning  its composition.  Under  the  Committee  Chairman's  oversight,  in some cases with the support of an external executive search firm, it leads the recruitment process.\n\nThe  shortlisted candidates  meet  with  the  Chair  of  the Appointments and Governance Committee. During these conversations, the candidate's career, motivations and availability are discussed at length.\n\nA list of candidates is then put forward to the Appointments and Governance Committee, which analyzes the experience, professional  and  personal  attributes  and  talents  of  each candidate  given  the  requirements  identified  and  the  diversity policy  applied  to  the  Board  of  Directors  (international  diversity, balanced representation of women and men, skills and expertise, age  profile,  etc.).  The  candidates'  skills  are  assessed  based  on factors, such as training, career and professional accomplishments. The Committee also confirms the suitability of the candidate profiles selected in view of the recommendations of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  concerning  the  Board's  composition (independence,  number  of  corporate  offices  that  may  be  held simultaneously,  etc.).  Following  this  analysis,  the  Committee formulates a recommendation for the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Board  reviews  the  various  shortlisted  applications  and decides, on a case-by-case basis whether to coopt the candidate, with any such decision being subject to ratification by the Annual General Meeting or to propose their appointment at the Annual General Meeting.",

It carries out the controls and verifications it deems appropriate.\n\nIn compliance with AMF recommendation no. 2012-05, the Board has adopted internal guidelines on the identification, control and evaluation of related-party agreements and agreements entered into  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  and  at  arm's  length  to ensure  that  agreements  entered  into  in  the  ordinary  course  of business and at arm's length actually meet the required criteria, in accordance with article L. 22-10-12 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nIn  addition  to  reiterating  the  regulations  applicable  to  the identification and classification of related-party agreements and agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business and at  arm's  length  (notably  by  the  Company's  Legal  Department, with  the  assistance  of  the  Finance  Department),  the  guidelines also  provide  for  the  regular  control  and  evaluation  of  such agreements by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. Anyone  directly  or  indirectly  involved  in  an  agreement  cannot participate in its evaluation.\n\n## 3.1.2 Board's commitment to nonfinancial performance\n\nThe Board of Directors determines the strategic direction of the Company  and  ensures  it  is  pursued  in  accordance  with  its corporate purpose, while paying close attention to the social and environmental issues linked to its activities.\n\nThe four specialized Board Committees play a role in formulating and monitoring the non-financial strategy. Each operates within its respective area of expertise, while coordinating their activities to  provide  a  cross-disciplinary  approach  to  CSR  issues,  as described below.\n\n## Audit Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 ensures  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  and  risk management systems in the Group;\n- \u00b7 pursuant  to  Order  no.  2023-1142  of  December  6,  2023 transposing the European Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive  (CSRD)  into  French  law,  the  Audit  Committee  has been given a remit to review the process for the preparation and certification of sustainability information.\n\n## Remuneration Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 makes recommendations to the Board of Directors concerning  the  remuneration  of  the  executive  corporate\n\nofficers,  including  the  non-financial  targets  for  annual  and long-term remuneration.\n\n## Appointments and Governance Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 discusses  governance  issues  related  to  the  operation  and organization  of  the  Board,  including  the  gender  diversity policy  applied  to  the  Board  and  to  the  senior  management bodies.\n\n## Sustainability Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 makes  proposals  to  the  Board  concerning  the  Group's strategic direction on the sustainability front.\n\nMinutes of each Committee meeting are provided to the Board of Directors,  ensuring  that  the  Board  receives  information  and maintains a regular dialogue concerning the non-financial issues studied  by  the  Committee.  Board  meetings  may  also  include  a separate agenda point to discuss certain issues.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  AMF  recommendation  no.  2012-02,  a decision was made in 2023 to organize on an annual basis a joint meeting  between  the  Audit  Committee  and  the  Sustainability Committee.  The  goal  is  to  enable  members  to  discuss  issues relevant  to  both  Committee,  such  as  the  Group's  non-financial risks  and  reporting  and  to  coordinate  their  work  on  these common areas of interest more effectively. The first joint meeting was held on January 31, 2024. Its agenda included a discussion of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the new sustainability reporting regime (regulatory environment and implementation of these obligations within the Group).\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors has introduced two positions held  by  its  members  who  have  been  given  special  ESG (environmental,  social,  governance)  responsibilities  to  ensure greater consideration of these issues in the Board's work:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Climate  Change  Lead,  whose  role  and  duties  are described  in  section  1.5  of  this  chapter,  ensures  climate issues  are  addressed  by  the  Board  of  Directors  as  part  of  a long-term  approach,  in  coordination  with  the  various Committees;\n- \u00b7 the  Lead  Independent  Director,  whose  role  and  duties  are described in section 1.4 of this chapter, represents the Board, in  coordination  with  the  Chairman  of  the  Board,  in  its dealings with investors concerning environmental, social and governance  (ESG)  matters  and  reports  investors'  concerns and observations in  this  area  to  the  Board.  V\u00e9ronique  Weill has held this role since 2022, and her membership of the four specialized  Board  Committees  ensures  these  issues  are  a factor  in  all  the  work  undertaken  by  the  Board  of  Directors and its Committees.\n\nIn  addition,  Kering  created  in  2022  a  department  focused  on Sustainable Finance. Its mission includes:\n\n- \u00b7 overseeing non-financial performance (social and environmental), which helps with financial planning relating to  energy transition and the decarbonization of the Group's business;\n- \u00b7 ensuring that the Group complies with the current and future non-financial reporting and green finance regulatory framework; and\n- \u00b7 ensuring that social and environmental issues are addressed in the Group's management and decision-making processes, particularly regarding investments and M&A.",

The diversity principles applied to composition of the Board of Directors are also applied more broadly across the Group  via  a  gender  diversity  policy  for  its  senior  management bodies.  Pursuant  to  this  policy,  as  of  the  date  of  this  report  on corporate  governance,  the  Executive  Committee  included  five women out of a total of 12 members.\n\nThe  establishment  in  2019  of  a  Diversity  and  Inclusion Department marked a new milestone in Kering's commitment to accelerating  and  expanding  its  actions  in  support  of  diversity, equality  and  inclusion  -  in  the  broadest  sense  of  the  term.  In addition, in line  with  the  Group's  2025  sustainability  strategy,  a diversity in the workforce criterion, with a particular emphasis on achieving  an  effective  gender  balance,  is  incorporated  in  the process  of  determining  the  annual  and  multi-annual  variable remuneration of the Group's executive corporate officers. These criteria are described in section 5 of this chapter.\n\nAlongside  its  commitment  to  social  responsibility,  the  Group believes that diversity and inclusion are a source of creativity and innovation  and  as  such  of  economic  performance.  This  is  why Kering makes every effort to establish a culture of equality at all levels of the organization.\n\nKering has defined and put in place an action plan to achieve a balanced gender mix - by 2025 - especially within the Group's senior management (Top 450 roles). This will notably involve:\n\n- \u00b7 measuring the representation of women in talent pools and succession plans;\n- \u00b7 promoting equality  in  recruitment  processes  by  introducing training  on  unconscious  bias  at  the  highest  level  (\"Kering Perspectives\" program) (see section 3.2.2 of chapter 4 of this Universal Registration Document);\n- \u00b7 monitoring  promotions  within  the  Group  by  gender  and management level;\n- \u00b7 measuring  gender  parity  at  each  management  level  on  a quarterly basis in all the Group's Houses using key indicators;\n- \u00b7 implementing a global parental policy;\n- \u00b7 giving women  a  voice  via  the  Diversity  &  Inclusion Committees put in place at all of the Group's Houses.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  45.2%  of  Top  450  roles  were  held by women.\n\n## 3.2 Functioning of the Board of Directors\n\nThe operating rules and procedures of the Board of Directors are defined by law and the Company's Articles of Association, along with  the  internal  rules  of  the  Board  and  its  four  specialized Committees (Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee, Appointments  and  Governance  Committee,  and  Sustainability Committee).\n\nThe  internal  rules  are  revised  on  a  regular  basis  to  bring  them into  line  with  changes  in  governance  rules  and  practices.  They are published in full on the Company's website, were updated at the Board  meeting  of  February  16,  2021  to  reflect  the amendments  to  the  Articles  of  Association  approved  by  the Annual General Meeting of June 16, 2020 (remit and powers of the Board in view of social and environmental issues; reduction in the number of shares that Directors must hold; removal of the role of non  voting  director  (censor))  and  to  add  a  new  section concerning  the  Lead  Independent  Director,  including  his/her remit and powers, and special remuneration. Each Committee's internal  rules  are  also  reviewed  on  a  regular  basis.  The  most recent  update  concerned  the  internal  rules  of  the  Audit Committee,  which  now  include  rules  for  the  approval  of  nonaudit  services  that  may  be  provided  by  Statutory  Auditors  and their networks.\n\n## 3.2.1 Length and staggering of terms of office\n\nThe Directors are appointed by the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders for a renewable four-year term of office.\n\nIn  order  to  avoid  reappointing  the  entire  Board  simultaneously and to facilitate a smooth renewal process, shareholders at the Combined  General  Meeting  held  on  May  7,  2009  adopted  an amendment to article 10 of the Company's Articles of Association staggering appointments of Directors over time.\n\nAccordingly, two terms of office will come to an end in 2024, three in 2025 and four in 2026.\n\nNote that Directors representing employees are chosen, pursuant to article 10 of the Company's Articles of Association and in line with  the  relevant  statutory  provisions,  by  the  Social  and Economic Committee or the European Works Council for a fouryear term of office.\n\n## 3.2.2 Meetings\n\nThe Board of Directors meets when convened by its Chairman, as frequently  as  the  Company's  interests  require  and  at  least  four times per year, by means of videoconferencing or conference call technology  where  appropriate,  in  accordance  with  the  Board's internal rules. In 2023, the Board of Directors met 14 times.",

        "page_content": "In addition, all Directors are entitled to attend specific meetings of  Committees of which they are not a member if they so wish, but without voting rights.\n\n## 3.2.3 Executive sessions\n\nIn accordance with the internal rules of the Board of Directors, an executive session - a meeting of the Directors with no executive corporate officer present - is organized at least once a year by the Lead Independent Director. This type of meeting format enables the  Directors  to  discuss,  without  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer or, up until October 3, 2023 the Group Managing Director,  being  there,  issues  such  as  the  functioning  and composition of the Board of Directors, the Group's strategy and performance  and  the  performance  and  remuneration  of Executive Management, alongside any other issues they wish to raise. The Board of Directors unanimously considers this to be a best corporate governance practice.\n\nThe Lead Independent Director arranged two executive sessions in  2023.  The  first,  which  was  held  on  March  22,  2023,  gave Directors  an  opportunity  to  consider  the  late  2022  internal assessment of the Board of Directors and its Committees and to discuss  desirable  changes  in  the  composition  of  the  Board  and the  organization  of  its  work.  The  second  executive  session  was held  on  December  7,  2023.  Directors  engaged  in  an  in-depth discussion  of  the  analysis  conducted  by  Maureen  Chiquet,  the newly appointed independent Director, as part of the six-month consulting assignment entrusted to her by Kering under a service agreement entered into on July 28, 2023. In it, she focused on the Houses'  brand  positioning  and  practices  in  terms  of  elevation, product  ranges,  communication,  customer  experience  and services and on investments in the Luxury industry.\n\n## 3.2.4 Information provided to Directors\n\nTo  allow  Directors  to  prepare  as  effectively  as  possible  for  the topics  to  be  considered  at  a  meeting,  a  comprehensive information  pack  is  sent  to  them  in  due  time  ahead  of  the meeting; it includes the necessary information on all items on the agenda  and  draft  minutes  of  the  previous  meeting.  These documents are made available to the Directors on a secure digital platform.\n\nThe Directors can take up matters with Executive Management at any  time  and  with  complete  transparency,  and  Executive Management  keeps  the  Directors  regularly  informed  of  all important events concerning the Company's business affairs. The Directors  are  in  regular  contact  with  the  Group's  senior executives,  who  take  part  at  the  strategic  seminars  and  other meetings of the Board of Directors and specialized Committees, according  to  the  items  on  the  agenda  and  the  Group's  latest developments.\n\nEach  Director  is  also  entitled,  if  they  so  wish,  to  meet  with  the Group's  senior  executives  and  House  CEOs  outside  Board meetings  in  order  to  gain  a  better  insight  into  the  Group's businesses or certain operational issues.\n\nThroughout  the  year,  Directors  receive  a  daily  press  review featuring articles about Kering and its competitive environment, plus  regular  briefings  on  financial  analysts'  reports.  A  weekly press  review  focused  on  the  strategic  aspects  of  the  Group's activities is also made available to Directors on the secure digital platform.\n\nThe Board of Directors may also call on any external advisors or consultants  to  obtain  an  independent  expert  opinion  on  any topics presented to it by the Company.\n\n## 3.2.5 Director induction and training\n\nSpecial attention is paid to inducting and training Directors.\n\nWhen they join the Board of Directors, new Directors follow an induction program  familiarizing them  with  the  Group's activities, strategic challenges  and  priorities,  its  internal organization,  its  culture  and  the  culture  of  its  Houses,  and  its governance. To help achieve this goal:\n\n- \u00b7 they  are  given  a  welcome  pack  containing  the  requisite documents to understand the Group's business activities, the Board's internal rules, the stock market code of conduct and conflicts of interest prevention  rules, the Articles of Association, the minutes of meetings over the past five years of the Board and of the specialized Committees of which they are members; and\n- \u00b7 individual  meetings  are  arranged  with  the  Chairman  and Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  Lead  Independent  Director  and the  Group's  senior  executives  (Houses'  CEOs,  Group  Chief Financial Officer, Chief Sustainability and Institutional Affairs Officer,  Chief  Communications  Officer,  Chief  People  Officer, Internal Audit Director and Group General Counsel).\n\nThroughout  their  term  of  office,  Directors  may  receive  training tailored  to  their  specific  needs  within  the  Board,  should  they deem  it  necessary.  Training  specially  designed  for  Directors representing  employees  is  also  arranged.  These  internal  and external training sessions are arranged and paid for solely by the Company.\n\nIn 2023, a special climate seminar was organized on May 4, 2023 (for more details, see section 3.4.1 below), in line with the wishes stated by Directors during the internal assessment of the Board of Directors and the specialized Committees carried out in late 2022.\n\n## 3.2.6 Ethics of Directors\n\nDirectors  must  act  in  the  interest  of  the  Company  in  all circumstances.\n\nDirectors  are  expected  to  attend  meetings  and  be  fully committed to  the  work  of  the  Board  and  its  Committees.  They should attend the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders.\n\nEvery Director (it being specified for all relevant purposes that no distinction  is  made  between  an  individual  Director  and  the permanent representative of a legal-entity Director) is bound by a confidentiality  obligation  with  regard  to  information  not  in  the public  domain  to  which  they  are  privy  in  the  course  of  their duties.  This  same  confidentiality  obligation  shall  apply  to  any person  invited  to  attend  meetings  of  the  Board  and/or  its specialized  Committees.  It  goes  beyond  the  mere  duty  of discretion  provided  for  in  article  L.  225-37  of  the  French Commercial  Code  and  a  general  obligation  not  to  disclose information about the affairs of the Board and the Group, without prejudice to the statutory provisions applicable to the disclosure of inside information.",

Accordingly:\n\n- \u00b7 the Directors must refrain from trading directly or indirectly in the listed securities and  financial  instruments  of  the Company  and  the  Group  for  a  period  of  30  calendar  days preceding  each  of  the  periodic  publications  relating  to  the annual and half-year  consolidated  financial  statements  and 15 calendar days preceding each of the quarterly publications relating  to  consolidated  revenue  and  ending  at  the  close  of the  trading  day  following  the  publication  of  the  relevant official press release. This closed period does not replace the statutory and regulatory provisions regarding insider trading with  which  each  member  of  the  Board  must  comply  at  the time they decide to trade, no matter when this might occur outside the defined closed periods;\n- \u00b7 the  same  obligations  apply  to  each  Director  insofar  as  they are privy to inside information;\n- \u00b7 the Directors are bound, in accordance with the regulations in force, to report to the Company and to the French Financial Markets  Authority  ( Autorit\u00e9  des  march\u00e9s  financiers ), any transactions effected in the Company's  securities by themselves or by persons closely related to them as defined by  the  regulations.  The  transactions  that  fell  under  this heading during 2023 are presented in section 4.5 below.\n\nPursuant  to  the  internal  rules  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  the Directors  must  hold  at  least  50  Company  shares  for  their  own personal account in accordance with article 10 of the Company's Articles  of  Association.  This  requirement  does  not  apply  to Directors representing employees pursuant to article L. 225-25 of the French Commercial Code. Should they not hold these shares already, Directors are obliged to acquire them within six months of their appointment.\n\n## 3.2.7 Prevention of conflicts of interest\n\nUnder the internal rules of the Board, each Director is required to inform  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  and  the  Lead  Independent Director  of  any  conflicts  of  interest,  even  potential  conflicts, between their duties to the Company and their private interests and/or  other  duties.  A  Director  must  not  participate  in proceedings or vote on any matters that concern them directly or indirectly.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors may ask the Directors at any time for a written statement confirming that they do not face any conflicts of interest.\n\nEach year, the Board of Directors assesses the independence of Directors with regard to conflicts of interest.\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, none of the corporate officers faces a potential conflict of interest between their duties with regard to the Company and their private interests or other duties  or  has  family  ties  with  another  corporate  officer  of  the Company.\n\n## 3.2.8 Honorary Chairman\n\nIn accordance with the option provided for under the Company's Articles  of  Association,  at  its  meeting  on  April  26,  2018,  which followed the Combined General Meeting, the Board of Directors decided to confirm Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, founder of the PPR group, since  renamed  Kering,  as  Honorary  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors. In this capacity, Fran\u00e7ois Pinault is invited to attend the meetings of the Board of Directors on a consultative basis.\n\nHe did not attend any of these meetings in 2023.",

The conclusions drawn from this assessment were presented in Kering's 2022 Universal Registration Document, which can be downloaded from its website.\n\nFollowing this assessment, in line with the wishes stated by the Directors,  the  following  measures  have  been  implemented  by the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 a climate training seminar was organized on May 4, 2023 (for further details, see section 3.4.1 of this chapter);\n- \u00b7 an  additional  executive  session  was  organized,  so  nonexecutive  Directors  met  twice  during  the  year,  namely  on March  22  and  December  7,  2023  (for  further  details,  see section 3.4.1 of this chapter);\n- \u00b7 the Board of Directors increased its industry expertise and its international  profile  with  the  arrival  of  US  citizen  Maureen Chiquet,  previously  Chanel's  Global  CEO,  who  joined  as  an Independent Director.\n\nIn 2023,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided,  acting  on  the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, to carry out a formal assessment by an independent external  consultant  and  entrusted  this  assignment  to  Egon Zehnder.  This  formal  assessment  took  place  one  year  ahead  of\n\nschedule  given  the  recent  changes  in  the  Board's  composition. Since  Egon  Zehnder  had  conducted  the  previous  external assessment  in  2021,  the  rationale  for  the  decision  was  that  it would be able to compare and contrast these two assessments very usefully. In addition, the consulting firm's working methods are highly reputed, and it is independent of the Company and its senior  executives,  since  it  has  not  been  retained  to  hire  new Directors  or  for  any  other  assignments  related  to  Kering's governance.\n\nThe assessment covered the following points:\n\n- \u00b7 the composition and role of the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 the  role  and  actions  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 the role and actions of the Lead Independent Director;\n- \u00b7 the meetings of the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 the contribution by the Board to the Group's strategy;\n- \u00b7 the Board's relationships with Executive Management;\n- \u00b7 the contribution performed by the Committees;\n- \u00b7 the individual contribution made by each Director; and\n- \u00b7 induction arrangements for new Directors.\n\nThe  results  of  the  assessment  were  reported  by  the  external  consultant  to  the  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee  on January 31, 2024 and then to the Board of Directors on February 28, 2024. The conclusions of the assessment are summarized below:\n\n## Main strengths\n\n## Areas for improvement identified\n\n- \u00b7 Satisfactory composition in terms of diversity of Director profiles  and  independence,  enhanced  by  the  addition since 2022 of top-level new Directors, whose arrival has injected fresh momentum into the Board and raised the quality of its discussions.\n- \u00b7 Atmosphere of trust and freedom of speech encouraged by  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  whose leadership qualities are unanimously recognized.\n- \u00b7 Significant progress  has  been  achieved  since  the previous external assessment in 2021:\n- -Frequency and fluidity of interactions between Directors have been increased;\n- -The  Lead  Independent  Director's  commitment  and contribution were highlighted and unanimously acclaimed.  Her  role  in  governance-related  dialogue with  shareholders  has  a  positive  impact  on  how  the Board deals with these subjects;\n- -Directors view the new  Executive Management structure unveiled on July 18, 2023 in a positive light, considering it may  enhance  the  dialogue  with operational and functional departments.\n- \u00b7 Quality  of  the  management  presentations  and  working papers provided to the Directors.\n- \u00b7 Quality of the Board discussions and work performed by the Committees.\n- \u00b7 Fluid and effective decision-making process.\n- \u00b7 Annual strategic seminar and climate seminar appreciated by Directors.\n- \u00b7 Enhance the composition of the Board in terms of industry expertise  and  knowledge  of  the  Group's  key  markets (especially the United States and Asia) with a special focus on candidates with CEO experience.\n- \u00b7 Broaden the range of participants at Board meetings to encourage  more  regular  input  from  the  Houses'  senior executives.\n- \u00b7 Continue  the  work  already  done  to  systematically devote a portion of meeting time to strategy and M&Arelated issues.\n- \u00b7 Increase the length of Board meetings to allow for longer discussions  and  concurrently  adjust  the  time  set  aside for management presentations.\n- \u00b7 Devote more time to business and commercial aspects, as well as cybersecurity,  compliance  and  human resources.",

The  goal  of  the seminar  was,  firstly,  to  provide  the  Directors  with  a  common knowledge  base  on  climate-related  issues  and,  secondly,  to present the forthcoming regulatory changes in the area. Internal and external experts gave presentations to the Directors. In the\n\ncourse  of  these  presentations,  they  outlined  the  scientific  and regulatory  background,  as  well  as  the  Group's  climate  strategy and the projects deployed under the strategy.

This  temporary  situation linked to a Director's departure will be rectified by means of the appointments to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of April 25, 2024, as presented in section 2.2.2 above.\n\nNo executive corporate officer is a member of the Committee, in line with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\n## Duties\n\nThe main role of the Audit Committee, which was established in December  2002,  within  the  limit  of  the  duties  of  the  Board  of Directors, is to review  the  annual  and  interim  financial statements, to verify the relevance, consistency and reliability of accounting methods applied by the Company and at the Group's main subsidiaries and the implementation of internal control and risk management procedures in the Group, to be familiar with the policies implemented within the Group in relation to sustainability  and  environmental  protection,  and  to  hear  from and  put  questions  to  the  Statutory  Auditors.  The  Committee  is notified  of  the  main  issues  identified  by  the  Kering  group's Internal Audit Department.\n\nThe Audit Committee reports to the Board on a regular basis and provides  it  with  opinions  or  recommendations  on  all  matters within its  scope  of  duties.  Meetings  of  the  Audit  Committee  are recorded in a written and approved report.\n\nIn exercising its role, the Committee is supported, in addition to the external auditors, by the Finance department and the Group's Internal  Audit  Director,  plus  the  General  Counsel,  who  are brought  in  to  present  their  work  and  answer  the  Committee's questions. The Committee can also retain external specialists and hear from any other individuals.\n\nEach  year,  it  reviews  the  fees  charged  by  the  Company's Statutory  Auditors  and  assesses  their  independence.  The  Audit Committee  also  considers  potential  Statutory  Auditors  for appointment.\n\nIn addition, the Committee issues recommendations to the Board of Directors in relation to the regular assessment of the terms of the Group's related-party and ordinary agreements. Accordingly, it reviews  on  an  annual  basis  payments  made  under  the agreement entered into between Kering and Art\u00e9mis (described in Note 31.1 to the consolidated financial statements, included in this Universal Registration Document), as well as any changes in such payments.\n\nThe Audit Committee members all possess recognized financial or accounting skills, bringing to bear their combined expertise in general and operational management of banks and businesses as evidenced  by  their  professional  career.  Jean-Pierre  Denis  was previously  Chairman  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Mutuel  Ark\u00e9a  and  a  Finance Inspector,  and  has  gained  considerable  executive  management experience.  V\u00e9ronique  Weill  has  held  various  responsibilities  in financial services, with investment banking her key focus. H\u00e9lo\u00efse Temple-Boyer,  Deputy  General  Manager  of  Art\u00e9mis,  and  Serge Weinberg,  founder  and  Chairman  of  an  asset  management company,  also  possess  respected  financial  expertise  combined with executive management experience. Given their professional experience  (described  in  section  2.1  of  this  chapter)  and  their first-class knowledge of the accounting and financial procedures applicable  to  groups  of  companies,  all  the  Audit  Committee's members have the requisite skills for their roles.\n\n## Work performed by the Audit Committee in 2023 and through to February 28, 2024\n\nThe  Committee  met  five  times  in  2023,  with  an  average attendance rate of 89%.\n\nThe  Chief  Financial  Officer (incumbent  changed  effective September 1, 2023) and the Chief Audit Executive were invited to each Committee meeting to present their work and answer the Committee's  questions.  The  Financial  Control  Director,  the Treasury Director, the Chief Sustainability and Institutional Affairs Officer,  the  General  Counsel,  the  Chief  Information  Security Officer,  the  Group  Privacy  Officer  and  the  Intellectual  Property Director also appeared before the Committee.",

It will be submitted for  the  approval  of  the  shareholders  at  Kering's  Annual  General Meeting to be held on April 25, 2024.\n\n## 5.1.1 General principles of the remuneration policy for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n## Principles for determining the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's remuneration\n\nThe  Company's  remuneration  policy  for  its  executive  corporate officer is set by the Board of Directors, based on recommendations  from  the  Remuneration  Committee,  in compliance with the Company's interests to ensure the long-term success and development of the business and embeds social and environmental issues arising from its activities.\n\nAn exhaustive approach is taken when determining the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's  remuneration,  taking  into  account all its elements in order to achieve a comprehensive assessment.\n\nThe Board of Directors seeks to maintain a balance between the various  components  of  remuneration,  with  most  remuneration consisting  of  short-  and  long-term  variable  elements  related  to the  Group's  performance  and  that  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe  remuneration  structure  and  the  criteria  on  which  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's variable remuneration is based  are  therefore  defined  and  modified  over  time  to  ensure that  the  amounts  paid  are  closely  aligned  with  the  extent  to which  the  Group's  strategic  objectives  (including  social  and environmental objectives) have been met.\n\n84% of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's remuneration is subject to performance conditions, reflecting his obligation to create medium- and long-term value.\n\nHis  variable  remuneration  (annual  and  long-term)  depends  on the  achievement  of  financial,  environmental  and  social  targets that  reflect  the  Group's  major  ambitions  in  these  areas.  The performance  criteria  are  precise,  varied,  directly  linked  to  the Group's strategic priorities, and mostly quantifiable.\n\nA  significant  proportion  of  variable  remuneration  is  awarded  in the form of shares subject to demanding  performance conditions. This is intended to encourage the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to make decisions and take actions with a view to  achieving  sustainable  profitability  over  a  long  period,  and aligns his interests with those of the Company's shareholders and other  stakeholders.  The  requirement  for  him  to  retain  a  large proportion of the performance  shares  awarded  to  him throughout his term of office also fosters a long-term vision and close correlation with shareholder interests.\n\nThrough these principles, the remuneration policy is intended to establish a clear, motivating framework that serves the Group's ambitions.\n\n## Process for determining the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's remuneration\n\nProcess  for  determining  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer's  remuneration  involves  three  of  the  Board  of  Directors' Committees.\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding:\n\n- \u00b7 the remuneration policy for executive corporate officers and Directors;\n- \u00b7 the  determination  and  weighting  of  the  quantifiable  and qualitative criteria of the variable remuneration, both annual and long-term, of executive corporate officers;\n- \u00b7 the  performance  target  achievement  rate  applicable  to  the variable  remuneration,  both  annual  and  long-term,  of executive corporate officers.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee regularly examines the remuneration  policy, and  is particularly attentive to its compliance with the key principles set out above.\n\nA review of the existing remuneration mechanisms is carried out annually to assess whether changes should be made.",

In  particular, market practices may be benchmarked, allowing objective consideration of  the  remuneration  policy  and  a  better  understanding  of Kering's  relative  position  in  terms  of  remuneration.  Where  such benchmarking takes place (both in terms of remuneration levels and the principles for determining and managing remuneration), comparisons  are  made  principally  with  the  benchmark  panel used by Kering when awarding long-term variable remuneration in  the  form  of  performance  shares,  made  up  of  eight  listed companies  in  the  Luxury  sector:  Burberry,  Ferragamo,  Herm\u00e8s, LVMH, Moncler, Prada, Richemont and Swatch. Other companies may also be taken into account based on their size and business sector.\n\nIn fulfilling its remit, the Remuneration Committee also relies on work  done  by  the  Group's  Human  Resources  and  Legal departments  which,  in  conjunction  with  the  Secretary  of  the Board of Directors, make recommendations to the Committee in their  respective  fields  of  expertise:  the  Human  Resources Department formulates proposals on the structure of remuneration, the weighting of its components and the choice of performance targets for variable remuneration, making sure that they are aligned with the Group's strategy; the Legal Department ensures  that  the  remuneration  policy  complies  with  applicable legislative  and  regulatory  provisions  and  with  the  principles  set out in the AFEP-MEDEF Code; it also ensures that the Committee is  fully  informed  of  market  best  practice  and  the  expectations and observations expressed by investors as part of shareholder dialogue and their voting policies, as well as by proxy advisors.\n\nDecisions  about  the  composition  of  the  executive  corporate officers'  remuneration and its modification over time - whether in relation to the balance between  fixed and  variable components or the choice of performance criteria - are based on proposals  made  by  the  Remuneration  Committee.  These proposals are predicated, in turn, on analyses and recommendations  provided  by  the  Group's  Sustainability, Human  Resources,  Remuneration  and  Employee  Benefits,  and Legal Departments.\n\nThe level of achievement of the financial targets for the executive corporate officer's  annual  and  long-term  variable  remuneration is  determined  by  the  Group's  Finance  Department.  The  level  of achievement of the non-financial targets is first assessed by the Remuneration Committee, which reports thereupon to the Board of  Directors.  This  assessment  is  based  on  information  provided by the Legal, Sustainability and Human Resources Departments, members of which may be present during the meeting to provide commentary.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nAs part of the process for determining variable remuneration, the Audit Committee examines each year the level of achievement of the applicable financial performance targets.\n\n## Sustainability Committee\n\nIn  addition  to  financial  performance  targets,  the  executive corporate officer's  annual  and  long-term  variable  remuneration is  also  based  on  the  achievement  of  non-financial  performance targets aligned with the Group's strategic priorities in this area, as established by the Board of Directors on the basis of work done by the Sustainability Committee.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  determines  the  remuneration  policy applicable  to  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer.  In particular, it ensures that the performance indicators and targets for annual and long-term variable remuneration components are aligned with the Group's strategy.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Board  of  Directors  discusses  and  approves payment  of  variable  elements  payable  in  accordance  with  the principles  adopted,  after  the  consolidated  financial  statements for the relevant year have been approved.\n\nThe Chairman and Chief Executive Officer does not take part in discussions or votes relating to his remuneration.\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nIn  accordance  with  legislative  and  regulatory  provisions  in force, shareholders are invited to vote on the following matters each year as part of the Annual General Meeting:\n\n- \u00b7 the remuneration policy for the executive corporate officer(s) ( ex-ante vote);\n- \u00b7 the  content  of  the  corporate  governance  report  setting  out details of remuneration paid or granted to corporate officers during the last financial year (global ex-post vote);\n- \u00b7 the  fixed,  variable  and  exceptional  components  of  total remuneration and benefits in kind paid during or awarded in respect of the last financial year to each executive corporate officer (individual ex-post vote).\n\n## 5.1.2 Components of the remuneration policy for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nIn  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  April  27,  2023,  the  resolution relating  to  remuneration  paid  during  or  awarded  in  respect  of 2022 to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (5th resolution) was approved by shareholders, with 77.44% voting in favor, and the remuneration policy for executive corporate officers for 2023 (7th  resolution)  was  also  approved  by  shareholders,  with  94% voting  in  favor.  Since  the  approval  rate  for  2022  remuneration was  less  than  80%,  the  Remuneration  Committee,  which  pays careful  attention  to  the  views  of  shareholders  and  takes  them into  account  as  part  of  Board-level  discussions  regarding remuneration, took the view that it was necessary to understand the reasons behind that approval rate and consider any action to be  taken  in  response.  The  Remuneration  Committee  has  met twice  for  that  purpose.  After  an  in-depth  analysis  of  investor expectations and comments as part of the shareholder dialogue process, both before the AGM and afterwards and during the ESG roadshow (for more details about shareholder dialogue regarding governance, please see section 1.6 of the present chapter), and after  examining  the  existing  remuneration  policy  in  the  light  of those responses, the Remuneration Committee made proposals to  the  Board  of  Directors  to  change  the  policy,  taking  into account some of the salient points made by shareholders.",

That target would constitute a new performance indicator when  determining  annual  variable  remuneration  and  would  supplement  the  criterion  based  on  protecting biodiversity used to determine long-term variable remuneration.  To  recap,  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer's  annual  variable  remuneration  for  2023  included a target relating to a commitment to reduce in absolute terms the carbon footprint of the  Group's supply chain (Scope 3 of the GHG Protocol). The Climate criterion proposed for inclusion in  the 2024 remuneration policy follows on from that target. Its inclusion in the determination of the  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's short- and long-term variable remuneration is intended to  ensure that the Group's Climate Strategy is implemented immediately and on an ongoing basis,  and to allow its fulfillment to be assessed over time.   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ongoing use of a criterion  relating to the protection                                                                                                                         | In line with the implementation in 2023 of a process to protect the Houses' intangible assets and  reputation, the Board of Directors proposes to maintain a target in this area, which would become  a performance indicator, in order to align the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's remuneration  as far as possible with the Group's priorities and strategic issues. This target would account for 10%  of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's annual variable remuneration for 2024.

        "page_content": "For 2024, the remuneration structure for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will comprise three components:  fixed remuneration,  annual  variable  remuneration  (short-term)  and long-term  variable  remuneration  (in  the  form  of  performance shares).\n\nThe relative weight of each component will be as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) LTI:  150%  of  the  fixed  remuneration  for  year  Y  +  target  annual variable remuneration for year Y-1.\n- (2) Annual variable remuneration: 150% of fixed remuneration.\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\nThe  fixed  remuneration  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer  is  determined  by  taking  into  account  the  following factors:\n\n- \u00b7 the level and complexity of the tasks and responsibilities of the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  compared  with those  of  an  executive  corporate  officer  of  a  group  of comparable size;\n- \u00b7 the incumbent's  experience,  background  and  level  of expertise;\n- \u00b7 market research and analyses relating to the remuneration of people in similar positions in comparable companies.\n\nIn line with recommendation 26.3.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's annual fixed remuneration is reviewed at relatively long intervals, and is used as  a  reference  for  calculating  his  annual  variable  remuneration and determining the value of his long-term remuneration.\n\n(1)\n\nFor  2024,  the  Board  of  Directors  proposes  leaving  the  annual fixed remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at \u20ac1,200,000, i.e., the same level as for the last seven years (1) .\n\n## Annual variable remuneration\n\nAnnual variable remuneration is designed to align the executive corporate  officer's  remuneration  with  the  Group's  short-term financial  and  non-financial  performance,  and  to  encourage  the achievement of its long-term strategic objectives. It is stated as a percentage of annual fixed remuneration and has no guaranteed minimum amount.\n\nIf  all  targets  are  hit,  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer's annual  variable  remuneration  equals  150%  of  his  annual  fixed remuneration.  In  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  annual  variable  remuneration  is  capped  at 203%  of  his  annual  fixed  remuneration  if  targets  are  exceeded (achievement rate of over 125% for financial targets and of 100% for non-financial targets).\n\nThe  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer's  annual  variable remuneration for 2024 depends on:\n\n- \u00b7 the  achievement  of  financial  targets  based  on  the  Group's recurring operating  income  and  free  cash  flow  from operations, which determine 70% of the total, and\n- \u00b7 the achievement of non-financial targets based on indicators relating  to  the  climate  (10%),  organization  and  talent management  (10%)  and  the  protection  of  the  Group's intangible assets (10%), which determine 30% of the total.\n\n## Criteria for annual\n\n## variable remuneration\n\n<!-- image -->",

For  confidentiality  reasons,  the  targets  associated  with financial  criteria  are  not  disclosed  at  the  time  they  are  set  but disclosed ex-post as part of reporting  on  their  level  of achievement.\n\nThe assessment of each performance target's level of achievement  is  based  on  a  detailed  proposal  prepared  by  the Remuneration Committee, which relies in particular on objective information  reported  by  the  Group's  Finance  Department, Human  Resources  Department,  Sustainability  Department  and Legal Department in relation to the predefined targets.\n\nThe above-described principles for the determination of annual variable  remuneration  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer  will  be  pursued  in  2024  subject  to  the  approval  of  the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on April 25, 2024.\n\nAnnual variable remuneration due for 2024 will be paid in 2025, following  the  2025  Annual  General  Meeting's  approval  of  the financial statements. Payment is also subject to the approval of the 2024 remuneration policy in the Annual General Meeting on April 25, 2024.\n\n## Factors determining the payment of annual variable remuneration\n\nThe factors determining payment of annual variable remuneration are the same as for previous years and function as described in the table below.\n\nFor the financial targets (70% of annual variable remuneration), the  achievement  rate  must  be  at  least  75%  for  each  target  for variable remuneration to be paid. If targets are met exactly, the variable  remuneration  awarded  corresponds  to  100%  of  the target amount. If the achievement rate reaches or exceeds 125%, 150% of the target amount is paid out.\n\nThe  percentage  payment  for  the  non-financial  targets  (30%  of annual variable remuneration) may vary between 0% and 100% depending  on  the  assessment  made  by  the  Board  of  the achievement rate of the targets.",

For example, for 90% achievement of the target, an executive corporate officer would receive 60% of the annual variable remuneration; or for 110% achievement of the target, 120% of the annual variable remuneration.\n\n## Long-term variable remuneration\n\n## Awards of performance shares\n\nSince 2020, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's long-term remuneration has been based on free grants of shares subject to performance  conditions  assessed  over  three  years,  replacing Kering Monetary Units (KMUs).\n\nThis system serves to tighten the link between the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's remuneration and his direct contribution to the long-term performance of the company, while also aligning its interests with the interests of shareholders.\n\nFree  awards  of  performance  shares  are  accompanied  by  share awards  for  employees  in  key  positions  within  the  Group.  The award  of  performance  shares  to  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer is capped at 20% of the total shares granted by the  Board  of  Directors  during  each  fiscal  year,  subject  to  an\n\noverall  limit  on  awards  equal  to  1%  of  the  Company's  share capital on the award date.\n\nThe  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer's  long-term  variable remuneration equals 150% of his annual fixed remuneration and his annual variable remuneration due in respect of the previous year. It is aimed at encouraging him to take decisions with a longterm  view,  thereby  strengthening  the  close  link  between  his overall  remuneration  and  Group  performance  in  line  with  best practice  in  the  international  market.  The  Chairman  and  Chief Executive  Officer's  long-term  variable  remuneration  does  not include any guaranteed minimum amount.\n\nThe duration of vesting period of the shares is three years, in line with  the  period  over  which  the  performance  conditions  are assessed and with customary market practice.\n\n149 -",

The  reference  panel comprises the shares of the following eight listed companies in the Luxury sector: Burberry, Ferragamo, Herm\u00e8s, LVMH, Moncler, Prada, Richemont and Swatch.\n\nIt  follows  that  the  number  of  vested  shares  based  on  the achievement  of  financial  and  non-financial  targets  may  be reduced by half if the Kering share underperforms the reference index  by  more  than  50%.  Conversely,  if  the  Kering  share  price outperforms, the number of vested shares based on financial and non-financial  criteria  may  be  increased  in  proportion  to  this outperformance by up to 50%.\n\nAs a result, the number of shares vesting at the end of the vesting period  may  vary  from  0%  to  150%  of  the  number  of  shares awarded  under  the  plan  based  on  the  assessment  of  financial performance, non-financial performance and share price performance.",

It is established in accordance with article L. 22-10-8 of the French Commercial Code and with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nAccordingly,  Directors'  remuneration  consists  of  a  fixed  portion (40%)  and  a  larger  variable  portion  (60%)  that  depends  on Directors' actual attendance in meetings of the Board of Directors and  of  the  Committees  of  which  they  are  members.  The remuneration  policy  for  Directors  is  consistent  with  the Company's corporate interest.\n\nThe variable remuneration allocated to the Directors depends on their  actual  attendance  at  meetings  of  the  Board  and  of  the specialized Committees of which they are members, and on the time and effort required of them to prepare for and participate in these  meetings.  The  Lead  Independent  Director  also  receives additional remuneration, which is subject to the achievement of predefined  objectives  relating  to  her  duties,  as  described  in section 1.4 of this chapter. The Climate Change Lead also receives a  higher  level  of  remuneration  for  performing  his  duties,  as described in section 1.5 of this chapter.\n\nThe  Remuneration  Committee  prepares  and  monitors  the remuneration  policy for Directors. The total amount  of remuneration  allocated  to  the  Directors  and  its  apportionment are approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Board and Remuneration Committee meetings that deal with the  remuneration  policy  for  Directors  are  carried  out  in  strict compliance  with  the  procedures  for  preventing  and  managing conflicts of interest, which are described in the Board's internal rules, and Directors do not participate in discussions or votes on resolutions that relate to their own remuneration.\n\nFinanci\u00e8re  Pinault,  which  controls  Kering,  has  waived  all remuneration  in  respect  of  its  duties  as  a  Director  within  the Group (including as a Director of Kering SA) and as a member of the specialized Board Committees.\n\nConcetta Battaglia and Vincent Schaal, the Directors representing employees,  both  have  a  permanent  employment  contract  with the Company or a Group company.\n\n## 5.2.2 Components of the remuneration policy for members of the Board of Directors\n\nIn  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  April  22,  2021,  the  maximum total annual remuneration that may be paid to members of the Board of Directors in respect of their duties was set at \u20ac1,400,000.\n\nIt is proposed that:\n\n- \u00b7 the total annual remuneration  paid  to  Directors  be maintained at \u20ac1,400,000;\n- \u00b7 the special remuneration awarded to the Lead Independent Director  be  increased  from  \u20ac50,000  to  \u20ac75,000  given  her increased responsibilities, particularly in view of her participation,  from  2024,  in  the  roadshow  for  significant investors  in  the  Company  ahead  of  the  AGM,  together  with her participation in the ESG roadshow, and in view of the time and  effort  she  is  required  to  invest  in  those  events  and  to prepare  for  meetings  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and specialized Committees, and to ensure that the remuneration offered  by  Kering  remains  competitive  with  that  offered  by other CAC 40 companies;\n- \u00b7 except  for  the  change  relating  to  the  special  remuneration awarded  to  the  Lead  Independent  Director  as  presented above, the apportionment of Director remuneration, described below, be left unchanged.\n\nThe  apportionment  between  the  fixed  portion  (40%)  and  the variable portion (60%) that depends on members' attendance in meetings  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  of  the  specialized Committees, remains unchanged.\n\nDirectors'  remuneration  is  thus  allocated  in  the  following manner:\n\n- \u00b7 a fixed portion, minus (i) a special portion corresponding to the  remuneration  of  the  Chairs  of  the  Audit,  Remuneration, Appointments and Governance, and Sustainability Committees, respectively (\u20ac23,000 each), (ii) a special portion allocated to the Lead Independent Director for her role on the Board (\u20ac75,000 for 2024), and (iii) a special portion allocated to  the  Climate  Change  Lead  (\u20ac23,000),  with  the  remainder being allocated with a coefficient of 1 per Board membership, increased by 0.5 per Committee;\n- \u00b7 a  variable  portion,  allocated  with  a  coefficient  of  1  per presence  at  each  meeting  of  the  Board  and  0.5  for  each attendance of a Committee meeting.\n\nThe remuneration allocated to the Lead Independent Director will be subject to the achievement of objectives set in advance by  the  Board  of  Directors.  The  Lead  Independent  Director's objectives for 2024 will be the following:\n\n- \u00b7 promote  and  maintain  a  good  relationship  between  the Board and its shareholders and investors;\n- \u00b7 coordinate  the  internal  assessment  of  the  Board  and  its members;\n- \u00b7 facilitate and build relationships within the Board, including by holding meetings without executive corporate officers;\n- \u00b7 ensure  the  effective  implementation  of  mechanisms  to prevent and resolve potential conflicts of interest;\n- \u00b7 report,  on  a  regular  basis,  to  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  on the performance of her duties.\n\nThis remuneration policy applies to all members of the Board of Directors, including those who  represent  employees  but excluding  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  who  from 2024 will no longer receive remuneration in respect of his role as a  Director, in accordance with the 2024 remuneration policy for the  executive  corporate  officer  described  above  and  subject  to approval in the April 25, 2024 AGM.",

At that point, the beneficiaries could receive the  cash  equivalent  of  their  KMUs  based  on  the  last  assessed value. A table summarizing the KMUs granted to each executive corporate  officer  that  are  still  vesting  or  are  available  to  be cashed in, is shown below.\n\nTo  align  the  multi-annual  variable  remuneration  system  with the  Group's  long-term  performance,  vesting  of  the  KMUs awarded to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group  Managing  Director  was  subject  to  the  fulfillment  of performance  criteria  based  on  three  financial  indicators assessed at Group level:\n\n- \u00b7 recurring operating income;\n- \u00b7 free cash flow from operations;\n- \u00b7 recurring operating margin.\n\nUnder  this  system  put  in  place  in  2017,  if  an  increase  was observed  in  at  least  one  of  these  three  indicators  between  the average  amount  over  the  three-year  vesting  period  and  the amount shown in Kering's consolidated financial statements for the  year  preceding  the  year  of  the  grant,  100%  of  the  KMUs granted were cashed in (the change in each indicator is measured at  constant scope and as reported). Failing this, the KMUs were definitively forfeited.",

This value was then weighted for the performance of the Kering share relative to the basket of benchmark stocks.\n\nAt  the  end  of  each  six-month  period,  the  value  of  a  KMU  was calculated as follows:\n\n|                  | UVs+1  =  UVs  x  ([1+VKs+1]  +  ([1+VKs+1]  x  [1+VKs+1]  /   |\n|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| [1+VPVs+1])) / 2 |                                                                |\n\n## Where:\n\nUV = Unit of Value.\n\ns+1  =  the  six-monthly  closing  date  at  which  the  unit  of  value  is assessed (06/30 or 12/31).\n\ns = the previous six-monthly closing.\n\nVK  =  the  change  in  the  Kering  share  price  over  the  six-month period, using the average share price over the 30 days preceding the six-monthly closing as the reference price.\n\nVPV = the change in the price of a panel of stocks over the sixmonth period, equal to the arithmetic  average  change  in  these stocks, using the average share price over the 30 days preceding the six-monthly closing as the reference price.\n\nThe following companies were used to compile the benchmark: Burberry,  Ferragamo,  LVMH,  Prada,  Richemont,  Swatch  and Tod's.\n\nBetween  2018  and  2022,  the  value  of  the  KMUs  fluctuated  as follows:\n\n| Date              | KMU Value   |\n|-------------------|-------------|\n| June 30, 2018     | \u20ac885        |\n| December 31, 2018 | \u20ac753        |\n| June 30, 2019     | \u20ac988        |\n| December 31, 2019 | \u20ac1,168      |\n| June 30, 2020     | \u20ac1,095      |\n| December 31, 2020 | \u20ac1,219      |\n| June 30, 2021     | \u20ac1,525      |\n| December 31, 2021 | \u20ac1,387      |\n| June 30, 2022     | \u20ac954        |\n| December 31, 2022 | \u20ac910        |",

Following the decision made by the Board of  Directors  of  March  2,  2023  to  defer  payment,  the  sum was paid out in full in May 2023.\n\n## Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Palus - Group Managing Director until October 3, 2023\n\nThe former Group Managing Director had no KMUs that were yet to vest or available for cashing-in in 2023.\n\nThe cashing-in of KMUs awarded under the 2019 plan was completed in April 2022 based on a value of \u20ac1,387 per KMU at December 31, 2021, corresponding to an amount of \u20ac2,113,788, which was paid out in full in May 2022, as shown in Table 2 on page 155 above.\n\n<!-- image -->",

in place.\n\n## Pay ratios between the level of remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the former Group Managing Director and the average and median remuneration of Company employees\n\nIn  accordance  with  article  L.  22-10-9  of  the  French  Commercial Code, the following table presents the ratios between the level of remuneration  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and the former Group Managing Director and the average and median remuneration  of  Company  employees  on  a  full-time  equivalent basis over the past five years.\n\nThese ratios were established in line with the AFEP guidelines on remuneration  multiples  published  on  January  28,  2020  and updated in February 2021.\n\nFor  the  executive  corporate  officers,  the  components  of remuneration taken into account are:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed remuneration in year Y;\n- \u00b7 annual variable remuneration paid in year Y for year Y-1;\n- \u00b7 the value of the long-term remuneration granted during the year;\n- \u00b7 remuneration paid in respect of duties as a Director (formerly known as Directors' fees) paid in Y;\n- \u00b7 exceptional remuneration (where applicable) granted in Y;\n- \u00b7 benefits in kind.\n\nIn  accordance with the AFEP guidelines, the 2023 remuneration of the Group Managing Director in office until October 3 2023 was annualized.\n\nFor  the  employees  (on  a  full-time  equivalent  basis),  the components of remuneration taken into account are:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed remuneration in Y;\n- \u00b7 annual variable remuneration paid in year Y for year Y-1;\n- \u00b7 individual bonuses paid in Y;\n- \u00b7 profit-sharing and incentives paid in year Y;\n- \u00b7 the  value  of  performance  shares  granted  during  the  year  at their IFRS value;\n- \u00b7 the value of any other long-term incentives awarded;\n- \u00b7 benefits in kind.\n\nThe ratios are calculated on the basis of remuneration paid and awarded during the year.\n\nTo make them more representative, these fairness ratios have been calculated for two different scopes of analysis:\n\n- \u00b7 the legal scope covering Kering SA, the listed company, with 820 employees in 2023;\n- \u00b7 a broader scope of analysis including employees of Kering SA as well as employees of all its subsidiaries located in France, over  which  Kering  SA  has  exclusive  control  within  the meaning of article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code, i.e.,  5,085  employees in 2023, representing 100% of Kering's workforce in France.\n\nData for the larger scope of analysis are available only from 2019, when the joint payroll system that can provide such consolidated figures was introduced.\n\nIn  2023,  following  the  acquisition  of  UNT,  Usinages  &  Nouvelles Technologies, and the creation of Kering Beaut\u00e9, the employees of  the  concerned French-based subsidiaries have been included in the data for the broader scope.\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  held  the  position  of  Chairman  and  Chief Executive  Officer  during  the  five-year  period  in  question. Jean -Fran\u00e7ois  Palus  held  the  position  of  Group  Managing Director until October 3, 2023.",

The aim  is  to  gain  a  full  appreciation  of  their  concerns  and  expectations,  and,  as  far  as  possible,  to  incorporate  these  aspects  into  the Group's strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.3 Materiality analysis and non-financial risks: our priorities\n\nKering is rolling out its ambitious 2025 Sustainability Strategy, which builds on three components: the vision and ambition adopted at the  highest  level  of  the  Group,  the  materiality  assessment  and  the  non-financial  risk  assessment,  which  identifies  accurately  key challenges and risks throughout the value chain.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Since 2013, this approach has allowed Kering to identify the key topics relating to its  vision  and  its  business  activities  (based  on their  economic,  environmental  and  social  impacts  as  well  as governance), and how key stakeholders assess them.\n\n## 1.3.1.1 Materiality assessment methodology and stakeholder engagement process\n\nKering  consulted  its  stakeholders  around  the  world  in  2020  in order  to  feed  its  materiality  assessment.  This  three-step materiality  assessment  drew  on  various  existing  guidelines  for stakeholder engagement (GRI, AA1000 and ISO 26000). The first step  enabled  to  list  28  topics,  on  which,  in  a  second  step, stakeholders were consulted through a quantitative survey and strategic  interviews.  Almost  70  external  stakeholders  (investors, suppliers and  business  partners,  distributors  and  clients,\n\nSTAKEHOLDER EXPECTATIONS\n\nrepresentatives  of  civil  society,  local  communities  and  NGOs, academics, public authorities and regulators, peers, professional organizations and innovators) and internal stakeholders (management,  top  management  at  Kering  and  its  Houses, functional  departments)  were  consulted.  A  steering  committee made  up  of  members  of  the  Group's  main  functional departments  were  involved  throughout  the  project,  which  was supported by a team of independent consultants. The final step involved consolidating and ranking the results in the materiality matrix.\n\n## 1.3.1.2 Analysis of results\n\nKering's  materiality  matrix  includes  28  topics  with  high  overall importance,  broken  down  into  four  categories:  planet,  people (social  and  societal  topics),  profit  (business)  and  governance. These  topics  are  arranged  in  a  three-level  hierarchy,  which provides  useful  information  that  allows  the  Group  to  better understand,  manage  and  prioritize  its  actions  in  the  short  and medium-term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIMPORTANCE FOR KERING\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCore challenges\n\nMajor challenges\n\nCrucial challenges\n\nPlanet\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGovernance\n\nProfit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The  results  of  the  assessment  confirm  that  Kering's  strategic pillars defined in its 2025 Sustainability Strategy and its business model,  as  well  as  the  commitments  made  since  2020,  are consistent  with  the  expectations  of  external  stakeholders.  In 2020,  stakeholders  identified  four  topics  that  were  gaining traction - biodiversity, sustainable procurement and responsible supplier relations, employee well-being, and cybersecurity - and this has been confirmed in the light of societal changes and new regulations.\n\nSustainability topics included in the matrix are therefore covered by  action  plans  and  key  performance  indicators  as  part  of Kering's 2025 Sustainability Strategy (see section 1.4).\n\nIn addition, in 2023, Kering began work relating to the entry into force of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), involving  all  relevant  internal  stakeholders  and  functional departments (Sustainability, Risk Management, Finance, Human resources,  Legal  and  Compliance  departments,  representatives of  the  Houses,  etc.).  This  work  included  updating  the  Group's approach  to  materiality  by  adopting  a  double  materiality assessment,  establishing  the  methodology  in  accordance  with the  European  Sustainability  Reporting  Standards  (particularly ESRS 1 and 2), with the support of an independent consultancy firm.  In  particular,  the  materiality  assessment  was  defined  in accordance  with  the  Group's  risk  analysis.  Thus,  the  review  of sustainability  matters  and  the  associated  impacts,  risks  and opportunities took into account the risk factors already identified by the Group.\n\n## 1.3.2 Stakeholder dialogue and actions of the Group and its Houses\n\nTo  stay  closely  attuned  to  its  stakeholders'  priority  challenges and  contribute  to  the  movement  toward  more  sustainable Luxury,  Kering  has  defined  a  consultation  approach  based  on dialogue and analysis of stakeholder expectations at the Group level. This analysis is updated annually. It was reviewed in-depth as part of the preparatory work conducted for the CSRD's entry into force, to ensure that relevant stakeholders were considered in the double materiality assessment.\n\nBeyond its materiality assessment, Kering takes multiple actions at the local, national and international levels and participates in many initiatives and associations with its stakeholders or as part of  multi-party  stakeholder  coalitions.  Kering  encourages  each House  to  develop  its  own  dialogue  platforms  at  a  more operational level.\n\nKering  updates  annually  a  thematic  factsheet  presenting  in  a synthetic  and  non-exhaustive  way  the  materiality  assessment and  the  main  expectations  identified,  the  ways  in  which  the Group interacts with each stakeholder category and the actions implemented.  It  is  available  on  the  Group's  website,  section Sustainability/Measuring our impact/Reporting and indicators.\n\n## 1.3.3 Non-financial risk assessment\n\nEach year, Kering carries out a detailed analysis of the risks that the  Group  may  face,  including  non-financial  risks  that  could jeopardize  its  ability  to  maintain  its  overall  performance.  The approach as a whole and all aspects generally relating to risks are presented in chapter 5 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nRisks  relating  to  the  categories  included  in  the  Non-Financial Information Statement (NFIS) as defined in article L. 225-102-1 of the  French  Commercial  Code  -  environment,  social/societal, human rights, corruption and tax evasion - are thus an integral part  of  the  Group's  overall  risk  identification  and  management process, and as such are described in chapter 5 of this document.\n\nThe  Sustainability  department  is  involved  in  the  process  of identifying and classifying the risks that fall within its scope. This risk  assessment extends beyond Kering's operations and covers the entire value chain from the sourcing of raw materials to the use  of  products  made  by  the  Group's  Houses,  fully  consistent with the materiality assessment of sustainability issues including the  review  of  stakeholders'  expectations,  the  recommendations of  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-related  Financial  Disclosures (TCFD), and other analytical work conducted by Kering, including the EP&L. As a result, eight main risks out of the NFIS categories have been identified.\n\nThe  following  table  sets  out  the  risks  identified  in  chapter  5  in view of the main topics in the materiality matrix and the sections of  the  NFIS  that  present  the  related  policies,  initiatives,  results and associated performance indicators.",

All categories of Scope 3 emissions have been included in this target following the work done by Kering in 2023 to extend the quantification of Scope 3 emissions, including for the least material sources of emissions.\n\n- (4) Intensity  measured on an identical scope on the basis of 2015 EP&L categories (excluding impacts relating to use of products, end-of-life treatment  of  products,  capital  expenditure,  franchises,  financial  investment,  employee  commuting  and  product  waste,  corresponding  to Categories 2, 5, 7, 11, 12, 14 and 15 of Scope 3 of the GHG Protocol). Cf. section 5.1.1 for more information about the EP&L 2023.\n\n- (6) Scope 1, 2 and 3 2022 emissions excluding use of sold products (Scope 3 - Category 11 of the GHG Protocol) and end-of-life treatment of sold products (Scope 3 - Category 12), as calculated for 2022 reporting. These offset emissions therefore do not include the new Scope 3 categories or  the  methodological  adjustments  calculated  in  2023.  See  section  5.2.4.4  for  more  information  about  carbon  offsetting  in  2023  and  the amount of related credits.\n\n## Collaborate with people\n\n| Objectives                                   | 2023 results and highlights                                                                                                                                        | Main strategic advances                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Preserve know-how                            | \u00b7 Approximately 10  craftsmanship  excellence programs  in haute  couture, leather goods and jewelry  benefiting more than 1,950 learners  and employees in 2023   | 1,700+ people  trained in excellence programs at our Houses,  such as Gucci and  Instituto Secoli , Institut Saint Laurent Couture,  Pomellato Virtuosi  with  Scuola Galdus , Boucheron with Haute  \u00c9cole de Joaillerie, Bottega Veneta's  Accademia Labor  et Ingenium Gucci's  Accademia ArtLab e Fabbriche  has trained more than  2,300 employees since 2018 |\n| Local communities                            | \u00b7 More than  15  active international  programs focusing on raw materials \u00b7 Change in the Foundations' status  to the  Kering Foundation endowment fund            | \u00b7 Reforestation  of gold-mining sites in French Guiana \u00b7 7 projects supported by the Kering Regenerative Fund for  Nature, including the Gobi Desert cashmere project \u00b7 In the space of 15 years, the Kering Foundation has helped  1 million women  who have been victims of violence and  supported 100 nonprofits around the world                             |\n| Helping suppliers  with their transition     | \u00b7 4,559 supplier audits  performed,  representing 75% of tier 1 and 2                                                                                              | Foundation \u00b7 Clean by Design  implemented among 59 textiles suppliers  and being launched with 15 others                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Partnerships  with schools  and universities | \u00b7 Kering  Certificate of Influential  Luxury program  with HEC Paris \u00b7 Partnership between the Kering x IFM  Sustainability Chair and the Bezalel                  | \u00b7 Around  1,500 students  educated in sustainability concepts  each year by IFM by means of a mandatory 30-hour course,  along with training leading to a recognized qualification as  part of the IFM-Kering Sustainability Chair                                                                                                                                |\n| Progressive human  resources policies        | \u00b7 100%  of employees covered  by the Baby Leave program \u00b7 50%  of employees covered by the EU  collective agreement                                                | \u00b7 Baby Leave , parental leave of at least 14 weeks allowing all  Kering employees - regardless of gender or family situation -  to spend time with their new child in the best possible  conditions                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Gender equality,  diversity  and inclusion   | \u00b7 Women represent  63%  57%  of managers and  50% members (as at December 31, 2023)  \u00b7 Universal Fair Pay for Kering and recognized for all  of the Group's Houses | of employees,   of Board   certification  \u00b7 Proportion of women on the Board of Directors increased  from 28% in 2010 to  50%  in 2023 \u00b7 Inclusion & Diversity Committees \u00b7 Women in Luxury  internal network (launched in France in  2022) extended in 2023 to Italy, the United States, China,  Singapore, Mexico, South Korea and Japan                        |",

The Chief Sustainability and Institutional Affairs  Officer  is  a  member  of  the  Executive  Committee  and reports directly to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Sustainability Department is responsible for the implementation of the sustainability strategy and supports the Houses to deploy it as a sparring partner. More than 100 individuals have a dedicated sustainability role at the Corporate level and within the Houses, as well as in dedicated structures such as the Material Innovation Lab  (MIL) and  the  Jewellery  Innovation  Lab  (JIL).  This organization fosters cooperation between Kering and its Houses, with  the  support  of  Corporate  functions  and  the  creation  of working  groups  and  cross-business  committees  on  the  Group's flagship projects.\n\nIn  terms  of  governance,  the  Sustainability  Committee  of  the Board of Directors' role is to support the Company and the Group in  establishing,  implementing  and  monitoring  good  corporate governance policies and sustainability and corporate citizenship practices. There is a Lead Independent Director on the Board of Directors whose role includes, in coordination with the Chairman, representing the Board in its dealings with investors concerning ESG matters, along with a Climate Change Lead. Their respective roles and responsibilities are described in sections 1.4 and 1.5 of chapter 3, which also contains information about the work of the Sustainability Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Program is led\n\nby  the  Group  Chief  Compliance  Officer,  who  reports  directly  to the  Group  Audit  Committee.  This  system,  fully  integrated  in Kering's  internal  control  system,  ensure  a  strong  culture  of integrity  throughout  the  Group  and  its  Houses.  They  also  give employees  a  confidential  way  of  reporting  potential  breaches, and  ensure  that  any  such  reports  are  dealt  with  promptly  and fairly. They also ensure that the Group complies with applicable regulatory  requirements,  including  French  Laws  no.  2016-1691, known  as  Sapin  II,  no.  2017-399  on  the  Duty  of  Care  and no. 2022-401, known as the Waserman Law.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.1.1 Ethics\n\nKering's  approach  to  ethics  involves  three  dedicated  Ethics Committees: one Group committee and two regional committees  (for  Asia-Pacific  and  the  Americas)  as  part  of  a reference framework common to the whole Group. Each of the three  Committees  is  made  up  of  representatives  from  Kering and  its  Houses  to  ensure  greater  diversity  in  terms  of nationality, gender and role. In 2023, 52% of these committees' members were  women.  The  Committees  focus  on  three  main areas:\n\n- \u00b7 ensuring that the Code of Ethics effectively reaches all Group employees;\n- \u00b7 proposing  appropriate  updates  to  the  Code  and  on  the implementation of appropriate behavior and practices;\n- \u00b7 managing and processing alerts received as part of the Kering whistleblowing system.\n\nEmployees can contact the Ethics Committee of their choice to obtain  clarification  or  ask  questions  on  the  application  of  the Code,  but  also  if  they  are  unsure  how  to  behave  in  a  specific situation or to report concerns if they believe they have suffered or witnessed conduct that breaches the Code (see section 2.4).\n\n## 2.1.2 Compliance\n\nThe  Compliance  organization  is  coordinated  by  a  Group  Chief Compliance Officer  (CCO),  who  is  responsible  for  implementing the  Group  Compliance  Program  as  approved  by  the  Board  of\n\nDirectors.  The  Group  Chief  Compliance  Officer  reports  to  the Audit Committee, which helps ensure the independence required of  that  role.  The  Group Chief Compliance Officer also has direct access to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and does not hold any other position, so is fully focused on this role. To ensure the  day-to-day  monitoring  and  effectiveness  of  the  Compliance Program, the Group Chief Compliance Officer is supported by (i) a team  of  seven  compliance  law  experts  working  in  Paris,  New York, Singapore  and  Shanghai,  (ii)  a  network  of  Brand Compliance Officers  appointed  by  the  Houses'  CEOs,  and  (iii)  a network  of  Regional  and  Local  Compliance  Officers.  In  some Houses, there are compliance managers in addition to the Brand and  Local  Compliance  Officers.  As  a  general  rule,  the  positions held by the Compliance Officers in parallel with their compliance duties  are  sufficiently  high-ranking  to  ensure  they  have  the necessary authority and independence.\n\nThe  Compliance  Program  in  general,  and  the  anti-corruption system in particular, are ultimately the responsibility of Fran\u00e7oisHenri  Pinault  in  his  capacity  as  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer  of  Kering  SA.  Mr.  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  is  involved personally  in  developing  and  implementing  the  anti-corruption program  within  Kering  and  its  Houses,  both  internally  and externally. He is supported by Jean-Marc Duplaix in his capacity as Deputy CEO in charge of Operations and Finance and by the Board of Directors, particularly within the Audit Committee and the  Remuneration Committee, and is supported by the Houses' CEOs, who are also personally involved in the development and implementation of the compliance program.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2 Implementation throughout the Group and beyond\n\n## 2.2.1 Kering's Code of Ethics\n\nSince 1996, Kering's ethical principles have applied to everyone within the Group without exception. The Code of Ethics has been updated  regularly  in  the  meantime  to  reflect  new  laws  and regulations. The Code extends to the commitments of members of  the  Executive  Committee  as  well  as  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive  Officer,  and  has  been  presented  to  and  reviewed  by Kering's Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Code  of  Ethics  is  the  cornerstone  of  Kering's  approach  to ethics. It aims to formalize the Group's determination to comply with  the  major  international  reference  texts,  and  demonstrates how the Group continually strengthens its commitments and the systems  in  place  to  ensure  that  compliance.  It  is  available  in 14 languages on Kering's intranet and website.\n\n## 2.2.2 System for detecting and preventing corruption and influence-peddling\n\nKering's  Code  of  Ethics  emphasizes  that  employees  must  at  all times  act  with  integrity,  loyalty  and  a  sense  of  responsibility.  It clearly  sets  out  the  Group's  commitment  to  zero  tolerance  on corruption and influence-peddling, and encourages employees to report any instance of misconduct. It stipulates the necessity of avoiding conflicts of interest, any risk of which must be promptly identified and resolved.\n\nIn  2016,  Kering  developed  and  implemented  an  Anti-corruption Policy, standing alongside the Code of Ethics, to offer employees fuller guidance in their everyday practices and ensure a firm grip on  corruption  risks.  This  Policy,  which  was  updated  in  2019, identifies  prohibited  behavior  and  sets  out  guidelines  enabling employees to detect instances of corruption and report them to management.\n\nThe anti-corruption  compliance  program  in  place  within  Kering and  its Houses  meets  the  requirements  of  international standards, and more particularly the eight pillars required under article 17 of the Sapin II law. The Group Chief Compliance Officer attends at least one meeting of the Audit Committee each year to report to its members on the status of the compliance program and  its  implementation.  The  Audit  Committee  ensures  that compliance  risks  are  sufficiently mitigated  and  that  the Compliance  Officers  have  the  appropriate  resources.  The Committee  also  discusses  the  annual  compliance  objectives  to be assigned by the Remunerations Committee to the Chairman and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Deputy  CEO  in  charge  of Operations  and  Finance.  The  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer and Deputy CEO in charge of Operations and Finance also meet regularly with the Group Chief Compliance Officer.\n\n## Implementation\n\nTo apply these commitments in an effective way and ensure full compliance  with  the  stipulations  of  France's  Sapin  II  Law, corruption and influence-peddling risks were mapped across the Group and each of its Houses worldwide in 2019 and updated in 2021.  To  ensure  that  the  risk  assessment  was  comprehensive, each  potential  corruption  and  influence-peddling  scenario relevant to the Group was identified and assessed after analyzing existing first, second and third-level controls. The corruption and influence-peddling  risks  associated  with  these  scenarios  were rated  and  ranked  in  the  aforementioned  risk  map.  The  action plan  resulting  from  the  2021  update  was  rolled  out  starting  in 2022 and continued in 2023, alongside second-level compliance audits  carried  out  on  and  off  site  by  the  Group  Compliance Department,  with  the  support  of  an  international  law  firm  to reinforce  the  independence and expertise of the analysis in the most at-risk jurisdictions identified in the risk map.\n\nThe Group Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Audit Committee and is therefore independent of the Houses and support  functions,  is  responsible  for  implementing  the  Anticorruption  Policy  under  the  Group  Compliance  Program.  The deployment of the Anti-corruption Policy is monitored closely by the Audit Committee and Executive Management.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.2.3  System for detecting and preventing money laundering\n\nIn  2021  Kering  adopted  and  implemented  a  Group  Policy  (the \"AML Policy\") to reduce money-laundering risks and strengthen its  systems  in  this  area.  The  latest  update  of  this  policy  was issued  in  late  2023,  and  it  defines  rules  for  carrying  out  checks relating to the Houses' selling activities, online and in store \"for certain transactions considered at-risk\". In 2023, Kering Compliance  Department  trained  more  than  3,000  employees worldwide in the application of the AML Policy.\n\n## 2.2.4 System for detecting and preventing risks related to economic sanctions and export controls\n\nIn  line  with  its  commitments,  the  Group  seeks  to  act  in  full compliance  with  the  laws  and  regulations  applicable  to  it, including  those  regarding  economic  sanctions  and  export controls,  which  have  been  significantly  reinforced  by  certain jurisdictions  because  of  the  armed  conflict  between  Russia  and Ukraine.  To  prevent  non-compliance  risks  as  far  as  possible,  a specific  Sanctions  Policy  was  adopted  and  deployed  by  the Group in 2016, and was updated most recently in October 2023 as a  result  of  the  armed  conflict  between  Russia  and  Ukraine. Detailed information is provided in chapter 5.\n\n## 2.2.5 Human rights Policy\n\nRespect  for  and  protection  of  human  rights,  for  all  Group employees  and  all  employees  in  each  House's  supply  chain,  is central to Kering's ethical commitments  and  compliance program.\n\nDetails  about  the  Human  Rights  Policy  published  in  2021,  its governance  and  related  systems  and  initiatives  are  set  out  in section 2.5.\n\n## 2.2.6 Continuous improvement of the Compliance Program\n\nUpdates to risk maps (relating to corruption, human rights and the  Duty  of  Care),  compliance  reviews  and  internal  audits  are conducted  to  better  identify  potential  shortcomings,  which Kering  and  its  Houses  remedy  with  the  aim  of  continuously improving the Compliance Program. For example, the corruption risk identified as being the most material for the Group when the risk  map  was  updated  in  2019  and  again  in  2021  relates  to relationships with third parties, particularly business partners or in the context of real estate transactions. After that exercise, the Group  updated  its  third-party  due  diligence  procedure  and strengthened its controls over distributors, landlords and service providers involved in the creation and renovation of stores.\n\n## 2.3 Promoting and respecting ethics within the Group and beyond\n\n## 2.3.1  Fostering a culture of integrity\n\nA training program on ethics and the related Code, known as the \"Ethics & Compliance e-learning program\", has been established for all Group employees worldwide and implemented since 2014.\n\nAvailable in 15 languages, it sets out the ethical ground rules in place at Kering and presents case studies and ethical dilemmas that help employees ask themselves the right questions. The elearning  program  is  updated  annually,  and  covers  all  the principles  upheld  by  the  Group's  Code  of  Ethics  by  alternating between practical examples that allow a variety of subjects to be covered  over  time  (conflicts  of  interest,  inclusion  and  diversity, respect for human rights, harassment, environmental protection, fraud,  etc.).  The  fight  against  corruption  is  a  mandatory  topic covered  each  year.  Employees  are  also  reminded  every  year  of the  existence  and  operation  of  the  Group's  whistleblowing system and its key features (particularly respecting confidentiality  when  handling  cases  and  the  ban  on  any retaliations against whistleblowers).\n\nEach  year's  training  program  is  led  by  Kering's  Chairman  and Chief Executive Officer. The training program had been delivered to 98% of Kering employees by year-end 2023, up from 96.5% in\n\n2022 and 96.4% in 2021. Topics covered in 2023 included working conditions in the supply chain and case studies relating to human rights,  responsible  procurement,  various  corruption  risks  and energy efficiency. The training program was overhauled in 2023, with  the  introduction  of  pathways  suited  to  each  employee's work environment (Retail, Office, Operations).\n\nKering's Compliance Officers also benefit from regular personalized  training,  and  the  Group's  internal  auditors  have been  trained  on  the  key  factors  involved  in  assessing  anticorruption procedures. The Compliance department also delivers regular  on-site  training  courses  to  educate  employees  about corruption risks. Almost 3,500 employees worldwide took one of these courses in 2023.\n\nAs  well  as  providing  training,  Kering  also  runs  an  ongoing program  to  inform  employees  and  managers  and  raise  their awareness. All new recruits are issued with a copy of the Code of Ethics and are required to follow the ethics training program for the  current  year.  The  Group's  intranet  includes  an  Ethics  & Compliance section in French and English, giving ready access to policies  and  procedures,  along  with  a  list  of  compliance managers at the Houses and structures.",

For  any  contractor  working  for  Kering  or  one  of  its  Houses, notwithstanding  any  contractual  clauses,  a  precondition  of  the business  relationship  is  that  suppliers  commit  formally  to\n\napplying high ethical standards themselves and to ensuring the preservation of human rights.\n\nSection  4  \"Working  together  to  build  sustainable  and  socially responsible supply chains\" provides details of the expectations of Kering from its suppliers, its Suppliers' Charter, the way in which it applies  its  Sustainability  Principles  in  supply  chains,  the Hercules  oversight  and  compliance  system  for  Group  suppliers, and the findings of audits carried out in 2023.\n\n## 2.4 Whistleblowing procedure for reporting unethical conduct\n\n## 2.4.1  Whistleblowing system\n\nIntroduced in 2005, Kering's whistleblowing system was strengthened  in  2018  to  ensure  full  compliance  with  France's Sapin II Law and again in 2023, partly to meet the requirements of France's  Waserman  Law.  It  is  accessible  to  all  employees  and interns  of  the  Group  and  its  Houses,  people  whose  working relationship  with  the  Group  has  ended  and  people  who  have applied  for  a  job  with  the  entity  concerned  (where  the information  was  obtained  as  part  of  the  relationship  or application  procedure),  shareholders  and  people  involved  in Kering's Annual  General  Meeting,  but  also  external  and temporary  personnel,  particularly  those  working  for  external partners or service providers under contract with the Group or its Houses.\n\nThe whistleblowing system makes it possible to report concerns internally via two channels. Concerns can be reported locally to the person's direct or indirect manager, employee representatives  or  members  of  the  local  compliance  network (Local  Compliance  Officers  and  Brand  Compliance  Officers);  or centrally  to  the  Group  Chief  Compliance  Officer  or  the  Ethics Committees, which can be contacted by email or via an external independent  hotline  that  can  take  calls  24/7  in  around 40 languages.\n\nThe system may be used to report any of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 a criminal offense;\n- \u00b7 a  breach  or  an  attempt  to  conceal  a  breach  of  an  international commitment, of an instrument of an international organization adopted  on  the  basis  of  such  a  commitment,  of  European Union law or of any other law or regulation;\n- \u00b7 conduct or situations that are contrary to the Group's Code of Ethics, Anti-corruption Policy or Human Rights Policy;\n- \u00b7 a threat or harm to the general interest.\n\nDepending  on  the  type  of  allegations  made,  investigations  are carried  out  either  internally  or  via  previously  selected  external independent firms that specialize in the subjects concerned.\n\nReports are handled in a uniform way so as to comply with the key  principles  of  such  investigations,  including  confidentiality and  the  absence  of  retaliations,  which  Kering  formally  forbids. This  protection  is  clearly  stated  each  year  in  the  Ethics  & Compliance e-learning program.\n\n## Communication with employees of Group suppliers\n\nSince 2018, the Group's whistleblowing system has been open to employees of suppliers and service providers with which Kering and  its  Houses  have  direct  business  relationships.  All  suppliers and service providers have been informed accordingly.\n\nA  communication  campaign  aimed  directly  at  the  relevant employees of suppliers has been adopted to ensure that they are fully  informed.  To  achieve  this,  an  email  has  been  sent  to suppliers by the Group Ethics Committee with the support of all CEOs of the Group's Houses. The information can be accessed at any  time  via  a  dedicated  website  and  has  been  translated  into 15  languages.  This  communication  campaign  takes  two  forms: displays  at  relevant  locations  within  supplier  and  serviceprovider  sites  in  order  to  gain  the  greatest  visibility  (cafeteria, locker rooms, site entrance, etc.), and a prospectus that is given directly to employees. Both the displays and the prospectus list the  Group's  six  major  ethical  principles:  compliance  with  laws and  regulations;  prohibition  of  any  form  of  corruption,  fraud, money laundering or conflict of interest; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; protection of the health and safety of all;  respect  for  the  integrity  and  dignity  of  all;  and  protection  of the environment. The level of detail is adjusted according to the recipients, to give specific examples of what is expected in each case  (including  the  refusal  of  forced  labor,  the  refusal  of recruitment  fees  paid  by  employees,  special  attention  paid  to vulnerable  people,  access  to  suitable  washroom  facilities  and decent dormitory conditions where applicable, the free disposal of  salaries  and  personal  documentation,  respect  for  privacy, access to appropriate personal protective equipment, etc.).\n\nThe  documents  also  remind  employees  of  the  whistleblowing system and how to use it.\n\nThis  information  and  communication  campaign  is  refreshed regularly to cover all new suppliers and service providers of the Group and its Houses. The supplier social audits conducted each year (see section 4.2) include checks on the effective circulation of  this  information  to  all  workers  (awareness  of  the  system, display and issue of the documentation, etc.).",

        "page_content": "## 2.5 Protection of human rights: an approach rooted in the Group's values\n\n## 2.5.1 Human rights Policy\n\nKering is committed to complying with the principles set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), and to  implementing  the  United  Nations  Guiding  Principles  on Business  and  Human  Rights  (UNGP).  This  commitment  to respecting  human  rights  throughout  the  Group  and  its  supply chains  is  reflected  in  and  expanded  upon  in  all  of  its  internal policies and reference documents.\n\nKering's  Human  rights  Policy  covers  all  of  its  operations  and supply chain, and brings together its commitments to respecting human rights as set out in its Code of Ethics, Suppliers' Charter and Sustainability Principles. Kering's approach to the protection of  human  rights  related  to  specific  risks  may  be  accessed  on Kering's website, which also contains its publications under the California  Transparency  in  Supply  Chains  Act  of  2010,  the  UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 and Regulation (EU) 2017/821 of May 17, 2017 on metals and ores from  conflict-affected  and  high-risk  areas.  In  addition,  Kering's Duty  of  Care  plan,  drawn  up  in  compliance  with  French  Law no. 2017-399 of March 27, 2017 on the Duty of Care, is outlined in the \"Duty of care plan\" section of chapter 5 in this document.\n\n## 2.5.2  Shared governance and central systems deployed at Group level\n\nHuman  rights  governance  spans  various  departments,  starting with Compliance (responsible for monitoring the implementation of  undertakings  established  by  Kering's  Human  rights  Policy), Human Resources (including the Inclusion & Diversity department that reports to it), Sustainability, Internal Audit and Security. It also extends to employee representative bodies.\n\nHuman  rights  considerations  are  included  in  the  annual performance appraisals  of  Group  executive  officers.  30%  of  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's annual variable remuneration  is  linked  to  the  achievement  of  non-financial criteria, including the operational roll-out of the 2025 Sustainability Strategy.\n\n## 2.5.3 A continuous improvement approach\n\nKering  regularly  revisits  key  principles  relating  to  ethics  and human rights. A gap analysis was performed in 2017 to pinpoint differences  between  the  Group's  internal  practices  and  the UNGP. The findings of this analysis provided input for the 2019 update  to  Kering's  Code  of  Ethics  and  for  a  dedicated communication  plan  targeting  employees  of  the  Group's  direct suppliers with specific details on how to use the whistleblowing system (see section 2.3).\n\nIn  the  same  vein,  the  due  diligence  procedure  aimed  at identifying,  assessing  and  preventing  the  impact  that  Group operations  have  or  might  have  on  human  rights  in  the  supply chain and the Group's direct operations is seen as a continuous process that requires constant adaptation. This due diligence is a part  of  the  Duty  of  Care  Plan  and  the  Hercules  system  (see section 4.2.1).\n\nIn 2023, as detailed in the Duty of Care Plan (see chapter 5), the Group reviewed its map of risks, particularly those pertaining to severe  impacts  on  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms, health  and  safety,  and  the  environment  resulting  from  the Group's operations and supply chain. The risks listed above were assessed separately with respect to (i) the internal operations of Kering  and  the  Houses,  (ii)  the  operations  of  their  first-level suppliers,  and  (iii)  the  sourcing  of  raw  materials.  The  exercise involved  interviews  with  127  Group  employees,  a  review  of almost  2,000  documents,  and  the  scoring  of  thousands  of country-specific  risks  based  on  56  third  party-supplied  risk indices.\n\nThe Group has also carried out various studies to identify areas for improvement:\n\n- \u00b7 study conducted with GoodCorporation (2020), an independent  external  organization  specializing  in  business ethics,  to  analyze,  with  regards  to  major  reference  texts (UNGP, OECD, etc.), Kering's governance and management of human  rights  in  the  supply  chain,  and  its  handling  of whistleblowing  alerts  received  by  its  Ethics  Committees, particularly  in  view  of  the  UNGP  principle  31.  The  study enabled  Kering  to  update  the  list  of  risks  that  the  Group considers salient with regard to human rights (notably forced labor,  child  labor  in  raw  materials  sourcing,  discrimination, health and safety, living wages for suppliers' employees and harassment).  Various  areas  for  improvement  were  also presented to members of the Luxury Committee;\n- \u00b7 Human  rights  risk  analyses  relating  to  certain  key  raw materials used by the Group;\n- \u00b7 between 2021 and 2023, a series of living wage analyses and assessments  were  carried  out  with  over  one  hundred  of suppliers (production) in order to establish risks and consider the issues involved;\n- \u00b7 in late 2023, an analysis of on-site contractors was launched across  the  Group  and  its  Houses  to  assess  areas  for improvement in regards to social topics.\n\nAlongside  these  analyses,  Kering  also  monitors  various  human rights  risk  indicators  provided  by  the  external  platform  Verisk Maplecroft.\n\nFinally, Kering and its Houses have adopted a number of human rights initiatives such as:\n\n- \u00b7 the  collaboration  between  Gucci  and  the  Indian  social enterprise \"I was a Sari\", which is continuing to pursue its aim of  helping  underprivileged  Indian  women  to  become  more independent  through  the  production  of  upcycled  products made from used saris;\n- \u00b7 Saint Laurent renewed its support for \"charity: water\", which works  with  numerous  local  organizations  to  bring  safe drinking  water  to  people  who  lack  it,  while  helping  young girls attend school;",

The findings of the social audits carried out within supply chains are presented in section 4.2.3.\n\nA cross-reference table between Kering's human rights approach and the United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting Framework is available in the Sustainability/Measuring our impact/Reporting and indicators section of Kering's website.\n\n## 2.6 Contribution to professional organizations and other institutions\n\nKering  takes  a  global  approach  to  dialogue  with  stakeholders, and  is  ever-attentive  to  the  major  issues  they  face.  It  actively promotes its  vision  of  responsible  and  sustainable  growth,  and takes  part  in  a  number  of  initiatives  involving  business  and industry-specific associations in that regard. Kering's contribution  to  those  associations  is  aligned  with  the  Group's Sustainability  approach  and  is  intended  to  encourage  the sustainable growth of the Luxury industry. Kering is particularly careful  to  ensure  that  the  Group  is  not  a  member  of  any professional  or  sector  association  that  may  have  positions  that are controversial in regard to the public interest or do not comply with the rules established by the Group for its stakeholders.\n\nTo ensure this:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Group has an internal disclosure procedure, including a referral  to  the  Group  Compliance  department  whenever  it seeks to become a member of a professional association;\n- \u00b7 a  monitoring  of  developments  and  work  related  to  these associations is ensured by certain head-office employees;\n- \u00b7 if there is any doubt about an initiative or developments in a given  situation,  those  in  charge  of  representing  Kering  in those  associations  can  refer  the  matter  to  the  Compliance department.\n\nKering  complies  fully  with  the  rules  established  by  the  High Authority  for  Transparency  in  Public  Life  (HATVP)  in  France, where  the  Group's  head-office  is  located,  and  by  the  European Union's  transparency  register.  Each  Group  employee,  including members of Kering's Executive Committee, must comply with its Code  of  Ethics,  and  Kering's  contribution  to  these  professional associations  and  any  lobbying  activities  must  comply  with  the principles established in that Code.\n\nKering's  contributions  to  these  associations  are  determined according to  predetermined grid  of  contribution  that  are  either fixed or proportional to the Houses' revenue.\n\nKering and its Houses allocated \u20ac1,939,735 to institutional affairs worldwide  in  2023,  including  \u20ac1,587,495  of  contributions  to business and industry-specific associations. The main contributions were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac383,000 to the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana , which is helping to develop a responsible fashion industry;\n- \u00b7 \u20ac249,593  to  the Comit\u00e9  Colbert ,  which  promotes  the  Luxury industry  and  its  specific  features  with  respect  to  public authorities  in  France  and  Europe,  and  which  is  working  to outline the industry's 2050 carbon  trajectory via its sustainability committee;\n- \u00b7 \u20ac174,957 to Confindustria , which represents Italian companies and helps drive their exports.\n\nOf  that  total,  \u20ac352,240  was  spent  on  lobbying,  solely  via organizations of which the Group is a member. This expenditure is  intended  to  encourage  the  sustainable  growth  of  the  Luxury industry and is entirely consistent with the Group's Sustainability Strategy.\n\nIn  line  with  Kering's  Code  of  Ethics,  no  financial  contributions were made in 2023 in the name or on behalf of the Group to any political  organization  in  exchange  for  any  direct  or  indirect material, commercial or personal advantage.\n\nThe  amount  allocated  to  institutional  affairs  breaks  down  as follows:\n\n| In euros                                                                 | 2023      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Lobbying or similar                                                      | 352,240   |\n| Funding of political organizations                                       | 0         |\n| Contributions (business or industry-specific  associations, think tanks) | 1,587,495 |\n| Other                                                                    | 0         |\n| TOTAL                                                                    | 1,939,735 |\n| Scope                                                                    | 100%      |",

The Group's Houses keep investing to offer applicants the best possible experience through innovative and inclusive solutions, such as the launch of the MyBoucheron onboarding platform.

It  aims  to  assist employees  when  an  organizational  change  (such  as  a  store transfer or closure) is liable to have an impact on jobs.\n\nIn  all  countries  and  for  all  Houses,  when  departures  are  being considered  following  reorganizations,  efforts  made  to  find  new roles for employees go beyond those required by law, and priority is given to voluntary mobility measures.\n\nThe  European  Works  Council  is  also  informed  of  the  Group's plans and the associated organizational changes during its two annual  plenary  meetings,  at  extraordinary  committee  meetings as  necessary,  and  at  the  meetings  of  its  Select  Committee.  The French  Works  Council  is  also  informed  annually  of  the  Group's plans for organizational change.\n\n## 3.2 Fostering employee development in a stimulating and inclusive work environment\n\n## 3.2.1  A long-term strategy for promoting inclusion and diversity on a local basis\n\nGoing further than its commitment to social responsibility, Kering believes that inclusion and diversity are sources of creativity and innovation,  and  thus  of  economic  performance.  Innovation prospers  in  an  environment  where  all  voices  are  heard  and everyone's  contribution  is  appreciated,  respected  and  treated equally.  This  is  why  Kering  makes  every  effort  to  establish  a culture of inclusion at all levels of the organization and provides its  teams  with  an  open-minded,  diverse  and  stimulating  work environment, thereby contributing to the Group's success. Kering pays  close  attention  to  diversity  in  employee  profiles  (gender, culture,  origin,  sexual  orientation,  identity,  religious  belief,  age and  disability),  which  it  recognizes  as  a  rewarding  source  of collective intelligence.\n\nIn 2019, Kering signed up to the UN's Supplier Code of Conduct to combat  discrimination  against  LGBTIQ+  people,  and  joined  the Open To All coalition, which combats all forms of discrimination against employees, visitors and customers, including\n\ndiscrimination  based  on  ethnicity,  nationality,  gender,  gender identity, sexual orientation, religion and disability.\n\nWithin  the  Human  Resources  department,  an  Inclusion  and Diversity  (I&D)  team  defines  the  Group's  strategy  and  priority commitments, guiding all of the Houses.\n\nEach House set up an Inclusion and Diversity Committee in 2020, sponsored by a member of its executive team. These committees are  made  up  of  representatives  from  the  various  departments and regions. Their role is to transpose the Group's inclusion and diversity strategy within their respective entities, while adapting it  to  their  specific  cultures  and  environments.  The  initiative  is sponsored by Kering's  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer.  In 2022,  to  make  the  numerous  initiatives  led  by  the  Group,  its regional entities and its Houses more impactful and complementary, Kering adopted an overall strategy supported by a  new  governance  arrangement  with  a  regional  dimension, particularly  in  the  Americas  and  Asia-Pacific.  Kering  recognizes that  each  country  and  each  culture  have  their  own  specific context,  with  unique  challenges  and  opportunities  to  change mentalities to create an increasingly inclusive culture.",

        "page_content": "Kering's  efforts  are  centered  around  six  key  areas  of  diversity shared by all the Houses:\n\n- \u00b7 gender equality;\n- \u00b7 diversity in terms of cultural profiles and origins;\n- \u00b7 equal opportunities, regardless of socio-economic background;\n- \u00b7 equal  treatment  and  opportunities  regardless  of  gender identity and sexual orientation;\n- \u00b7 multi-generational diversity at work;\n- \u00b7 inclusion of disabled people at work.\n\n## 3.2.2  Promoting an inclusive culture with a grassroots impact on employees\n\nTo foster an inclusive culture on a lasting basis, Kering organizes conferences  with  personalities  and  external  experts,  as  well  as directors  from  Kering  and  provides  its  employees  with  online training courses on inclusion and diversity. In 2023, an additional \"intermediary\" module  was  made  available  to  the  I&D community  (sponsors,  leaders  and  committee  members). Inclusion  and  diversity  is  one  of  the  modules  of  the  Ethics  & Compliance mandatory annual training program, which in 2023 included  case  studies  on  gender  equality  and  flexible  working when returning from parental leave.\n\nThe Kering Perspectives seminar was rolled out in 2023, with the Houses'  management  committees,  representing  872  hours  of training  in  2023.  This  one-day  seminar,  bringing  together members  of  the  Executive  Committee  and  Kering's  global department heads, is dedicated to raising awareness about how human bias works and providing ways of mitigating  it,  thereby promoting  inclusive  leadership.  The  program  is  devised  in partnership  with  non-profit  093Lab,  which  helps  young  people\n\nfrom  Aulnay-sous-Bois  (France)  access  the  worlds  of  fashion design and the visual arts.\n\nAwareness  campaigns  are  run  throughout  the  year  to  coincide with international days such as International Women's Day, Pride Month, Global Diversity Awareness Month and the International Day of People with Disabilities.\n\nTo promote an inclusive culture for LGBTQIA+ people, the Group set up its \"ALL\" global internal network in 2019 to lead awareness and networking efforts over the course of the year.\n\nIn 2023, Kering and its Houses worked hand-in-hand to make art a means of demonstrating the richness of diversity and the power of inclusion. Bottega Veneta launched the \"I&D via Arts\" project, a series  of  awareness-raising  events  for  employees  organized  at museums  and  other  cultural  institutions  in  13  countries.  More than 400 employees took part in these initiatives. Brioni, under the  aegis  of  the  Creative  Director  and  HR  department,  also organized cultural visits to Rome for employees to give a more indepth understanding of issues relating to inclusion and diversity from the perspective of art.\n\n## 3.2.2.1  Establishing a culture of gender equality within the Group\n\nWhile  Kering  addresses  the  issue  of  diversity  in  all  its  aspects, particular emphasis is placed on equal opportunity. In 2010, the Group was one of the first companies in Italy to sign the Women's Empowerment Principles, drafted by UN Women, and the United Nations Global Compact. These principles offer guidance on how to promote the presence and progression of women in business and, more generally, in society.\n\nKering has set a target of achieving gender parity and pay equity at all levels of the Group by 2025.\n\nThe Group's action plan to promote gender parity focuses on three key priorities:\n\n## 1. Instilling a culture of equality within the Group\n\n## through efforts to raise awareness and dedicated development programs\n\n- -incorporated into all HR and management processes (recruitment, talent review, compensation, etc.);\n- -rollout of the Women In Luxury (WIL) internal network to promote gender equality in Italy, the United States, Mexico, South Korea, Mainland China, Japan and Singapore. Its work includes organizing conferences, networking sessions and communications campaigns over the course of the year;\n- -for the past seven years, Kering has partnered the EVE program, which enables 15 employees from various Group Houses and countries to attend seminars in Europe and Asia.\n\n## 2. Fostering a good work-life balance\n\n## by means of a Group-wide framework for all employees that promotes wellbeing at work and equality for all\n\nMany other initiatives have also been adopted by Kering's various Houses, including remote working and flextime in Italy and the United States, as well as daycare centers for employees based in France and nursing rooms for employees in Hong Kong SAR and France.\n\n## 3. Developing an inclusive and exemplary parental policy\n\nKering has been committed to a widereaching parental policy since 2017, supporting parents and helping to create a culture of equality within the Group. Baby Leave, launched in 2020, allows all parents - regardless of gender or family situation - to benefit from 14 weeks of parental leave to care for a new child. This policy also helps to combat the gender stereotypes encountered by women when they apply for a new job, aim for promotion or want to further their career.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nFollowing  the  engagement  survey  conducted  in  2023  (see section  3.2.3.3),  discussion  groups  on  gender  equality  were organized in France, Italy, the United States, China, South Korea and Japan. The aim was to gain a better understanding of female employees' expectations and feelings  with  regard  to  well-being at  work,  work-life  balance  and  career  development  in  order  to take  practical  measures  to  improve  women's  experience  as employees within the Group.\n\nIn  addition,  an  action  plan  has  been  launched  dedicated  to achieving  the  Group's  goals  in  terms  of  equal  pay,  details  of which are provided in section 3.3.1.2.\n\n## Recognizing and assessing the impact of gender equality initiatives\n\nIn  2023,  women  accounted  for  57.2%  of  the  Group's  managers, 63% of the total workforce (62.9% in 2022, 63.2% in 2021), 31% of its  Tech  workforce,  42%  of  Executive  Committee  members  and 50% of its Directors (excluding Directors representing employees as  of  December  31,  2023),  making  Kering  one  of  the  CAC  40 companies  with  the  highest  proportion  of  women  in  senior management positions.\n\nKering  was  one  of  the  leading  companies  in  the  France  2023 gender equality index, with a consolidated score of 88 points out of 100 for all of its Corporate entities and Houses in France.\n\nFinally,  Gucci  obtained  certification  for  gender  parity  in  Italy  in 2023, introduced as part of the country's National Recovery and Resilience  Plan  (Piano  Nazionale  di  Ripresa  e  Resilienza), following an audit by Bureau Veritas. This certification is granted on  the  basis  of  an  assessment  of  33  indicators  spanning  six themes:  culture  and  strategy,  governance,  human  resources management  process,  career  opportunities  for  women,  wage equality  and  attention  paid  to  work-life  balance.  Gucci's commitment is reflected by the adoption of a three-year strategic plan  with  the  aim  of  promoting  concrete  initiatives  to  support gender equality.\n\n## 3.2.2.2  Promoting the integration of people with disabilities\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Group employed 696 (1.5%) workers with  disabilities  (coverage  rate  of  85.2%  excluding  the  United Kingdom and the United States).\n\nKering  reasserted  its  commitment  to  the  integration  of  people with disabilities with the European Empowering  Talent agreement  signed  in  2015.  This  agreement  reiterates  and reinforces the commitments made to employee representatives in 2008 with regard to promoting the employment of people with disabilities.\n\nEach  year,  management  presents  a  progress  report  to  the European Works Council on the agreement's three pillars, which include  promoting  diversity  in  general,  and  on  the  initiatives undertaken  by  the  Houses  in  the  areas  of  gender  equality  and equal opportunity.\n\nIn  2022  and  2023,  Kering  Corporate  and  Balenciaga  gave employees the opportunity to take part in the Duo Day initiative, allowing  adults  and  young  people  from  Local  Units  for Educational Inclusion (ULIS) in France to experience a day in the life of an employee.\n\nThe  Group's  Houses  in  France  and  Italy  also  continue  to outsource  work  to  the  protected  sector  to  promote  the employment of people with disabilities. Special service providers employing  workers  with  disabilities  are  called  on  for  such services as printing, data entry, archiving, replying to unsolicited job  applications,  catering,  preparing  mailshots,  gift  packaging during the holiday season, and landscaping.\n\nOver the last few years, Gucci has implemented a more inclusive working  environment  and  customer  experience,  with  initiatives aiming to make stores more accessible, increase representation of  people  with  disabilities  within  teams  and  provide  employees with  training  to  make  them  more  aware  of  accessibility  and inclusion. In North America, Gucci was recognized for the second year in a row as the Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion by the  Disability  Equality  Index\u00ae,  a  joint  initiative  by  two  major organizations to protect the rights of people with disabilities: the American  Association  of  People  with  Disabilities  (AAPD)  and Disability:IN,  a  global  network  to  encourage  the  inclusion  of people  with  disabilities  supporting  over  400  companies.  The House  has  also  stepped  up  opportunities  for  employee engagement by taking part in internal groups on disability. The first  group,  Guccibility,  was  set  up  in  the  United  States  and  has been extended to Italy.\n\n## 3.2.2.3 Working with partners to promote intergenerational diversity\n\nIntergenerational  diversity  is  part  of  Kering's  Inclusion  and Diversity  strategy  and  a  central  aspect  of  concrete  measures taken within the Group's Houses.\n\nTo  preserve  and  pass  on  their  expertise,  several  of  the  Group's Houses  -  namely  Gucci,  Bottega  Veneta,  Brioni,  Pomellato  and Boucheron  -  have  created  vocational  schools  and  training programs, with the support of trade associations. The aim is to give  young  people  the  opportunity  to  learn  a  trade  that  will ultimately enable them to join one of the Group's Houses or find employment  elsewhere  in  the  luxury  or  fashion  industries  (see section  6.2.1).  In  2023,  Bottega  Veneta  took  its  commitment  to craftsmanship even further with the launch of Accademia Labor et  Ingenium,  a  new  school  that  aims  to  encourage  the  next generation of creative talent. The name is inspired by the brand's founding values as displayed in its original coat of arms, \"Labor et Ingenium\", which means \"Craft and Creativity\".\n\nIn  France,  Kering  signed  a  charter  in  2022  for  the  integration  of young people, vulnerable individuals and people with disabilities, with  the  aim  of  working  with  the  French  Ministry  of  Labor  to support  them  in  the  job  market.  Kering  is  working  with  nonprofits T\u00e9l\u00e9maque and Energie Jeunes to make concrete progress in  terms  of  equal  opportunities,  by  making  it  easier  for  all employees to volunteer during working hours (see Giving Back). Since 2019, Balenciaga and Boucheron have partnered with nonprofit ViensVoirMonTaf!, which works to combat social determinism and school dropout by helping high-school students in underprivileged areas find work experience placements.\n\nIn show  of  its  commitment  to  fostering  intergenerational diversity,  in  2022,  Kering  signed  a  commitment  alongside 31  other  companies  to  enhance  the  role  of  employees  aged 50  and  over,  an  initiative  led  by  the  L'Or\u00e9al  group  and  Club Landoy  and  sponsored  by  France's  Ministry  of  the  Economy, Finance and Recovery. The charter features 10 key commitments regarding recruitment, training, career progression, wellbeing at work and preparation for retirement, but also awareness of agerelated stereotypes. In 2023, Kering contributed to the publication of four indicators that revealed average, anonymous and  aggregated  data  from  signatory  companies  on  the employment  rate  and  hours  of  training  of  over  50s,  the recruitment  rate  of  over  45s  as  well  as  the  staff  transfer  rate. These indicators allow for a better understanding, along with the charter's  signatories,  of  the  societal  issues  faced  and  concrete measures that can be taken by the company. By developing and supporting the careers of our employees aged 50 and over, Kering encourages  the  transfer  of  know-how,  which  is  essential  in  the Luxury goods industry, from generation to generation.",

Developing a shared culture of performance\n\nAll Group employees have a People Performance and Development Annual Review with their manager to assess their performance relative to previously set targets and the employee's development needs. These reviews, which take place between  January  and  March,  strengthen  the  Group's  dynamic approach  to  performance  appraisals,  combined  with  regular check-in conversations.\n\nThese reviews are the opportunity to confirm or reconfirm who are the talents who should be included in Talent Reviews. These Talent Reviews provide the opportunity to share up-and-coming talents at Group level by function, their respective development and career path. Members of Kering's Executive Committee play an active part in this process and attend synthesis meetings for each department. Since 2021, the identification process has been expanded  to  include  retail  in  order  to  help  build  talent development plans and anticipate the organization's needs.\n\nThese Talent Reviews make it possible to create a shared pool of pre-identified  internal  talent,  and  prepare  succession  plans  for key positions (members of the Houses' Management Committees).\n\nThis work on fostering internal talent is supplemented by efforts to identify external talent through a continuous talent monitoring. One person, who now reports to the Deputy CEO in charge  of  Brand  Development,  has  the  dedicated  role  of identifying  and  watching  creative  talent  within  the  Group's Houses.  These  succession  plans  are  presented  to  the  Board  of Directors' Appointments Committee.\n\nThese  processes  for  pre-identifying  talent  both  within  and outside the Group make it possible to find the right person when someone leaves a key role. They address the problems that arise should  these  positions  become  vacant,  in  addition  to  the expertise  developed  by  staff  within  each  of  the  Houses, characterized  by  iconic  products  and  a  unique  history.  This expertise ensures continuity in each House's offering, particularly during  the  transition  between  two  Creative  Directors  or  Chief Executive Officers.\n\nGender balance analysis is always included in the talent review and succession planning processes.\n\n## 2. Promoting mobility and careers within the Group and its Houses\n\nProfessional mobility is a pivotal way of developing skills, offering career  prospects  and  giving  everyone  the  opportunity  to  grow within the Group.\n\nAs part of its internal mobility policy, employees can apply for an opportunity after 18 months in their job. They can also register as internal  applicants  and  have  confidential  contact  with  internal recruiters  before  applying.  Meetings  of  the  HR  community were organized  to  facilitate  ongoing  dialogue  on  recruitment  needs and available people, in addition to dedicated training and tools for the whole community. The introduction of this new policy was backed  up  by  a  communication  campaign.  In  2023,  more  than 6,700  employees  expressed  their  wish  to  move  to  a  new  role within  the  Group.  During  the  same  period  of  time,  there  were more than 2,300 internal transfers.\n\n## 3.2.3.2 Creating new impetus in employee training\n\nIn  2023,  Kering  devoted  a  budget  of  more  than  \u20ac42  million  to employee  training,  corresponding  to  1.4%  of  the  total  Group payroll.  As  a  result,  681,915  hours  of  training  (excluding  safety training) were provided during the year, an increase of 12.4% on 2022;  51,933  employees  (including  leavers)  took  at  least  one training course.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the end of 2021, an internal audit to redefine employee training and development priorities revealed a shared need to work on strengthening the culture of learning. After reviewing its strategy to support the creation of a learning culture,  one  key  stage  was  to  introduce  a  new  ritual  of  a dedicated training day for all employees: Global Learning Day. The first Global Learning Day was held on March 21, 2023, in all the Group's Houses (in 25 cities, in 16 languages), winning the Culture  and  Marketing  training  award  from  Learn  Assembly. With over 17,500 learning connections - representing one third of the Group's employees - the day was structured around three types of event:\n\n- \u00b7 A global conference featuring experts from within and outside the Group  and  employees  sharing  their  experiences, attracting a total of over 4,500 views;\n- \u00b7 An \"Unlocking your future\" masterclass based on a \"train the trainer\"  system,  with  4,000  employees  taking  part  either  in person  or  online.  The  theme  of  this  90-minute  training  was developing  people's  learning  agility  by  identifying  their development goals and the resources to be used by means of a development plan;\n- \u00b7 Local conferences tailored to each specific country or relating to the Houses and their culture.\n\nIn  addition  to  this  training  strategy,  Kering  continued  to  offer development paths tailored to each employee's situation:\n\n## 1. Regional training for employees and managers\n\n- \u00b7 In  Europe,  520  managers  took  part  in  management  training courses in French, English and Italian;\n- \u00b7 In Asia, 35 virtual courses were offered, providing training for 660 employees;\n- \u00b7 In the Americas, 13 training programs were offered, allowing the Group to train 171 employees.\n\n## 2. Dedicated training for employees with potential and directors\n\nDevelopment  experiences  for  high  potential  employees  and directors bring together employees from all regions and Houses. The aim is to prepare them for the challenges of tomorrow and anticipate future changes, and improve their leadership skills as well.  This  year,  485  employees  took  part  in  these  Group programs.\n\n## 3. Functional academies tailored to business needs\n\nIn  response  to  the  specific  challenges  facing  certain  business areas  and  support  the  Group's  culture  of  learning,  Kering  has developed  academies  for  specific  functions  (Finance,  Supply Chain,  Sustainability,  Tech,  Human  resources,  etc.)  for  the development and passing on of key skills. The Human Resources Academy has trained more than 550 employees and continues to offer training and discussion forums for this community. In 2023, in  addition  to  regular  onboarding  formats,  training  included dialogue sessions with HR directors from the Houses and training to  help  local  HR  business  partners  with  matters  such  as  career support  and  performance.  The  HR  communities  met  on  a regional  level  at  the  People  at  Kering  Forums,  attended  by 290 people in total (150 in Europe, 90 in Asia-Pacific and 50 in the Americas),  to  share  the  Group's  HR  strategy,  work  together  on creating the talent-first approach and its connection with skills, as well as the future of HR, taking account of the impact of AI on different jobs.\n\n## 4. Training and raising awareness about sustainability issues\n\nThe Group and its Houses are ramping up their efforts to provide training  and  raise  awareness  about  sustainability  issues,  in particular with sales, design and merchandizing teams, through a series of actions and communications.",

At the same time, a performance rating system |\n\n## 3.2.3.3 Employee engagement: putting employees at the center of all initiatives\n\nDeveloping  employee  engagement  is  one  of  Kering's  strategic priorities in order to create a common culture and strengthen the sense of belonging to an integrated Luxury Group.\n\nThe  Group's  internal  platforms  give  all  employees  a  voice  and access  to  Group  information  at  any  time,  via  any  channel, conveying  the  main  actions  and  internal  communications campaigns. In 2020, Kering introduced live streams as a way of communicating  with  employees.  Executives  such  as  Fran\u00e7oisHenri  Pinault,  Jean-Marc  Duplaix  and  B\u00e9atrice  Lazat,  as  well  as external  speakers,  discuss  key  themes  for  the  company  and answer  live  questions  from  employees.  These  discussions  are broadcast  live  on  social  media  for  all  employees,  with  a  replay available. In 2023, Kering produced 15 live streams on topics as varied as Group performance, the results of the Kering Employee Listening satisfaction survey, cybersecurity and successes in the digital industry.\n\n## Global communication campaigns about the Group's values and policies\n\nKering's internal communication campaigns help to consolidate a shared history and common language:\n\n- \u00b7 to celebrate Kering's 10th anniversary and  the  60th anniversary of the Group's creation in 2023, Kering organized a  series  of  celebrations  for  employees  in  Paris,  New  York, Milan, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo;\n- \u00b7 Giving Back program enabling employees in France, Italy and the  United  Kingdom  to  devote  up  to  21  hours  per  year (approximately three days) to volunteering. Kering launched APAC Giving Back Week for the first time in 2023. More than 400  employees  in  mainland  China,  Hong  Kong  SAR,  Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Australia took part in a variety  of  activities  with  the  aim  of  supporting  local communities.\n\n## Kering Employee Listening internal engagement survey\n\nKering  has  also  created  its  own  employee  survey  -  Kering Employee Listening - to develop a culture of feedback in which employees'  ideas  result  in  concrete  action,  such  as  a  new company  agreement  on  well-being  or  sharing  of  the  company strategy via live streams translated into the local language, and in which  managers  can  be  changemakers.  These  are  annual engagement surveys comprising around 30 questions relating to engagement,  well-being,  inclusion  and  diversity,  as  well  as opportunities for internal development. In 2023, 36,584 employees took part in the survey, representing a participation rate  of  83%.  The  measured  rate  of  engagement  was  73/100 overall. The aim of this tool is to boost employees' engagement, sense  of  belonging  and  performance  by  listening  to  them. Employee feedback can therefore directly improve their working experience. The results of these surveys are analyzed by gender, age, job category and other attributes, and taken into account in drawing up practical action plans. The aim was to gain a better understanding  of  the  expectations  and  feelings  of  female employees,  and  take  concrete  measures  to  improve  the employee  experience  within  the  Group  (see  section  3.2.2.1). These surveys have also been adapted to suit more local needs, particularly at the level of the Houses with the Pulse surveys.\n\nGucci  carried  out  two  surveys  of  all  employees  (around 19,000 people) in 2023, with an average response rate of 85%.\n\n## 3.2.4  Quality of life at work\n\nAs early as 2010, Kering signed a \"Charter of commitments on the  quality  of  life  at  work  and  the  prevention  of  work-related stress\" with the Group's European Works Council. This charter has enabled the Houses to develop and implement action plans based on three key principles:\n\n- 1. identifying  and  assessing  the  causes  of  stress  in  the workplace;\n- 2. deploying preventive measures to improve quality of life at work and reduce workplace stress factors;\n\n<!-- image -->",

Under  the  agreement,  the  Houses  are adopting procedures and taking action to identify, assess, reduce and prevent the key risks associated with their activities. They are also taking initiatives designed to achieve continuous improvements  in  quality  of  life  at  work.  In  this  way,  Kering  is committed  to  developing  a  working  environment  and  working relationships  that  ensure  well-being  at  work,  to  promote  the development  of  all  employees  and  contribute  to  the  Group's performance.\n\nThe  2023  Kering  Employee  Listening  opinion  survey  included questions  on  quality  of  life  at  work,  morale,  stress,  work-life balance,  health  and  safety,  as  well  as  mental  health  and preventing work-related stress.\n\nMeasures to promote well-being at work include:\n\n- \u00b7 handing out a guide to well-being at work to all employees of Corporate  functions  in  Europe.  This  guide  informs employees  about  matters  relating  to  their  quality  of  life  at work, the definition of psychosocial risks and the six factors that  can  influence  employees'  health,  performance  and satisfaction  at  work  based  on  studies  by  the  International Labour Organization (ILO) and the World Health Organization (WHO).  It also provides a reminder  of the Group's commitments, the related e-learning offering and dedicated contact people for all teams;\n- \u00b7 in-person training for senior managers and managers to help them  detect  situations  where  well-being  is  at  risk,  hold preemptive  conversations  with  employees,  and  understand what their roles are as managers and whom they can ask for support both within the Group and externally, to create a safe and supportive working environment;\n- \u00b7 a consultation on social dialogue and well-being at work within  the  Group,  leading  to  the  signing  of  a  common declaration with members of the European Works Council in 2022.  This  common  declaration  refers  to  the  Group's innovative policies to foster well-being at work;\n- \u00b7 an agreement with the European Works Council on social dialogue  and  well-being  at  work signed  on  June  7,  2023. This  agreement  -  communicated  to  all  Group  employees  in 50 countries - is based on two principles: defining well-being at work according to four specific dimensions and cultivating social dialogue to contribute to well-being at work. This is a key  agreement  for  the  HR  community,  managers  and employees as it includes  appendices  in  French,  English  and Italian that are useful in fostering well-being at Kering and its Houses, such as:\n- -the intercompany commitment concerning employees aged over 50,\n- -advice on working from home,\n- -the Kering Charter on the right to disconnect,\n- -the guide to quality of life at work,\n- -Kering's innovative social commitments such as the health and safety policy, Baby Leave, the global policy on domestic violence and the human rights policy.\n\n## 3.2.4.1  Promotion of workplace safety and management of psychosocial risks\n\nKering's global health and safety policy is based on best practice from  across  the  organization.  It  aims  to  ensure  that  a  clear governance structure is in place and that regular internal audits and other processes are implemented Group-wide, with a view to achieving the zero-accident target each year. It also requires the Houses  to  take  specific  measures  to  improve  quality  of  life  at work  for  retail  employees  and  to  conduct  regular  health  and safety  audits.  The  Houses  adapt  their  local  procedures  by involving the Social and Economic Committee's Health, Safety & Working Conditions team, ergonomists, occupational physicians and external  prevention  specialists.  In  terms  of  risk  prevention, 54,567  hours  of  safety  training  were  provided  to  8,187  Group employees in 2023.\n\nNational, regional and local procedures have been developed by the entities to put Kering's global health and safety policies into practice.  A  continuous  consultation  process  has  been  initiated with employees on the topics of health, safety and well-being to enable  everyone  at  Kering  to  play  a  role  in  prevention  and protection  measures.  Support  offered  to  employees  has  been extended in several countries. In Europe, Kering Corporate now offers all employees virtual or face-to-face psychological support, as  well  as  legal  and  financial  support.  These  services  are  also offered  by  some  Houses  in  France  and  Italy.  In  the  United Kingdom,  all  Group  employees  benefit  from  an  emotional support  service.  In  the  Middle  East,  a  well-being  platform  is provided  for  all  employees,  which  can  be  accessed  on  their mobile  phone,  with  access  to  psychological,  legal  and  financial support.  In  Asia,  employees  benefit  from  a  24-hour  hotline  in Mainland  China  and  personal,  custom  support  in  Japan.  In  the United  States,  a  psychological  support  service  is  offered  to  all Group employees as part of the health insurance scheme.\n\nIn  addition,  well-being  at  work  pilot  programs  have  been launched  such  as  #takecare  at  Kering  Corporate  -  a  guide  to quality of life at work updated in 2023, defining psychosocial risk and how to recognize the risks, as well as advice for employees and  managers,  training  on  well-being  at  work  included  in  the Kering training catalogue in 2023 and for 2024 - and Be Well at Alexander  McQueen  -  a  global  well-being  and  mental  health program comprising a global campaign and local and worldwide initiatives including activation days and dedicated guides.\n\nIn addition to these initiatives, the Houses are exploring various other avenues, including:\n\n- \u00b7 identifying  psychosocial  risk  factors  at  work  (e.g.  Kering Corporate,  Bottega  Veneta  and  Gucci  through  SA8000  and ISO 45001 certification);\n- \u00b7 preventing psychosocial risks and stress: talks by healthcare professionals and sports trainers at Kering's head office, and providing social assistance services for employees.\n\nIn  2023,  288  lost-time  accidents  were  recorded across all of the Group's Houses, compared with 252 in 2022 and 233 in 2021, with zero fatal accidents in 2023, as was the case in 2022 and 2021.",

The overall absenteeism rate includes absenteeism due to illness and every other kind of absence (maternity leave, paternity leave, unjustified absences, etc.), calculated from the first day of absence.\n\n## 3.2.4.2  Organization of work\n\nThe average working time of the Group's full-time employees is 40 hours per week. In 2023, 68,763 hours of overtime were logged in France, an increase on 2022.\n\nIn 2023, 2,183 employees worked part-time. Employees working part-time accounted for 4.8% of permanent employees, up as a proportion  of  the  total  workforce,  located  mainly  in  the  United States  and  Western  Europe.  Contractual  working  hours  are spread out on the basis of the specific business and organization of  each  House,  either  over  certain  days  of  the  week,  or  overreduced time slots on all working days.\n\nThe organization of working time remains a topic addressed by the  Group's  Houses  and  may  vary  according  to  the  countries, sites  and  employees  concerned  (in  stores,  production  and workshops  or  support  functions).  Kering  Corporate  and  the Houses make every effort to organize the work of employees in strict  compliance  with  local  health,  safety  and  environment guidelines.\n\nIn  France,  work  is  mostly  organized  on  the  basis  of  a  fixed number of hours or days, with annualized working time and the possibility of flextime.\n\nBeyond these legal aspects, the Houses try to find and offer more flexible ways to organize working time in order to meet their own needs as well as those of their employees as part of their policy on  quality  of  life  at  work:  flextime  for  several  Houses,  the introduction of a smart working pilot plan at the Bottega Veneta and Gucci headquarters in Italy, leave to care for sick children at Boucheron  and  part-time  work  at  Pomellato.  In  2022,  when fitting  out  offices,  Kering  also  included  flex  office  arrangements for  its  Corporate  functions  and  for  its  Houses  in  Europe  which, alongside remote working, foster a better work/life balance.\n\nThese  discussions  are  regularly  shared  within  the  European Works Council and discussions are also held with managers and employee  representatives  at  the  local  level  to  find  the  most appropriate  solutions  while  also  ensuring  employee  well-being and a healthy work-life balance.\n\n## 3.2.4.2.1 Promoting a better work-life balance and fostering wellbeing at work\n\nThe Group and its Houses implement actions in favor of work-life balance  benefiting  both  men  and  women  and  based  on  two aspects.\n\n## 1. Operating a strong parental policy\n\nKering is committed to ensuring a good work-life balance for its employees by helping them through life's key moments. The best example  of  this  commitment  is  its  global  parental  policy, deployed  in  the  50  countries  in  which  the  Group  operates  on January 1, 2017, and further enhanced by the introduction of the Baby Leave scheme on January 1, 2020.\n\nBaby  Leave  is  offered  to  all  Kering  employees  regardless  of gender  or  family  situation.  It  offers  the  same  terms  of  parental leave for all new parents all over the world. By giving all parents the same parental leave, Baby Leave is an important step forward in  achieving  gender  equality.  It  allows  women  to  go  further  in their  careers  and  also  helps  to  build  a  society  free  of  gender stereotypes.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Houses  and  Kering  Corporate  help  employees return to work after becoming parents. Kering Corporate France allows  employees  to  return  to  work  on  an  80%  part-time  basis while continuing to be paid 100% of their salary the month after they return from maternity, paternity or adoption leave. In 2020, Balenciaga  launched  Baby  Leave  Comeback  to  help  parents return  to  work  by  offering  them  greater  flexibility.  Specific employee  benefits  are  offered  by  Gucci,  Pomellato,  Kering  UK and Kering Italy.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThe employee experience at the heart of the Group's Human resources strategy\n\n## 2. Encouraging, where possible, more flexible work methods that enable employees to better organize their lives\n\nFlexible work was suggested by employees as a way of improving quality  of  life  at  work  and  enhancing  work-life  balance,  in response to the employee opinion surveys conducted in 2019 and 2021  in  all  the  countries  where  Kering  operates.  The  measures deployed  by  the  Group  and  its  Houses  as  part  of  their  action plans address this desire for more flexible working methods.\n\nKering has been a member, since 2016, of a discussion platform initiated  by  the  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO),  known as  the  Global  Business  Network,  the  French-speaking  branch of which  brings  together  French-speaking  companies  that  are committed to developing joint international welfare programs.\n\nThe  Houses  have  also  been  able  to  capitalize  on  measures relating  to  well-being  at  work,  such  as  the  organization  of workplaces in line with the highest standards, as well as flexible working hours, work-life balance and health and well-being.\n\nIn  France,  the  right  to  disconnect  has  been  introduced.  A disconnection  charter  and  a  guide  to  best  practice  regarding remote  working  also  form  part  of  the  Group's  work-related standards.  The  agreement  signed  with  the  European  Works Council  on  June  7,  2023,  on  social  dialogue  and  well-being  at work has been rolled out in all host countries, incorporating the Group's  social  standards  and  risk  prevention  tools  into  its appendices.\n\nKering  is  involved  in  the  work  of  the  ILO's  French-speaking network and helped to draw up three guides to best  practices, including  \"Implementing  a  strategy  to  support  parents  and measuring  its  impact\"  (2021)  and  \"Global  businesses  and  wellbeing at work\" (2023).\n\n## 3.3 Remuneration and employee benefits\n\nThe Group's personnel expenses totaled around \u20ac3 billion in 2023 (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in chapter 6 of this document).\n\n## 3.3.1  Remuneration policy\n\nRemuneration  is  a  key  component  that  managers  can  use  to reward  the  commitment  and  the  individual  and  collective performance of their teams.\n\n## 3.3.1.1 Performance-related remuneration\n\nThere  must  be  a  strong  link  between  remuneration,  individual contribution and collective performance. This link with performance  must  exist  for  all  components  of  remuneration, both basic salary and variable elements (i.e., bonuses and longterm incentives).\n\nAccordingly, 90% of the Group's employees receive a fixed salary and a variable pay component that is subject to the achievement of individual and/or collective objectives.\n\nThe  individual  portion  of  variable  pay  is  determined  and managed as part of the performance management process. Each employee's  contribution  to  their  team's  results  is  assessed  by their  direct  manager  in  accordance  with  the  achievement  of targets set and their behavior throughout the year.\n\nIn a similar spirit of recognizing and rewarding team performance and  the  contribution  of  all  employees  to  Kering's  growth  and success, the Group introduces incentive plans in countries where this  is  encouraged  by  the  local  legislation.  In  France,  nearly  all employees benefit from a profit-sharing mechanism.\n\nFor  example,  in  2023  and  for  the  fifth  consecutive  year,  all Bottega  Veneta  employees  were  involved  in  an  inclusive approach  to  setting  sustainability  targets  for  their  activities. Balenciaga France entered into a three-year incentive agreement in  2020  under  which employees are given a financial interest in reaching sustainability and profitability targets.\n\n## 3.3.1.2 Competitive and fair remuneration\n\nMajor efforts are made to ensure that fixed salaries are both fair internally and competitive within the market. They are reviewed annually,  based  on  proposals  made  by  direct  managers.  Fixed salary  raises  are  granted  in  accordance  with  the  level  of  the existing  salary  in  comparison  with  peers  and/or  the  external market, factoring in performance over time and the potential for development.\n\nThe existence of a framework for all jobs within the Group and shared  by  all  Houses  (known  as  the  \"Job  Catalogue\")  enables their  accurate  definition  based  on  both  area  of  expertise  and level  of  responsibility.  This  is  particularly  helpful  during  the internal and external competitiveness analyses that are regularly conducted  by  the  Group,  and  for  the  fair  allocation  of  variable pay and certain benefits in kind.\n\nIndividual  career  paths  within  the  Group  and  impacts  on individual  remuneration  are  managed  without  consideration  of gender or age.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Group  developed  the  Kering  Parity  Index  to  allow Houses  to  evaluate  and  monitor  their  parity  performance  over time. This index consists of four individually weighted indicators: parity  indicator  in  the  300  executive  positions  with  the  greatest level  of  responsibility,  gender pay gap by level of responsibility, comparative opportunities for men and women to benefit from a promotion  or  job  development,  and  comparative  opportunities for men and women to receive a pay rise. It is calculated annually for  each  House  and  at  consolidated  Group  level  in  order  to identify areas of weakness requiring specific remedial measures and to allow changes in these various metrics to be monitored over time.",

        "page_content": "## Focus: Kering obtains Universal Fair Pay certification\n\nIn 2023, the Group took a new step in its analysis of gender pay gaps by completing a dedicated study, in partnership with a specialized  and  independent  consulting  firm.  This  initiative  was  carried  out  globally  across  the  Group,  in  all  Houses  and  all countries. The objective was to identify possible gender pay gaps that cannot be explained by factors that legitimately influence pay  (such  as,  for  example,  the  employee's  level  of  experience,  the  level  of  responsibility,  the  professional  field,  the  work location, etc.).\n\nThe study revealed an unexplained gender pay gap of 1.6% in favor of men and allowed us to identify targeted actions to reach the Group's commitment to equal pay. Following this first analysis and identification of the actions, the Fair Pay Innovation Lab, an independent organization whose aim is fair pay for all, undertook a comprehensive review and awarded Kering and each of our Houses with their Universal Fair Pay certification.\n\nIn addition, Gucci obtained certification for gender parity in Italy in  2023,  introduced  as  part  of  the  country's  National  Recovery and Resilience Plan (see section 3.2.2).\n\nThese  initiatives  are  an  integral  part  of  the  plan  of  action  to achieve gender parity, which forms part of the 2025 Sustainability Strategy.\n\n## 3.3.1.3 Remuneration and social commitment\n\nIn 2021, Kering carried out a global study to define, for each of the countries in which it operates, the Kering standards that would ensure  a  decent  standard  of  living  to  all  employees  and  their families.  The  definition  of  a  decent  standard  of  living  includes: food,  water,  housing,  education,  healthcare  and  other  essential needs. In order to ensure that these thresholds are reliable and legitimate,  the  Group  has  drawn  on  the  Fair  Wage  Network methodology,  which  collects  and  analyzes  information  for different  countries  on  a  standardized  basis.  New  research  that becomes available in each country is systematically integrated by the organization.\n\nEach  House  is  informed  of  any  shortfalls  on  an  annual  basis. Kering's commitment to guaranteeing a decent standard of living for each employee and their family is included in the agreement signed with the European Works Council on June 7, 2023, as part of  its  societal  and  environmental  commitment,  one  of  the  four dimensions of well-being at work.\n\nTo  ensure  that  the  value  and  wealth  that  Kering  creates  are shared fairly, it launched its first employee share ownership plan in  2022,  KeringForYou.  The  program  was  offered  to  Group employees based in France, Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Japan and South Korea, representing 80% of Kering's total workforce.\n\n## 3.3.2  Executive pay\n\nWithin  Kering's  senior  management,  the  remuneration  of 300  people  in  particular  is  monitored  by  the  Group's  Human Resources  department,  with  the  aim  of  ensuring  internal consistency and competitiveness in light of industry practice.\n\nThe  remuneration  structure  for  senior  executives  (portions allocated  as  base  pay  and  as  short-and  long-term  variable remuneration)  is  defined  by  the  Group.  It  varies  in  accordance with  the  level  of  responsibility  assigned  to  the  role.  The  shortterm variable remuneration (annual bonus) policy aims to reward senior executives for meeting objectives - in part financial and in\n\npart individual - set in line with the strategy of the Group and the Houses.  Financial  performance  is  assessed  on  the  basis  of  two indicators, dedicated to measuring  profitability (recurring operating income) and assessing the quality of the free cash flow of the Group and the Houses.\n\nThe long-term incentive policy, meanwhile, meets two objectives: rewarding executive teams for both their performance over time and their loyalty to the Group.\n\nSince  2020,  all  executives  have  had  performance  shares,  which now represent the main element of Kering's long-term incentive schemes. The number of shares granted to each executive varies with their level of responsibility. The number of shares delivered at the end of the vesting period depends on Kering's share price performance compared with a panel of luxury goods stocks.\n\nFor  executives  working  within  a  Group  House,  the  Kering performance shares are accompanied by monetary units in the same proportion, linked to the valuation of the House for which they work. These monetary units were launched in 2013 and their unit  value  evolves  over  time  in  line  with  the  increase  in  the House's value. At the end of a three-year vesting period starting from the year that the monetary units were granted, executives have  the  opportunity  to  exchange  their  monetary  units  during each of the subsequent two years.\n\n## 3.3.3  Employee benefits within the Group\n\nIn addition to monetary remuneration, Kering has always placed great importance on offering its employees healthcare, disability/ life  cover  and  pension  benefits,  as  well  as  ensuring  their  wellbeing  more  generally.  As  well  as  the  coverage  provided  for  by law,  almost  all  employees  enjoy  supplementary  insurance through the various plans in operation in the Group's Houses. For some  years,  the  Houses  have  offered  more  comprehensive benefit  plans  in  line  with  best  practice  in  each  country.  These popular plans are constantly changing to better meet employees' expectations. France is a good example of this: savings, pensions, healthcare  and  benefits  were  fully  overhauled  in  2022  to  offer employees  more  suitable  coverage.  As  well  as  basic  coverage, plans  often  include  benefits  relating  to  well-being,  sports, education, recreation, transportation and family support. As far as  possible,  these  benefits  are  available  flexibly  and  can  be selected  to  meet  the  needs  of  each  individual.  This  was  the guiding  spirit  behind  the  introduction  in  2020  of  the  ambitious Flex Benefits program for Gucci's employees in China.",

The  Group  offers  flexible, hybrid working, which has now been adopted by most employees in  Kering's  offices.  All  employees  receive  a  minimum  of  two weeks  of  paid  leave  per  year,  notably  in  Asia  and  the  United States,  where  paid  leave  is  not  covered  by  local  labor  law.  The\n\n## 3.4 Social dialogue\n\nThe  Kering  group  strives  to  ensure  ongoing  social  dialogue specific to each of its bodies, as well as social dialogue in France and on a European level within the Houses and the Group.\n\nIn  2021,  European  Works  Council  members  had  their  terms  of office  renewed,  and  the  EWC  marked  its  20th  anniversary. Members  of  the  French  Works  Council  appointed  in  2019  also underwent  economic  and  workforce-related  training.  This training  took  place  in-person  in  Paris  and  fed  through  into Kering's social dialogue on a national level.\n\nIn  2022,  employee  representative  partners  received  training  on social  regulation,  as  well  as  training  courses  on  well-being  at work, and were able to negotiate on the issue of social dialogue and well-being at work.\n\nAn  agreement  on  social  dialogue  and  well-being  at  work  was signed with the European Works Council on June 7, 2023. Other notable events of 2023 were the 30th anniversary of the French Works Council and the signing of an amendment to the French Works Council agreement on June 28 for the body's re-election.\n\n## 3.4.1  Listening to and engaging with employees\n\nTo  encourage  a  culture  of  dialogue  and  in  line  with  its engagement  policy, the Group favors directly informing employees via internal platforms (see section 3.2.3.).\n\nSocial dialogue has also been defined and associated with wellbeing at work within the framework of Kering's negotiations with the  European  Works  Council.  Fostering  social  dialogue  to contribute  to  well-being  at  work  is  therefore  one  of  the  two principles  of  the  agreement  signed  by  Kering  with  members  of the European Works Council on June 7, 2023.\n\nThe negotiations led by Kering on the issue of social dialogue and well-being  at  work  in  2023  and  2022  are  central  to  the  Group's overall Human Resources strategy and make it possible to jointly devise  action  plans  with  the  various  entities  and  employee representative partners to supplement any local initiatives with the support of the managing bodies.\n\nThe agreement makes social dialogue in Europe a key element of the Group's social strategy and allows for tools to be shared with the Houses to create impetus in sharing best practices.\n\nThis agreement also strengthens social dialogue at all levels for employees  and  their  representatives  and  enables  ongoing  and lasting  improvement  of  dialogue  with  the  European  Works Council in addressing present-day challenges.\n\nThe  number  of  hours  for  strike  increased  to  4,009  in  2023, compared with 1,021 in 2022 and 1,673 in 2021, in a context of economic tensions.\n\npaid leave policy allows employees to \"recharge their batteries\" so  as  to  better  engage  with  and  contribute  to  a  positive  and balanced work environment.\n\n## 3.4.2  The Group's forums for social dialogue\n\n## 3.4.2.1  Kering European Works Council\n\nCreated pursuant to the agreement of September 27, 2000, the Kering  European  Works  Council  (EWC)  provides  a  Europe-wide forum  for  information,  consultation,  exchanging  of  views  and dialogue.  The  principal  purpose  of  the  EWC  is  to  remain  a  key intermediary  in  the  development  of  social  dialogue  between European countries with differing realities and social practices.\n\nThe  EWC  is  a  cross-border  institution  and  operates  alongside existing national employee representative bodies in accordance with specific prerogatives in terms of receiving information and being consulted. The discussions that take place within the EWC enable employee representatives to acquire a better knowledge and  understanding  of  the  Group's  organization,  strategy  and main challenges.\n\nThe  EWC  holds  two  three-day  plenary  sessions  per  year  with Group  Management,  at  which  it  is  informed  of  and,  where applicable,  consulted  on  cross-border  issues  affecting  the Group's employees in a manner defined in precise terms by the new agreement signed for an indefinite period.\n\nThe  EWC  also  has  a  Select  Committee  composed  of  five members, elected by their peers, who meet at least four times a year to prepare and analyze the two annual plenary sessions and to discuss various issues with Group Management.\n\nIn  2021,  the  members  of  the  EWC  had  their  terms  of  office renewed for four years. The EWC met on two occasions, including one  meeting  attended  by  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault,  the  Group's Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer, while the Select Committee met four times. Regular meetings are also held with the  EWC  secretariat.  The  Council  members  newly  appointed  in each country met in Paris on December 1, 2 and 3, 2021.\n\nIn October 2022, the EWC's members took part in three days of inperson training on economic matters. This training plays a vital role in developing the skills of EWC members, who have regularly addressed  the  financial  and  economic  issues  relating  to  the Group  as  well  as  workforce-related  innovations  over  the  last 20 plus years.\n\nIn  2023,  the  EWC met on two occasions. Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, the Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Financial Officer attended  the  June  meeting.  The  Select Committee  met  four  times,  including  one  meeting  with  the Group's new Deputy CEO in charge of Operations and Finance.",

The CSR  Committee  met  for  the  first  time  on  December  7  and discussed  issues  relating  to  sustainability  with  its  members, making it a specific item on the agenda for the next meeting.\n\nIn 2023, the European Works Council covered 100% of employees in  Europe  and  around  50%  of  employees  worldwide.  However, 100% of worldwide employees are covered by the social dialogue and  wellbeing  at  work  agreement  signed  with  the  European Works Council, making wellbeing associated with social dialogue a transnational issue.\n\n## 3.4.2.2  French Works Council\n\nWithin all of its Houses in France, the Group engages in dialogue with employee representative bodies and as part of negotiations with unions.\n\nCreated  in  1993  and  renewed  most  recently  in  2015,  Kering's French Works Council represents workers in France and operates under  French  law.  Its  members,  who  meet  in  plenary  sessions once  a  year,  are  kept  informed  of  and  exchange  views  on  the Group's strategies, economic and financial imperatives, and HR management  policy.  Each  plenary  session  is  preceded  by  two preparatory meetings of members that allow them to seek expert advice and ask questions of the Board prior to the annual plenary session.\n\nOn  February  27,  2020,  an  agreement  renewing  the  powers  and resources  attributed  to  the  French  Works  Council  was  signed unanimously  by  the  unions  for  an  indefinite  period.  Under  this agreement, two days of economic and workforce-related training were  provided  to  members  of  the  French  Works  Council  on September  29  and  30,  2021.  The  topics  discussed  during  inperson  meetings  of  the  French  Works  Council  in  April  and  May and on June 4, 2021, included an update on the social, economic and  financial  situation  of  the  Group  and  its  Houses,  a presentation  on  2021  ethics  and  compliance  training,  and  a discussion relating to questions submitted in advance by French Works Council members.\n\nKering  also  took  advantage  of  the  two  days'  training  of  French Works Council members to incorporate training on issues relating to social dialogue.\n\nMembers of  the  French  Works  Council  met  three  times  in  2022 and  undertook  training  on  social  dialogue  in  preparation  for employee  representative  elections  at  the  Group's  Houses.  This training, provided by an expert in workforce relations, is part of the  four-stage  training  course  that  has  been  delivered  to members  of  the  French  Works  Council  and  the  Houses'  HR managers since 2021 in France.\n\nThe French Works Council met three times in 2023 and executive management celebrated the Council's 30th anniversary with its members. Kering  also  signed  an  amendment  to  the  agreement with members on June 28, 2023, concerning the re-election of the Council.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group further believes that respect for human rights applies to everyone, be they employees, workers in supply chains  or  members  of  local  communities.  These  key  principles are documented in the Group's Code of Ethics and Human rights Policy.\n\nKering helps its suppliers adopt more sustainable practices and has put in place numerous initiatives to involve suppliers in the Group's objectives and requirements with regard to sustainability and support their transition efforts.\n\nThis requires transparency and traceability within supply chains for  its  raw  materials  -  and  therefore  the  need  to  identify, understand  and  map  those  chains  -  with  a  view  to  developing synergies and priority programs wherever significant impacts are found.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For  any  supplier  wanting  to  work  with Kering  or  one  of  its  Houses,  notwithstanding  any  contractual clauses,  compliance  with  the  Charter  is  a  precondition  of  the business relationship. The Group requires its suppliers to commit formally  to  applying  high  ethical  standards  themselves  and  to upholding human rights.\n\nThe Charter reminds them of the need to promote human rights within  their  production  units  and  among  their  subcontractors, and to advise Kering and/or its Houses of any serious difficulties in  applying  the  Charter.  Compliance  is  further  measured  by means of social audits at production sites (see section 4.2). The requirements of the Suppliers' Charter are applied operationally through  the  Sustainability  Principles  for  suppliers,  detailed below, and supplemented by the Human rights Policy.\n\n## 4.1.1.2  Sustainability Principles applicable to suppliers\n\nKering's Sustainability Principles relate to three areas:\n\n- \u00b7 social  aspects  that  relate  to  human  rights,  the  rights  of workers and their health and safety: the prohibition of child labor,  forced  labor,  human  trafficking  in  all  its  forms, discrimination,  harassment,  living  wage,  compliance  with statutory  working  hours,  and  respect  for  the  freedom  of association and the right to collective bargaining;\n- \u00b7 environmental aspects, such as compliance with laws as well as restrictive lists of chemicals defined by Kering, environmental management, waste water treatment etc.;\n- \u00b7 aspects related to the supply of raw materials and packaging, including  respect  for  animal  welfare  and  the  five  related freedoms,  sourcing  and  traceability  requirements  for  a number of key materials used by Kering, and the prohibition of  certain  substances  and/or  certain  sourcing  regions  (for reasons  that  may  relate  to  a  high  risk  of  human  rights violations  -  such  as  child  labor  or  forced  labor  -  or environmental conditions) etc.\n\nThese principles are available on the Group's website and have been an integral  part  of  supplier  contracts  since  2016;  they  are intended to provide operational guidance and details regarding the  Suppliers'  Charter.  Each  supplier  is  tasked  with  passing  on these principles to its own subcontractor network if it has any.\n\nThe document was updated in 2023 and has enabled Kering to clarify  its  requirements  regarding  various  themes.  As  such, additional  information  was  provided  to  enable  responsible recruitment  practices.  Kering  expects  its  suppliers  to  pay  close attention  to  this  topic,  ensuring  that  their  employees  have  not had to pay any recruitment fee or a deposit in order to get a job. In  such  case,  Kering  expects  its  suppliers  to  reimburse  the employees concerned. Furthermore, conscious of the importance\n\nof human  rights  and  environmental  rights  defenders  and indigenous peoples, Kering has formalized its expectations in this area.  Finally,  a  reference  to  the  Dhaka  Principles  for  migrant workers has been added to identify examples of good practice to be implemented.\n\n## 4.1.1.3  Responsible sourcing policy\n\nThe Group's general approach to responsible sourcing is  based on  key  principles  defined  in  its  Suppliers'  Charter  and  its Sustainability Principles applicable to suppliers. In addition, the Kering  Standards:  Standards  and  guidance  for  responsible production,  laying  down  the  Group's  requirements  in  terms  of responsible  sourcing  and  traceability  of  raw  materials  in manufacturing processes (see section 5.4).\n\nOn  one  hand,  for  non-retail  (indirect)  purchases,  the  Group's Indirect Purchasing Department remains committed to responsible  sourcing  based  on  a  reciprocal  undertaking  with suppliers to respect the Kering Code of Ethics. It also has specific commitments tailored to each category of purchases, with buyers and  internal  clients  identifying  the  most  relevant  sustainability criteria. The Group's Indirect Purchasing Policy includes standards of conduct relating to responsible sourcing. It sets out the priorities to be shared and applied by all Group employees to manage  sourcing  ethically  and  responsibly.  The  policy  was updated in 2023. To date, all buyers are trained and made aware of  responsible  sourcing  practices,  and  standard  purchases include CSR selection specifications and criteria.\n\nKering has signed since 2014 the \"Responsible Supplier Relations and  responsible  purchasing\"  Charter  issued  by  the  French Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance.  The  Charter  contributes  to building  a  balanced  and  sustainable  relationship  between signatories and their suppliers.\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  for  direct  purchases,  the  Group's  Direct Procurement  department  supports  Kering's  Houses  in  reaching the  2025  target  of  ensuring  that  100%  of  the  raw  materials  it purchases are aligned with the Kering Standards. Since 2021, the team has implemented procurement framework contracts, when possible, at Group level to support the sourcing of raw materials in the form of yarns and fabrics that are aligned with the Kering Standards and certified, ensuring availability of key commodities at  negotiated  prices  and  agreed  lead  times.  A  harmonized methodology  is  applied  to  all  projects  managed  by  the  Direct Procurement department, and this allows a tailored approach to be taken to each raw material based on its market characteristics.\n\n## 4.1.1.4  Kering Standards: adoption and dissemination\n\nIn  2012,  Kering  set  out  basic  principles  and  guidelines  on responsible sourcing, known as the Kering Standards: Standards and guidance for sustainable production. These Standards were published  in  2018  and  are  updated  every  year.  They  can  be downloaded  in  English,  Italian  and  French  from  the  Group's website.",

They are based on founding notions of integrity (material traceability,  Chain  of  Custody  certification,  etc.),  circularity  (use of  recycled  materials  where  possible,  consideration  of  the recyclability of products, etc.) and the precautionary principle (no use of GMOs, no nanomaterials, etc.).\n\nThe Kering Standards cover:\n\n- \u00b7 the raw materials used by the Group, representing more than 95% of its purchasing volumes;\n- \u00b7 the Group's main manufacturing processes, namely tanning, the  various  stages  of  textile  processing,  leather  work  and shoes;\n- \u00b7 packaging  and  logistics  (storage  and  transportation),  visual tools and innovation for sustainable production;\n- \u00b7 end-of-life management for products;\n- \u00b7 animal  welfare,  covering  all  species  that  form  part  of  the Group's supply chains;\n- \u00b7 supplementary guides relating to circularity, innovation and environmental claims.\n\nDedicated Standards also cover stores' planning and construction as well as stores' operations and management, with a view to minimize their environmental impacts.\n\nAlignment with the Kering Standards is monitored by each House and  consolidated  at  Group  level  through  the  EP&L  and  the Vendor Portal (see sections 4.1.2. and 5.1.1).\n\n## 4.1.2  Helping our suppliers to adopt more sustainable practices\n\n## 4.1.2.1  Monitoring and assessing suppliers' sustainability performance (Vendor Portal)\n\nSince 2020, Kering has been using a supplier portal, which can be accessed online. This portal is a tool for conducting evaluations, sharing information and sustainability practices. In 2023, most of Kering's suppliers in the ready-to-wear, leather goods and shoes categories have been engaged in this process, representing 95% of purchases in these categories.\n\nBy  means  of  dedicated  questionnaires  of  up  to  around  300 questions,  this  portal  assesses  implementation  of  the  Kering Standards across the supply chain, environmental performance, social performance and management of chemical substances of suppliers. The social questionnaire seeks increased transparency on  supplier  workforce  (gender  balance,  for  example),  social initiatives,  management  of  health  and  safety  (risk  assessment, incident rate, etc.), and procedures put in place to mitigate risks of  forced  labor  and  child  labor.  This  information  is  used  to calculate  certain  performance  indicators  for  suppliers  and  to define the scope of new projects.\n\nThe various indicators show that:\n\n- \u00b7 more  than  730  suppliers  representing  around  69%  of purchasing  in  the  ready-to-wear,  leather  goods  and  shoes categories have completed, to date, the four questionnaires, submitting  a  self-assessment  of  their  performance  via  the portal;\n\n- \u00b7 all  respondents  acknowledge  that  they  know  the  Group's requirements  (Code  of  Ethics  and  Suppliers'  Charter,  MRSL and PRSL, Kering Standards);\n- \u00b7 46% of industrial sites state that they either buy or produce renewable energies ; around one third produce it on-site;\n- \u00b7 604  production  sites  representing  58%  of  purchases  in  the ready-to-wear,  leather  goods  and  shoes  categories  have shared data regarding their water consumption.\n\nKering and its Houses strive to develop long-lasting relationships with  their  suppliers,  in  a  spirit  of  trust  and  continuous collaboration.  For  instance,  long-term  partnerships  between brands  and  suppliers  play  a  pivotal  role  in  preserving,  sharing and improving key know-how in a mutually beneficial way, and in ensuring the manufacturing of iconic pieces.\n\nThe  Group  and  its  Houses  also  encourage  -  wherever  relevant and  particularly  taking  account  of  suppliers'  size  -  the  use  of certifications  under  internationally  recognized  standards  for environmental management systems (ISO 14001), labor relations (SA8000) and health and safety (ISO 45001).\n\n## 4.1.2.2  Awareness and capacity building\n\nProviding  technical  support  and  helping  suppliers  through continuous improvement, training and awareness-raising programs are Kering's favored methods of developing environmentally  and  socially  responsible  supply  chains  and improving the performance of Group suppliers.\n\nKering and its  Houses help their suppliers implement projects intended to develop their technical expertise and reduce their environmental footprint, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 initiatives  adopted  by  logistics  teams  to  reduce  the  carbon footprint of their activities;\n- \u00b7 the  Clean  by  Design  program,  which  aims  to  improve  the environmental efficiency of 59 historic tier 1 and 2 suppliers located  in  Italy,  China  and  Japan  via  dedicated  training sessions and performance audits (water, energy and waste). On  average,  sites  taking  part  in  the  program  reduce  their water consumption by 5-10%. Energy savings averaged 19% per site, in a range from 10% to 20%, with peaks at 40%. The program  was  extended  to  15  new  suppliers  in  2023  in collaboration with other fashion Brands, under the supervision of the Apparel Impact Institute;\n- \u00b7 programs developed in collaboration with participants in the various raw materials supply chains (see section 5.4);\n- \u00b7 Pomellato's  support  for  several  suppliers  seeking  to  obtain RJC CoC certification by advising them on the topic;\n- \u00b7 the project set up by Saint Laurent and Balenciaga for their denim  suppliers  in  Japan,  to  assess  the  environmental performance of the various participants in the supply chain (Tier  1,  Tier  2  and  Tier  3)  and  help  them  to  improve  their practices  with  regard  to  water  and  energy  consumption, waste management, wastewater treatment and management of  chemical  products  (application  of  Kering's  MRSL  and PRSL). After a series of site visits in 2022, the year 2023 aimed to  analyze  existing  production  processes  to  help  suppliers adopt  practical  initiatives.  Following  phases  will  include operational recommendations and monitoring;",

On average,  across  the  whole  Gucci  supply  chain,  25%  of  the energy  used  by  suppliers  comes  from  renewable  sources, peaking at over 50% in leather production and 40% in shoe production;\n- \u00b7 the  program Sviluppo  Filiere of  Gucci  launched  in  2020  in collaboration with Intesa Sanpaolo bank.\n\nSome types of suppliers are also offered training to:\n\n- \u00b7 advise them on how to align their raw materials sourcing with the Kering Standards;\n- \u00b7 raise their awareness  regarding  Kering's  sustainability initiatives so that they understand new practices (such as the Regenerative  Fund  for  Nature  and  regenerative  agricultural practices);\n- \u00b7 engage  their  commercial  and  business  teams,  in  order  to strengthen their approach to sustainable sourcing;\n- \u00b7 encourage  them  to  establish  new  commercial  relationships with  sustainability  actors  (e.g.,  the  regenerative  cashmere sourcing program);\n- \u00b7 strengthen  their  management  of  chemicals  used  in  the Luxury  industry,  with  more  than  250  suppliers  receiving training on the MRSL and the ZDHC program.\n\nIn 2023, Kering Eyewear organized Sustainability Days with 20 of its  main Italian suppliers, during which training and awarenessraising  sessions  were  held  on  sustainability  themes.  Kering Eyewear also provided training on its Virtus blockchain system to 21 of its indirect suppliers of raw materials and components (see section 5.5.2.2). Specific training regarding ISCC Plus certification was also organized for seven of its suppliers.\n\nThe Material Innovation Lab (see section 5.5.2) supports almost 100 of the Group's suppliers by helping them with their ecological transition. The MIL does this by making a financial contribution to the  costs  incurred  by  suppliers  in  obtaining  certification  or developing more sustainable materials, and offers training on the Kering Standards.\n\nThe Group and its Houses, including Balenciaga, Boucheron and Saint Laurent, are also committed to working with organizations in  the  social  and  solidarity  economy  (SSE),  particularly  through contracts for on-site services and pilot projects. Kering Eyewear has also formed a partnership with CAUTO Cooperativa Sociale , a network  of  social  cooperatives  in  Italy  that  helps  integrate disabled people.\n\n## 4.2 Action to improve working conditions in our supply chains\n\nKering's initiatives in respect of working conditions in its supply chains  form  part  of  the  Group's  Human  rights  approach,  and relate  to  its  duty  of  care  as  presented  in  chapter  5  \"Risk management and internal control\".\n\n## 4.2.1  Implementation of the social audit system within the Group\n\nNo control system, regardless of how mature and tested it is, can guarantee the absence of risk, and it is up to the Group and its Houses  to  embed  the  most  efficient  collaborative  and  control systems with suppliers in order to keep risk to a minimum and implement any corrective action in cases where non-compliance is identified.\n\nSince  2016,  the  Group  has  had  a  single  central  body  allowing Kering to control the compliance of Group suppliers, combining audit  and  risk  assessment  practices,  known  as  the  Hercules system. This system is built on the following six pillars:\n\n- 1. the  Sustainability  Principles,  updated  in  2023,  which  are divided  into  three  areas:  social  aspects  related  to  human rights,  labor  rights,  and  health  and  safety;  environmental aspects; and aspects related to raw materials sourcing and packaging (see section 4.1.1);\n- 2. central  management  by  Kering  through  a  team  of  37 people: depending on needs (location, workload, etc.), this team is assisted by external service providers that apply the same auditing methodology;\n- 3. clear and uniform procedures for all the Houses, corresponding  to  the  different  stages  of  the  supplier relationship, including activation, evaluation and termination of contract;\n- 4. audit plans that are regularly updated to take into account new suppliers and exclude those that have become inactive. The  risk  assessments  and  audit  plans  are  constructed  on the  basis  of  a  set  of  gross  risks  and  prior  social  audit performance;\n- 5. a  single,  comprehensive  audit  methodology  that  covers human  rights,  health  and  safety,  and  the  environment. Containing 97 questions, the comprehensive audit questionnaire  is  divided  into  13  categories  (child  labor, forced labor, health and safety, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, discrimination, wage, the environment, etc.) and is aligned with the best standards in the  field  such  as  SA8000  and  the  SMETA  audit  standard. Findings are consolidated between the Houses in order to avoid  any  overlap  in  the  audits.  Follow-up  audits  with  a smaller  scope  focus  on  the  area(s)  in  which  breaches  of compliance were identified during the first comprehensive audit. In all cases, audits -both  announced  and unannounced - consist of document reviews, site tours, and worker interviews. A representative sample of employees is selected for those interviews, taking into account age and union  representation  in  particular,  as  the  case  may  be. These interviews  are  confidential.  The  frequency  of  audits depends on the results of previous audits and the criticality of  suppliers.  Key  suppliers  are  audited  every  two  years. Better-rated  suppliers  will  be  audited  less  frequently. Nevertheless,  periodic  audits  are  undertaken  regularly  to ensure  compliance.  In  2022  and  2023,  the  teams  have launched  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  current  social audit protocol and associated checklists in order to capture rising  regulatory  expectations  and  best  practices  in  this area;",

Immediate  shutdown  of  the  approval  process  if  the supplier  is  in  the  process  of  being  activated  but  has not  started  working;  and  discussions  about  the possibility of remediation and support for the supplier or  about  the  need  to  terminate  the  contractual relationship if the supplier is working on one or more orders.

By type of supplier, the gender balance is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 tier 1 suppliers: 49% men, 51% women;\n- \u00b7 subcontractors: 47% men, 53% women.\n\nFor  each  of  the  13  categories  in  the  comprehensive  audit questionnaire,  a  detailed  description  of  what  constitutes  zerotolerance  breaches,  serious  or  moderate  compliance  breaches and observations has been prepared. For example, in the health and safety category, any situation that may endanger the lives of workers  is  a  zero-tolerance  breach;  the  absence  of  mandatory documentation on aspects capable of endangering the health or safety of employees is a serious compliance breach; the absence of  mandatory  documentation  other  than  that  addressing  the health or safety of workers is a moderate compliance breach; and a deviation from existing procedures results in an observation. In the  social  category,  the  falsification  of  a  certificate  proving payment  of  social  security  contributions  is  a  zero-tolerance breach;  any  issue  relating  to  the  minimum  wage  is  a  serious compliance breach; a failure to comply with updates to collective bargaining agreements is a moderate compliance breach; and a failure to implement  laws  to  promote  the  professional integration of vulnerable people results in an observation.\n\nDepending on the results of audits, suppliers are classified as:\n\n- \u00b7 compliant  (no  zero-tolerance  breaches,  no  compliance breaches,  whether  serious  or  moderate,  fewer  than  five observations);\n- \u00b7 partially  compliant  (no  zero-tolerance  breaches,  no  serious compliance breaches, fewer than five moderate breaches);\n- \u00b7 progress  expected  (no  zero-tolerance  breaches,  more  than five  moderate  compliance  breaches  or  at  least  one  serious breach);\n- \u00b7 zero tolerance (at least one zero-tolerance breach).",

        "page_content": "## 4.2.3  2023 results of supplier audits and key indicators\n\nThe  supplier  base  managed  by  Kering's  central  team  for  its Houses has the following characteristics:\n\n- \u00b7 it does include all production suppliers, the main suppliers of raw materials (leather, fabrics, ribbons, precious stones, etc.), Kering Eyewear suppliers and suppliers deemed strategic;\n- \u00b7 to date,  it  covers  4,433  suppliers,  with  the  following breakdown:\n- -38% Tier 1 suppliers (19% of direct suppliers that do not use subcontractors and 19% of contractors that use subcontractors),\n- -62%  subcontractors,  i.e.,  those  that  work  for  contractors and  have  no  direct  business  relationship  with  the  Houses (Tier 2 suppliers).\n\n8.5%  of  suppliers  were  deemed  strategic  in  2023.  Strategic suppliers  are  those  needed  to  ensure  business  continuity  due  to the volume of production involved and/or their specific know-how. Furthermore, out of the total number of active suppliers in 2023, 4.8% were deemed \"at risk\" because they are located in countries considered by the Group to be \"at risk\". A country is deemed to be at risk when the indicators contained in various external databases imply that human rights risks are high or very high.\n\n13.3% of suppliers were deemed critical in 2023 (of which 68.9% were in Tier 1 and 31.1% in Tier 2). Suppliers are deemed critical when they are strategic and/or at risk. If they meet both criteria, they are only counted once. They are given special attention in view of their importance to the business and their location.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the 12,569 anomalies broke down as follows:\n\n## Breakdown by severity of anomalies as of December 31, 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBreakdown by theme of the top five anomalies recorded (excluding observations) as of December 31, 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSubcontracting without prior authorization is not permitted.\n\nAmong  its  suppliers,  Kering  also  distinguishes  raw  material suppliers. Raw materials suppliers identified as key to the Group represent  roughly  20%  of  all  such  suppliers,  corresponding  to approximately 80% of purchases.\n\nLastly,  for  a  limited  portion  of  its  activities  (fragrances  and cosmetics), Kering also works with licensed suppliers, i.e., those that are under license to the Houses.\n\nWithin this portfolio of suppliers, 4,559 audits were conducted in 2023 (compared with 4,118 in 2022 and 3,420 in 2021), breaking down  into  2,616  comprehensive  audits  and  1,943  follow-up audits. A total of 32% of these audits were carried out by Kering's Internal Audit team and 68% by external auditors, with the Group audit protocol applied in the same way for all audits conducted. This  means  that  75%  of  suppliers  were  audited  in  2023.  Some audits  concern  suppliers  that  have  become  inactive:  486  of  the audits carried out in 2023 covered suppliers that were inactive at the end of the year, and 60% of the suppliers in the system that are now inactive have been audited since 2015.\n\nMoreover, Kering has undertaken to audit all of its key suppliers every  two  years.  It  should  be  noted  that  \"activation\"  audits  for new suppliers are comprehensive audits, and that they therefore cover the entire scope of a comprehensive audit.\n\nFinally,  with  the  aim  of  going  further  back  in  its  supply  chain, Kering includes an increasing number of raw material suppliers in its audits.\n\n## Breakdown by severity of anomalies recorded at critical Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers as of December 31, 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBreakdown by theme of the top five anomalies recorded (excluding observations) at critical Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers as of December 31, 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nFollowing these audits, 64.8% of suppliers were rated compliant (stable  compared  to  2022),  29.4%  partially  compliant,  4.6% progress expected and 1.2% zero tolerance. A total of 49 suppliers saw  their  business  relationship  terminated  in  2023  due  to unsatisfactory audit results.\n\nRobust  corrective  action  plans  were  put  together  following  the audits,  wherever  breaches  of  compliance,  and  particularly serious  breaches,  were  identified.  Follow-up  audits  were  then conducted  to  verify  the  resolution  of  the  problem.  The  zerotolerance  breaches  identified  during  the  audits  were  dealt  with immediately,  in  accordance  with  established  rules  and  in coordination  with  the  relevant  Houses.  To  speed  up  the resolution of issues, the central team  held  more  than 409 committee meetings with the Houses. This process aimed at continuous  improvement  led  to  resolution  of  several  serious compliance breaches and zero tolerance situations.\n\nFor  example,  in  2023  an  audit  of  a  new  supplier  revealed  agediscrimination  practices  in  its  recruitment  process.  After  this critical issue was discussed in a committee meeting, the supplier adopted  practical  measures  to  resolve  this  anomaly,  and  as  a result,  the  anomaly was considered closed. The supplier will be reassessed in 2024.\n\nAnother  example  concerns  a  supplier  where  a  serious  anomaly was  discovered  in  2021  concerning  breaches  of  statutory  rules regarding overtime. After providing regular evidence that it was complying  with  its  remedial  action  plan  in  2021  and  2022,  an audit  carried  out  in  2023  confirmed  that  the  company  was complying with the applicable rules.\n\nA  final  example  concerns  a  supplier  that  did  not  comply  with regulations  regarding  pay  rises.  After  providing  evidence  of remedial measures (correctly reclassifying employees and issuing back pay), the anomaly was considered closed.\n\n## 4.2.4  Beyond social audits: social impact\n\nBefore  it  establishes  commercial  relations  with  members  of  its supply chain, Kering focuses strongly on mitigating Human rights and  social-related  risks,  particularly  through  due  diligence carried  out  by  its  audit  department.  In  addition,  all  first-tier suppliers are required to disclose their subcontractors, and their disclosures are checked through social audits.\n\nAs well as mitigating human-rights risks, geographical location is an important criteria when identifying the initiatives that Kering needs to adopt as regards social impact. This approach requires sustained dialogue and active collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders,  including  private-sector  peers  faced  with  similar challenges, international organizations that are leading the way on  this  topic,  and  technical  partners  that  can  contribute  their expertise to discussions, such as living wage. Accordingly, Kering set  up  a  social  impact  team  in  its  Sustainability  Department  in 2021, whose role is to measure the social footprint of the Group's suppliers  and  provide  inputs  for  action  plans  adopted  by  the Houses and the Group in this area.\n\nThe  Group  started  reflecting  on  the  just  transition  in  order  to anticipate  the  changes  in  the  sector,  particularly  in  regards  to climate  change  and  other  environmental  issues,  taking  an intersectional  ecological  approach.  The  aim  is  to  preserve  jobs and  develop  the  skills  needed  to  address  the  sector's  future issues.\n\nAccordingly,  Kering  and  its  Houses  have  been  engaged  in several  initiatives  and  collaborations  to  develop  its  approach and explore priority areas of action for the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 Kering is an active member of the B4IG (Business for Inclusive Growth) coalition, which has merged with the WBCSD (World Business  Council  for  Sustainable  Development).  Kering  is particularly active in four working groups, i.e. (i) Living Wage, (ii)  Human  Rights,  (iii)  Social  Metrics  &  Impact  and  (iv) Diversity & Inclusion;\n- \u00b7 Kering is  a  founding  member  of  the  F\u00e9d\u00e9ration  de  la  Haute Couture  et  de  la  Mode  (FHCM)  working  group  focusing  on measuring social impact selected by its members (particularly regarding the living wage and gender equality). Kering  leads  certain  working  groups  so  that  the  Luxury industry in France uses the same evaluation methodology;\n- \u00b7 Kering  is  a  member  of  the  Capitals  Coalition,  a  global nonprofit platform that supports the use of different types of capitals (particularly human,  natural and social) for companies  to  make  strategic  decisions.  Kering  has  also contributed  to  the  development  of  courses  regarding  social and human capital, which are freely accessible online;\n- \u00b7 Kering  is  continuing  its  collaboration  with  the  Fair  Wage Network around the living wage in its supply chains;\n- \u00b7 in  2023,  Kering  became  a  strategic  partner  of  the  Wage Indicator Foundation's  initiative to make  living  wage estimates freely available to the public;\n- \u00b7 Kering continued to organize internal living wage workshops, bringing  together  various  Group's  stakeholders  and  its Houses, aimed at driving collaborative efforts.",

The Group made a commitment to reduce its EP&L intensity by 40% by 2025  compared  with  2015  (in  \u20ac  thousands  of  revenue), and achieved this target in 2021.\n\n## 5.1.1.1  Approach\n\nThe  EP&L  covers  six  categories  of  environmental  impact: greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, water pollution, water consumption, waste production and land use. It allows Kering and  its  Houses  to  measure  their  impacts  on  natural  capital across their entire value chain, firstly in terms of physical units (e.g., tons of CO2 equivalent, hectares of occupied land, tons of pollutants), and then assign a monetary value. The EP&L results make it possible to:\n\n- \u00b7 translate  environmental  impacts  into  a  common  business language;\n- \u00b7 compare environmental impacts between separate units;\n- \u00b7 compare,  for any given environmental  indicator, the magnitude of an impact for different locations;\n- \u00b7 facilitate comparisons between Houses and business units;\n- \u00b7 ultimately, choose between and prioritize actions.\n\nThe results should not be seen as a liability or a cost for Kering. Rather, they represent a way of assessing the cost to society of environmental  changes  stemming  from  the  activities  of  the Group and its suppliers, by taking into account local contexts and the impacts on local populations. The construction of the EP&L\n\ndraws on databases containing a level of uncertainty inherent in the principle of evaluating environmental impacts using LCA (Life Cycle Analysis) methods and economic modeling tools.\n\nIn 2023, Kering continued its work, seeking to:\n\n- \u00b7 increase automated data collection and incorporation of data obtained from financial consolidation processes;\n- \u00b7 increase  the  reliability  of  the  data  used  in  the  EP&L  by enhancing control processes. The voluntary limited assurance  for  its  EP&L  data  by  an  independent  third-party organization, renewed in 2023, is included at the end of this NFIS.  This  method  strengthens  Kering's  approach  and increases confidence among stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 extend  the  scope  covered,  thanks  in  particular  to  the incorporation  of  environmental  and  monetary  impacts associated  with  improving  the  measurement  of  greenhouse gas  emissions  (newly  calculated  Scope  3  categories,  see section  5.4.2.1),  accompanied  by  a  new  breakdown  of impacts between those directly related to products and their commercialization,  and  those  resulting  from  the  Group's transversal operations.\n\nThe methodological note on environmental reporting - available on the Kering website - explains the rules, scopes and calculation assumptions relating to the EP&L. It summarizes the framework developed and sets out the key aspects of the methodology, as well  as  the  elements  of  the  estimation  process  that  shape  the approach used and the calculations made, including assumptions about coefficients and monetization.\n\nKering  has  shared  its  2023  EP&L  results,  together  with  the coefficients used in the calculations, on the open-source platform kering-group.opendatasoft.com.\n\n## Scope covered by the EP&L approach\n\nThe EP&L measures Kering's environmental impacts across its entire value chain, divided into seven tiers, from production of the raw material used to make its products through to end-of-life of sold products. The graphic below exemplifies in an non-exhaustive way these tiers for two products, one made from leather and the other made from cotton.\n\n## Steps of the value chain covered by the EP&L (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This target was achieved in 2021, four years ahead of schedule. In 2023, Kering confirmed its trajectory to reduce its environmental footprint, with a 58% reduction in intensity compared to the 2015 baseline  year  with  an  identical  EP&L  scope  of  calculation (2) .  In 2023,  Kering  was  able  to  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  its environmental strategy by means of its ongoing commitment to reducing  its  impact  through  effective  programs  and  actions across the entire value chain.\n\n## Change in Group EP&L intensity 2015 to 2023 (\u20acEP&L/\u20ac thousand of revenue)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EP&L impact ( in \u20ac millions )\n\nThe  Group's  overall  environmental  impact  in  2023  across  all categories  amounted  to  \u20ac498  million,  broken  down  into  two parts:\n\n- \u00b7 Environmental impact relating to the products' life cycle and their commercialization ,  which comes to \u20ac429 million, or 86% of the Group's total EP&L footprint. These impacts are divided between the various tiers of Kering's value chain and according  to  the  various  types  of  environmental  impact,  as shown  in  the  chart  below.  The  value  chain  (Tier  1  to  4) represents the majority of the Group's environmental impact relating to the products' life cycle and their commercialization,  accounting  for  84%,  of  which  75% attributable  to  the  production  of  raw  materials  (Tier  4)  and their initial  processing (Tier 3). The product use and end-oflife  phases  account  for  10%  and  0.1%  of  these  impacts respectively. The impacts relating to Kering's own operations, or  Tier  0  (consumption  of  water  resources,  energy,  waste, etc.,  from  stores,  tanneries,  warehouses  and  other  Kering sites, as well as the impact of its logistics activities), account for 6% of the EP&L impacts of the Group's products.\n\nGreenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  and  land  use  remain  the predominant impact indicators,  accounting  for  around  71% of the impact. This confirms Kering's environmental priorities.",

The amount of  these  impacts  has  been  valued  solely  on  the  basis  of greenhouse  gas  emissions  associated  with  these  categories (tons of CO2e converted into monetary impact).\n\n## 5.1.2  Internal organization and management\n\n## 5.1.2.1  Internal organization and managing the network\n\nIn addition to the organization and governance of Sustainability (see section 1.5), the management of the Group's environmental objectives and their operational application draws on multidisciplinary committees,  bringing  together  other  key functions at Kering and its Houses to ensure the implementation of its action plans and initiatives.\n\nIn  2023,  Kering  pressed  ahead  with  its  Idea  Labs:  working groups  bringing  together  experts  and  operational  employees from  the  Houses  with  a  view  to  implementing  practical solutions  to  improve  the  Group's  impact  and  support  its transformation. The themes covered in 2023 include:\n\n- \u00b7 the Kering Standards: standards and guidance for sustainable production;\n- \u00b7 standards for stores and offices;\n- \u00b7 Clean by Design and energy-savings and purchasing of green energy in the supply chain;\n- \u00b7 evolution of regulations concerning ecodesign (ESPR) and the digital  passport  program  (DPP),  as  well  as  circularity  and environmental labelling;\n- \u00b7 repairability practices;\n- \u00b7 help  and  support  for  suppliers  with  adopting  sustainable practices;\n- \u00b7 the Group's commitment to deforestation;\n- \u00b7 materials innovation;\n- \u00b7 regenerative agriculture;\n- \u00b7 management of chemicals;\n- \u00b7 best practices in customer communications on sustainability;\n- \u00b7 issues specific to the jewelry industry and precious stones.\n\n## 5.1.2.2  Reporting scope, tools and methodology\n\nProduced  each  year  since  2003,  the  Group's  environmental reporting  draws  on  around  100  indicators  representing  the various Houses' environmental concerns.\n\nThe scope covers all Group entities under operational control, more specifically entities that are integrated and consolidated into  Kering's  financial  statements.  The  rules  governing  the inclusion and exclusion of entities are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 new entities (or business units) are included in the reporting scope two years after their integration;\n- \u00b7 entities  sold  during  the  year  are  included  in  the  reporting scope until the date they are sold.\n\nKering  Beaut\u00e9  (including  Creed)  and  Maui  Jim  (business  unit  of Kering Eyewear) are not included in the reporting scope for 2023.",

It  is available  in  the  Sustainability/Measuring  our  impact/Reporting and indicators section of the Group's website.\n\n## 5.2 Acting against climate change\n\nKering  follows  the  recommendations  of  the  Task  Force  on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Within this framework,  Kering  has  identified  among  its  environmental impacts a significant contribution to climate change. The Group's 2023  EP&L  results  show  that  37%  of  Kering's  monetized environmental  impacts  related  to  the  products'  life  cycle  and their commercialization concern greenhouse gas emissions. This is  in  addition  to  climate-related  impacts  resulting  from  the Group's cross-business operations that are not directly related to its products - such as capital goods and employee commuting which  also  emit  greenhouse  gases  and  account  for  14%  of  the Group's total monetized impact.\n\nThe  Group  has  therefore  made  climate  action  a  key  part  of  its Sustainability Strategy by means of a dedicated Climate Strategy, which  includes  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation measures and aims to transform Kering's and the industry. This strategy can be found on the Group's website.\n\n(3)\n\n## 5.1.2.3  Certification procedures\n\nThe number of Group sites for which certification attesting to the implementation of an environmental management system (such as ISO 14001) is relevant remains limited due to the nature of the Group's  activities.  These  certifications  are  sought  primarily  for the sites that have a more significant environmental impact, such as  large  logistics  centers  and  tanneries.  In  2023,  all  tanneries owned by the Group were ISO 14001 certified and 86% had LWG (Leather Working Group) certification (3) .\n\nAll  Gucci's  Italian  stores  and  outlets  have  both  SA8000  and ISO  45001  certification,  and  its  production  sites  and  offices  are also  ISO  14001  and  ISO  45001-certified.  In  2019,  Gucci  also obtained  ISO  20121  Sustainable  Events  (fashion  shows  and advertisements)  certification  for  its  Guccio  Gucci  business  (see section 6.1.2).\n\nAll the Group's climate action measures are part of a continuous improvement process, with the aim of stepping up its ambitions and aligning with best practices and scientific developments. In 2023,  the  Group  worked  on  improving  measurement  of  its greenhouse  gas  emissions  (GHG,  see  section  5.2.4).  It  also introduced a new absolute target in 2023 for reducing its GHG by 40% between 2021 and 2035. This target is accompanied by an enhanced decarbonization roadmap, with a specific adaptation for each House.\n\nKering's commitment is being recognized externally. The Group received a CDP Climate 2023 rating of A and is still included in the Climate A-List. The Group's response is publicly available on the www.cdp.net website.",

Specific ad hoc databases recognized by the scientific community have also been used for some risks (World Bank for carbon prices, WRI Water Risk Atlas, etc.). These scenarios also take account of the recommendations of ISO 14090/91 and the TCFD.\n\nThree  time  horizons  were  considered:  2030  (short-term),  2040 (medium-term) and 2050 (long-term). Also drawing on the results of  Kering's  EP&L,  the  whole  value  chain  was  included  in  this analysis framework.\n\nDrawing on these assumptions, the scenarios devised are based on  socioeconomic  narratives  (SSP  -  Shared  Socioeconomic Pathways)  coupled  with  technical  climate  characteristics  (RCP scenarios) and transition scenarios (NGFS scenarios).\n\nThese scenarios have helped with the identification, description and assessment of the Group's climate risks and opportunities.\n\n## 5.2.2.2  Identification of climate risks and opportunities\n\nDrawing on these two scenarios, Kering has mapped the Group's climate risks and opportunities, identifying 27 main physical and transition  risks  relating  to  climate  change  with  potential consequences for its operations and upstream and downstream value chain, including in particular: the impact of climate change on the availability and cost of raw materials (leather, plant and\n\nanimal  fibers);  disruptions  to  the  supply  chain  or  downstream transportation  chain  due  to  extreme  meteorological  events; higher  operating  and  capital  expenditures  relating  to  energy efficiency and  the  impact  of  carbon  pricing.  The  seven opportunities identified include promoting regenerative agricultural  practices  in  Kering's  supply  chain,  development  of strategic  relationships  with  suppliers  on  climate  issues  and increased  consumer  demand  for  climate-friendly  sustainable products.\n\nKering intends to manage climate-related risks and opportunities, anticipate their effects and ensure its resilience by adapting  its  business  model,  governance  and  decision-making processes,  and  its  supply  chain.  The  assessment,  review  and management of climate risk is an integral part of the Group's risk management (see section 1.3.3 and chapter 5 of this document).\n\n## 5.2.2.3  Impact assessment\n\nThis risk mapping has resulted in different ways of assessing the impact of risks and opportunities, which feed into the review of policies  and  strategic  directions.  As  part  of  a  process  of continuous  improvement,  areas  for  action  to  enhance  the Group's  climate  risk  management  have  been  identified  in response to this assessment, as well as the prioritizing of action plans.\n\nAs an illustration, the four risks and the opportunity detailed in the table below have been identified as material for the Group, and  Kering  has  conducted  an  assessment  of  their  financial impact.  The  analyses  performed  at  this  stage  have  not demonstrated  any  material  impact  on  the  Group  financial statements.",

It has drawn up an ambitious Climate Strategy based on three complementary short-, medium- and long-term objectives:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) See section 5.2.4 for a description of the Scope 3 categories taken into account in this objective.\n- (2) All Scope 3 categories are taken into account in this objective. Details of the categories are provided in section 5.2.4.\n\n## 5.2.3.1.2 Transition plan and decarbonization strategy\n\nTo achieve these objectives, the Group has made a commitment not  only  with  regard  to  its  own  operations  but  across  its  entire value  chain.  A  decarbonization  roadmap  has  been  drawn  up  at Group level, and adapted to each of the Houses to fit its activity and  the  main  emission  sources  identified.  It  is  based  on  major investment  projects  and  initiatives  covering  all  the  Group's activities and main logistics sites, tanneries and stores, as well as its entire  value  chain.  The  Group  has  initiated  measures concerning  each  of  its  main  sources  of  emissions  centered around three pillars: fair production, scaling up of pilot projects and  best  practices  (sourcing,  circularity,  innovation),  and development of new business models.\n\n## Group operations (Scopes 1 and 2)\n\n- \u00b7 energy-saving measures: Given the energy issues that arose in  winter  2022/23  and  the  French  government's  appeal  to reduce  consumption  by  10%  in  France,  the  Group  has strengthened  its  energy  efficiency  strategy  with  an  energysaving plan implemented by all Houses and headquarters;\n- \u00b7 optimizing sites' energy efficiency:\n- -the Kering Standard for Stores defines expected performance  levels  on  the  basis  of  11  priority  themes, including  energy  management,  lighting  and  renewable energy,  in  particular  using  LED  technology  for  lighting, allowing  for  energy  savings  of  up  to  90%  and  reaching almost 100% implementation in store selling areas,\n\n- -environmental  certification  of  sites  renovated  by  Kering: LEED  (Gold  or  Platinum  level),  HQE  or  BREEAM,  which include  criteria  concerning  optimum  energy  efficiency,  as well  as  WELL  certification  (based  on  user  wellbeing  in buildings, including thermal comfort),\n- -centralized  management  of  sites'  energy  performance, allowing  for  performance  improvements  by  streamlining the  energy  procurement  process  through  pooling  and consolidating energy consumption, as well as increased use of renewable electricity. The project - which covers Europe, the United States and Asia - has resulted in tangible energy savings and lower costs for the Houses and the Group;\n\n## \u00b7 energy supply strategy:\n\n- -on-site renewable energy generation with the installation of solar systems on roofs and car parks,\n- -buying  renewable  electricity:  Kering  favors  signing  power purchase  agreements  for  locally  produced  renewable electricity in cases where the site pays its bills directly and where  the  local  electricity  market  allows.  For  locations where this  practice  is  not  possible,  Kering  opts  for  buying renewable electricity certificates from solar or wind power systems,  selecting  only  new  or  recent  installations  (less than 10 years old) in order to speed up the energy transition in the countries in which it operates. Since 2022, Kering has achieved  the  target  of  100%  renewable  electricity  in accordance with RE100 guidelines,",

        "page_content": "- -signature of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA): Kering has joined 12 brands, coordinated by the Fashion Pact, in their efforts  to  sign  a  transnational  Corporate  Virtual  Power Purchase  Agreement  (CVPPA).  Under  the  agreement, representing a total of 160 GWh per year (including 43 GWh per  year  for  Kering),  a  new  solar  farm  is  to  be  built  in southern Spain. The agreement guarantees the developer of the solar farm with a stable sales value for energy generated over  the  first  10  years  in  operation,  allowing  it  to  secure financing for the project. Construction work began in 2023 and the farm will generate power as of 2025. The project will allow for 65,000 tons of CO2e to be avoided each year. The CVPPA  will  cover  around  one  third  of  the  Group's  direct total  electricity  consumption  in  Europe,  also  reducing  the energy cost and price fluctuations.\n\n## Across the entire supply chain (Scope 3)\n\nThe Group has launched initiatives to reduce its main emissions sources,  in  particular  those  relating  to  purchased  goods  and services and goods transportation:\n\n- \u00b7 product  eco-design  and  sustainable  sourcing  strategy: implementation of the Kering Standards for all raw materials and shift of production processes towards options with less environmental  impacts,  in  particular  in  terms  of  carbon impact;\n- \u00b7 fair  production: capitalize  on  planification  and  product offering to adjust production volumes as closely as possible to sales;\n- \u00b7 developing  the  use  of  renewable  energy  and  energy efficiency  programs  with  suppliers ,  in  particular  with  the Clean  by  Design  program,  which  aims  to  reduce  textile manufacturers'  environmental  impact  by  organizing  audits reviewing  10  of  the  production  plant's  key  performance indicators (water, energy, waste) (see section 4.1.2);\n- \u00b7 transportation :  work  with  logistics  platforms,  the  Houses and the Group's transportation companies to optimize goods transportation  at  the  various  stages  of  the  supply  chain through to stores, in particular:\n- -streamlining  itineraries,  optimizing  fill  rates,  functional design, reverse logistics,\n- -developing alternative means of transport, particularly for the last mile,\n- -improving  fleet  performance:  Preference  is  given  to  the most efficient vehicles and aircraft, with very ambitious CO2 emissions standards (maximum of 600 g of CO2 per metric ton-km for air freight, EURO 6 standard for road freight).\n\n## 5.2.3.2 Climate risk adaptation\n\nDue to the impacts of climate change, Kering faces physical and transition risks as described in section 5.2.2, whose financial and operational impacts depend on the climate scenario considered for  the  Group  (\"Paris  Agreement\"  scenario  or  \"No  mitigation\" scenario  as  described  in  section  5.2.2).  In  particular,  in  the accelerated  transition  scenario,  Kering  would  be  more  severely affected  by  the  risks  relating  to  transition,  and  in  the  no mitigation  scenario,  it  would  be  more  severely  affected  by  the physical risks.\n\nThe transition risks to which Kering is exposed - in particular the risk  relating  to  carbon  pricing  described  in  section  5.2.2  -  are covered  by  the  mitigation  measures  described  in  section  5.2.2. Adaptation to climate-related risks focuses in this section more specifically adaptation to physical risks.\n\n(4)\n\nKering's adaptation plans vary according to the type of risk and their  probability  of  occurrence  for  Kering  and  its  value  chain, such  as  the  water  use  reduction  policy  in  its  operations  and sites' exposure to extreme meteorological events. In terms of its upstream  supply  chain,  Kering  is  working  in  particular  on  the following  areas  to  secure  its  sourcing  over  the  long-term  and support nature-based solutions, in particular the development of regenerative agriculture:\n\n- \u00b7 sourcing : implementation  of  the  Kering  Standards  by suppliers with a target of 100% raw materials in line with the Kering Standards in 2025. These Standards list recommended third-party  certifications  in  the  Group's  supply  chain  that guarantee low-impact and more resilient agricultural practices, such as organic agriculture;\n- \u00b7 direct support for sourcing programs for certain key raw materials : for example, Kering has partnered with the Savory Institute  to  promote  sourcing  of  raw  materials  from  the regenerative herding system, in particular for bovine leather;\n- \u00b7 Kering Regenerative Fund for Nature : the aim of this fund is to  support  the  transition  to  regenerative  agriculture  among producers of key raw materials for the Group in order to reach the target of one million hectares in 2025. Seven projects are currently  supported  in  leather,  cotton,  wool  and  cashmere (see section 5.3.2).\n\nThese regenerative agriculture projects support climate resilience.  The  practices  adopted  -  minimizing  tillage,  crop rotation,  maintaining  plant  cover  -  improve  soil  health  and  its ability to capture carbon, retain water and support biodiversity. These factors together help make the ecosystem more resilient to climate  change  impacts,  such  as  extreme  weather  events  and temperature  fluctuations,  thereby  protecting  the  environment and ensuring sustainable production for future generations.\n\n## 5.2.3.3 Positive contribution to climate change mitigation\n\nIn  addition  to  measures  of  rcarbon  emissions  reduction,  Kering has  voluntarily  invested  since  2012  in  nature-based  carbon offsetting  projects.  These  projects  help  to  mitigate  climate change beyond the Group's value chain and preserve and restore sensitive ecosystems (forests, wetlands and coastal areas), which are essential carbon sinks. They generate carbon credits for the Group,  which  are  used  to  offset  direct  and  indirect  emissions from the Group and its supply chain. Since 2019, the volume of carbon credits bought by Kering has corresponded to all Scope 1, 2  and  3  emissions,  excluding  product  use  and  end-of-life categories (4) .\n\nCredits come from carbon removal projects and greenhouse gas emission  avoidance  projects.  These  include  programs  aimed  at reducing emissions from deforestation and ecosystem degradation,  which  are  certified  and  verified  according  to international  standards  such  as  the  Verified  Carbon  Standard (VCS) or Gold Standard.",

This fund allows for new high-quality nature-based solutions  projects  to  be  launched  that  generate  carbon credits for Kering and other co-investors: around two thirds in removal projects and one third in avoidance projects. It aims to  contribute  10  million  metric  tons  of  CO2  equivalent  over 15  years  for  Kering  and  deliver  additional  benefits  for communities,  with  a  particular  emphasis  on  promoting women's  rights  and  empowerment.  In  2023,  this  fund gathered \u20ac195.5 million of investments.\n\n## 5.2.3.4 Contribution to industry transformation\n\n## 5.2.4 Measuring and results of the Group's carbon footprint\n\n## 5.2.4.1 The Group's total emissions and improvement relative to reduction targets\n\nKering's  greenhouse  gas  emissions  as  stated  in  the  NFIS  are calculated  according  to  the  GHG  Protocol  accounting  standard (5) . All results are presented in terms of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) and according  to  the  market-based  methodology (6) unless  stated otherwise.  The  methodological  note  on  environmental  reporting details the main rules for calculating the Group's carbon footprint.\n\nThe  Group's  carbon  footprint  in  2023  totaled  2,596,739  tons  of CO2e (Scopes 1, 2 and 3 according to the GHG Protocol), including 22,841 tons from energy use (Scopes 1 and 2) and 2,573,898 tons from upstream and downstream activities (Scope 3). Operations under Kering's direct control (Scopes 1 and 2) therefore account for around 1% of the Group's total carbon footprint.\n\n## Breakdown of the Group's greenhouse gas emissions by Scope\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Total Group greenhouse gas emissions (in tCO 2 e)\n\n|                        | 2023      | 2022      | 2021      | Change 2023/2022   | Percentage of total  2023   |\n|------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Scope 1                | 14,918    | 21,660    | 19,281    | -31%               | 0.6%                        |\n| Scope 2 - market-based | 7,923     | 7,598     | 11,227    | +4%                | 0.3%                        |\n| Scope 3                | 2,573,898 | 2,935,728 | 2,492,861 | -12%               | 99%                         |\n| TOTAL  (tCO 2 e)       | 2,596,739 | 2,964,986 | 2,523,369 | -12%               |                             |\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) are also captured in the EP&L and then monetized (see section 5.1.1.3).\n\nAs  part  of  its  continuous  improvement  approach,  the  Group worked in 2023 on improving measurement of its greenhouse gas emissions,  primarily  within  the  context  of  defining  a  new pathway  for  reducing  in  emissions  in  order  to  strengthen  its climate ambitions.\n\nIn 2023, the Group's carbon footprint was adjusted for 2021, 2022 and 2023 to specify the calculation of certain Scope 3 categories and add categories that had not previously been quantified. All these adjustments are shown in the table below. For more details about changes in methodology, refer to the methodological note on environmental reporting.",

Emissions  from  fuel  consumption  by company cars are considerably lower than in 2022, mainly as a result of the updated calculation methodology, which allowed for better measurement  of the Group's vehicles emissions, particularly  for  electric  and  hybrid  vehicles.  The  Group  applies environmental  criteria  when  selecting  company  cars  and  is gradually increasing the number of electric vehicles in its fleet. As part  of  this  effort,  Pomellato,  Dodo,  Kering  Eyewear,  Saint Laurent  and  Kering  Corporate  are  including  hybrid  and  electric vehicles  in  their  fleets.  At  the  end  of  2023,  these  vehicles accounted for 67% of the vehicle fleet at Gucci, 63% at Bottega Veneta and 44% at Balenciaga.\n\nScope 2 emissions remained stable in 2023 relative to 2022. The Group  had  already  achieved  significant  reductions  in  these emissions  in  2022  by  sourcing  renewable  electricity  in  all countries  where  this  was  possible.

Electricity  is  still  the  Group's  main  energy  source, accounting  for  84%  of  consumption,  and  95%  of  electricity  is from renewable sources.\n\nTotal  annual  energy  consumption  remained  stable  in  2023. Electricity consumption increased by 4% as a result of the large number of site openings in 2023, increasing the floor space of the Group's  sites  by  5%.  Energy  efficiency  efforts  also  led  to  a reduction in natural gas consumption, particularly at the Group's industrial sites and warehouses.\n\n## Energy intensity in MWh/m 2 excluding industrial sites\n\n|                                                           |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 | Change  2023 vs.  2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------------------------|\n| Energy intensity  excluding industrial  sites  (MWh/m 2 ) |  0.155 |  0.157 |  0.161 | -1%                      |\n\nThe  Group  has  adopted  an  energy-saving  strategy  aimed  at reducing worldwide energy demand (from October 2022 to March 2023 relative to winter 2021-2022) by reducing the use of lighting, heating and air conditioning when they are not being used.\n\nThanks  to  energy  efficiency  measures,  steady  improvement  in energy  consumption  has  been  observed  since  2015  across  all Group  sites.  Energy  intensity  has  decreased  by  26%  for  offices, 48% for industrial sites, 37% for stores and 31% for warehouses.\n\nIn addition, more than 300 LEED certifications were obtained by Kering and its Houses for their sites and stores in 2023. At the end of  2023,  this  included  147  Gucci  stores  and  four  offices, 32  Alexander  McQueen stores,  45  Saint  Laurent  stores  and  four offices, and 90 Balenciaga stores.\n\nKering  purchases  Energy  Attribute  Certificates  (EACs).  In  2023, renewable electricity accounted for 95% of the Group's electricity consumption  (100%  in  all  countries  where  this  was  possible). Kering  either  generated  its  own  electricity,  used  renewable electricity from local suppliers or purchased EACs corresponding to its consumption in accordance with the RE100 guidelines. The remaining 5% corresponds to consumption in markets where it was not possible to purchase renewable electricity. South Korea accounts for 79% of consumption in these countries. As a result, Kering has achieved the RE100 target of using 100% renewable energy in accordance with RE100 guidelines, this objective being already reached in 2022 and maintained in 2023.\n\nIn terms of on-site energy production, at the end of 2023, Kering had  solar  power  systems  on  the  roofs  and  car  parks  of  around 20  sites,  as  well  as  a  site  using  biomass  (wood).  Self-generated solar power accounts for 4% of total energy consumption. Heat production is the only area in which Kering still uses fossil fuels. This accounted for 15% of total energy consumption in 2023, less than in 2022 in line with the Group's efforts. Boilers are gradually being  replaced  with  electric  heat  pumps  powered  by  electricity from renewable sources.\n\nFeasibility  studies  on  the  electrification  of  installations  using natural gas have been conducted for some sites (3 in 2023). The operation turned out to be feasible and will be implemented in the next two years for ironing installations in a textile production plant.",

They account for 67% of Scope 3 emissions, or 1,729,426 tCO2e.\n\nThese emissions decreased by 15% relative to 2022, in line with the  reduction  in  the  Group's  activity  in  2023,  resulting  in  lower volumes of products purchased and expenditure with suppliers.\n\nIn 2023, suppliers that entered the Clean by Design program in late 2020 completed implementation of the first measures. The main areas concerned:\n\n- \u00b7 automated water dosage in washing operations, allowing for a saving of up to 54% in water and 20% in natural gas at three facilities;\n- \u00b7 the  introduction  of  humidity  controls  in  drying  processes, allowing for a saving of up to 20% in gas, at two facilities;\n- \u00b7 general  improvements  in  the  automation  and  control  of processes.\n\nIn addition, several suppliers have installed solar systems on their roofs.\n\n## 5.2.4.3.2 Emissions relating to capital goods (Category 2)\n\nEmissions  relating  to  capital  goods  cover  all  of  Kering's expenditure  in  relation  to  sites  construction  and  renovation works, as well as purchases of furniture, vehicles and machinery. These  emissions  make  up  13%  of  Scope  3  emissions,  or 325,329 tCO2e.\n\nThere was a slight increase in 2023 relative to 2022 due to specific spending on new machinery at some of the Group's sites.\n\nIn  2023,  the  Group  initiated  a  review  of  its  standards  for  the development and construction of stores and buildings, with the main  aim  of  achieving  full  alignment  with  the  EU  Taxonomy. Furthermore,  the  number  of  LEED  and  BREEAM  sites  increased further, with  some  projects  achieving  LEED  Platinum,  in particular the new Kering offices in Milan and Scandicci and one in  Paris,  a  first  for  an  historic  building.  Boucheron's  historic building on Place Vend\u00f4me  in  Paris obtained BREEAM certification in 2023 with a rating of Very Good.",

These  offset  emissions  therefore  do  not  include  the new  Scope  3  categories  or  the  methodological  adjustments calculated in 2023, as detailed in section 3.2.\n\nEmissions relating to the use of sold products and their end-oflife  treatment  account  together  for  9%  of  the  Group's  Scope  3 emissions, amounting to 237,457 and 4,626 tCO2e respectively.\n\n## 5.3 Preserving biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nThe  Group's  2023  EP&L  results  show  that  34%  of  Kering's monetized environmental impacts associated with the life cycle of its products and their sale relate to biodiversity and land use, and  that  they  mostly  happen  in  Tier  4  (production  of  raw materials) of its supply chains.\n\n## 5.3.1  Biodiversity strategy: preserving natural capital across the entire supply chain (up to Tier 4)\n\nThe Group's Houses  primarily use natural materials to manufacture  their  products.  These  raw  materials  come  from farms, rangelands, forests and mines. Protecting ecosystems and ensuring they work properly are essential for Kering.\n\n## 5.3.1.1 Biodiversity Strategy\n\nIn  2023,  Kering  published  the  second  edition  of  its  Biodiversity Strategy, which aims to stem biodiversity loss, restore ecosystems and protect the species composing them, as well as drive  systemic  change  through  the  entire  supply  chain.  This version adds to and explains the policy to combat deforestation and the conversion of ecosystems.\n\nKering  has  structured  its  activities  around  four  phases:  avoid, reduce,  restore/regenerate  and  transform.  This  conservation hierarchy  is  applied  as  recommended  by  the  Science  Based Targets  Network  (SBTN)  to  create  a  nature-positive  trajectory and develop scientific methods for ensuring that human activities respect planetary boundaries.\n\nKering is also one of the Taskforce for Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Early Adopters, undertaking to publish reports aligned with the TNFD reference framework.\n\n## Focus: Kering selected to pilot Science-Based Targets for Nature, an SBTN initiative\n\nIt was announced in 2023 that Kering is one of 17 companies in the world selected by SBTN to pilot the first version of the SBTN guidance  for  freshwater  and  land.

To  achieve  this,  Kering  has  partnered  with environmental NGO Conservation International to create the Regenerative  Fund  for  Nature.  The  Fund  supports  projects that  transform  farming  and  rearing  practices  in  areas  that supply raw materials to the fashion industry;\n- \u00b7 Kering  will  protect  one  million  hectares  of  critical  and irreplaceable  habitats  outside  of  its  supply  chain,  primarily through  programs  that  deliver  a  positive  impact  for biodiversity  protection,  carbon  sequestration  and  improved livelihoods for local communities.\n\nThese  two  million  hectares  represent  more  than  six  times  the global  footprint  of  Kering's  direct  and  indirect  (supply  chain) operations, calculated by the EP&L as 350,000 hectares in 2020. Kering has therefore included a significant security margin in its efforts to have a net positive impact on biodiversity.\n\nThe Group is also aligned with target 19 regarding increasing the level of financial resources  for nature  conservation  and restoration via the Climate Fund for Nature.\n\n## 5.3.2  Responsible land use and protection of biodiversity\n\n## 5.3.2.1  Measurement of ecosystem services and biodiversity and focus on key geographic regions\n\nThe \"land use\" part of the EP&L assesses how raw materials used by  the  Group  affect  ecosystem  services  and  biodiversity.  The methodology used to value natural capital for this indicator takes account  of  the  following  three  factors  as  a  proxy  for  the ecosystem  services  provided:  species  richness,  above-ground biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC).\n\nIn  2023, as part of the SBTN pilot, Kering assessed its pressures on  nature,  the  state  of  nature  associated  with  these  pressures and the state of biodiversity, in alignment with Version 1 of the Science  Based  Targets  for  Nature  guidance.  This  exercise  was performed at hydrobasin level for the Group's direct operations (offices,  stores,  production  plants,  warehouses  and  tanneries) and  at  country  level  for  impacts  associated  with  the  upstream value chain, according to the stages shown below.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Avoid\n\nAs a priority, the Houses avoid any known negative impact on the environment.  This  includes  avoiding  the  loss  of  natural ecosystems  through  a  zero  deforestation  and  conversion commitment,  which  applies  to  all  natural  materials  used,  as specified in the Biodiversity Strategy and the Kering Standards.\n\n## 2. Reduce\n\nWhen impacts cannot be entirely avoided, Kering and its Houses strive to reduce negative impacts on the environment by sourcing materials  from  preferred  sources  as  defined  in  the  Kering Standards.  These  standards  list  recommended  third-party certifications  in  the  Group's  supply  chains  that  guarantee  lowimpact  agricultural  practices,  such  as  organic  farming.  In  2023, 75%  of  raw  materials  were  aligned  with  the  Kering  Standards. The goal is to reach 100% by 2025.\n\n## 3. Restore & Regenerate\n\nIn  addition to avoiding negative impacts, Kering aims to bring about  a  paradigm  shift  by  restoring  and  regenerating ecosystems, which are both impacted by the production of key raw  materials  for  the  Group  and  critical  areas  for  biodiversity and ecosystem services. Kering's goal is to convert one million hectares of farms and rangelands in landscapes where key raw materials are produced to regenerative agricultural practices by\n\n2025, primarily by means of the Regenerative Fund for Nature. The  first  seven  projects  were  selected  in  2021  across  various critical sourcing landscapes:\n\n- \u00b7 cotton (India);\n- \u00b7 leather (Argentina, France and Spain);\n- \u00b7 wool (Argentina and South Africa); and\n- \u00b7 cashmere (Mongolia).\n\nEach of these projects has a monitoring framework to assess the impact  on  soil  health  (including  improved  soil  organic  carbon sequestration),  biodiversity,  the  elimination  of  synthetic  input usages,  improved  livelihoods  for  local  communities  and  animal welfare.  The  measurement  methods  and  indicators  used  proposed  by  the  project  owners  with  technical  and  scientific support from Conservation International - vary according to the geographic  region  so  that  they  can  be  adjusted  to  the  local context.  At  an  aggregated,  portfolio  level,  Kering  measures  the number of hectares over which regenerative practices are being implemented  thanks  to  the  Fund's  support  -  with  a  target  of 1  million  hectares  by  2025  -  and  the  number  of  beneficiaries. These  projects  represent  a  total  of  840,000  hectares  that  will eventually be converted into regenerative agricultural spaces and involve 60,000 people across the globe. The fund was extended in 2023 with the arrival  of  Inditex  as  co-investor  alongside  Kering, while a new call for projects was launched.",

This practice has proven to be a highly effective non-lethal alternative to conventional strategies against pumas, thereby helping to protect puma populations while also safeguarding livestock and wool production.\n\nThe project also  includes  the  creation  of  traceable  supply  chains  for  fibers  and  promoting  regenerative  and  certified  wildlifefriendly practices for wool production.\n\nFor  each  participating  site,  WCS  and  WFEN  perform  periodical  analysis  of  carbon  sequestration  in  soil,  soil  productivity  and biodiversity inventories. The project has grown from 87,000 hectares under regeneration in 2021 to over 320,000 hectares in 2023. In late 2023, WCS detected a rare species, the Patagonian opossum, at one of its sites.\n\nThe  Houses  also  work  on  projects  to  develop  regenerative farming practices and improve soil quality. Gucci has launched its Regenerative Agricultural Program in collaboration with Chargeur Luxury Fibers. The program covers 100,000 hectares in Uruguay and includes around 10 farms with the goal of improving soil quality in the region.\n\nSince 2022, Saint Laurent has supported a project in South Africa alongside Kering to support supply chain partners in their efforts to adopt regenerative farming and responsible rearing practices for wool  and  leather.  The  program  aims  to  support  the regeneration  of  215,000  hectares  by  2025.  At  the  end  of  2023, more than 35,000 hectares had been restored.\n\nIn 2023,  Balenciaga  helped  to  pilot  eDNA  technology,  an innovative  way  of  monitoring  biodiversity.  The  technology consists of taking samples of soil, water or insects from a site and then analyzing them to find traces of DNA. The data provided by eDNA help give farmers a more accurate picture of the diversity of species present in the ecosystem at a given time and assess how this evolves over time. The technology will be used in 2024 as part of  a  project  spearheaded  by  Epiterre,  part  of  the  Regenerative Fund for Nature.\n\n## 4. Transform\n\nIn support of the net positive impact goal, Kering supports initiatives outside the Group's direct supply chains.\n\n## 1)  External collaborations to transform the industry and raise awareness of biodiversity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2)  Positive contribution for climate and biodiversity beyond Kering's supply chains\n\nOutside  of  its  supply  chain,  Kering  will  protect  one  million hectares of critical and irreplaceable habitats through programs that  deliver  benefits  for  biodiversity  protection,  avoidance  of greenhouse  gas  emissions  arising  from  deforestation  and  from ecosystem  degradation,  increased  carbon  sequestration  and improved livelihoods for local communities.\n\n(8)\n\nKering  uses  nature-based  solutions  to  contribute  to  climate change mitigation in relation to its carbon footprint (Scope 1, 2 and  3  emissions  excluding  product  use  and  end-of-life) (8) .  The Climate Fund for Nature (see section 5.2.3.3), created in 2022, has enabled it to support projects covering 127,000 hectares to date.\n\nThe Houses are also taking action within their supply chains (see section 5.4), as well as through  conservation  initiatives undertaken in their own name (see section 6.3.2).",

The  Group  is  committed  to  develop  a  strategy  and defining targets to preserve water resources.\n\nIn  2023,  this  entailed  analyzing  the  water-related  risks  to  which the  Group's  operations  may  be  exposed,  depending  on  the region.  This  analysis  was  done  using  the  World  Resource Institute's Aqueduct tool, looking at four main indicators: risk of drought,  flooding  (differentiating  between  river  and  coastal flooding), water stress (corresponding to the ratio of total annual water  withdrawals  to  total  available  annual  renewable  water supply) and the physical risks (water pollution). These risks were analyzed  for  facilities  with  the  highest  water  consumption, representing 80% of Kering's total water consumption. A total of 110 sites were analyzed, including all tanneries and all industrial sites.\n\nAs  part  of  its  pilot  of  the  Science  Based  Targets  for  Nature guidance, Kering has extended its analysis of pressures on nature in terms of water use and pollution to its upstream value chain, using  estimated  impact  data  from  the  EP&L  and  data  on  the availability  of  water  and  water  pollution  from  the  SBTN  Unified State of Nature Water Layers tool.\n\nKering has also established a formal requirement relating to the provision of WASH services at all of its sites and for all suppliers, and set the goal of maintaining 100% compliance for the next few decades and beyond.\n\nKering's  water  management  strategy  is  detailed  in  the  Group's public  response  to  the  2023  CDP  Water  Security  Questionnaire, which  can  be  accessed  on  the  www.cdp.net  website.  Kering achieved an A rating in 2023.\n\n## 5.3.3.2  Water consumption\n\n## Kering's water consumption within its own operations\n\nOperations and sites under Kering's direct control (Tier 0 of the EP&L  scope)  account  for  2%  of  the  Group's  total  direct  and indirect water consumption (Tier 0 to Tier 4). Given the nature of Kering's operations, the direct environmental impact of its water consumption is not significant in terms of the total volume.\n\n## Water consumption (in m\u00b3)\n\n|                                  | 2023    | 2022      | 2021    | Change 2023  vs. 2022   |\n|----------------------------------|---------|-----------|---------|-------------------------|\n| Water from the public network    | 751,543 | 806,637   | 682,980 | -7%                     |\n| of wich water for domestic use   | 657,442 | 703,102   | 618,083 | -6%                     |\n| of wich water for industrial use | 94,101  | 103,535   | 64,897  | -9%                     |\n| Groundwater                      | 211,014 | 226,564   | 270,113 | -7%                     |\n| Rainwater                        | 0       | 0         | 0       | N/A                     |\n| Surface water                    | 0       | 0         | 0       | N/A                     |\n| TOTAL                            | 962,557 | 1,033,201 | 953,093 | -7%                     |\n\nTotal  water  consumption decreased by 7% between 2022 and 2023, mainly in relation to the reduction in activity:\n\n- \u00b7 68% of water consumed is used for domestic purposes (store cleaning, sanitary facilities, etc.);\n- \u00b7 32% is used for industrial purposes, of which 22% comes from groundwater levels. Water consumed for industrial purposes relates primarily to tanneries.\n\nWater  consumption  intensity  (m\u00b3  of  water  used  for  industrial purposes/Group  revenue)  decreased  by  4%  between  2022  and 2023.\n\nWater withdrawals for the Group's tanning activities were highest in  comparison with other sites, representing 29% of total water consumption and less than 0.3% of the number of sites in 2023. These sites are also most at risk in terms of water stress.\n\nThe Group has set the target of reducing water consumption at its directly owned tanneries by 35% between 2022 and 2035. The main  levers  identified  of  achieving  this  relate  to  more  efficient use  of  water,  focusing  on  industrial  processes  and  their  needs, and setting up on-site recycling systems to reduce the quantity of freshwater needed.\n\nKering and its Houses are also implementing measures to reduce domestic water consumption, particularly at stores, headquarters and offices.  In  the  Kering  Standards  dedicated  to stores,  the  Group  has  established  precise  technical  criteria  in order to limit stores' domestic water consumption. For example, the standards prohibit the use of drinking water as a heat sink in air  conditioning  systems,  encourage  the  use  of  non-drinking water  (e.g., recovered  rainwater)  for  certain  maintenance purposes, and require the installation of plumbing systems with low water consumption. For example:\n\n- \u00b7 Gucci, Saint Laurent, Pomellato and Kering have introduced water  fountains,  filters,  water-saving  devices  and  rainwater harvesting systems at logistics sites;\n- \u00b7 Kering Eyewear has set up a station at one of its factories for treating wastewater from its closed-loop production process, allowing  100%  of  treated  water  to  be  reinjected  into  the process.",

        "page_content": "## Initiatives for reducing consumption in Kering's supply chain\n\nKering  is  applying  its  EP&L  approach  to  conduct  an  innovative review of responsible water management across its entire value chain. Indirect water  consumption  linked  to  the  use  of agricultural  raw  materials  such  as  cotton  and  extraction  of precious metals is a major environmental issue.\n\nThe Kering Standards encourage suppliers to use water-efficient equipment, automate water flows, and increase liquor ratios in dyeing and finishing processes. They also encourage the use of waterless  dyes  and  efficient  dyeing  technologies,  such  as  cold pad  batch  dyeing.  Wet  processing  factories  (dyeing,  finishing, printing and tanning) are encouraged to install a reverse osmosis system at the end of the wastewater treatment process in order to close the water loop.\n\nThe  Clean  by  Design  program  (see  section  4.1.2)  includes measures  to  reduce  water  and  chemicals  use.  On  average, factories reduce their water use by 5 to 10%. In 2023, one supplier reduced its water consumption by around 150,000m 2 a month by improving  water  flow  controls.  As  a  result,  the  supplier's  water consumption decreased by 54%.\n\nThe  Houses  have  also  launched  initiatives  to  reduce  water consumption  in  their  supply  chains.  All  ready-to-wear  Houses favor  using  certified  organic  materials  and  recycled  fibers, allowing  them  to  reduce  water  consumption  in  their  supply chains.\n\n## 5.3.3.3  Water pollution\n\nManagement of chemicals used in the production of articles by the Houses is an integral part of the Kering Standards, which set out  guidelines  for  the  Group's  main  manufacturing  processes (tanning, textile processing and leather goods manufacturing). As production  sites  use  these  chemicals,  pollutants  are  found  in their  wastewater  discharges.  The  chemicals  used  and  the effluents  discharged  by  these  sites  must  therefore  be  managed properly in order to prevent and limit this pollution.\n\n## Management of chemicals within Kering's own operations\n\nWithin  Kering's  own  operations,  discharges  into  water  do  not represent  a  significant  impact,  except  for  its  tanning  activities. The total percentage of water discharged by Kering was stable in 2023 at 75%.\n\nBeyond complying with regulations, Kering has set the target of eliminating  all  hazardous  chemicals  from  all  Houses'  products and production processes. These requirements also apply to all suppliers,  which  have  to  implement  a  chemicals  management system. Furthermore, the Group is aiming to reduce the quantity of  pollutants discharged before treatment at all of its sites. The expected  impact  will  focus  initially  on  the  Chemical  Oxygen\n\nDemand (COD), which is the most relevant indicator of the quality of  effluents  after  treatment.  This  indicator  allows  to  assess  the overall amount of organic pollutants in wastewater. The Group's target is to identify and implement action plans to reduce COD by 2025.\n\nIn addition, special wastewater treatment measures are required for  tanneries,  which  use  large  amounts  of  water.  Each  tannery has its own on-site wastewater treatment plant. At all the Group's tanneries, wastewater is pre-treated on site before continuing the wastewater treatment process. The Group's Italian tanneries pretreat their wastewater containing chromium, which is then sent to  a  special  treatment  plant  used  by  several  other  tanneries, which purifies the water and recovers the chromium. The Group's other  tanneries  have  treatment  plants  that  use  sedimentation and physicochemical and biological treatment techniques.\n\nMore specifically, in 2023, the P\u00e9riers tannery in France launched an  ambitious  effluent  recycling  project  with  an  innovative decontamination system specially adapted to the specific needs of the industry. This project has allowed for an annual reduction in  water consumption of around 80%, thereby preserving water resources and reducing volumes discharged into the communal wastewater  treatment  plant,  resulting  in  a  positive  societal impact.\n\nTo ensure compliance with local wastewater legislation, regular analyses  are  carried  out  at  each  tannery  and  the  results  are continuously monitored. If any anomalies are recorded, dedicated  procedures  and  action  plans  are  put  in  place  and, where applicable, described in the ISO 14001 certified environmental management system.\n\n## Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) after treatment tanneries (in metric tons)\n\n|     |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 | Change 2023  vs. 2022   |\n|-----|--------|--------|--------|-------------------------|\n| COD |     42 |     34 |     57 | +24%                    |\n\nCOD increased significantly between 2022 and 2023. This is due to the use in 2023 of calcination, during which fur is removed from skins and the skins are prepared for chemical tanning products. There was no calcification in 2022.\n\n## Management of chemicals in the supply chain\n\nAs  part  of  its  commitment  to  eliminating  all  hazardous chemicals  from  the  production  of  all  Houses,  Kering  has compiled to lists of substances subject to restrictions:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Manufacturing  Restricted  Substance  List  (MRSL)  for production processes;\n- \u00b7 the Product Restricted Substance List (PRSL) for products.\n\n## Focus on: Kering's commitments and objectives concerning chemicals management in the supply chain\n\n- \u00b7 Contractual  requirements  for  100%  of  suppliers  include  the  implementation  of  a  chemicals  management  system  within businesses and rolling out these requirements among suppliers during the early stages.\n- \u00b7 By 2025:\n- -level 2 of the ZDHC Supplier to Zero program for 100% of strategic suppliers;\n- -100% of eligible suppliers evaluated in the Vendor Portal as regards chemicals management and compliance with the MRSL;\n- -testing of wastewater, in line with the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines, for all strategic suppliers.",

The  sessions  were organized  in  collaboration  with  other  signatories,  with  the support  of  a  ZDHC  training  provider  to  ensure  a  consistent approach.  Kering  continued  to  support  its  supply  chains through  the  distribution  of  ZDHC  vouchers  suitable  for  the program's  Level  1  certification,  and  by  providing  active support  with  preparing  ZDHC  Performance  InCheck  and ZDHC ClearStream reports.\n\n## Rollout of the MRSL in the supply chain\n\nThe  MRSL  is  focused  on  discontinuing  the  use  of  dangerous chemicals  in  the  manufacturing  process,  firstly  to  ensure  that workers within the Group's operations and in the supply chains of the  Houses  are  not  exposed  to  hazardous  substances,  and secondly to reduce toxic discharges into water.\n\nKering provides active support for its key suppliers in the leather (tanneries  and  suppliers  in  charge  of  production),  textiles  and finished product categories in ready-to-wear and accessories to encourage them to comply with the MRSL, offering implementation tools and training:\n\n## 1)  Contractual requirements\n\nThe  MRSL  requirements  signed  with  suppliers  have  been contractually binding since 2020. This means that no substance listed  in  Kering's  MRSL  can  be  intentionally  used  in  the manufacturing processes of the Houses' supply chains. In 2023, Kering  published  a  new  version  of  the  MRSL,  aligned  with  the ZDHC MRSL V3.1 and including a specific appendix on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).\n\n## 2)  Supplier evaluation\n\nKering assessed more than 1,100 suppliers in 2023, representing 85% of purchases, on their alignment with Kering's contractual requirements in relation to the MRSL. This was done by means of an annual self-assessment questionnaire (via the Vendor Portal, see section 4.1.2), detailed assessments, audits or certifications.\n\n90%  (in  terms  of  value)  of  eligible  suppliers  assessed  via  the Vendor Portal as regards chemicals management and compliance  with  the  MRSL  received  a  rating  of  \"good\"  or \"excellent\".  The  percentage  was  94%  for  the  Group's  strategic suppliers.  The  results  are  reviewed  biannually  with  the  Houses' operations departments. These committee meetings provide the opportunity to discuss supplier compliance and define measures\n\nto be taken for the suppliers concerned, such as help to improve their performance, implementation of remedial measures or even the  termination  of  business  relations  with  suppliers  that  fail  to comply.\n\nIn  addition,  on-site  audits  and  certifications  are  used  to  check whether  suppliers  meet  requirements  relating  to  chemicals management.\n\nIn  2022-2023, 274 suppliers were either audited or underwent a certification process (such as Kering on-site audits, the 4Sustainability  protocol,  the  ZDHC  Supplier  to  Zero  program Level  1  or  Level  2),  covering  58%  of  raw  materials  purchases (leather and fabrics) and 60% of purchases of finished products for Kering's ready-to-wear items and accessories.\n\nIn order  to  promote  ongoing  improvement  in  chemicals management,  Kering  intends  to  step  up  its  checks  of  MRSL compliance  by  also  performing  tests  on  wastewater  for  all strategic  suppliers  by  2025.  This  approach  is  recommended  by ZDHC  and  will  make  it  possible  to  identify  compliance  failings and  potential  contamination  by  analyzing  the  root  causes  and improving the quality and safety of effluents.\n\n## 3)  Ongoing training\n\nAn Idea Lab on the management of chemicals was held in 2023, aimed  at  providing  training  and  information  on  the  subject, focusing  on  ZDHC-related  initiatives,  as  well  as  making  joint decisions about Kering's action and strategy in this area.\n\n## 5.3.4  Air pollution\n\nThe  Group's  2023  EP&L  results  show  that  8%  of  Kering's monetized  environmental  impacts  related  to  the  products'  life cycle and their commercialization concern air pollution, and that they mostly happen in Tier 4 (production of raw materials) of its supply chains.\n\nSolvents used in tanneries contain Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)  that  are  released  into  the  atmosphere  in  gaseous  form. There  are  specific  guidelines  for  managing  VOCs  and  emissions are  calculated  and  monitored  closely  by  each  of  the  Group's tanneries.\n\nTanning processes can also give rise to odor pollution because of hydrogen  sulfide  emissions,  especially  at  the  stripping  stage. Unpleasant odors are managed by an air evacuation system at the  stripping  tubs,  which  channels  polluted  air  through  a  filter that traps sulfur-bearing particles and outputs clean air.\n\n## Volatile Organic Compound (VOC)\n\n## emissions in - Group tanneries\n\n(in metric tons)\n\n|      |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 | Change  2023  vs. 2022   |\n|------|--------|--------|--------|--------------------------|\n| VOCs |     89 |     65 |     58 | +37 %                    |",

        "page_content": "## 5.4 Sustainable sourcing and use of raw materials (Tier 3 and Tier 4)\n\n## 5.4.1  Traceability and transformation of raw material production practices\n\nThe  Group's  EP&L  clearly  shows  that  most  environmental impacts related to the life cycle and sale of its products (84%) are located in its upstream supply chains (Tier 1 to Tier 4) during the production of raw materials and their initial transformation (Tiers 3 and 4, 75%).\n\nBy analyzing the impact of each material, Kering can prioritize and  focus  efforts  on  the  materials  that  have  the  greatest impact:\n\n- \u00b7 materials used in large quantities and whose production can have  a  significant  impact  on  the  environment,  such  as leather;\n- \u00b7 materials used in smaller quantities but whose extraction or production  has  a  major  impact.  This  is  the  case  for  animal fibers such as wool and cashmere, as well as metals (such as gold and brass).\n\n## Breakdown of EP&L impacts (in \u20acm) of Tier 3 and 4 by material (in millions of kg)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKering  has  committed  to  reducing  its  environmental  footprint, starting  with  the  production  of  its  raw  materials.  The  Smart Sourcing  program  launched  in  2013  draws  on  the  Kering Standards and relies on close collaboration between the Group and its Houses, bringing together the MIL and supply chain, R&D and  Sustainability  teams,  with  the  aim  of  adopting  new responsible  sourcing  solutions  suited  to  the  specific  needs  of each House.\n\nThe Kering Standards lay down the Group's requirements for the raw materials used by the Houses (see section 4.1.1) in terms of traceability.  The  overall  level  of  traceability  of  raw  materials  is consolidated annually through the EP&L by collecting information about purchasing volumes. The level of traceability required by type of material was set on the basis of a risk matrix for each type of raw material, as well as the level of transparency achievable  by  the  market.  The  origin  of  the  raw  materials  is\n\nestablished by supplier declarations and may be supplemented by  specific  protocols  including  certification  (such  as  ICEC  for leather) and verification by the Houses. In addition to audits, the Houses are investigating various technologies to trace the path from  the  extraction  of  raw  materials  to  the  intermediate production stages and then into their own operations and finally into  stores.  These  technologies  include  RFID  and  NFC  chips, blockchain, mechanical marking of hides, and forensic technology.\n\nKering has undertaken to:\n\n- \u00b7 achieve 100% traceability by 2025, at least to the country of origin  and  beyond  (potentially  to  the  farm)  for  certain materials (as specified in the Kering Standards);\n- \u00b7 achieve 100% alignment with the Kering Standards by 2025, which is reflected by concrete targets for most raw materials.",

        "page_content": "## 5.4.2.1  Leather\n\nThe  concept  of  responsible  leather,  as  defined  in  the  Kering Standards, combines traceability, i.e., leather that can be traced back to all stages from the slaughterhouse, sourcing from farms that  minimize  their  environmental  impact,  respect  animal welfare and adopt practices that promote soil regeneration, and tanning  using  chrome-free  processes.  In  the  last  five  years,  an internal  working  group  dedicated  to  responsible  leather  has brought  together  representatives  from  all  the  Group's  leatherusing  Houses.  In  2023,  work  focused  on  transparency  and traceability,  animal  welfare  and  regenerative  agriculture  within leather supply chains.\n\nSeveral Houses have implemented leather scraps collection and recycling  systems  with  their  suppliers,  such  as  Saint  Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta and Gucci (see section 5.5.3.3).\n\n## Animal welfare\n\nKering published its standards for all animal species present in its supply  chains  in  2019,  as  well  as  standards  specific  to  species present in the leather supply chain, accompanied by a guide to specific practices for slaughterhouses. In 2021, Kering updated its map of food labels that meet a level equivalent to its standards in terms  of  animal  welfare  and  environmental  protection,  both  at the farm and in the slaughterhouse. The chosen approach draws on  existing  standards  in  the  food  industry  and  creates  links between  the  leather  and  meat  supply  chains.  To  date, 16 standards have been identified in close to 40 countries around the world. In 2023, around 20 on-site checks were performed at slaughterhouses.\n\nIn  addition,  Kering  also  worked  in  2023  on  animal  welfare  and mitigating  the  associated  risks  by  using  the  ICEC  traceability system.\n\n## Chrome-free and metal-free tanning\n\nSince  2017,  the  Group  has  been  working  closely  with  its tanneries, as well as its Houses and their suppliers, to promote the use of leather tanned without metals in the following ways:\n\n- 1. development of chrome- and metal-free tanning at all the Group's tanneries through R&D activities;\n- 2. close  collaboration  with  tanneries  to  develop  new  metalfree  tanned  items  and  gradually  increase  the  metal-free proportion of their products. A growing number of tanneries have  started  to  convert  their  facilities  to  fully  metal-free production;\n- 3. increase  in  the  proportion  of  metal-free  tanning  in  the collections  of  the  Houses:  in  2023,  52%  of  volumes purchased by the Houses for leather goods were metal or chrome free.\n\n## Leather traceability\n\nIn  2023,  Kering  expanded  its  work  on  the  investigation  and traceability  of  hides,  most  of  which  come  from  Europe,  by completing  its  in-depth  map  of  its  supply  chain,  making  it possible  to  identify  487  slaughterhouses.  The  Houses  that  use leather  are  developing  technologies  and  processes  to  trace leather at each stage of production, in particular to avoid losing track at the slaughterhouse, which is the most sensitive link in the chain.\n\n## Collaborative initiatives\n\nThe Group's strategy for managing leather sourcing in relation to deforestation is made public and described in Kering's responses to the 2023 CDP Forests Questionnaire, available on www.cdp.net. Kering achieved an A rating in the 2023 CDP Forests Questionnaire for the Cattle category.\n\n## 5.4.2.2  Animal textile fibers\n\nMaterials  made  from  animal  fibers  are  those  with  the  secondgreatest impact in Kering's EP&L and are central to many projects launched by the Group and its Houses.\n\n## Wool\n\nIn  2023,  Kering  continued  its  active  engagement  with  various potential  and  existing  wool  suppliers  to  assess  them  and  help them  to  improve  their  sustainable  environmental,  biodiversity, and animal welfare management practices. Kering also provides expertise to various initiatives, aimed at developing certifications and  sustainable  wool  production  methods,  such  as  the Responsible  Wool  Standard,  the  Responsible  Mohair  Standard and the Responsible Alpaca Standard.\n\nIn 2023, 63% of wool used by the Group's ready-to-wear fashion Houses  was  certified,  recycled,  organic  or  sourced  from regenerative agriculture (in particular GOTS, ZQ, RWS, GRS, EOV, ZQRX).\n\n## Cashmere\n\nIn  2015,  Kering  and  the  Wildlife  Conservation  Society,  an international NGO, launched the Gobi Desert Cashmere program to  promote  sustainable  and  traditional  production  of  highquality  cashmere  in  partnership  with  two  cooperatives  of nomadic herders representing 160 families and 150,000 hectares of pasture in 'Omno-Gobi province. The program also focuses on pastoral techniques such as rotating herds to improve the impact on  biodiversity  and  animal  welfare.  In  2022,  the  project  was integrated into the Regenerative Fund for Nature.\n\nKering's sustainable cashmere program is now a notable source of high-quality cashmere for the Group's Houses, as it meets the animal welfare and biodiversity conservation criteria laid down in the  Kering  Standards,  with  the  added  bonus  of  reducing  the Group's environmental footprint.\n\nAll  Houses  that  use  cashmere  (Gucci,  Balenciaga,  Alexander McQueen, Brioni, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta) favor use of GRS or GCS certified cashmere.\n\nIn  2023,  35%  of  cashmere  used  by  the  Group  was  certified, recycled, organic or sourced from regenerative agriculture.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainability\n\nRespecting and protecting the environment in our operations and value chain\n\nIn  terms  of  cashmere  from  farms  in  China  (Inner  Mongolia),  in 2021,  Kering  joined  the  Good  Cashmere  Standard  (GCS),  which promotes farming practices that meet demanding animal welfare requirements.\n\nAlongside their efforts to increase and verify the use of certified cashmere and cashmere produced using regenerative practices, the  MIL  and  the  Houses  are  seeking  to  replace  some  of  the cashmere  they  use  with  alternative  fibers  that  have  a  smaller environmental footprint and recycled options.\n\n## Silk\n\nKering  supports  certified  organic  silk  production  that  provides better  traceability  and  a  reduced  environmental  impact.  The Group's direct Procurement department has signed agreements with  the  main  suppliers  of  certified  silk  to  guarantee  that  the Group's Houses have access to this high-quality fiber. All Houses that  use  silk  (Balenciaga,  Gucci,  Saint  Laurent,  Alexander McQueen,  Bottega  Veneta,  Brioni)  are  gradually  incorporating organic  certified  silk  (GOTS)  or  recycled  silk  (GRS)  into  their collections. In 2023, 41% of silk used by the Group was certified, recycled, organic or sourced from regenerative agriculture.\n\nFor  example,  Gucci  is  supporting  the  reintroduction  of  the  silk supply chain in southern Italy with a pilot project. It encourages the  introduction  of  new  techniques  such  as  planting  mulberry trees,  the  development  of  new  technologies  for  production processes, and training farmers and craftspeople in transforming silk.  This  initiative  will  enable  Gucci  to  source  silk  from  local organic farms, which it will be able to use in its future collections.\n\n## 5.4.2.3 Metals, stones and other precious materials\n\nMining can endanger communities by causing serious health and environmental damage  if unregulated, whereas properly managed mining can generate responsible development for local communities.  Kering  is  therefore  committed  to  limiting  its purchases  of  metals  and  precious  stones  to  mined  sources  in areas  that  minimize  harmful  impacts  on  the  environment  and generate opportunities for local communities.\n\n## Gold\n\nThe Group's Houses source gold via the Kering Precious Metals Platform (PMP), which allows for centralized sourcing of gold and other precious metals in an ethical, responsible and transparent way.  This  has  enabled  Kering  to  draw  up  a  list  of  accredited refiners  that  have  been  meticulously  checked,  audited  and selected  by  the  Group.  Sourcing  options  available  via  the  PMP include gold that is Fairmined or Fairtrade certified, from smallscale  mines  whose  practices  have  been  verified  by  the  Group, 100% recycled from electronic or jewelry waste, and RJC Chainof-Custody (CoC) certified.\n\nResponsible  gold  purchases  totaled  3  metric  tons  in  2023, bringing  the  volume  of  responsible  gold  purchased  to  almost 14 metric tons since the platform was launched.\n\nFor all gold bought via the PMP, the Houses pay a premium that goes towards a fund to support responsible gold producers and contribute  to  their  growth  by  supporting  mining  communities. Each  year,  a  committee  composed  of  representatives  of  Kering and its Houses selects projects to be supported for the benefit of mining  communities  and  offering  social  and  environmental benefits.\n\nFollowing  on  from  the  reforestation  programs  carried  out  in French  Guiana  since  2018,  the  PMP  signed  a  new  two-year contract in 2023 to support the full reforestation of mining sites in the  Amazonian  rainforest  (French  Guiana)  in  collaboration  with reforestation  expert  Solicaz,  agroecology  product  developer Amasisa and mining company Sial. The aim of this program is to reforest all 15 hectares of the alluvial sites mined, going beyond the  regulatory  requirement  to  reforest  just  30%,  by  2025.  Gold from these mines is approved by the PMP.\n\n## Silver, platinum and palladium\n\nThe  Houses  also  source  silver,  platinum  and  palladium  from refiners  assessed  and  approved by Kering. The Group has since 2021 been working on adopting programs similar to the PMP for silver, platinum and palladium, with the pre-qualification of RJC CoC-certified recycled metals. Gucci uses 100%  recycled palladium and silver.\n\nPomellato, DoDo and Qeelin use 100% recycled silver.\n\n## Diamonds\n\nAs  regards  diamonds,  Kering  works  with  its  suppliers  to  ensure that all diamonds used in its products comply with the Kimberley process,  which  aims  to  ensure  the  legality  of  trade  in  the international  market,  so  that  it  does  not  serve  to  finance  rebel armed  conflicts.  The  Group's  Houses  map  risks  in  the  regions from which diamonds originate. Since 2022, the Group no longer sources diamonds from Russia. Kering has also worked with its Houses  to  roll  out  guidelines  and  best  practices  on  the traceability and sustainable sourcing of diamonds. For example, Boucheron  sources  diamonds  from  RJC  CoP-certified  suppliers and follows the recommendations of the World Diamond Council System of Warranties.\n\nPomellato,  Boucheron  and  Qeelin  have  introduced  systems  to ensure  that  diamonds  are  traceable.  For  example,  Boucheron and  Qeelin  use  Sarine  technology.  100%  of  solitaires  in Boucheron's \u00c9toile  de  Paris collection  and  83%  of  1  carat diamonds in Qeelin's engagement ring collection can be traced using this technology.\n\n## Other metals\n\nThe Houses also make use of other lower-impact processes: Saint Laurent  and  Balenciaga  have  been  using  physical  vapor disposition (PVD) coating on stainless steel for several years now for  certain  metal  parts  on  their  leather  goods.  This  vacuum metalization  process  deposits  thin  films  of  material  in  vapor form,  which  reduces  the  environmental  impact  compared  to classic electrolytic plating processes.",

Kering  takes  a  multi-level approach to responsible cotton:\n\n## 1. Define and maintain high sourcing standards\n\nThe Kering Standards for cotton specify traceability at least back to the country of origin to avoid sourcing from countries that are high-risk in terms of both environmental and social impacts, and prohibit the use of chemicals and pesticides. Alignment with the Kering  Standards  by  2025  includes  a  target  to  achieve  100% certified organic or recycled cotton. Kering encourages the use of organic  cotton  through  its  preference  for  GOTS  (Global  Organic Textile  Standard)  and  OCS  100  (Organic  Content  Standard) certifications, and  for  regenerative  practices,  for  example through ROC (Regenerative Organic Certified) and EOV (Ecological Outcome Verification) certifications.\n\n## 4. Support projects in the field\n\nThrough  its  partnership  with  OCA,  Kering  provides  practical support  for  on-the-ground  projects  in  India,  with  the  aim  of stepping  up  the  pace  at  which  organic  farming  practices  are adopted by helping farmers making the transition. Furthermore, through  the  Regenerative  Fund  for  Nature,  Kering  also  enables OCA to encourage farmers already practicing organic farming to adopt additional measures to achieve quantifiable regeneration of  soil  and  of  biodiversity.  Thanks  to  this  project  in  four  Indian states (Gujarat, Odisha,  Madhya  Pradesh  and  Rajasthan), 2,000  family  farmers  will  receive  support  to  move  from conventional  to  organic  and  regenerative  farming,  and  around 50,000 other producers that are already certified organic will be supported  in  adopting  regenerative  practices  such  as  crop diversification,  reducing  or  eliminating  tilling,  use  of  mulching, planting  of  ground  cover  and  green  manure,  mainly  through  a network  of  \"demonstration\"  regenerative  farms.  Between  2021 and  2023,  OCA  estimates  that  it  supported  the  introduction  of regenerative practices on around 68,000 hectares, well above the initial target of 53,500 hectares.\n\n## 2. Increase the proportion of cotton sourced from organic and regenerative farming or recycled cotton in their purchasing\n\nIn 2023, almost half of the cotton used by the Houses was organic (48%) and 23% was certified recycled.\n\nThe  Group  is  seeking  to  transition  some  of  its  cotton  sourcing toward alternative plant fibers that have a lower environmental impact  (such  as  linen  and  hemp),  as  well  as  recycled  options. Using  recycled  materials  significantly  reduces  the  impact associated with producing virgin materials.\n\n## 3. Collaborate with other companies in the sector to promote cotton from organic and regenerative farming\n\nKering continues to support the development of organic cotton farming  and  the  market  for  organic  cotton,  as  well  as  the adoption of regenerative practices in cotton production through various collaborations:\n\n## 5. Cotton traceability\n\nThe MIL has been working actively since 2018 to obtain the first fully verified organic  cotton  fabric  using  forensic  science methods.  The  project  has  been  carried  out  with  two  longstanding Kering partners, Italian weaver Albini and Supima, a USbased  organization  advocating  high-quality  cotton,  as  well  as with  traceability  expert  Oritain.  The  technology  uses  digital fingerprinting of organic cotton, which means it can be tracked at all stages of production. The current Oritain program (2022-2023) allows  the  Houses  to  check  their  suppliers'  claims  and  ensure that  they  comply  with  rules  restricting  the  origin  of  cotton  in accordance with the Kering Standards.\n\n## 5.4.2.5 Plastics and synthetic fibers\n\nThe Houses' use of plastics is governed by the Kering Standards. Kering has had a zero-PVC product policy in place since 2012 and aims to stop using single-use plastics by 2025 (see section 5.5.4.1). In addition, the Houses must favor plastics with recycled content or, failing that, certified biobased content, and ensure that chemicals used comply with the Group's MRSL (see section 5.3.3.3) and PRSL (see section 6.1.3). For the product endof-life phase, the Kering Standards emphasize recyclability.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Kering  is  working  on  eliminating  the  use  of  toxic  chemical products  and  removing  microfibers  and  microplastics  from  its production processes, for example by developing specific dyeing processes, from the product design phase.\n\nIn  2021,  Kering joined forces with The Microfibre Consortium as part  of  a  collaborative  approach  between  manufacturers  and brands  to  highlight  the  need  for  better  understanding  of microfiber pollution and its adverse effect on aquatic environments and air quality. The consortium calls for the sector to  measure  and  reduce  levels  of  microfiber  release.  Kering requires its suppliers to comply with its Sustainability Principles, including  implementing  measures  to  reduce  the  formation  of microfibers and microfiber emissions.\n\nAll  the  ready-to-wear  Houses  are  continuing  to  reduce  the proportion of synthetic materials used and gradually incorporate new  alternative  materials  or  more  responsible  synthetic  fibers into  their  collections,  made  from  biomaterials  or  recycled.  For example, in 2023, 42% of nylon used by Gucci was recycled. Since 2018,  Gucci  has  also  worked  with  its  suppliers  on  the  \"GucciECONYL\u00aePRE CONSUMER FABRIC TAKE BACK PROGRAM\" , which aims  to  recover  ECONYL\u00ae  production  scraps  (100%  recyclable nylon  fiber  from  fishing  nets)  and  recycle  them  to  create  new materials.\n\n## 5.4.2.6 Precious skins\n\nSustainable sourcing of precious skins such as from crocodilians and other reptiles, including compliance with the strictest animal welfare  standards,  is  a  priority  for  the  Group.  Kering  and  its Houses  support  a  range  of  initiatives  on  sustainable  supply chains for precious skins. These initiatives combine the Houses' Sustainability  departments  and  the  Group's  operations  division (which  manages  its  own  tanneries  and  incoming  supplies)  and various external stakeholders.\n\nThe Group and its Houses comply with national and international legislation and regulations on the trade of precious skins: all skins of species  classified  as  endangered  or  vulnerable  by  the Convention  on  International  Trade  in  Endangered  Species (\"CITES\")  are  obtained  with  certificates  attesting  to  their  legal origin,  issued  by  CITES  and  the  export  authority,  to  ensure  that trade does not threaten endangered species. In 2023, the Group resumed  its  grassroots  verification  activities,  particularly  in Southeast Asia and specifically Indonesia, but also continued to help international associations working on the ongoing improvement  of  sustainable  trade  and  use  of  exotic  leather. Kering actively supports the development of industry standards for all exotic species, such as crocodilians, ostriches and reptiles from Asia:\n\n## In 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 100% of Kering's exotic tanneries sourced their supplies from ICFA-certified farms;\n- \u00b7 100% of crocodilian and ostrich skin suppliers had certifications aligned with the Kering Standards (ICFA, SAOBC);\n- \u00b7 100% of python and lizard skin suppliers were pre-audited according to SARCA's RRSS protocol.\n\n## 5.4.2.7 Cellulosic fibers\n\nKering takes great care with its sustainable sourcing strategy for cellulosic fibers such as viscose since they can made from wood pulp, which can present significant risks in terms of deforestation and forest degradation. In 2023, viscose accounted  for approximately  6%  of  ready-to-wear  raw  materials,  and  in  total less than 1% of the Group's raw material purchases.\n\nTo  a  very  large  extent,  the  Kering  Standards  follow  the requirements  of  Canopy,  an  NGO  that  works  to  protect  the world's  forests,  species  and  climate.  In  2018,  Kering  funded CanopyStyle's  launch  of  ForestMapper,  an  interactive  map tracking  ancient  and  endangered  forests,  thereby  providing businesses  with  decision-making  support  for  their  purchases  of paper, packaging, wood and cellulosic textiles. The Group and its Houses source primarily from suppliers that have achieved \"dark green\" level (score of over 30 out of 35) according to the Canopy Hot Button Ranking methodology, as well as buying FSC-certified cellulosic  fiber.  The  main  suppliers  -  Lenzing,  Eastman,  Aditya Birla,  Jilin,  Tangshan Sayou, Bailu Group, Acegreen, Yibin Grace et  Enka  -  all  achieved  a  score  of  over  30  in  Canopy's  2023  Hot Button report.\n\nKering  is  exploring  a  number  of  recycling  technologies  and,  in 2020,  joined  forces  with  Fashion  for  Good  for  the  \"Full  Circle Textiles  Project:  Scaling  Innovations  in  Cellulosic  Recycling\" project,  which  is  looking  into  economically  viable  and  scalable solutions for chemical recycling of cellulose, in order to enable a closed-loop system to convert textile waste into new man-made cellulosic fibers.\n\nAt COP 27 in 2022, Kering supported the collective commitment alongside  NGO  Canopy  to  buy  more  than  half  a  million  metric tons  of  cellulosic  fibers  and  paper  packaging  made  from  \"nextgeneration\"  materials  that  have  a  lower  impact  on  the  climate and  biodiversity.  This  commitment  is  intended  to  attract  the investment needed to achieve a rapid ramp-up of production of these much sought-after alternatives.\n\nIn line with the Kering Standards, all Houses with ready-to-wear ranges favor using sustainable cellulosic fibers in their collections,  particularly  FSC-or  GRS-certified  viscose  and/or lyocell, and RCS-certified or recycled cupro, from suppliers with a score of over 30 in the Canopy report, as mentioned above. They also  favor  FSC-certified  products  in  their  packaging  and  paper (see section 5.5.4.1).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Kering achieved an A- rating in the 2023 CDP Forests Questionnaire for the Timber category.\n\n## 5.4.2.8 Fur\n\nKering has made the decision to stop using animal fur. None of the Group's Houses have used fur since the Fall 2022 collections.\n\n## 5.4.3 Animal welfare: the Kering Animal Welfare Standards\n\nKering believes that the products developed by its Houses must meet  the  highest  standards  in  terms  of  the  welfare  of  animals, supplying many of the materials used by the Houses.\n\nWith this in mind, Kering published its Animal Welfare Standards in  2019,  with  the  aim  of  ensuring  optimum  treatment  of  all species in the Group's supply chain. For each of these species, the standards  highlight  specific  challenges,  laying  down  rearing, transportation  and  slaughtering  requirements,  and  provide  the list of existing certifications serving as benchmarks. In 2021, these standards  were  updated  to  reflect  changes  in  practices  and experience gained during visits and assessments within our value chains.\n\nDeveloped with input from animal welfare experts, farmers and herders,  scientists  and  NGOs  such  as  the  Royal  Society  for  the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), Compassion in World Farming  (CIWF),  the  Nicolas  Hulot  Foundation  for  nature  and Humankind (FNH), Welfarm and French charity for animals taken to  slaughter  \u0152uvre  d'Assistance  aux  B\u00eates  d'Abattoirs  (OABA), the standards are based on the latest scientific research, as well as prevailing regulations and best management practices.\n\nThe  standards  lay  down  a  number  of  requirements  for  animal management  that  would  significantly  improve  the  welfare  of animals if they were adopted by the industry more broadly. They include Bronze, Silver and Gold levels to encourage the Group's suppliers to make continuous improvements.\n\n## Protocols and assessment results\n\nSpecific  assessment  protocols  have  been  developed  describing how  Kering  and  its  Houses  can  measure  their  suppliers' compliance  with  the  Kering  Standards.  The  protocols  cover livestock  rearing,  transportation  and  slaughter  conditions,  but also  include  broader  criteria  such  as  farms'  environmental performance and their impact on local communities and people.\n\nA country-by-country risk assessment approach is implemented, based  on  the  Animal  Protection  Index  of  NGO  World  Animal Protection. It assesses the risks inherent to each country in terms of  animal  welfare,  based  on  indicators  such  as  the  prevailing legislation and the voluntary commitments that exist. The level of verification  implemented  to  ensure  compliance  with  Kering's Standards is then adapted to this level of risk by country, as well as  other  factors  such  as  the  type  and  volumes  of  raw  materials concerned.\n\nIn  2023,  the  monitoring  and  verification  of  compliance  with animal welfare standards focused on leather and precious skins. This  led  to  a  case-by-case  action  plan  reflecting  the  risk presented  by  the  countries  of  operation  and  with  regard  to existing animal welfare certifications for slaughterhouses. Around 20  field  evaluations  were  carried  out  in  2023  to  verify  that Kering's  animal  welfare  requirements  were  being  met.  In  the absence  of  field  evaluations,  a  bibliographical  evaluation  of  a number of standards and suppliers was carried out with regard to their approaches to animal welfare, particularly for the wool and leather supply chains.\n\n## Fragrances and cosmetics\n\nIn 2023, Kering decided to invest directly in the beauty sector by creating a specialist entity: Kering Beaut\u00e9, which has developed an  in-house  sustainable  production  charter  that  includes  a section on animal welfare, with undertakings:\n\n- 1. to limit use of animal-derived products to only substances that present a relatively low risk - beeswax, lanolin, honey and carmine. The risks and impacts of these raw materials on the environment, society and animal welfare should also be carefully evaluated and taken into account before they are used;\n- 2. not  to  accept  animal  testing  by  not  developing  any products  that  require  their  raw  materials,  ingredients, formulae  or  finished  products  to  be  tested  on  animals, anywhere  in  the  world.  In  the  case  of  new  ingredients, suppliers  and  sub-suppliers  must  provide  evidence  that animal  testing  is  not  required  for  the  product  to  go  to market in China or any other country.\n\nIn  2023,  some  Group  brands  in  the  \"fragrances  and  cosmetics\" category operated via licensing agreements with leading industry operators such as L'Or\u00e9al and Coty to develop and sell fragrances and  cosmetics.  The  entities  with  which  Kering  and  its  Houses have signed licensing agreements have developed strict policies on  animal  testing,  compliant  with  internationally  recognized standards and best practices. Their approaches and requirements are set out in their respective reports.",

Transitioning to a truly circular economy requires a complete rethink of the way we produce and use resources as well as the way we extend the life of products.\n\n## 5.5.1 Circularity ambition: \"coming full circle\"\n\nKering sees the circular economy as a true opportunity to shape the industry by adapting it to the needs of future generations. The \"Coming Full Circle\" ambition has three central aspects:\n\n- 1. luxury that lasts;\n- 2. regenerative sourcing and clean production;\n- 3. making production processes more efficient.\n\nKering has set a series of targets: zero product destruction, 100% renewable energy by 2022 (target achieved based on RE100 criteria, see  section  5.2.4.2),  zero  single-use  plastic  by  2025,  100%  of  raw  materials  to  comply  with  the  Kering  Standards  by  2025,  and  zero microfiber leakage by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group is driving sustainable innovation and setting up internal workshops and structures, while the Houses are developing initiatives specific to their businesses and priorities. Kering is also committed to developing an ecosystem of innovation  actors.  The  graphic  below  summarizes  Kering's  innovation  approach  and  the  various  stages  involved,  from  identifying innovation  opportunities  (external  or  internal  via  the  MIL,  JIL  or  specific  departments  within  the  Houses  such  as  R&D,  operations, strategy) through to the rollout of innovations:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 5.5.2.1 Supporting innovation within and outside the Group\n\n## Material Innovation Lab (MIL)\n\nKering's Houses can rely on the Material Innovation Lab (MIL), which opened in 2013 at the heart of the Group's production operations in Italy. It consists of a team of experts and a materials library, with three main missions:\n\n## 1. Provide a sustainable materials library\n\n- \u00b7 Develop and make available to the Houses materials (fabrics, yarns, trims, etc.) aligned with Kering Standards to replace conventional materials in their collections.\n- \u00b7 Provide technical support for R&D efforts relating to sustainable materials, to design new textile structures and yarns for different product categories.\n- \u00b7 Update the MIL materials library every six months to incorporate fabric and yarns of suppliers' new collections. All obsolete collections are regularly donated to educational institutions in Italy and other countries.\n\n## 2. Investigation of supply chains\n\n## 3. Leading responsible innovation\n\n- \u00b7 Help the Houses to source sustainable raw materials (cotton, wool, silk) in larger quantities and develop multibrand synergies.\n- \u00b7 Map supply chains from field to end supplier, collect and check the various certifications at each stage in order to improve transparency. The MIL is also working on rolling out a digital traceability tool and also mapping out the textiles industry and Kering's supply chains (over 400 subcontractors and suppliers mapped).\n- \u00b7 Identify, assess and select sustainable textiles innovations in a variety of areas such as biotech fibers, recycling techniques, dyeing, printing and traceability technologies, etc.\n- \u00b7 Steer these innovations to make them more mature and get them to a level of development where they can be applied by the Group's Houses.\n- \u00b7 Support pilot projects from the Fashion for Good accelerator, of which Kering is an active member.\n- \u00b7 Maximize efforts to create sourcing mechanisms that enable the Houses and suppliers to source regenerative materials from the Regenerative Fund for Nature and approve a shared sourcing mechanism with suppliers and subcontractors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Its  two  key aims are:\n\n- 1. develop sustainable innovations for materials and processes to reduce the impact of the supply chains;\n- 2. assert the leading position of Kering and its Jewelry Houses in  terms  of  sustainability  through  key  partnerships  and groundbreaking initiatives.\n\nIn 2023, the JIL worked on alternatives to precious stones and on processes and materials with a lower environmental impact, such as  ceramics  produced  using  limited  energy  consumption  and green batteries.\n\n## Innovation in leather\n\nSome  of  the  Group's  tanneries  conduct  trials  on  developing alternative  materials  to  leather  in  partnership  with  external innovators, drawing on their expertise in leather tanning. The aim is  to  be  able  to  offer  high  quality,  plastic-free  materials  of  nonanimal origin with a significantly lower environmental impact to the Group's Houses and beyond. This work also aims to prepare the  future  of  tanneries  for  new  processes  relating  to  these innovative materials, and enable Kering to achieve its targets in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as leather accounts for 44% of greenhouse gas emissions relating to the products' life cycle and their commercialization, according to the EP&L.\n\n## 5.5.2.2 Innovation-oriented initiatives from Kering's Houses\n\nIn addition to Group-level initiatives, the Houses also run their own  innovation  initiatives,  addressing  their  specific  activities and priorities. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Balenciaga organized its fifth Material Innovation Unit (MIU), bringing together over 50 designers, developers and operational  representatives  to  converge  towards  common practices  and  processes.  The  platform  is  also  useful  for training teams and putting them in touch with startups, NGOs and  experts  from  the  academic  world  on  topics  including responsible  sourcing,  innovative  materials  and  sharing  of best practices;\n- \u00b7 in 2023, Balenciaga launched a coat made from Lunaform\u2122, a new  biomaterial  produced  by  micro-organisms  during fermentation.  This  is  the  first  time  this  material  has  been used  in  the  fashion  industry.  The  process  only  involves natural ingredients and no synthetic chemicals products are used.  It  is  free  of  animal  products  and  plastics.  The  House won  the  Best  Luxury  Product  of  2023  at  the  PETA  Fashion Awards;\n- \u00b7 Gucci  has  extended  its  range  of  products  made  from Demetra,  an  animal-free  alternative  to  leather  produced  in Italy, to include the Gucci Horsebit 1955 bag, which is made from  75%  plant-based  raw  materials.  The  House  took  the Best Vegan Bag prize at the 2023 PETA Fashion Awards;\n- \u00b7 Alexander  McQueen  used  marine  leather  in  its  2023  shoe collection, in collaboration with French startup ICTYOS. Initial assessments by ICTYOS highlight the reduced environmental impact of this leather in terms of carbon emissions and water consumption compared with conventional cowhide leather;",

Saint  Laurent  focused  on  wool  and  cashmere supply  chains  in  2023  and  is  looking  to  extend  its  scope  of application in 2024.\n\n## 5.5.2.3 External partnerships\n\n## Partnership with Fashion for Good\n\nKering  became  a  founding  partner  of  the  Fashion  for  Good accelerator  in  2017.  Its  aim  is  to  drive  innovation  in  the  Luxury and  fashion  industries  considering  in  sustainability  criteria  and supporting  the  development  of  startups  through  an  intensive accelerator program. Partners can identify startups and support them in their development.\n\nIn 2023, particular emphasis was placed on dry and wet finishing treatments,  fiber-to-fiber  mechanical  and  chemical  recycling, development  of  low-impact  dyeing  techniques  and  leather alternatives (bio-based or recycled materials).\n\nOf the 151 pilot projects launched via the accelerator, 33 were coordinated with Kering Houses through the MIL and at Group level, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the  \"D(r)ye  Factory  of  the  Future\"  project,  initiated  in  2022 and  continued  in  2023,  to  trial  innovations  in  the  pretreatment and dyeing of fibers and more specifically cotton denim,  wool,  polyester  and  wool-cotton  blends,  in  order  to reduce  consumption  of  water  (maximum  reduction  of  99% and average of 84%), energy (maximum reduction of 93% and average of 69%) and chemicals (maximum reduction of 90% and average of 59%) during the dyeing process;\n- \u00b7 a  hydroponic  cotton  project,  aiming  to  grow  cotton  in conditions similar to those of a greenhouse, with considerable  reduction  in  the  use  of  water,  chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, while quadrupling yields;\n- \u00b7 the \"Black Pigment Project\", initiated in 2022 and continued in 2023, for validating and scaling bio-black pigments derived from waste feedstocks such as industrial carbon, algae and wood that could replace synthetic carbon black dyes, offering a lower  carbon  impact  compared  with  classic  dyeing techniques.\n\n## Partnership with Biofabricate\n\nBiofabricate is a services platform based in New York that aims to popularize  and  democratize  emerging  biotechnologies  and biomaterials.  It  connects  Luxury  goods  houses  with  innovators around the world. In 2023, Biofabricate launched a web platform dedicated entirely to biomaterials. Kering played an active part in this  platform,  defining  the  needs  of  its  Houses  taking  an educational  approach  and  acting  as  beta  tester  ahead  of  its public rollout in 2024. In January 2024, Kering was main sponsor of  the  Biofabricate  Summit  in  France,  bringing  together  an international panel of innovators, creatives and investors.\n\n## Kering Generation Awards\n\nKering  and  the  innovation  platform  Plug  and  Play  China  have created  the  Kering  Generation  Awards  to  promote  sustainable innovation  in  the  fashion  industry.  As  well  as  identifying innovators in sustainable fashion in mainland China, the award program also seeks to raise awareness within the Chinese fashion ecosystem about the importance of more responsible fashion.\n\nThe rollout of the Kering Generation Awards in Japan has begun with local accelerator CIC. The first awards ceremony will be held in Tokyo in December 2024.\n\n## 5.5.3  Promote circularity and the reuse of products\n\n## 5.5.3.1  Durability by design\n\nThe  priority  of  circular  fashion  is  to  create  products  that  last, retain their value over time and to produce the right number of products  so  as  to  avoid  unsold  products.  The  Group's  luxury products  fall  within  this  framework,  combining  strategic  knowhow  with  excellent  craftsmanship  in  processing,  cutting  and assembly. They are designed and created from unique materials, and  are  subject  to  rigorous  quality  controls  to  ensure  their longevity and durability. These practices improve both products' intrinsic (physical) durability and their extrinsic durability, or their desirability and the emotional attachment they inspire.\n\nFurthermore, the Houses offer their customers repair services to maintain  the  quality  of  their  products  and  ensure  that  they stand the test of time, sometimes in addition to a warranty:\n\n- \u00b7 Brioni offers its customers a reconditioning service, which it promotes via its e-commerce site;\n- \u00b7 Bottega Veneta has introduced its Certificate of Craft lifetime warranty  program  for  its  most  iconic  bags  (Jodie,  Cassette and  Pouch)  offering  unlimited  refresh  and  repair.  This initiative  is  free  for  customers,  who  receive  a  physical certificate that matches the serial number of their bag.\n\nTo  make  it  easier  to  access  repair  services,  Kering  has  created specialist repair centers for customers: one located in Shanghai, another one in Hong Kong SAR and a last one in the United States (near  its  headquarters  in  Wayne,  New  Jersey).  Kering  already offers  a  resoling  service  for  sneakers,  and  several  Houses  have launched pilot programs for shoe cleaning and repairs. Kering's after-sales service is an essential part of building loyalty towards the  Houses.  This  contributes  to  its  excellence  and  savoir-faire, with  the  aim  of  enhancing  the  lifespan  of  the  Group's  luxury products.\n\nGucci, with the support of Kering, announced the launch of the first  circular  luxury  goods  hub  in  Italy  in  2023.  The  aim  of  the Gucci  \"Circular  Hub\"  is  to  speed  up  the  transformation  of production methods in the Italian fashion industry, redefining the entire  value  chain.  From  raw  materials  and  design  through optimizing  production  and  logistics,  the  \"Circular  Hub\"  is  an open-source innovation platform for the design and manufacture of circular products and research of new solutions. It supports the creation of innovative and circular luxury products that maximize the  use  of  recycled  materials,  durability,  repairability  and recyclability.",

As  such,  the  sale  of  second-hand products is  growing  in  importance  and  is  a  strategic  focus  for the Group, primarily via Kering Ventures. Its purpose is to invest in innovative new technologies, brands and business models for the future of the luxury sector. This includes the acquisition of a financial  stake  in  2021  in Vestiaire  Collective (worldwide  preowned fashion platform), Cocoon (luxury bag rental service) and VitroLabs in 2023 (startup specializing in the production of labgrown leather), etc.\n\nThe Group has also accelerated its movement to collect products that  are  no  longer  used  by  customers,  collectively  via  extended producer responsibility if the organizational structure is in place locally,  as  is  the  case  in  France  with  Refashion,  or  through partnerships  such  as  Alexander  McQueen  x  Vestiaire  Collective, which offer a practical solution for collecting products that are no longer used, while increasing products' active lifespan.\n\n## 5.5.3.3  Reuse, upcycle, recycle\n\nTo  limit  the  quantity  of  unsold  products  at  the  end  of  each season, the Group is investing in artificial intelligence technologies  to  improve  sales  forecasts  and  therefore  optimize production  and  distribution.  Machine  learning  models  improve the  Group's  ability  to  anticipate  seasonal  demand  and  current trends, thereby reducing possible prediction errors.\n\nAs  the  destruction  of  unsold  products  is  prohibited  throughout the  Group,  Kering  is  actively  working  to  develop  operational solutions  to  give  products  and  materials  a  second  lease  of  life. This means that products that are not sold in stores, particularly because  of  feedback  about  quality,  are  then  offered  for  sale  to employees  and  their  friends  and  families,  or  are  donated.  If products still remain unsold, pilot upcycling and remanufacturing  projects  are  in  place  to  develop  lasting  and value-added  recycling  systems  that  preserve  the  value  of materials in order to use recycled materials in fashion products. These  processes  are  not  the  same  as  downcycling,  which  does not allow for a circular economy.\n\nThe  Houses  have  developed  a  number  of  reuse,  upcycling  or recycling projects such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Balenciaga used obsolete fabrics and shoe scraps to produce insulation panels for its training center and factory in Cerreto Guidi. This enabled it to insulate a total of 2,800 m\u00b2 of walls and use 5.8 tons of shoe scraps and 1.5 million tons of fabric. The  House  is  also  involved  in  a  leather  scraps  recycling project with a number of external partners, allowing for the recovery of 5.2 tons of leather in 2023;\n- \u00b7 Bottega  Veneta  has  set  up  several  leather  scraps  recycling projects.  The  first  allowed  for  the  launch  in  2023  of  the \"Reserve Leather Series\" collection,  using  leather  from  high quality  surplus  stock  to  create  unique  pieces.  The  second project consisted of collecting leather scraps (free of chrome and  other  metals)  to  create  paper.  Finally,  another  project has been launched to turn leather scraps into fertilizer;\n- \u00b7 As part of its \"Circular Hub\", Gucci has worked in partnership with International Promo Studio , Candiani Denim and Filatura Astro to  develop  jeans  made  from  74%  cotton  fiber  grown using  regenerative  agriculture  practices  and  26%  postconsumer recycled fibers, collected and re-spun in Italy. The\n\nHouse  has  also  set  up  the  \"Gucci-Up\"  program  to  upcycle scraps of leather and  textiles generated during the production  process.  Between  2018  and  2023,  Gucci  reused 111 tons of leather scraps;\n\n- \u00b7 Saint  Laurent  has  used  upcycled  leather  in  its  Sunset collection since Fall 2021;\n- \u00b7 Kering  Eyewear  has  developed  ReAce,  a  100%  recycled acetate  derived  from  pre-consumer  acetate  scraps.  Using ReAce promotes a circular economy approach by recovering subproducts that would otherwise be wasted. Producing one kilo  of  ReAce  reduces  carbon  emissions  by  at  least  50% compared with producing the same quantity of conventional acetate;\n- \u00b7 Pomellato  has  launched  the Pomellato  Iconica  Cocktail ring collection  using  ancient  stones  from  unsold  rings  from  the Veleno collection.\n\nThese practices have enabled the Group to anticipate French and EU regulations and even go beyond these regulations by banning the destruction of unsold products, regardless of location.\n\n## 5.5.3.4  Responsible and regenerative sourcing of materials and responsible collections\n\nThe final aspect relates to the sound management of chemicals, the  maximum  use  of  recycled  or  renewable  materials,  and recycling at every stage of production. Kering and its Houses have focused primarily on materials deemed strategic by virtue of their volume,  their  environmental  impacts  or  their  contribution  in overall sourcing (see section 5.4).\n\nThis approach, coupled with the Group's innovation strategy (see section  5.5.2),  has  resulted  in  a  steady  rise  in  the  weighting  of responsible  materials  aligned  with  the  Kering  Standards  within the  Houses'  collections,  helping  to  raise  greater  awareness among  customers  and  respond  to  growing  demand  for responsible products (see also section 6.1).\n\n## 5.5.3.5  Circular economy partnerships in fashion\n\n## 5.5.4  Packaging and waste management\n\n## 5.5.4.1  More sustainable packaging\n\nAccording  to  the  definition  given  in  the  European  Directive  on packaging  and  packaging  waste,  a  packaging  is  a  disposable article  made  of  any  material,  intended  to  contain  and  protect specific goods and allow them to be handled and transported. As a result, certain items used to protect the Group's products, and intended to be used by customers throughout the products' lives, are not categorized as packaging. For example, this is the case for jewelry boxes, eyewear cases, clothing and shoe dust bags that are not used as disposable items by customers.",

The general reduction in packaging used by the Group's Houses between 2022 and 2023 is mainly due to the reduction in production volumes over the year, as well as anticipated new artistic directions.\n\n## Paper and cardboard packaging\n\n92% of packaging used by Kering consists of paper and cardboard. In 2023, all paper and cardboard packaging was certified or recycled.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures to promote more sustainable packaging\n\nKering  and  its  Houses  strive  to  source  recycled  or  certified biobased materials. They have also adopted initiatives aimed at reducing  the  use  of  packaging  while  guaranteeing  an  optimal level  of  protection  for  the  goods  manufactured.  The  Kering Standards  dedicated  to  packaging  set  out  the  principles  of ecodesign:  reduce  (weight  and  volume),  reuse,  recycling  and incorporate  sustainable  materials  (recycled,  bio-based  and certified). It should be noted that the use of compostable plastic is  not  considered  as  a  viable  solution  for  the  Group,  as  these materials have not demonstrated specific environmental benefits.\n\nAll  the  Houses  are  developing  plastic  alternatives  for  their packaging,  gradually  replacing  it  with  paper  (FSC-certified)  or cotton (organic, GOTS-certified). In particular, in 2023, Boucheron presented its new jewelry case concept. It is made from just two materials: aluminum (made from 15 to20% recycled aluminum) and felt  (made  from  RWS-certified  wool).  Using  felt  means  that glue and stitching is not necessary, which makes recycling easier.\n\nIn  2022,  an  ecodesign  tool  was  developed  to  help  teams implement  the  Kering  Standards  on  an  operational  level.  This guide  will  be  shared  more  widely  with  suppliers  at  the  start  of 2024.\n\nThe  Houses  pay  special  attention  to  packaging  used  for  ecommerce. For example, Bottega Veneta uses a box made from cardboard  that  is  lighter  than  the  traditional  packaging  used, thereby  optimizing  space  and  reducing  the  impact  of  product shipping.  Gucci  no  longer  uses  plastic  in  its  retail  and  ecommerce  packaging,  which  consists  of  reusable  cotton packaging and filling made from FSC Mix certified paper. Gucci is also cascading its requirements to its suppliers. As regards plastic protective boxes for its accessories, Gucci's \"Take Back\" program avoided the production of 360,000 boxes, equal to 43 metric tons of plastic avoided for BtoB packaging in 2023.\n\n## Single-use plastics\n\nKering  believes  that  eliminating  plastic  packaging  across  the industry  is  a  priority  and  has  adopted  the  ambitious  target  of eliminating  it completely  by  2025.  The  solutions  being considered are as follows, in order of priority:\n\n## BtoC:\n\n- 1. eliminate packaging;\n- 2. replace plastic with another material such as paper.\n\n## BtoB:\n\n- 1. eliminate packaging;\n- 2. choose reusable rather than single-use packaging;\n- 3. replace plastic with another material such as paper;\n- 4. use 100% circular plastic:\n- - containing 100% recycled material,\n- - recyclable in practice and at scale.\n\n## Plastic packaging\n\n4% of the Group's packaging is made of plastic. In 2023, 65% of plastic packaging consisted of recycled or bio-based material.",

Waste production is directly  related  to  the  intensity  of  its  retail  activities.  The repackaging of products or the use of pallets for transportation mostly generate non-hazardous waste.\n\nSmall quantities of hazardous waste are produced, corresponding  to  specific  waste  in  production  sites  and  other waste  produced  mainly  in  stores  and  offices  (lighting,  ink cartridges, etc.). The main source of the Group's hazardous waste production  is  linked  to  its  industrial  operations,  and  more specifically  its  tanneries.  One  of  the  main  challenges  is  the presence  of  heavy  metals,  which  are  used  during  the  tanning process,  in  waste.  Kering's  tanneries  are  therefore  actively involved in the research and development of alternative tanning methods that are more environmentally friendly (see section 5.4.2.1). As a result, a heavy metal-free tanning method is now  available  at the Group's tanneries and  Life Cycle Assessments  (LCA)  have  been  carried  out  to  confirm  the improvement in environmental impact associated with the new process, which does not use chrome or heavy metals.\n\n## Total waste produced (in metric tons)\n\n|                                 | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | Change 2023  vs. 2022   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-------------------------|\n| Non-hazardous waste             | 18,341 | 22,702 | 20,452 | -19%                    |\n| Of which recycled and recovered | 67%    | 65%    | 77%    |                         |\n| Hazardous waste (1)             | 604    | 569    | 645    | +6%                     |\n| Of which recycled and recovered | 60%    | 43%    | 46%    |                         |\n| TOTAL WASTE                     | 18,945 | 23,271 | 21,097 | -19%                    |\n| Of which recycled and recovered | 67%    | 64%    | 76%    |                         |\n\nIn  2023,  97%  of  waste  generated  by  the  Group  was  nonhazardous. The quantity of waste produced decreased by around 19%  in  2023.  The  Kering  Standards  on  store  operation  and maintenance are being introduced to more and more sites. At all Alexander  McQueen,  Balenciaga,  Bottega  Veneta,  Brioni  and Qeelin stores in France, waste is regularly weighed and declared, with average recycling rates of over 80%.\n\nThe proportion of non-hazardous waste recycled and recovered rose to 67% in 2023.\n\n## Non-textile waste recycling\n\nKering  is  constantly  looking  for  ways  of  recycling  the  waste generated by its operations. For example, Kering, Balenciaga and Saint  Laurent  collect  and  recycle  paper  and  packaging  at  their offices.\n\n## Waste recycling rate in 2023 (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMeasures  are  also  being  taken  on  a  local  level  to  combat  food waste,  such  as  Kering  Eyewear's  partnership  with  food  waste collection and recovery expert Moulinot , or Balenciaga and Saint Laurent's  partnerships  with  waste  and  compost  recovery specialists Linkee and Les  Alchimistes ,  particularly  in  relation  to showroom  events.  Gucci  has  been  involved  in  the Siticibo initiative  in  collaboration  with Banco  Alimentare since  2011, which also partners with Pomellato and Dodo.\n\n## Textile waste\n\nKering and its Houses have launched numerous initiatives and entered  into  multiple  partnerships  with  schools,  associations and  recycling  organizations  to  collect  waste  and  scraps  from production  processes  and  fashion  shows  with  a  view  to recycling or reusing them (see sections 5.5.3 and 6.1.2):\n\n- \u00b7 Revalorem for the reuse and recovery of damaged and unsold items;\n- \u00b7 donations to charities or schools, or private sales of stocks of fabric from old collections;\n- \u00b7 with  support  from  the  MIL,  Gucci  has  established  an ambitious  collection  and  recycling  program  for  ECONYL\u00ae scraps.  Known  as  the  \"ECONYL\u00ae-Gucci  pre-consumer  fabric take back program\", it aims to maximize the benefits of this innovative material in Gucci's ready-to-wear collections;\n- \u00b7 at  the  end  of  2023,  10  tanneries  were  involved  in  the  Gucci \"Scrap-less\" project. The project consists of cutting off parts of hides that cannot be used in finished products due to their size  or  quality  before  tanning  actually  takes  place.  The outcome  over  the  period  from  2018  to  2023  was  a  greatly reduced  environmental  impact,  achieved  by  reducing  the quantity of leather needing to be tanned (314 tons of scrap leather avoided).  This  meant  lower  carbon  emissions (28  tCO2e  avoided),  a  reduction  in  use  of  water  (35  million liters  of  water  saved),  chemicals  (reduction  of  484  metric tons,  including  82  metric  tons  of  chrome)  and  energy (2.9 million kW), and a lower impact from transportation.\n\nSeveral Houses have also established leather scraps management systems (see section 5.5.3.3).",

For  2023,  eligible  activities  have  been extended to include the six environmental objectives. Companies are required to publish three indicators in 2023: turnover, CapEx and OpEx, corresponding to the proportion eligible in relation to the  six  objectives  and  aligned  only  with  the  two  climate objectives of climate change mitigation and adaptation.\n\nOn the basis of the new activities introduced in the amendment to the Delegated Regulation of June 13, 2023 (DR 2023/2485 and DR  2023/2486),  Kering  has  analyzed  the  activities  that  could apply  to  the  Group  and  identified  the  following  activities:  5.1 Repair,  refurbishment  and  remanufacturing  and  5.4  Sale  of second-hand goods, with the  aim  of  moving  towards  a  circular economy.\n\nAs a result of the analysis and the amounts associated with these new  activities,  the  main  impact  for  Kering  remains  linked  to CapEx related to real estate , in particular purchases of property and  leases.  Details  of  the  methodology  used  and  Kering's assessment of compliance with the cross-cutting  conditions  for alignment  (Do  No  Significant  Harm  -  DNSH  and  minimum safeguards) are provided in section 5.6.2.\n\n## 5.6.1.1 Kering's application of the Taxonomy\n\nAnalysis  of  eligible  CapEx  focused  on  expenditures  related  to assets or expenditure eligible for the Taxonomy on an individual basis.  The  main  CapEx  targeted  are  real  estate  assets,  in particular  new  leases  and  new  acquisitions.  As  a  company involved  in  retail  and  luxury  goods,  the  majority  of  right-of-use assets in 2023 correspond to leases for stores, most of them are located in historic buildings in city centers. In many cases, these buildings  do  not  meet  the  highest  energy  efficiency  standards. Through its Kering Standards and building certifications (such as LEED Platinum/Gold and BREEAM), Kering improves significantly the energy efficiency of its sites and stores (see section 5.2.3.1.2).\n\n## Turnover\n\nIn  relation  with  the  new  activities  listed  in  the  amendment  of the  Delegated  Act  of  June  13,  2023  (DR  2023/2485  and  DR 2023/2486),  Kering  has  analyzed  turnover  and  investments associated with the following activities with the aim of moving towards a circular economy:\n\n- \u00b7 5.1 Repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing;\n- \u00b7 5.4 Sale of second-hand goods.\n\nThis  analysis  shows  that  turnover  relating  to  these  Taxonomyeligible  activities  is  below  the  Group  reporting  thresholds, representing  less  than  0.1%  of  the  Group's  total  turnover  and thus considered as non-material.\n\nNevertheless,  all  Group  Houses  have  launched  initiatives  to encourage circularity (see section 5.5):\n\n- \u00b7 repair  services  offered  to  customers.  These  services  are usually free and represent more an operating expense than a source of revenue for the Group;\n- \u00b7 selling second-hand  and  vintage  products  via  online platforms such as Vestiaire Collective and Reflaunt;\n- \u00b7 use of materials that promote circularity.\n\nA  detailed  table  of  ratios  of  Taxonomy-eligible  and  Taxonomyaligned turnover is provided in section 5.6.1.2.\n\n|                                  | Proportion of turnover/ (absolute turnover) Aligned Eligible   | Proportion of turnover/ (absolute turnover) Aligned Eligible   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Climate change mitigation (5)    | 0%                                                             | 0%                                                             |\n| Climate change adaptation (6)    | 0%                                                             | 0%                                                             |\n| Water and marine resources (7)   | N/A                                                            | 0%                                                             |\n| Circular economy (8)             | N/A                                                            | 0%                                                             |\n| Pollution (9)                    | N/A                                                            | 0%                                                             |\n| Biodiversity and ecosystems (10) | N/A                                                            | 0%                                                             |",

The change in the proportion of eligible expenditures is primarily due to  the  impact  of  the  acquisition  of  three  buildings  in  Paris, increasing  the  total  amount  of  CapEx  (denominator)  by  68% relative to 2022. Note that total CapEx also includes land that is not Taxonomy-eligible.\n\nFurthermore,  Kering  did  not  directly  implement  any  solutions responding to the objective of adaptation in 2023, as in the light of  the  Group's  activities  and  risk  review,  expenditures  over  the year are related mainly to climate change mitigation measures.\n\nThe main changes in eligibility and alignment ratios compared with 2022 were as follows:\n\n## \u00b7 7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings\n\n- -all new leases and acquisitions were reviewed;\n- -the  eligible  proportion  relating  to  activity  7.7  (climate change  mitigation)  of  the  Taxonomy  amounted  to  41%  of total CapEx in 2023. This 53% reduction relative to 2022 is due to a 68% increase in total CapEx (impact of the value of land from acquisitions mentioned above). The total eligible amount comes to \u20ac1,886 million compared with \u20ac1,416 million in 2022, corresponding primarily to the value of  the  three  buildings  (excluding  land)  acquired  in  Paris during the year;\n- -the aligned proportion is 10% of total CapEx, stable relative to  2022  (11%).  This  is  mainly  because  of  the  alignment  of assets  acquired  in  2023  and  achieving  the  energy  criteria (EPC  A  rating)  for  new  leases,  representing  a  total  of \u20ac472 million;\n- -regarding the consolidation of Ginori and Creed, the Group carried  out  a  review  of  the  two  consolidated  entities' eligible  property,  plant  and  equipment,  including  mainly production  plants,  offices  and  stores.  Based  on  the information  obtained  and  the  Taxonomy  criteria,  these assets are not considered to be Taxonomy-aligned but are included  in  Taxonomy-eligible  assets  in  2023.  A  more  indepth review of Creed's assets will be carried out in 2024, as it was consolidated into the Group at the end of the year.\n\n## \u00b7 7.2 Renovation of existing buildings\n\n- -the  main  major  renovation  projects  in  accordance  with local regulations or aiming for a 30% reduction in primary energy demand have been analyzed for their eligibility and alignment;\n- -eligible  assets  in  relation  to  the  renovation  of  existing buildings increased to \u20ac115 million from \u20ac60 million in 2022, as  expenditure  on  store  renovations  was  taken  into consideration  in  2023.  In  2022,  analysis  concerned  mainly expenditures  not  related  to  stores  (production  plants  and warehouses).  As  a  result,  some  renovation  projects  were aligned with activity 7.2 criteria (climate change mitigation) in 2023, representing a total of \u20ac37 million (0.8% of CapEx);\n- -in 2024, the Group will endeavor to take greater account of Taxonomy  criteria  when  starting  renovation  projects  in order to meet energy consumption reduction criteria.\n- \u00b7 7.3 Installation,  maintenance  and  repair  of  energy efficiency equipment\n- -for sites for which investments are not eligible for a major renovation, the eligibility and alignment of energy efficiency equipment have been analyzed;\n- -taxonomy-aligned expenditures accounted for 2% in 2023, similar to the proportion in 2022 of 3%. Emphasis is placed on  this  type  of  expenditure  in  the  Kering  Standards  and energy  efficiency  features  such  as  insulation  and  LED lighting are included in each real estate project.\n- \u00b7 7.5  Installation,  maintenance  and  repair  of  instruments and  devices  for  measuring,  regulation  and  controlling energy performance of buildings\n- -for sites for which expenditures are not eligible for a major renovation, Kering has analyzed eligibility and alignment n relation  to  instruments  for  measuring,  regulation  and controlling energy performance;\n- -these devices are widely used within the Group's buildings, as  emphasized  in  the  Kering  Standards,  and  required  for site certification;\n- -these  expenditures  remained  stable  compared  with  2022, amounting to \u20ac10 million in 2023.\n\nBased  on  analysis  of  the  technical  criteria  for  substantial contributions,  application  of  the  \"Do  No  Significant  Harm\" principle  and  minimum  safeguards,  Taxonomy-aligned  CapEx represents 13%  of Kering's total Taxonomy  CapEx, or \u20ac593 million,  compared  with  \u20ac412  million  in  2022  (15%  of  total CapEx).\n\nInformation about the methodology used and a review of DNSH criteria are provided in section 5.6.2.",

In  view  of  this  limited amount and the nature of the expenses in question, which do not\n\nrepresent  the  core  business  of  Kering  and  its  Houses,  the  work carried out concluded that this indicator was not material for the Group.  The  numerator  is  therefore  considered  to  be  zero.

        "page_content": "## 5.6.2 Methodological note\n\nAlignment is  based  on  meeting  substantial  contribution  criteria and  on  the  non-opposability  of  a  generic  or  specific  DNSH criterion. Kering  assessed  these  criteria  on  the  basis  of documentation, certifications and supporting evidence required to  ensure  that  EU  Taxonomy  criteria  are  met  with  regard  to activities concerning the Group.\n\n## DNSH - Climate change adaptation\n\nThe climate change adaptation criterion applies only to Kering's eligible activities, but all of the Group's locations were included in the analysis regarding the application of the criterion. The Group analyzed the risks of exposure to chronic and acute physical risks and  adaptation  related  to  climate  change,  as  well  as  the vulnerability  of  various  sites  (see  section  5.2.2).  Analysis  was carried out on the basis of two IPCC scenarios (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5)  and  two  time  horizons  (2030  and  2040)  and  allowed  for financial exposure to be modeled. Measures have been adopted within the Group, particularly in relation to insurance policies and business  continuity  plans,  with  more  detailed  management  of climate  change  risk  at  the  Group's  sites  (annual  site-by-site monitoring,  strengthening  of  business  continuity  plans,  annual financial impact monitoring and discussions with the stakeholders  involved,  including  insurers)  that  could  lead  to adaptation  solutions  being  adopted  in  addition  to  annual  risk analysis.\n\nIt  should be noted that the Group is mainly a tenant of its sites, which in many cases take up limited space within buildings, with lease terms that are variable but can be fairly short. As a result, landlords  will  be  mainly  responsible  for  physical  adaptation solutions.\n\n## DNSH - Water\n\nFor the alignment of expenditures under activity 7.2 - Renovation of existing buildings, it should be checked whether expenditures comply with water flow rates per minute, which vary depending on  the  water  supply  equipment  used.  Kering  has  checked whether  water  meters  or  water  consumption  management solutions  are  in  place,  which  indicate  alignment  with  the thresholds set by the European Commission.\n\n## DNSH - Circular economy\n\nFor each of the renovation projects under activity 7.2, Kering has ensured  that  at  least  70%  of  construction  waste  by  weight  is prepared  for  recycling,  reuse  or  any  other  form  of  recovery  by collecting  the  necessary  documentation,  based  in  particular  on work carried out to obtain LEED Gold/Platinum certification for the sites and other documents such as the existence of a green worksite charter or on-site waste monitoring.\n\nThe  Group  has  also  checked  that  the  design  and  construction techniques used promote circularity (reusing materials, dismantling, etc.)  by  collecting  technical  documentation  on  the materials used on construction sites.\n\n## DNSH - Pollution\n\nKering has ensured that the pollutants listed in Appendix C of the Climate Delegated Act have not been used in expenditures made, particularly  for  renovations  of  existing  buildings  (7.2)  and  the installation, maintenance  and  repair  of  energy  efficiency equipment (7.3).\n\nThe Group has also checked that thresholds for certain polluting substances  such  as  volatile  organic  compounds  are  respected, for example by consulting documents such as indoor air quality plans.\n\nFinally, the Group has made sure that measures have been put in place  to  limit  noise,  dust  and  polluting  emissions  during  works (for example by consulting the Low Disruption Worksite Charter, the Green Worksite Charter, etc.).\n\nFor  Taxonomy-aligned  projects,  these  criteria  are  deemed  to have  been  met  on  the  basis  of  applicable  French  and  EU regulations concerning pollution.\n\n## Minimum safeguards\n\nMinimum safeguards apply to the entire Group and mostly relate to  subjects  within  the  scope  of  Group  programs  or  policies.  For the Group, minimum safeguards consist of compliance with the OECD  Guidelines  for  Multinational  Enterprises,  the  United Nations  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human  Rights,  the United  Nations  International  Bill  of  Human  Rights  and  the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organization  (ILO).  Minimum  safeguards  mainly  cover  human rights and business ethics (anti-corruption, responsible taxation, competition  law).  The  Group  relied  on  the  Sustainable  Finance Platform's report on  minimum  safeguards  to  ensure  its compliance with these principles. The Group's policies, programs and action plans on the subject are presented in part 2 \"Ethics, the cornerstone of our business\", in particular the Code of Ethics, the  Human  rights  Policy  and  measures  to  detect  and  prevent risks of corruption and influence peddling, and in the chapter 5 of this  Universal  Registration  document  on  the  Duty  of  Care  Plan, responsible taxation and tax commitments.\n\nThere were no breaches of these rules in 2023.",

For  this reason,  Kering  strives  to  communicate  in  an  ethical  and transparent manner across all channels.\n\nTo this end, a Policy and internal guidelines have been developed and  are  implemented  with  the  support  of  a  robust  internal control  framework  under  the  supervision  of  the  Chairman  and Chief  Executive  Officer.  They  detail  key  principles,  golden  rules and processes to be implemented in every House and throughout the Group.\n\nTo ensure that our communications comply with these principles at Group level and within each House, a Brand Trust function was created  in  2023,  tasked  with  making  recommendations  to  the Houses regarding their content and marketing and communications  activities,  and  to  help  them  assess  risks.  The Brand  Trust  must  be  consulted  for  advertising  campaigns  that touch on one or more sensitive topics identified internally, for all fashion shows and on demand for ad hoc requests.",

        "page_content": "In 2022, Kering also published a Practical Guide to Environmental Claims  as  part  of  the  Kering  Standards,  designed  to  provide support  to  its  Houses  and  to  avoid  any  risk  of  potential greenwashing  statements.  The  guide  sets  out  the  kind  of information that should be provided. According to best practice guides  on  green  claims,  for  a  claim  to  be  fully  responsible  and trustworthy it must be: true and relevant, clear and unambiguous, fair and without exaggeration, substantiated and verifiable,  not  over-using  visual  natural  or  nature-like  elements, and putting forward certifications properly. A practical guide for the Houses'  internal use (the \"Kering Anti-Greenwashing Guidelines\") is currently being finalized.\n\nThe  Charter  on  fashion  models'  working  conditions  and  wellbeing, published in 2017 by Kering and LVMH and applied to all of their brands, promotes high standards of integrity, responsibility and  respect  toward  the  people  concerned.  As  well  as  paying particular  attention  to  models'  working  conditions,  this  Charter forms  part  of  the  Group's  responsible  communication  efforts, aiming  to  promote  respect  for  the  dignity  of  all  people  and  to convey a positive image to the audiences of the Group's various Houses, particularly among vulnerable groups.\n\nGucci  has  a  set  of  responsible  marketing  and  communication guidelines that set out the procedures  that  should  be implemented before and during photo shoots, fashion shows and other events and initiatives, such as the creation of promotional materials  and  more  generally  any  photographic/audiovisual material produced or used by Gucci.\n\n## Informing customers\n\nTo provide customers  with  clear, accurate and  reliable information  about  the  sustainability  characteristics  of  their products and sustainability, the Houses provide retail teams with specific trainings. This is notably the case for Gucci (Global Retail Academy),  Saint  Laurent  (E-University),  Bottega  Veneta  (Green Atelier),  Balenciaga  (Global  Retail  Meeting),  Alexander  McQueen (Responsible  Materials  training),  Brioni  (My  Brioni  app)  and Boucheron.  Kering  Eyewear  has  also  developed  a  guide  for  its retail  teams  in  order  to  respond  to  consumer  requests  as effectively  as  possible,  including  details  about  the  sustainable materials used in its products.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Houses  have  developed  initiatives  for  their customers and the general public:\n\n- \u00b7 Gucci, Boucheron, Saint Laurent, Pomellato, Brioni, Balenciaga,  Bottega  Veneta,  Alexander  McQueen  or  Kering Eyewear communicate on sustainability matters via dedicated apps, their websites or social media;\n- \u00b7 Boucheron's  second  impact  report  and  Gucci's  third  were published in 2023.\n\nKering  has  held  discussions  with  various  department  store landloards  (particularly  in  Asia)  regarding  the  criteria  for  a product to be classed as sustainable, in order to guide customers.\n\n## Measuring the footprint of products\n\nKering takes part in methodological work regarding environmental  labeling  to  consumers,  particularly  via  the  work done by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la Haute Couture et de la Mode (FHCM) as  part  of  the  European  PEF  (Product  Environmental  Footprint) project and the French Anti-Waste and Circular Economy (AGEC) Law. In 2022, preparations for the implementation of article 13 of AGEC law included developing a data collection system in order to display environmental information to consumers at the time of purchase. The information displayed relates to matters such as the recycled content of products and packaging, their recyclability and the traceability of materials. In 2023, only Gucci and Balenciaga were concerned by this regulation in relation to their  products,  while  Saint  Laurent,  Alexander  McQueen  and Bottega Veneta will be concerned in 2024.\n\nIn  2023,  Bottega  Veneta  continued  using  its  Green  Atelier,  an integrated system for monitoring the sustainability performance of its materials and suppliers, and therefore of its products. The system  allows  the  House  to  assess  all  ready-to-wear,  leather goods  and  shoes  collections  across  five  criteria:  traceability  of materials, compliance with sustainability standards, environmental  impact,  social  performance  and  the  quality  of suppliers'  chemical  management  processes.  The  Green  Atelier uses a number of interfaces that allow results to be shared widely in-house,  including  an  app  installed  on  the  phones  of  Bottega Veneta's  employees,  which  shows  each  product's  performance and strengths.\n\n## 6.1.2  Green fashion shows: rethinking fashion shows and managing event footprints\n\nFashion  shows  are  a  unique  opportunity  to  raise  awareness about  sustainability  and  to  mobilize  all  the  parties  involved  in organizing  a  fashion  show  (brands,  model  agencies,  event organizers, media, etc.) around this important topic.\n\nSince  2019,  all  of  the  Houses  that  hold  fashion  shows  (Gucci, Balenciaga,  Saint  Laurent,  Alexander  McQueen  and  Bottega Veneta)  have  followed  Kering's  Green  Fashion  Shows  internal guidelines  on  minimizing  the  environmental  impact  of  shows, while  allowing  the  creative  directors  to  express  their  artistic potential. The  topics covered  by  the  guidelines  include governance, stakeholder relations, energy and waste management,  elimination  of  single-use  plastics,  catering  and transportation.  The  associated  specifications  cover  the  before, during  and  after  phases  of  each  event.  Since  2020,  the  safety department  has  carried  out  procedures  to  check  that  the guidelines  are  applied  in  each  show.  These  procedures  were reinforced in 2022.",

Partnerships  are  also formed with various local nonprofits and organizations to collect and redistribute materials (at the Group level with La R\u00e9serve des Arts), as well as equipment and leftover food. For example:\n\n- \u00b7 Gucci  obtained  ISO  20121  certification  for  its  advertising campaigns  and  shows,  both  physical  and  virtual.  The ISO  20121  standard  examines  environmental,  social  and economic factors to determine whether an event can qualify as  sustainable,  and  Gucci's  compliance  was  verified  by Bureau  Veritas.  In  addition  to  the  Group's  guidelines,  Gucci applies  its  own  standards  -  the  Gucci  Guidelines  for Sustainable  Events  -  to  all  its  events.  The  House  also measures the environmental impact of all its shows, verified by an independent third-party organization;\n- \u00b7 For  all  of  Balenciaga's  shows,  the  House  works  with  an ISO  20121-certified  agency  that  is  involved  in  all  stages  of organization  (installation,  management  of  the  show  itself, supplier relations, disassembly, etc.). In 2023, Balenciaga also continued  working  with  NGO  Up2Green  Reforestation  and supported two projects: one based in the Indian province of Gujarat to offset emissions related to its physical shows and one  based  in  Senegal  to  promote  the  use  of  green  energy (production of biochar) to combat deforestation and climate change.\n\nIn 2022, in a circular approach, Kering formed a partnership with M.E.TA, an Italian organization that upcycles business materials, to  create  guidelines  and  share  best  practice  regarding  the  ecodesign  of  fashion  shows.  The  partnership  is  also  creating  a traceability  system  for  materials  along  with  the  performance\n\nindicators needed to ensure circularity as regards the sets used in shows. In 2023, Gucci sent M.E.TA 26 tons of materials as part of their collaboration as well as 19 tons to La R\u00e9serve des Arts , for a total  of  103  tons  since  2021.  Kering  also  takes  part  in  working groups on this topic, set up by fashion industry associations and nonprofit organization Paris Good Fashion.\n\n## 6.1.3  Product compliance and consumer health and safety\n\nKering is committed to helping raise awareness of sustainability issues  among  consumers,  while  ensuring  that  its  products respect both their health and the environment.\n\nTo  enable  customers  to  enjoy  the  products  developed  by  the Houses safely, Kering has defined a set of quality and compliance control  procedures  that  comply  with  the  strictest  international consumer  health,  safety  and  environmental  standards  and regulations, such as REACH, US CPSIA, China GB Standards and Japan  Industrial  Standards  (JIS).  The  Product  Compliance Advisory  department  aims  to  pool  services,  for  the  purpose  of advising  and  supporting  the  Houses  on  product  development and the various stages of production, including product testing protocols  to  ensure  that  products  comply  with  the  local characteristics  of  each  market.  The  department  publishes  the Product  Restricted  Substance  List  (PRSL)  and  Product  Safety Requirements,  an  internal  document  listing  substances  to  be removed  and  thresholds  not  to  be  exceeded,  as  well  as requirements in terms of product safety. To take into account the pace  of  technological  development  and  progress  in  chemical research, the PRSL is updated at least once a year. In particular, it has specific modules for products intended for children in terms of  managing  chemical  substances  and  safety.  Specific  training sessions are provided each year.\n\n## Focus on: the Test & Innovation Lab (TIL)\n\nThe  Test  &  Innovation  Lab  (TIL),  acquired  by  Kering  in  2021,  is  based  in  Prato  (Italy)  and  has  obtained  ISO/IEC  17025 accreditation from Accredia. It helps the Group's Houses (as well as external clients) with their testing activities (250,000 tests performed in 2023) and various sustainability-related projects. The TIL is also  involved  in  various  problem-solving,  R&D  and analysis activities.\n\nIn  2023,  the  TIL  received  CPSC  (Consumer  Product  Safety  Commission)  accreditation  for  the  United  States  as  well  as  ZDHC certification relating to its use of chemicals.\n\nIn  2023,  the  TIL  developed  its  skills  by  integrating  a  new  Robotics  department  in  order  to  test  the  sustainability  of  finished products and their components, and acquired new equipment for identifying PFAs and tracing the origin of textile and leather materials based on forensic analysis.\n\nIn 2023, the Product Compliance  Advisory department continued its activities with the following aims:\n\n- 1. strengthen  compliance  controls:  regular  audits  of  product compliance  were  conducted  at  the  warehouse  level together with the Houses  to  detect  potential  noncompliance. Relations with laboratories accredited to carry out tests and measurements were maintained to cover the growing  number  of  non-core  products  (food  contact materials, toys, electrical/electronic devices);\n\n- 2. improve knowledge-sharing on product compliance processes: training programs have been strengthened and extended  to  all  key  departments  (product  development, production, quality and purchasing), from raw materials to production  (leather,  fabric  and  metal  accessories)  and testing. In 2023, around 15 training sessions on production processes, compliance requirements and related tests and checks  were  organized,  attended  by  over  450  employees. The  department  also  adopted  specific  guidelines  covering the most important subjects regarding product compliance;",

        "page_content": "- 3. support  the  product  development  teams:  in  collaboration with  the  Chinese  authorities,  company-specific  product standards have been established for Kering's Houses. These standards  relate  particularly  to  handbags,  wallets,  shoes and  belts,  and  set  out  chemicals-related  requirements  for non-regulated product categories. They make it possible to develop  pieces  that  meet  all  requirements  in  terms  of health,  safety  and  compliance,  while  leaving  the  Houses' creative teams significant scope to follow their inspiration.\n\nKering's Customs & Trade Compliance department is tasked with optimizing  the  Houses'  global  distribution  flows  from  the regulatory  and  procedural  perspective  around  the  world.  This activity  consists  mainly  of  analyzing  requirements  and  laws relating to customs and compliance in destination countries for new  products  and  projects,  working  with  local  logistics  teams and external experts if need be. By working with the Customs & Trade  Compliance  department  from  the  early  stages  of development,  Houses  can  prevent  risks,  penalties  and  delays, and  ensure  that  the  distribution  chain  is  fully  compliant.  Once requirements  have  been  defined,  the  Customs  &  Trade Compliance  department  is  tasked  with  pulling  together  and sharing product-related information and  documents  with regional  logistics  teams,  brokers  and  clients;  checking  the consistency  of  product's  master  data  managed  by  the  Houses'\n\nproduction  departments  and  taking  steps  to  correct  potential errors;  managing  product  certifications  and  supplier  audits  by following the standards established by international certification authorities; and implementing appropriate compliance procedures, often by directing other Group entities. In 2023, the department dealt with almost 40,000 internal requests.\n\nThe Group also has a Multi Brand After Sales department, a single point  of  contact  for  all  the  Houses  that  deals  with  quality assurance for products after they have been sold, in accordance with  House  standards  as  regards  Value-Added  Services  (VASs). The department also implements and manages activities related to product returns from stores to the Group's distribution centers and warehouses. Activities include repair management, product checks,  on-demand  audits,  re-labeling  and  the  hallmarking process for jewelry.\n\nSome Houses also carry out specific actions related to regulatory compliance  in  respect  of  hazardous  substances  and  the implementation  of  the  PRSL  and  MRSL  (see  section  5.3.3.3). Houses including  Boucheron,  Pomellato  and  Dodo,  also  ensure that  their  products  conform  to  the  REACH  regulation.  Lastly, Kering  Eyewear  uses  accredited  laboratories  with  specific expertise in eyewear for its compliance checks.\n\n## 6.2 Involving our ecosystem in creating tomorrow's Luxury\n\n## 6.2.1  Positive community impact and preservation of know-how\n\nConscious  of  its  responsibility  to  future  generations,  Kering  is continuing  its  policy  of  academic  partnerships  with  design schools, business schools and universities worldwide. The aim is to  raise  awareness  and  train  designers  and  future  fashion industry  leaders  regarding  the  major  social  and  environmental challenges  they  will  face.  Details  of  the  main  partnerships  are provided in section 3.1.2.\n\nIn  addition,  and  in  order  to  ensure  that  top-level  expertise  is maintained  and  promoted  within  their  business  activities, certain  Houses  are  developing  dedicated  training  centers  and local partnerships. These professional bodies help to ensure the preservation  of  some  very  demanding  and  unique  skills,  and support  long-term  employment  in  the  regions  where  these crafts originated. To date, more than 4,000 people have taken part  in  these  programs  and  training  courses  delivered  by  the Group and its Houses such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Gucci  and  its  Gucci  ArtLab  center  of  excellence  for  leather goods  and  shoes  (1,470  participants  in  2023)  as  well  as  its collaboration with Instituto Secoli , sewing school (18 participants in 2023);\n- \u00b7 Saint  Laurent  and  the  Saint  Laurent  Couture  Institute  for ready-to-wear apparel (104 participants in 2023);\n- \u00b7 Bottega Veneta's Accademia  Labor  et  Ingenium ,  launched  in 2023, to preserve its know-how and creativity and strengthen its  commitment  to  craftsmanship.  This  school  allows  new Bottega Veneta employees and students to learn from master artisans  via  training  sessions,  workshops  and  courses (40  participants  in  2023).  The  program  also  offers  upskilling and reskilling courses for the House's employees in order to preserve Italian craftsmanship;\n- \u00b7 Brioni  and  its  partnership  with  the Scuola  di  Alta  Sartoria (10 participants for the 2023 summer school);\n- \u00b7 Boucheron  and  its  partnership  with  the  Haute  \u00c9cole  de Joaillerie in France (50 participants in 2023);\n- \u00b7 Pomellato  and  its  partnership  with  the  Galdus  Goldsmith Academy, which trains future goldsmiths (122 participants in 2023).\n\nThe Houses support craft guilds and undertake local initiatives, for  example  Bottega  Veneta  with  its  Bottega  for  Bottegas program.  The  project  supports  and  celebrates  the  creativity  of Italian bottegas,  which  are  small  artisan  stores  that  sell handmade products.  For  the  second  consecutive  year,  Bottega Veneta has supported fourteen bottegas from around the world whose products are inspired by Italian culture, from a Shanghaibased pasta maker to a Vermont carpenter.\n\nFinally, in 2018, Brioni integrated the Arazzeria Pennese historic tapestry production site - one of Italy's most important tapestry centers - with its Montebello workshops in order to preserve this highly specific form of craftsmanship.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Bringing  together  more than 65 members representing more than one third of production volumes in the fashion and textile industry, The Fashion Pact now has considerable European and international influence, establishing  itself  as  the  leading  CEO-led  coalition  for  the sustainable transition of the fashion sector. Its practical actions, split  between  the  three  key  areas  of  climate,  oceans  and biodiversity, are driving positive impacts for the signatories. They cover  subjects  including  renewable  energy,  microplastics  and microfibers leakage, regenerative agriculture practices in sourcing  raw  materials  and  tools  for  calculating  biodiversity footprint.\n\nIn  2023,  The  Fashion  Pact  officially  launched  its  European Accelerator  project,  aimed  at  reducing  the  Scope  3  greenhouse gas  emissions  of  textile  producers  that  have  a  supply  chain  in Italy.  The  project  aims  to  fund  the  environmental  transition  of suppliers,  allowing  them  to  invest  in  new  equipment  that  will save water and energy and reduce their use of chemicals.\n\n## 6.2.2.2  Watch & Jewellery Initiative 2030\n\nKering and Cartier are the co-founders of the Watch & Jewellery Initiative 2030. The initiative was launched in 2022 and its main aim  is  to  establish  a  sustainable  supply  chain  for  watches  and jewelry.  The  coalition  had  55  members  at  the  end  of  2023, ranging from brands to suppliers and focuses on three key areas: increasing climate resilience, preserving resources and fostering inclusion. By encouraging suppliers to make strong commitments to these objectives, Kering aims to steer the whole industry toward a sustainable transformation.\n\n## 6.2.2.3  Mobilizing the whole of civil society\n\nKering  and  its  Houses  support  and  take  part  in  numerous  events  and  forums  focused  on  sustainability.  Through  these  events  and speeches,  the  Group  regularly  shares  Kering's  vision  and  strategy  with  future  generations,  helps  to  raise  public  awareness  about sustainability issues and aims to mobilize the whole of civil society to address these themes.

In  2008,  based  on  its  belief  that  companies  have  a  vital  role  to play  in  addressing  this  issue  alongside  public  authorities  and NGOs,  Kering  launched  its  corporate  foundation  dedicated  to combating  violence  against  women.  Since  its  creation,  the foundation  has  received  and  endowment  of  \u20ac20  million  from Kering.\n\nWhen the foundation's third term came to an end in August 2023, 15  years  after  its  creation,  the  Kering  Foundation  changed  its status to an endowment fund, in order to amplify its commitment and  make  it  easier  for  the  Foundation  to  work  with  Kering's\n\nHouses,  other  companies  and  other  foundations,  as  well  as  to raise funds.  In  addition,  the  Group  extended  the  Kering Foundation's commitment to include combating violence against children, and particularly incest, which affects all cultures and all social classes. Since 2019, the Kering Foundation has worked on the intersection of violence against both women and children by joining forces with various initiatives. For example, it supported a new  unit  dedicated  to  caring  for  women  incest  survivors  at La Maison des femmes in Saint-Denis, working with Face \u00e0 l'Inceste .\n\nTo break the cycle of violence that is passed on from generation to  generation,  the  Kering  Foundation  now  works  to  combat violence from the earliest age with the following strategy:\n\n- \u00b7 supporting  partner  organizations  to  ramp  up  grass-roots initiatives  (appropriate  care  for  victims  and  survivors  and prevention work);\n- \u00b7 engaging  Kering's  ecosystem  to  create  safe  and  supportive workplaces;\n- \u00b7 influencing  new  audiences  and  mobilizing  others  to  take action alongside Kering.\n\n## Focus: the annual Caring for Women dinner\n\nIn 2023, the Kering Foundation organized its second annual fundraising dinner entitled Caring for Women . The event took place on  September  12  in  New  York  with  the  support  of  Kering's  Houses.  It  raised  over  $3  million  and  benefited  three  nonprofit organizations:  the National  Network  to  End  Domestic  Violence (NNEDV),  the  N ew  York  City  Alliance  Against  Sexual  Assault (NYCAASA) and the Malala Fund . The funds raised will finance: a microcredit program for victims of domestic violence, initiatives to prevent sexual violence against young people at risk, and Afghan nonprofits offering alternative learning opportunities to girls in regions where their education is under threat.\n\nIn 2023, the Kering Foundation's main actions were as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->",

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.\n\n## To the Shareholders' Meeting,\n\nIn our capacity as Statutory Auditor of Kering (hereinafter the \"Company\"), appointed as independent third party (\"third party\") and accredited by the French Accreditation Committee COFRAC under number 3-1886 (Cofrac Inspection Accreditation, scope available at www.cofrac.fr), we have conducted procedures to express a limited assurance conclusion on the historical information (observed or extrapolated)  in  the  consolidated  non-financial  performance  statement,  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Company's  procedures (hereinafter the \"Guidelines\"), for the year ended December 31, 2023 (hereinafter the \"Information\" and the \"Statement\", respectively), presented  in  the  Group  management  report  pursuant  to  the  legal  and  regulatory  provisions  of  Articles  L.225-102-1,  R.225-105  and R.225-105 and R.225-105-1of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\nIt is also our responsibility to express, at the request of the Company and outside the scope of accreditation, a conclusion of reasonable assurance regarding whether certain information selected by the Company and presented in the Declaration has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\n## Conclusion of limited assurance on the consolidated non-financial performance statement in accordance with article L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce )\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed as described in the section \"Nature and scope of procedures\" and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the non-financial statement is not prepared in accordance with the applicable regulatory provisions and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not fairly presented in accordance with the Guidelines, in all material respects.\n\n## Conclusion of reasonable assurance on selected information included in the Statement\n\nIn our opinion, the information selected by the Company has been prepared fairly, in all material aspects, in accordance with the Guidelines:\n\n- \u00b7 energy consumption and associated CO2e emissions for 2023;\n- \u00b7 renewable electricity proportion at Group level for 2023;\n- \u00b7 GHG emissions associated with upstream transportation for 2023;\n- \u00b7 tons of CO2e offset for 2023.\n\n## Preparation of the statement\n\nThe  absence  of  a  generally  accepted  and  commonly  used  reference  framework  or  established  practices  on  which  to  base  the assessment and measurement of the Information enables the use of different but acceptable measurement techniques that may impact comparability between entities and over time.\n\nAccordingly, the Information must be read and interpreted with reference to the Guidelines, available on the Company's website.\n\n## Limits inherent in the preparation of the Information\n\nAs  stated  in  the  methodological  notes  of  the  Statement,  the  Information  may  be  subject  to  uncertainties  inherent  to  the  state  of scientific or economic knowledge and the quality of external data used. Some information are sensitive to the methodological choices, assumptions,  and/or  estimates  made  for  its  preparation,  as  presented  in  the  methodological  notes  referenced  in  section  1.4  of chapter 4 of the Statement.",

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the Executive Management,\n\nPursuant to your request and in our capacity as Statutory Auditor of Kering (hereinafter the \"Company\"), we performed a review with the aim of providing limited assurance on information concerning the Environmental Profit & Loss Account (\"EP&L\") selected by the Company (hereinafter \"the Information\") for financial year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed as described under the paragraph \"Nature and scope of procedures\", and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Information is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria and procedures used by the Company (hereinafter \"the Guidelines\").\n\n## Preparation of the Information\n\nThe  absence  of  a  generally  accepted  and  commonly  used  reference  framework  or  established  practices  on  which  to  base  the assessment and measurement of the Information enables the use of different but acceptable measurement techniques that may impact comparability between entities and over time.\n\nAccordingly,  the  Information  must  be  read  and  interpreted  with  reference  to  the  Guidelines  and  criteria,  summarised  in  the environmental methodological note referred  in  chapter  4,  section  1.4  of  the  Universal  Registration  Document  and  available  on  the Company's website or on request from its headquarter Sustainable Finance Department.\n\n## Limits inherent in the preparation of the Information\n\nThe Information may be subject to uncertainty inherent to the state of scientific and economic knowledge and the quality of external data  used,  including  certain  elements  such  as  traceability  and  certifications,  environmental  impact  factors  (\"multipliers\")  and monetisation factors used. Some data are sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions and/or estimates used for its preparation and presented in the methodological note referred in chapter 5 section 1.4 of the Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Responsibility of the Company\n\nThe Company is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 selecting or establishing suitable criteria and procedures for preparing the Guidelines;\n- \u00b7 preparing the Information in accordance with the Guidelines;\n- \u00b7 designing, implementing and maintaining internal control over information relevant to the preparation of Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Responsibility of the Statutory Auditor\n\nThe conclusion presented in this assurance report only covers the Information.\n\nBased on our work, we are responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 expressing limited assurance on the fact that nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Information is not  prepared,  in  all  material  respects,  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  and  procedures  used  by  the  Company  (hereinafter  \"the Guidelines\"), whether due to fraud or error;\n- \u00b7 forming an independent conclusion, based on the evidence we have obtained; and\n- \u00b7 reporting our conclusion to the management of the Company.\n\nAs  we  are  engaged  to  form  an  independent  conclusion  on  the  information  prepared  by  management,  we  are  not  permitted  to  be involved in the preparation of the Information, as doing so may compromise our independence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

To assist us  in  conducting  our  work,  we  referred  to  our  corporate  social  responsibility  and  sustainable  development  experts.  We  conducted around ten interviews with people responsible for preparing the Information, including representatives from the sustainable finance department.\n\nThis  work  involved  the  use  of  information  and  communication  technologies  allowing  the  work  and  interviews  to  be  carried  out remotely, without hindering the good execution of the verification process.\n\n## Independence and quality control\n\nOur independence is defined by article L. 821-28 of the French Commercial Code and French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de d\u00e9ontologie). In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, ethical requirements and the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) relating to this engagement.\n\n## Nature and scope of procedures\n\nWe planned and performed our work in order to express a limited assurance regarding the following Information:\n\n- \u00b7 total amount for environmental impact estimated in \u20ac for 2023;\n- \u00b7 intensity (\u20acEP&L/1,000\u20ac of revenue) for 2023;\n- \u00b7 mapping of 2023 impacts per environmental impact (6 impacts for Tiers 0 to 4 and for the use and end of life phases);\n- \u00b7 distribution of impacts per raw material (Tiers 3 & 4) for 2023.\n\nThe nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend on professional judgment, including the assessment of risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, in the Information.\n\n## We:\n\n- \u00b7 assessed  the  suitability  of  the  Guidelines  with  respect  to  their  relevance,  completeness,  reliability,  neutrality  and understandability;\n- \u00b7 verified the set-up of a process to collect, compile, process, and check the completeness and consistency of the Information;\n- \u00b7 interviewed the relevant staff from the Company's departments at its headquarters and for a selection of contributing entities in order to analyze the deployment and application of the Guidelines;\n- \u00b7 performed analytical procedures on the Information and verified, the calculations as well as the consolidation of the data and the consistency of its evolution;\n- \u00b7 carried  out  tests  of  details  using  sampling  techniques,  for  a  representative  selection  of  entities  that  we  selected  to  verify  the correct application of the definitions and procedures and reconcile data with supporting evidence.\n\nWe consider that the evidence obtained are sufficient and appropriate to enable to express our conclusion. The procedures conducted in a limited assurance review are substantially less in extent than those required to issue a reasonable assurance opinion in accordance with  the  professional  guidelines  of  the  French  National  Institute  of  Statutory  Auditors  ( Compagnie  nationale  des  Commissaires  aux Comptes ); a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.\n\n## Applicable law\n\nIn our capacity of Statutory Auditor of Kering, our responsibility towards Kering and its shareholders is defined by French law and we do not accept any extension of our responsibility beyond that provided for by French law. We are not liable and accept no liability to any third party. We cannot be held responsible for any damage, loss, cost or expense resulting from fraudulent behavior or fraud committed by directors, officers, employees or stakeholders of Kering or its subsidiaries.\n\nThis report is governed by French law. The French courts have exclusive competence to receive any dispute, claim or dispute that may arise from our engagement letter or this report, or any question relating thereto.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, February 29, 2024 One of the Statutory Auditors,\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s\n\nB\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Margerin\n\nAssoci\u00e9e, Audit\n\nJulien Rivals\n\nAssoci\u00e9, D\u00e9veloppement Durable",

It  also  takes  into  account  of  the  requirements  set  out  in\n\narticle 173 of French law n o 2015-992 of August 17, 2015 on energy transition for sustainable development.\n\nThe AMF's framework is based not only on the aforementioned French  and  EU  legislation  and  regulations,  but  also  on  internal control  and  risk  management  best  practices  and  international standards, in particular the ISO 31000 and COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations) frameworks.\n\n## 1.1 Scope and principles of organization\n\nKering is the parent company of the Kering Group, whose entities operate  in  the  Luxury  industry.  The  following  report  aims  to describe the internal control process in place at the Group and especially  for  the  preparation  and  processing  of  financial  and accounting information. The scope of the Group covered by the report  includes  all  fully  consolidated  subsidiaries,  i.e.,  the companies over which the Group directly or indirectly exercises exclusive control.\n\nAs  a  holding  company,  Kering's  own  operations  consist  in:  (i) defining  and  implementing  its  strategy,  (ii)  organizing  and managing  its  holdings,  (iii)  stimulating  the  development  of  its activities and coordinating their financing, (iv) providing support\n\nand communication functions, and (v) defining and implementing the insurance coverage policy.\n\nThe structure of the internal control process is aligned with the general organization of the Group. It is both:\n\n- \u00b7 decentralized  at  the  level  of  the  activities:  Executive Management of the operating and legal entities is responsible for managing and coordinating the internal control process;\n- \u00b7 unified  around  a  common  methodology  and  a  single  set  of standards.  The  Kering  holding  company  coordinates  its deployment across the Group, supported by teams at Kering Asia-Pacific and Kering Americas.\n\n## 1.2 General principles of risk management\n\nAccording  to  the  AMF  definition,  risks  represent  the  possibility that  an  event  may  occur  and  could  have  an  impact  on  people, assets,  the  environment,  the  Company's  objectives  or  its reputation.\n\nRisk  management  covers  area  that  are  much  wider  than  just financial risks: for example, operational, labor-related, environmental and compliance risk.\n\nRisk management is a key management tool that helps to:\n\n- \u00b7 create  and  preserve  the  value,  assets  and  reputation  of  the Company;\n- \u00b7 strengthen  the  security  of  the  Company's  decision-making and  other  processes  to  support  the  achievement  of  its objectives;\n- \u00b7 mitigate  the  risk  of  unexpected  outcomes  and  operating losses;\n- \u00b7 ensure  that  initiatives  are  consistent  with  the  Company's values;\n- \u00b7 bring Company employees together to develop a shared view of the main risks.",

        "page_content": "## 1.3 Components of risk management\n\nThe Group constantly strives to make its operations more secure and  improve  its  methodology  to  identify  and  mitigate  risks.  In 2023,  the  Group  pushed  ahead  with  the  changes  to  its  risk management methodology initiated in 2011 and maintained the resources  used  for  its  risk  management  process.  The  Group's process  provides  for  an  organizational  framework,  a  three-step risk management process and continuous monitoring.\n\n## 1.3.1 Organizational framework\n\nThis organizational framework includes:\n\n- \u00b7 an organization that sets out the roles and responsibilities of the  various  participants  and  lays  down  procedures  and standards for the process;\n- \u00b7 a risk management policy that sets out the objectives of the process  in  line  with  the  Company's  culture,  the  common terminology applied, and the process to identify, analyze and deal with risks;\n- \u00b7 an  IT  system  that  makes  it  possible  to  register  data  about risks;\n- \u00b7 planned  reporting  of  risk  information  to  stakeholders identified within the Group, as well as an annual presentation to the Board of Directors.\n\n## Risk Committee\n\nWithin the scope of the Group's risk management policy and in accordance with Kering's corporate governance, Kering's Executive Management created a \"Kering Group Risk Committee\" in 2011. The Deputy CEO in charge of Operations and Finance, the Chief  Financial  Officer,  the  General  Counsel,  the  Chief  Audit Executive,  the  Head  of  the  Security  Department,  the  Chief Information  Security  Officer  and  the  Risk  Manager  are  the members  of  this  Committee.  As  the  Group's  operations  and activities expand, become more complex and more international, the  Risk  Committee  helps  identify  and  rank  the  main  risks  that could  have  an  impact  on  the  Group's  business  operations. Internal  rules  determine  how  the  Committee  is  managed,  and how it operates.\n\nThe  Risk  Committee  reviews  (i)  the  validation  and  monitoring process  for  the  Group's  risk  management  policy;  (ii)  the monitoring of the latest developments and relevance of analysis relating  to  operational,  labor-related,  environmental,  financial and compliance risks; (iii) briefings on the analysis of general and specific  risks;  and  (iv)  the  validation  and  monitoring  of  action plans rolled out to mitigate the risks identified more effectively.\n\nThe  Risk  Committee's  work  is  brought  to  the  attention  of  the Audit Committee, which is informed of the Committee's internal rules and has access to the minutes of its meetings.\n\n## Risk Manager\n\nThe  Risk  Manager  position  was  created  within  the  Company  to coordinate the robust risk management process, ensure that the Executive  Management  teams  of  the  Group's  activities  analyze the  main  risks  within  their  scope  of  business,  and  provide  the members of the Risk Committee, prior to each meeting, with the information  and  documents  necessary  for  their  work  and  their discussions.\n\n## Risk management policy\n\nAfter reviewing  the  COSO  internal  control  frameworks  in particular, the Group implemented a risk management approach that was sent to the Executive Management teams of the Group and the Houses. This document describes the methods used by the Group for its risk analysis.\n\n## 1.3.2 A three-step risk management process involving:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk  identification  by  the  Internal  Audit  Department: in this  step,  the  main  risks  are  identified  and  addressed centrally.  A  risk  is  characterized  by  an  event,  one  or  more internal or external sources, and one or more consequences. Within  the  Group,  risks  are  identified  as  part  of  an  ongoing process that takes the Houses' perspective into account, as well as the Group's broader vision, including insights from the Sustainability  Department  helping  to  identify  sustainability risks. During this step, interviews with the main stakeholders (the  recommended  and  most  widely  used  technique)  are conducted to identify the risks that could impact the Group's ability  to  achieve  its  objectives.  Kering  relies  on  the  prior year's risk registers, as well as various sources that are, both external  (e.g.,  surveys)  and  internal  (e.g.,  reporting  of information).\n- \u00b7 Risk  analysis: this  step  involves  evaluating  the  main  risks identified  on  the  basis  of  three  criteria:  their  impact,  their probability of occurrence and their level of control. It is also a continuous  effort,  and  assessments  are  conducted  once  a year  during  work  sessions  with  key  managers  from  the Houses, Kering's  divisions  in  the  Americas,  Asia-Pacific,  and the  Group.  The  risk  management  policy  describes  in  detail the criteria and procedures for these assessments.\n- \u00b7 Risk  ranking: during  this  last  step,  risks  are  ranked  by priority  and  the  most  appropriate  action  plan(s)  for  the Company is (are) identified.",

In addition, risk information is also shared with each of the Houses during feedback meetings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.3.3 Oversight of the risk management process\n\nThe  risk  management  process  is  monitored  and  reviewed  on  a regular basis to continuously improve the process. The objective is to identify and analyze the main risks and to learn the lessons from the risks that have materialized.\n\nThe  Risk  Committee  meets  in  principle  at  least  twice  a  year  to review  the  risk  maps  drawn  up  by  the  Group  Internal  Audit Department, and to monitor the progress of the  specific  action plans.\n\nThe  Risk  Committee  met  three  times  in  2023.

Risks  are  managed  and  addressed through action plans, which may include project management  and  may  also  involve  implementing  controls that can be adapted to the organization. The controls to be implemented are part of the internal control process and may be reviewed based on the risk maps;\n\n- \u00b7 the  internal  control  process  uses  the  risk  management process to identify the main risks to be mitigated;\n- \u00b7 the audit plan uses the risk map to test the assessment of the level of control of the identified risks.\n\nThe  combined  interaction  and  balance  between  the  two processes  are  influenced  by  the  control  environment,  which provides a common foundation particularly the risk and control culture of the Company and the ethical values of the Group.",

        "page_content": "Operationally, the internal control process is as follows:\n\nThe internal control culture is set by Top Management/Executive Management (\"tone at the top\")\n\nEvery year, internal control selfassessment campaigns are organized targeting Group entities and stores\n\nRoll-out of the internal control process\n\n- \u00b7 The Group lays down the internal control policies and procedures for the Houses to implement in a suitable manner. The Houses remain in charge of drawing up their own internal control policies and procedures.\n- \u00b7 The Houses' top management has ultimate responsibility for the effective conduct of their activities.\n\nSelf-assessment of the internal control process\n\nIndependent internal control assessment during assignments\n\n- \u00b7 Everyone has a role to play in internal control. Audit engagements do not provide assurance of the effectiveness of internal control right across the entire scope of the Group's entities every year.\n- Accordingly, the Internal Audit and Risk Department has made use of selfassessment questionnaires since 2012. These activities are coordinated by the Group's Internal Audit and Risk Management Department.\n- \u00b7 Respondents carry out a selfassessment of their internal control process and communicate the results to the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7 The completion rate was 84% for Group entities and 96.4% for stores in 2023.\n- \u00b7 The internal audits conducted by the Internal Audit and Risk Department provide a level of assurance of the internal control process in place at Group entities and stores.\n- \u00b7 To this end, the Group's auditors independently assess the internal control process in place at the entities.\n- \u00b7 Assignments are laid down in an annual audit plan approved in advance by the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7 In 2023, the Group's Internal Audit Department conducted 38 audit assignments at the Group's entities (five focused on IT operations) and 151 in stores.\n\nThe Group seeks to strengthen its business processes through a continuous improvement approach. As well as analyzing feedback, it defines action plans based on internal control self-assessment campaigns and on recommendations made in internal audit reports.\n\n## 1.5 General principles of internal control\n\n## 1.5.1 Definition of internal control\n\nThe internal control process applicable within the Kering Group relies  on  a  set  of  resources,  policies,  conduct,  procedures  and appropriate actions to ensure that the necessary measures are taken in order to control:\n\n- \u00b7 activities,  operational  effectiveness  and  the  efficient  use  of resources;\n- \u00b7 operational, labor-related, environmental, financial or compliance risks that could have a significant impact on the Company's assets or the achievement of its objectives.\n\nInternal control is defined as a process conducted by Executive Management, under the supervision of the Board of Directors, and  implemented  by  senior  executives  and  all  employees. Regardless of its quality and its degree of application, it cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives falling within the following categories will be met:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance with laws and regulations in force;\n- \u00b7 application  of  guidelines  and  directions  set  by  Executive Management;\n- \u00b7 smooth  operation  of  internal  processes,  particularly  those contributing to the safeguarding of assets;\n- \u00b7 reliability of financial and accounting information.\n\n## 1.5.2 Limitations of internal control\n\nThe  probability  of  meeting  these  objectives  is  subject  to  the limitations inherent in any internal control process such as:\n\n- \u00b7 human errors or malfunctions occurring when decisions are made or applied;\n- \u00b7 deliberate  collusion  among  multiple  individuals,  enabling them to elude the control system;\n- \u00b7 situations  in  which  implementing  or  maintaining  a  control would be more expensive than the risk that it is intended to remedy.\n\nFurthermore,  in  pursuing  the  objectives  indicated  above,  it  is understood  that companies  are  faced  with  events  and uncertainties  beyond  their  control  (unexpected  changes  in  the markets,  competitive  environment  or  geopolitical  situation,  or error  in  forecasting  or  assessing  the  effects  of  such  changes  on the organization, etc.).\n\nInternal  control  cannot  therefore  provide  absolute  assurance under  all  circumstances  that  the  Company  will  achieve  its objectives.\n\nGroup entities and stores undergo internal audits",

It  includes  principles  and  values  governing  the conduct and ethics of all its employees, presented in the Code of Ethics.  It  also  includes  an  Internal  Control  Charter.  Moreover,  it relies  on  human  resources  management  that  ensures  the competency, ethical conduct and involvement of its employees.\n\n## The Group Charter\n\nThe Kering Group adopted a Charter several years ago, which was updated in 2012 and provides the framework  for the decentralization  of  the  organization  and  the  responsibility  of senior  executives.  The  Charter  defines  the  guiding  principles governing the relations between Kering and its activities. It also defines,  within  each  functional  area:  (i)  the  matters  that  fall within the delegated responsibility of the activities; (ii) those that must  be  communicated  to  Kering  within  appropriate  time frames; and (iii) those requiring Kering's prior authorization.\n\n## Code of Ethics\n\nThe ethical principles of the Kering Group are set out in the Code of  Ethics,  first  circulated  in  2005  and then updated in 2018. It is now available to all Group employees in 14 languages. The Ethics Committees  are  composed  of  representatives  of  the  Group's Houses  and  Kering  staff.  This  entire  structure  is  managed  by Kering's Chief Sustainability and Institutional Affairs Officer. The changes made to the Code and the organization of ethics within the  Group  are  examined  in  detail  in  section  2  \"Ethics,  the cornerstone of our business\" of chapter 4 \"Sustainability\" of this Document.\n\n## The Internal Control Charter\n\nThe  Kering  Group  first  adopted  an  Internal  Control  Charter  in 2010  and  then  updated  it  in  2015.  The  Charter  defines  internal control  and  sets  out  its  objectives  as  presented  in  the  AMF's reference framework. It specifies that the holding company acts as  the  fulcrum  point  coordinating  the  various  entities  and  sets out  the  responsibilities  of  each  of  the  activities  and  Houses  in implementing  an  internal  control  process  that  fits  their operations.\n\nThe  Charter  defines  the  role  of  each  person  involved  in  the internal control process and the bodies responsible for oversight and assessment.\n\nFurthermore, the Charter specifies the existing tools for assessing internal  control  and  risks,  namely  self-assessment  of  internal control, mapping of major risks and sets out the basic principles for creating new procedures.\n\n## The Audit Charter\n\nInternal  Audit's  operational  procedures  are  laid  down  in  the Audit Charter. A new version of the Audit Charter was published in 2018. The Charter stipulates that:\n\n- \u00b7 at the end of each audit, the findings and recommendations are  presented  to  the  managers  of  the  area  or  areas concerned;\n- \u00b7 any  agreements  or  disagreements  made  known  by  the audited  parties  concerning  the  proposed  recommendations are  included  in  the  final  report,  which  specifies  any  action plan,  as  well  as  responsibilities  and  the  deadlines  for implementation;\n- \u00b7 the operational staff members concerned are responsible for implementing recommendations;\n- \u00b7 the  Internal  Audit  Department  is  in  charge  of  verifying  their implementation.\n\n## Human resources policy\n\nThe quality of Human resources and management cohesiveness are key success factors for the Group.\n\nKering  makes  sure  that  the  various  Houses  apply  human resources  policies  aligned  with  their  situation,  challenges,  and meeting the highest local standards.\n\nThe  Houses  lead  and  engage  in  dialogue  and  employee involvement  at  local  level  concerning  labor  policy,  while  the Group manages dialogue within the Group's employee representative bodies namely the Group Works Council and the European Works Council.\n\nThe Group also supports the Houses with spotting talent for key positions and succession planning, while keeping a close eye on the market to enrich the pool of internal applicants.\n\nKering  supports  the  Houses  by  handling  transactional  HR activities  (payroll,  absence  management,  employee  benefit management) and provides a shared framework for developing Group-wide projects, such as digital platforms, HRIS and internal social  media  network,  talent  and  performance  management, internal communication for key issues linked to Kering's values, global  remuneration  and  employee  benefits  policies.  This framework  is  constantly  evolving  so  the  Houses  can  meet  the new challenges they are faced with.\n\nInternal  control  is  also  strengthened  by  the  centralization  of certain functions within Kering.",

It  also  formulates  Group policy and oversees its application. It provides the Houses with a methodology  for  identifying  standard  risks  enabling  them  to anticipate such risks and inform the Legal Department.\n\n## Tax Department\n\nThe  Tax  Department  coordinates  the  Group's  tax  policy  and advises and assists the activities on all issues related to tax law, as well as on the implementation of tax consolidation in France.\n\n## Communications Department\n\nThe  Communications  Department  is  involved  in  the  Group's development  by  enhancing  its  image  and  reputation  both internally and externally.\n\n## Information Systems Department\n\nThe Information Systems Department is responsible for providing optimal  operational  performance,  controlling  IT  risk  and improving the Group's information systems.\n\n## 1.6.2 Organization and resources\n\nThe organization of internal control depends on persons involved at  every  level  in  the  chain  of  responsibility,  from  Executive Management to all employees, as well as the bodies responsible for  oversight  and  assessment:  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  Audit Committee, the Internal Audit and Risk Management Department, and the Statutory Auditors. Together, this  forms  a model with three lines of defense. A summary of it is provided in section 9 of chapter 1.\n\n## 1.6.2.1  Participants in the control process\n\n## Executive Committee\n\nThe  Kering  Group  Executive  Committee,  which  is  an  Executive Management body, comprises 13 members as at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Executive Committee meets regularly in order to:\n\n- \u00b7 draw up and coordinate the Group's operating strategy;\n- \u00b7 set the priorities via objectives assigned to the activities and the main functional projects;\n- \u00b7 develop synergies between the Houses;\n- \u00b7 propose acquisitions and disposals to the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 ensure  proper  implementation  of  the  policies  and  projects defined within the framework of the Group's commitments to sustainability.\n\nKering Group strategies and goals are discussed each year via the medium-term plans and the budgets of the business units of each of its activities.\n\n## Executive Management teams\n\nThe  Executive  Management  teams  define,  coordinate  and oversee the Group's internal control process.\n\nThey  are  also  in  charge  of  taking  the  requisite  corrective measures. The Executive Management teams' involvement is of key importance to the internal control process given the Kering Group's organization.\n\n## Management and employees\n\nManagement  plays  the  leading  operational  role  in  internal control;  it  relies  on  internal  control  to  perform  its  duties  and reach its objectives. In this respect, management implements the internal  control  operations  related  to  its  area  of  responsibility and ensures that the internal control process fits its activities.\n\nEmployees must have the knowledge and information necessary to  set  up,  operate  and  oversee  the  internal  control  process  in order to meet the objectives assigned to them. In their day-to-day activities,  they  follow  the  principles,  rules  of  control  and  can suggest ways to improve and detect malfunctions.\n\n## 1.6.2.2  Bodies responsible for oversight and assessment\n\nThe bodies responsible for oversight and assessment are:\n\n## The Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  contributes  to  the  overall  control environment  through  its  members'  skills  and  expertise.  The Board  is  regularly  informed  about  the  methodologies  used  for internal  control  and  the  management  of  major  risks,  which  it presents in its Board report. The duties of the Board of Directors are presented in section 3.1 of chapter 3 of this Document.\n\n## The Audit Committee\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  Kering's  Audit  Committee  had  five members,  three  of  whom  were  independent.  Tidjane  Thiam (Chair  of  the  Audit  Committee)  left  the  Board  of  Directors  on January  9,  2024.  The  Committee  has  since  had  four  members (Jean-Pierre Denis, Interim Chair), Financi\u00e8re Pinault, represented  by  H\u00e9lo\u00efse  Temple-Boyer,  Serge  Weinberg  and V\u00e9ronique  Weill.  Under  the  responsibility  of  the  Board  of Directors  to  which  it  reports  on  a  regular  basis,  the  Audit Committee is in charge of monitoring:\n\n- \u00b7 the procedures for preparing financial information;\n- \u00b7 the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  and  risk  management systems;\n- \u00b7 the  statutory  audits  of  annual  financial  statements  and, where  appropriate,  of  consolidated  financial  statements performed by the Statutory Auditors;\n- \u00b7 the independence of the Statutory Auditors.\n\nThe Kering Audit Committee also:\n\n- \u00b7 verifies that the Group has an Internal Audit Department that is  structured  and  well  suited  to  the  tasks  of  identifying, detecting and preventing risks, anomalies or irregularities in the management of the Group's affairs;\n- \u00b7 assesses  the  relevance  and  quality  of  the  methods  and procedures used;\n- \u00b7 reviews the Internal Audit reports and the recommendations issued;\n- \u00b7 approves the annual Internal Audit plan;\n- \u00b7 reviews the work conducted by the Risk Committee and has access to the minutes of its meetings.\n\nSince 2021, Kering's Audit Committee has met at least five times a year.\n\nThe  composition  of  the  Audit  Committee  and  its  duties  are presented in section 3.4.2 of chapter 3 of this Document.",

Its principal duties are:\n\n- \u00b7 leading  and  coordinating  risk  management  through  risk mapping and action plan monitoring among other activities. The Chief Audit Executive informs Executive Management and reports to the Audit Committee on the main results of their assessments and on action plan monitoring at least once a year;\n- \u00b7 coordinating, harmonizing and optimizing working methods and  tools.  It  also  provides  its  services  (regulatory  watch, expertise, useful resources, etc.);\n- \u00b7 actively keeping track of the best practices in internal control.\n- \u00b7 drawing  up  the  audit  plan  based  on  the  Group's  process guidelines  and  on  the  major  risks  identified  at  the  Houses. The audit plan takes account of special requests from senior management  and  other  operational  departments.  These projects are discussed with the main persons in charge. The Audit Committee reviews and approves the final audit plan;\n- \u00b7 implementing the audits in line with the annual audit plan. It checks  the  control  procedures  implemented  by  other departments and conducts operational  and  financial  audits within its remit.\n\nThe main issues identified by the Internal Audit Department are reported  to  the  Audit  Committee.  In  this  way,  the  Audit Committee  is  informed  of  the  issues  identified  and  the  action plans set up by the entities concerned.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2023,  the  Group's  Internal  Audit  Department  had 19  employees, two of them specialized in IT audits. The team's size has remained stable since 2017.\n\nInternal  Audit  activities  are  performed  in  conjunction  with  the work  of  the  Audit  Committee  and  the  results  of  the  work performed by the Statutory Auditors.\n\nIn  2013,  Kering's  Internal  Audit  Department  published  the following  referential  frameworks  that  establish  a  common methodology: the audit manual and the audit approach. In 2020, the approach to auditing stores was updated.\n\nIn  December 2021, Kering's Internal Audit Department obtained professional certification from the IFACI (French institute of audit and internal control) that it conducts its activities in accordance with the mandatory requirements of the International Professional  Practices  Framework  of  the  Institute  of  Internal Auditors (IIA). This seal of quality demonstrates that the Internal Audit  Department  adds  value  for  the  Group,  improves  its operations and helps it to accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic,  disciplined  approach  to  evaluate  and  improve  the effectiveness  of  risk  management,  control,  and  governance processes.\n\nIn  2022, the Kering Internal Audit Department introduced a tool for  drafting  and  sharing  reports  on  audit  assignments in stores. The follow-up process on the various assignment stages is fully digitalized,  making for more effective monitoring and smoother discussions with stakeholders.\n\n## The Statutory Auditors\n\nThe Statutory Auditors review internal control processes as part of  their  audit  of  the  financial  statements.  In  so  doing,  they identify the strengths and weaknesses of these processes, assess the risk  of  material  misstatement, and, where applicable, make recommendations.  Under  no  circumstances  do  the  Statutory Auditors take the place of the Company in implementing internal controls.\n\nThe role of the Statutory Auditors is to certify the completeness, accuracy  and  fair  presentation  of  the  parent  company  and consolidated financial statements on an annual basis and issue a limited  review  report  on  the  Group's  interim  consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe  main  matters  covered  by  the  Statutory  Auditors  are  as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 identifying  risk  areas  and  performing  tests  by  sampling  in order  to  validate  the  completeness,  accuracy  and  fair presentation of the financial statements with regard to their individual or consolidated materiality threshold;\n- \u00b7 validating  the  main  types  of  accounting  treatment  and options  throughout  the  year,  in  coordination  with  the management of the activities and Kering;\n- \u00b7 applying  the  accounting  standards  defined  by  Kering  for  its activities based on the relevant accounting standards;\n- \u00b7 preparing an audit report for each House, in order to certify Kering's  consolidated  financial  statements,  including  any comments on internal control;\n- \u00b7 presenting a general overview of the Kering Group to Kering's Management and to the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 preparing  the  Statutory  Auditors'  reports  for  Kering's shareholders. These reports are presented in chapter 6 of this Document.",

The risk factors identified are subject to the mitigation measures presented in section 2 of this chapter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.6.4 Oversight of the process\n\nThe ongoing oversight of the internal control process and regular review  of  its  functioning  rely  on  the  work  performed  by  the Internal Audit Department, any comments made by the Statutory Auditors and the annual self-assessments.\n\nIn the annual self-assessments carried out within the entities for each  process  identified,  the  managers  in  charge  are  asked  to assess the level of internal control through key controls for their operations, in order to identify any weaknesses and implement corrective  measures.  Self-assessment  is  not  simply  a  reporting tool  intended  for  the  Internal  Audit  Department  or  the  Audit Committee;  it  is  also  a  system  that  allows  the  Executive Management  teams  of  the  activities  to  obtain  reasonable assurance regarding the strength of the internal control process. Self-assessment  makes  it  possible  to  strengthen  the  level  of internal  control  through  operational  action  plans.  Lastly,  these provide  a  means  of  harmonizing  the  level  of  internal  control applied throughout the Group and of introducing best practices at all activities, especially newly acquired entities.\n\n## Self-assessment by Group entities\n\nKey operational staff members carry out a questionnaire-based self-assessment in each of the entities following the breakdown of  operations  into  key  processes.  Key  controls,  as  well  as  fraud risk controls, have  been  identified  and  added  to  these questionnaires  in  order  to  strengthen  the  effectiveness  of  the action plans. The self-assessment campaign covers all of Kering's operations.\n\nThe questionnaires are reviewed at regular intervals in the light of participants'  responses  during  the  previous  annual  assessment and comments from those conducting the assessments. In 2021, the  financial  process  questionnaires  were  revised  to  reflect  the changes introduced within the Group. In 2022, the entire content of the questionnaires for the other processes was reviewed. The goal of the update was to focus on more operational, clearer and more  concise  points  reflecting  adjustments  to  the  Group's processes that have undergone major changes.\n\nThe finance, accounting and management process questionnaire takes  into  account  the  AMF's  reference  framework  and,  in particular, its application guide. It includes some 60 questions on the  Group's  mandatory  key  controls.  It  is  circulated  among  the largest subsidiaries in the Group's activities. There was no change in the scope of processes covered in 2023.\n\n## Self-assessment by the Houses' stores\n\nThe  Internal  Audit  Department  extended  its  self-assessment procedures to stores throughout the Group's Houses starting in 2013. These self-assessments give the sales network managers an idea of the effectiveness of their internal control and represent a training guide to help store managers meet their internal control obligations.\n\nThe  self-assessment  questionnaire  for  the  Group's  stores  was extensively revised in the first half of 2020 to (i) take into account changes  in  all  store  activities,  (ii)  clarify  and  simplify  the questions  and  make  them  more  relevant,  and  (iii)  simplify  the connection with the control points verified during in-store audits for comparison purposes.\n\nIn  addition,  to  facilitate  the  use  of  the  results,  the  frequency  of self-assessment  campaigns  in  stores  was  reduced  from  halfyearly to yearly. This approach was presented and approved by the Kering Audit Committee.\n\n## Shared Services Centers\n\nSince 2021, the Group's Finance Department has continued the roll-out  of  the  tool  continuously  monitoring  the  transactional activities managed by the Group at the financial Shared Services Centers. It was deployed more widely across financial processes in accordance with the Group's financial transformation project.\n\n289 -",

At the level of Kering, this department supervises the  Financial  Control  Department  (which  includes  the  accounting,  consolidation  and  management  control  teams),  the  Financial Communications Department, the Financing, Treasury and Insurance Department and the Tax Department.\n\n## 1.7.1 Financial Control Department\n\n## Financial management procedures\n\nThe financial information is produced and analyzed using a set of financial management procedures including:\n\n- \u00b7 medium-term plans, which measure the impact of strategic priorities  on  the  Group's  key  financial  and  management indicators. They are also used for the annual assessment by the Group of the fair value of assets allocated to the various cash-generating units;\n- \u00b7 budgets,  which  are  drawn  up  on  the  basis  of  discussions between the operating departments and the members of the Group's Executive Management. The first phase takes place in the  fourth  quarter  of  the  fiscal  year  when  a  preliminary budget sets out the main financial indicators and operating action  plans.  The  second  stage,  which  finalizes  the  budget, takes  place  in  the  first  quarter  of  the  following  year  and builds in any significant events that may have occurred in the meantime;\n- \u00b7 monthly  reporting  that  monitors  the  performance  of  the Group's  activities  throughout  the  fiscal  year  via  specific indicators whose consistency and reliability are reviewed by the  Financial  Control  Department.  This  department  also oversees the consistency of the accounting treatment applied by  the  activities  with  Group  rules  and  carries  out,  together with  their  financial  controllers,  an  analytical  review  by comparison with the budget and the previous year;\n- \u00b7 monthly meetings of Kering's Executive Management and the senior executives of the Group's activities to assess business trends on the basis of financial and operational data provided by meeting participants.\n\n## Consolidation process\n\nKering's  Financial  Control  Department  coordinates  the  process and is in charge of producing the Group's consolidated financial statements. For this purpose, the Department sends instructions to  the  activities  specifying  the  reports  to  be  sent,  the  common assumptions  to  be  applied  and  the  specific  points  to  be  taken into account.\n\nConsolidation  levels  within  the  activities  provide  a  first  level  of control and consistency.\n\nThe consolidation of the financial statements takes place in late June  and  late  December  using  the  Group  consolidation  tool. Financial  information  is  transferred  from  the  activities  in  real time after full validation of the consolidation reporting packages by the Statutory Auditors and by the Chief Executive Officers and Chief  Financial  Officers  of  the  Houses.  They  make  a  legally binding  commitment  via  a  signed  representation  letter,  which helps to underpin the quality of the financial information made available.\n\nLastly,  the  Group  regularly  monitors  the  activities'  off-balance sheet  commitments.  This  control  is  carried  out  as  part  of  the consolidation process, with the activities required to provide an exhaustive list of their commercial or financial commitments and to monitor them from year to year.\n\n## 1.7.2 Financial Communications Department\n\nThe Financial Communications Department's role is to produce and release the permanent and periodic information that makes up the regulatory information.\n\nIt  conducts this role in line with a precise regulatory framework and in compliance with the key general principles applicable to financial  reporting.  The  Financial  Communications  Department thereby upholds the principle of equal access to information for investors, the principle of consistent, accurate, precise and fairly presented  information  and  the  full  and  effective  release  of regulated  information,  notably  through  the  publication  on  the Group's website, kering.com.\n\nFinancial  Communications  forms  a  key  component  of  market transparency and represents a core pillar of investor confidence. It is intended for a diverse range of audiences, mainly consisting of institutional investors, retail investors and (financial and nonfinancial)  analysts.  Executive  Management,  the  Chief  Financial Officer  and  the  Financial  Communications  Department  are  the contacts  for  analysts  and  investors.  The  Human  Resources Department  provides  information  for  employees  and  employee shareholders, in conjunction with the Financial Communications Department.\n\nThe  role  of  the  Financial  Communications  Department  also extends to non-financial (CSR) topics in its dealings with analysts and  investors.  The  Sustainability  Department  is  also  involved, handling relationships with non-financial rating agencies.\n\n## 1.7.3 Financing, Treasury and Insurance Department\n\nThe  Financing,  Treasury  and  Insurance  Department  manages liquidity, counterparty,  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate financial risks. It also coordinates the Group's cash management. It manages the Group's banking policy, establishes guidelines for the allocation of activity by bank, and coordinates Group calls for tender.  It  ensures  consistency  between  published  financial information and  policies governing interest rate, foreign exchange  and  liquidity  risk  management.  Almost  all  of  the financing  is  set  up  by  Kering  or  Kering  Finance.  Exceptions  are analyzed on a case-by-case basis according to specific opportunities or constraints and require Kering's agreement.\n\nThe  Insurance  Department,  an  integral  part  of  the  Financing, Treasury  and  Insurance  Department,  establishes  and  manages the Group's policy on insurance. It is responsible for identifying, quantifying  and  handling  risks  (prevention,  self-insurance  or transfer to insurers or reinsurers).",

This framework incorporates:\n\n-\n\na new Kering policy that sets out a list of recommendations and warnings for communication and marketing activities,\n\n- -a set of guidelines for sensitive issues;\n- \u00b7 Based  on  this  framework,  a  formal  internal  process  within  each  House  suited  to  its  own  organizational  structure.  These processes are controlled by Kering's internal audit team;\n- \u00b7 Establishment of a Group-wide Brand Trust function, responsible for reviewing and making recommendations to Houses about their communication and marketing content and activities and to guide them with their risk assessments. Consulting the Brand Trust Director is mandatory for 15 identified topics (politics, religion, animals, alcohol, etc.), which will be regularly updated to reflect current events and developments, and for all fashion shows. The matter will be reviewed in-depth by the Brand Trust Director and, as a last resort, may be submitted to Kering Deputy CEO, in charge of Brand Development, for decision. In addition, the Houses are also in regular discussions with the Group to forestall risks arising from the use of potentially sensitive images and messages in their communication.\n\n## Communication measures:\n\n- \u00b7 A special reputational crisis management procedure defined with the Communication and Image Department and in conjunction with the Executive Management and the other departments concerned.\n\n## Training measures:\n\n- \u00b7 Implementation of a training program on how to manage reputational crises for each of the Houses' executive management teams.\n- \u00b7 Promotion  of  a  culture  that  nurtures  both  independent  judgment  and  collective  discussion,  including  through  training  for employees via online modules, in particular on business ethics and compliance. This training also aims to instill a culture of equality and inclusion, for example, by combating stereotyping and unconscious bias that could be at odds with the Group's values and thus harm its image.\n\n## Governance measures:\n\n- \u00b7 Monitoring by Kering's Board of Directors of how the actions mentioned above are implemented, as well as the inclusion of a criterion linked to protecting the intangible assets of the Group and its Houses in the remuneration policy of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Group's  distribution  network  remains  balanced  across  the  regions: sales are made through a network of 1,771 directly operated stores, spread evenly across the main regions and through its online presence.\n- \u00b7 The Group's broad spectrum of products also makes it less dependent on any single category. The Group has also extended its operations to the Beauty activities in 2023.\n- \u00b7 The  Group  has  demonstrated  in  the  past  its  ability  to  adapt  its  organization,  operating  methods  and  strategic  priorities  in response to changes in the macro-economic and technological environment. Its level of profitability and of cash generation allows it to invest for the long-term and to weather the sector's recessionary phases, even though the downward adjustment of cost bases remains a long and complex process in an industry where the proportion of fixed operating expenses is high.\n- \u00b7 The  acquisition  of  a  shareholding  in  Vestiaire  Collective  and  other  initiatives  should  enable  the  Group  to  gain  additional knowledge of the pre-owned Luxury market.\n\n## Sanctions policy\n\nThe Group has also introduced a \"Sanctions policy\" enabling it to guard against risks related to economic sanctions and export controls. These measures have been significantly reinforced by certain jurisdictions because of the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. This Sanctions Policy was adopted and deployed by the Group in 2016 and updated in 2022. This Policy is supported by a guide setting out the measures that need to be taken to ensure compliance with sanctions against Russia and Belarus. The guide  was  first  published  in  March  2022  and  updated  in  January  2023  and  details  the  measures  that  each  sales  channel  and department  must  take  to  identify  risky  situations,  block  problematic  or  prohibited  transactions  and  report  them  to  their hierarchy.\n\n## Situation in Ukraine and Russia\n\nThe Group has taken steps to prevent the supply of sanctioned luxury goods to or for use in Russia. The Group also reorganized its diamond supply chain and has ceased sourcing them either directly or indirectly from Russia. It should be noted, however, that its diamond purchases from Russia were not material.\n\nThe armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine that began in February 2022 continued to have a very limited direct impact on the business activities of major Luxury brands. However, it contributed to inflationary pressure and the deterioration in the global economic outlook. As a reminder, the Group's exposure is limited. Since in 2021 Kering generated around 1%  of its total revenue in Ukraine and Russia, and the net value of its assets there was not material at the end of 2021 (around 0.1% of the Group total assets). The value of those assets was written  down in full in 2022.\n\nKering believes it has taken the requisite measures to reduce as far as possible the likelihood of risks occurring and to mitigate their impact. Depending on its duration and extent, the conflict could affect the economic growth of the main areas and therefore the Luxury market over a longer period. Since that impact is indirect, however, it does not appear possible to quantify it precisely.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A profitability study and an assessment of the strategic and operational benefits are carried out prior to every investment decision related to the network. One-off studies may be carried out two or three years after the investment to ensure the business plan has been executed properly.\n- \u00b7 Optimization of how stores operate through regular and close monitoring of the main retail indicators. The Houses can plan in advance for any decision to strengthen in-store teams, extend or redevelop sales space, for example.\n\n## Wholesale\n\n- \u00b7 Regular review of wholesale distribution contracts by the Houses' teams with the support of the Group's Legal Department to ensure  each  House's  distribution  network  is  as  efficient  and  effective  as  possible.  In  addition,  a  team  from  Kering's  Finance Department tracks the solvency of all the Group's wholesale accounts and monitors payment collection.\n- \u00b7 Efforts made by the Group to streamline the wholesale channel since late 2019. This has resulted in a decline in revenue and, in certain cases, especially for e-tailers, a conversion to a concession format.\n\n## Parallel distribution networks\n\n- \u00b7 The Group prevents sales of its products by parallel distribution networks by ensuring the traceability of its goods, prohibiting direct  sales  to  these  networks  (gray  market)  and  implementing  specific  measures  to  tighten  control  over  these  distribution channels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

All brand CEOs report to her, and she is responsible for steering the Group Houses through the next stages of their growth and development. To ensure a smooth transition, Francesca Bellettini assumed her new responsibilities gradually, and a new Yves Saint Laurent top management lineup was put in place.\n\nJean-Marc Duplaix, Chief Financial Officer since 2012, was appointed Kering Deputy CEO in charge of Operations and Finance. JeanMarc Duplaix heads all Group corporate functions and is responsible for enhancing efficiency and scrutiny.\n\nThe aim of these changes is to build a more robust organization to harness its full expansion potential in the global Luxury market over the long-term.\n\nIn  addition,  Kering  makes  certain  that  Creative  Directors  are  supported  and  stimulated  in  their  work  and  their  quest  for  new inspiration.  Continuous  interaction  between  the  House  CEOs  and  Group  Management  promotes  dynamic  management  of  the Houses and improved responsiveness. Regular interaction between the Chief Executive Officer and the Creative Director of each House preserves its value and respect for its identity over time. Any accounting impacts of impairment losses, which could arise from the loss of a House's appeal, are described in Notes 12, 33.11 and 33.12 to the 2023 consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Integration of acquisitions\n\nThe  Group  mainly  expands  through  organic  growth  supplemented  where  appropriate  by  selective  acquisitions.  All  acquisition plans are reviewed and approved by governance bodies based on financial and investment criteria. These projects are reviewed systematically and extensively (strategic, technical, operational, financial, legal, HR, compliance reviews, etc.) with all the related risks and opportunities being analyzed and assessed as part of this process.\n\nAdjacent segments (Kering Eyewear and Beauty) have prepared a roadmap, dedicated project teams and a plan covering all the processes  that  need  to  be  integrated.  These  project  teams  are  made  up  of  the  Group's  employees  and  employees  from  the companies acquired. For example, a post-acquisition compliance audit ensures Kering standards on combating corruption, moneylaundering,  sanctions,  human  rights,  and  the  duty  of  care  are  upheld.  In  addition,  coverage  of  Maui  Jim's  insurable  risks  was incorporated in the Group's program during 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

To this end, each of Kering's Houses has a crisis management policy and unit that liaises with headquarters. The Group also monitors adherence by personnel to the Kering Group Charter, which defines the framework for the decentralization of the organization, and to the Code of Ethics, which is available in 14 languages.\n\n## Commitment of the governing body and Compliance organization\n\nThe compliance program in general, and the anti-corruption system in particular, are ultimately the responsibility of Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault  in  his  capacity  as  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Kering  SA.  Fran\u00e7ois-Henri  Pinault  is  involved  personally  in developing  and  implementing  the  anti-corruption  program  within  Kering  and  its  Houses,  both  internally  and  externally.  This commitment supported by Executive Management and the Board of Directors is relayed within the Houses by the Chief Executive Officers. A specialized unit has been set up consisting of the Group Chief Compliance Officer, lawyers and Compliance Officers.\n\n## Ethics organization\n\nA  Group  Ethics  Committee  has  been  established  and  is  supported  by  two  regional  counterparts,  the  Asia-Pacific  (APAC)  Ethics Committee and the Americas Ethics  Committee.  Together,  they  ensure  compliance  with  the  Code  of  Ethics  and  respond  to  all inquiries, from simple ethics-related questions to the management of complaints about potential non-compliance with the Code. The three Ethics Committees, the Compliance team and the ethics hotline form Kering's whistleblowing system. All the Group's employees worldwide, as well as employees of the suppliers and partners under contract with the Group and/or its Houses, may use the whistleblowing system.\n\nA detailed description of this organization is presented in section 2 \"Ethics, the cornerstone of our business\" of chapter 4.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is presented in detail in section 2 \"Ethics, the cornerstone of our business\" of chapter 4.\n\n- \u00b7 Prevention:\n\nThe Code of Ethics draws on the Group's key founding principles in the area of ethics, which are then set out in greater detail in other policies and documents.\n\nThe  anti-corruption  policy,  internal  control  procedures  and  guidelines  have  been  drafted  to  assist  Group  employees  with applying the procedures in the situations identified as being most at risk.\n\nAt the same time, the Group also ensures that its suppliers adhere to the principles laid down in the Group Suppliers' Charter.\n\nDue  diligence  procedures  for  all  direct  and  indirect  suppliers,  acquisition  targets,  joint  venture  and  consortium  partners, retailers, as well as beneficiaries of sponsorships and donations, have also been tightened up so as to better prevent the risks of corruption, fraud, money laundering and violation of economic sanctions. These procedures round out the Hercules project (see section 4.2.1 of chapter 4).\n\nIn addition, employees identified as being most exposed to corruption and influence peddling risk are given customized training to enhance first-level control over the new procedures. These training sessions, which were delivered to 3,223 employees in 2023, complement  the  mandatory  Ethics  and  Compliance  e-learning  courses  updated  on  an  annual  basis  for  all  the  Group's employees. This training is run for all Group employees (attendance rate of 98% in 2023) to remind them about the fundamentals of ethics and their obligations in this regard and about the Group's whistleblowing system.\n\n- \u00b7 Detection:\n\nA procedure is in place for reporting concerns and to detect potential risks arising from ethics.\n\nSecond- and third-level compliance checks ensure the compliance program is implemented.\n\n- \u00b7 Remediation:\n\nRemedial action is taken for any failures identified, helping to drive continuous improvement under the program.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Supply instability.\n- \u00b7 Increasing scarcity of resources associated with growing demand, impacting the production, availability, quality and cost of raw materials.\n- \u00b7 Loss of biodiversity caused by intensive livestock farming, which threatens, or may threaten, the production of high-quality raw materials.  More  generally,  soil  degradation  and  depletion  and  the  destruction  of  biotopes  represent  a  significant  risk  to  the maintenance of high-quality livestock and crop farming.\n- \u00b7 Manufacturing disruptions caused by the unavailability or decreased quality of raw materials, due to climate change and its impact on biodiversity and on the destruction of land and ecosystems.\n- \u00b7 Ending a business relationship with a dependent supplier could result in that supplier experiencing financial difficulties or even insolvency, thus affecting its liquidity and ability to comply with its other supply commitments.\n- \u00b7 Failure  by  a  supplier  to  meet  Kering's  ethical,  social,  environmental  and  animal  welfare  standards  potentially  harming  the Group's image and reputation.\n- \u00b7 A defect that leads to a product return by the consumer could harm the Group's image and reputation.\n- \u00b7 A defect that could affect consumer health or safety (e.g., allergies) would result in a product recall.\n\n## Actions taken\n\nIn order to bring high-quality products to market that are compliant with these standards, the Group implements quality control processes covering all of the stages in the product lifecycle, from design to marketing. Products are classified using quality and safety standards, while suppliers are listed on the basis of technical audits and adherence to the Group Suppliers' Charter. Product quality and safety controls are carried out at all stages of the production process by quality engineers and accredited laboratories.\n\nUnder its supplier selection process, the Group makes certain their practices fulfill the Group's ethical, environmental and social requirements as laid down in its Supplier Charter included in the Code of Ethics and its Sustainability principles, which are stated in contracts with suppliers. Compliance with these practices is confirmed during the employment audits carried out every year. The Group ensures that its suppliers abide by the applicable laws and regulations and that its supplies meet international standards. In addition,  Kering  supports  its  suppliers  as  they  transition  to  more  sustainable  standards  and  has  set  up  a  collaborative  portal (Vendor Portal), making training and various key documents freely available to suppliers and enabling the Group to evaluate their environmental and social performance by means of questionnaires. Some production lines may be internalized following detailed analysis of the main suppliers.\n\nKering is also looking at the following areas in order to secure its sourcing over the long-term and support natural solutions:\n\n- \u00b7 Introduction of the Kering Standards by suppliers with two levels of achievement: minimum requirements and best practices to be achieved by 2025 at the latest with a target of 100% raw materials compliance with these Standards. These standards focus on five areas: social impact, environmental impact, traceability, use of chemicals and animal welfare. Kering has also published specific standards on animal welfare to ensure that animals are treated as humanely as possible throughout the Group's supply chains;\n- \u00b7 Introduction of sustainable sourcing. The quality, safety and stability of the Group's supplies of animal and plant-based raw materials depend on strict compliance with the standards in this regard. First and foremost with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and on the sustained equilibrium of ecosystems, some of which are already under threat;\n- \u00b7 Implementation of the Biodiversity Strategy and development of regenerative agriculture through direct support for sourcing programs for  certain  key  raw  materials  and  the  Kering  Regenerative  Fund  for  Nature,  which  was  established  to  support  the transition to regenerative agriculture with producers of key raw materials for the Group in order to reach the target of one million hectares by 2025. Seven projects (leather, cotton, wool and cashmere) are currently being supported;\n- \u00b7 Development of alternative materials with the Material Innovation Lab (MIL) and the Jewellery Innovation Lab (JIL). The Material Innovation Lab (MIL) is a unit established in 2013 to support the Group's Houses by pursuing three targets: (i) develop and make available materials aligned with Kering Standards to replace traditional materials (organic cotton and wool, mushroom leather, sustainable  cashmere,  recycled  plastics,  etc.),  (ii)  analyze  Houses'  supply  chain  to  secure  larger  volumes  of  sustainable  raw materials and develop multi-brand synergies, and (iii) identify, assess and select sustainable innovations. The main role of the JIL  is  to  help  Kering's  Jewelry  Houses  with  adopting  more  sustainable  practices  by  means  of  innovation  and  networking  by pursuing two targets: (i) develop sustainable innovations for materials and processes to reduce the impact of the supply chain, (ii)  assert  the  leading  position  of  Kering  and  its  Jewelry  Houses  in  terms  of  sustainability  through  key  partnerships  and groundbreaking initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group has forged special partnerships with key  suppliers  and  pursues  a  policy  of  actively  seeking  new  partners.  It  also  develops  synergies  within  the  production  chain  by means of acquisitions or strategic business partnerships in the subcontracting market.\n\nThe Product Compliance teams support the Houses in developing and distributing products that comply with legal requirements in each market and with the Group's Product Restricted Substance List (PRSL), which specifically lists the substances to be removed or thresholds not to be exceeded, as well as the highest existing standards for the disposal of hazardous chemicals. Since 2021, the organization has been strengthened by the addition of the Test & Innovation Lab (TIL), the ISO/IEC 17025 (Accredia) laboratory that supports testing and problem-solving activities and the R&D projects of the Group's Houses. In addition, Kering has committed to ensuring  hazardous  chemicals  are  removed  from  manufacturing  processes  and  has  drawn  up  a  Manufacturing  Restricted Substances  List  (MRSL).  Likewise,  the  Group  systematically  embraces  environmental  standards  and  best  health,  safety  and environmental practices across all its production activities.\n\nAll the Group's businesses are also endowed with a \"product\" crisis management unit. In the event of a known risk, they follow procedures  ensuring  that  immediate  and  transparent  information  is  provided  to  the  public,  and  that  defective  products  are recalled.\n\nLastly, the Group has also taken out civil liability insurance to cover bodily harm or property damage to third parties caused by products considered defective (see section 2.7 \"Insurance and risk protection\" of this chapter).\n\nChapter  4  \"Sustainability\"  of  this  Universal  Registration  Document  presents  details  of  the  policies,  projects  and  actions implemented, the outcomes achieved and the associated performance indicators relating to:\n\n- \u00b7 the quality and safety of products in section 6.1.3 \"Product compliance and consumer health and safety\";\n- \u00b7 the  Group's  raw  materials  and  biodiversity  conservation  in  section  5.3  \"Preserving  biodiversity  and  ecosystems\"  and  5.4 \"Sustainable sourcing and use of raw materials (Tier 3 and Tier 4)\" and more generally Kering's environmental policy within section 5 \"Respecting and protecting the environment in our operations and value chain\";\n- \u00b7 guidance and support for suppliers as they transition to sustainable practices in section 4 \"Working together to build sustainable and socially responsible supply chains\".\n\n301 -",

Action taken includes:\n\n## Prevention\n\n- \u00b7 Implementation  of  procedures.  The  Group  has  increased  IT  security,  notably  through  a  transformation  plan,  and  stepped  up employee  awareness  initiatives  by  implementing  a  large  number  of  control  and  protection  measures,  including  establishing procedures, and developing targeted IT security systems. In 2022, the Group introduced strong authentication to prevent identity theft. A new authentication management platform was deployed to tighten up access and protect workstations by rolling out disk drive  encryption  and  tightening  up  security  configurations.  The  security  integration  process  for  projects  was  also  enhanced  to ensure that all new applications added to the information systems comply with security requirements.\n- \u00b7 Training:  All  employees  have  been  trained  to  detect  malicious  emails,  including  via  phishing  simulation  exercises  conducted throughout  the  year.  Moreover,  the  Group  has  developed  e-learning  modules  on  cybersecurity  and  data  confidentiality,  in addition to one on security and remote working. Best security practices in various areas (phishing, malware, passwords, etc.) were also circulated via the Group's various internal communication channels during 2023, with a special campaign held during cybersecurity month in October.\n- \u00b7 GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). The Group has taken significant action  in  these  areas  such  as:  anonymizing  the customer data used in non-production environments,  restricting access to customer data to authorized persons, carrying out risk  assessments  on  all  projects  implemented  by  the  Group  in  order  to  identify  requirements  in  terms  of  data  security, confidentiality, integrity, traceability and availability, and thereby defining the appropriate security measures, entering into nondisclosure  agreements  with  external  service  providers  and  adding  security  clauses  to  the  Group's  contracts  with  suppliers, acquiring a customer identity management platform in order to secure the authentication process. The Data Privacy Officer is involved in these measures.\n\n## Controls\n\n- \u00b7 Compliance of the Group's IT systems. The following actions are implemented every year to assess the level of compliance of the Group's information systems: penetration testing (pentests) on applications and simulated logical/physical attacks (Red Team), network vulnerability scans and applications, continuous cloud infrastructure audits, review of patch management procedures and obsolescence management, review of backup procedures.\n- \u00b7 Audits of information systems and sensitive applications. The Information Systems Department (Kering Technologies) regularly conducts audits of these.\n\n## Incident management and continuity plan\n\n- \u00b7 Security incident management that may impact personal data or operations. The Group has set up a Security Operations Center on  hand  24/7  and  responsible  for  detecting  and  resolving  security  threats  and  events,  such  as  identity  fraud,  malware  and information leaks. In 2022, detection capabilities and responsiveness were strengthened by building and rolling out new kit for the Security Operations Center and setting up a Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) for Kering. In 2023, the Kering CERT processes were tightened up and approved by industry organizations such as InterCERT France.\n- \u00b7 Business continuity and recovery plan. Business continuity and recovery plans are regularly updated with the assistance of the Houses' security departments and their efficacy is closely monitored. In 2023, the recovery plan was tightened up with increased testing  on  critical  applications  and  infrastructure.  The  crisis  management  framework  was  enhanced  and  training  drills  were carried out.\n\nThe Group also works with peers to reduce exposure to this type of risk. The Group has joined Campus Cyber to build closer ties with the French cybersecurity community and now plays an active role in working parties and governance.\n\nInformation relating to GDPR compliance is presented under actions taken in the \"Legal risks\" section of this chapter.",

These rely chiefly on the advice of duly authorized external organizations and advisors and adequately satisfy the customary technical and professional standards from a relevance and proportionality perspective under the applicable regulatory framework. An active prevention and safety policy are an integral part of these methods and procedures. Provisions have been set aside for the probable costs of disputes (e.g., complaints or litigation), as estimated by the entities and their experts. According to the Group entities' experts and advisors, no litigation currently in progress concerning Group companies presents a risk for the normal course of the Group's business or its future development. Provisions were set aside in the Group's 2023 consolidated financial statements to cover all of the above-mentioned legal risks, including the impact of commitments given on the disposal of controlling interests (see Note 24).\n\n- \u00b7 None of these risks have been qualified as arising outside the normal course of business for Group companies.\n- \u00b7 The Group considers that the effective methods and procedures for identifying and managing its industrial and environmental risks  within  each  of  the  entities  concerned,  which  rely  chiefly  on  the  advice  of  duly  authorized  external  organizations  and advisors,  adequately  satisfy  the  customary  technical  and  professional  standards  from  a  relevance  and  proportionality perspective  under  the  applicable  regulatory  framework.  An  active  prevention  and  safety  policy  are  an  integral  part  of  these methods and procedures.\n- \u00b7 Furthermore, the Group has granted various vendor representations and warranties in connection with disposals of controlling interests in subsidiaries made over the last ten years (see Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "As regards the laws and regulations applicable to the Group's activities (excluding possible international sanctions that may be imposed against certain countries but have no impact on the Group's activities), none are subject to specific rules or exemptions in any  of  the  relevant  territories.  They  are  all  subject  to  the  same  constraints  and  obligations  as  those  directly  applicable  to  its competitors  in  its  different  markets.  The  Company  is  not  aware  of  any  foreseeable  regulatory  or  legislative  changes  in contradiction with the foregoing.\n\nAs  part  of  a  preliminary  investigation  into  the  fashion  sector  in  several  countries  under  EU  anti-trust  rules,  the  European Commission  carried  out  an  unannounced  inspection  in  April  2023  at  the  Italian  premises  of  Gucci,  a  Kering  subsidiary.  The Company published a press  release  on  April  19,  2023  concerning  the  preliminary  investigation,  which  is  ongoing.  To  date,  the Company has not received any formal notice concerning developments in the proceedings. The Legal Department regularly reviews the progress of the investigation to assess its potential implications for the Group, in conjunction with the Finance Department, the Internal Audit Department and the Deputy CEO in charge of Operations and Finance.\n\nIn line with its commitments, the Group seeks to act in full compliance with the regulations applicable to its operations, including competition rules. Over the past several years, the Group has implemented policies and guidelines concerning competition law, which have been made available to all employees. These lay down the principles and rules of conduct employees have to abide by in order to comply with the applicable rules. A specific unit reporting to the Compliance Department handles their deployment and monitors their application, and training is provided to the relevant employees.\n\nTo the Company's knowledge, there are no governmental, legal, or arbitration proceedings (including any pending or threatened proceedings of which the issuer is aware) that are likely to have in the future or have had in the course of the previous 12 months, a significant impact on the financial position or earnings of the issuer or the Group.\n\n## Contract management\n\nThe Group is not significantly dependent on any third-party patents, licenses or supply sources. The Group owns or has licensed rights to the trademarks, patents and intellectual property rights that it exploits, free of any restrictions on the right of priority or use (and of rights likely to restrict such exploitation) in all relevant markets. The same applies to the corporate names and domain names of the subsidiaries or entities, to the names of the Group's stores and points of sale (see the \"Real estate\" section) and to the trademarks and signs of the goods and services manufactured or marketed by the various Group entities. This situation does not preclude any of the trademarks belonging to the Group being licensed to third parties for the sale of goods or services under its trademark enhancement policy, as it is  the case in fragrances and cosmetics. In all cases, any such licensing agreements have been entered into under fair commercial and financial terms and conditions and have no impact on the ownership of the trademarks and signs belonging to the Group.\n\nFurther information on contractual obligations and other commitments is provided in Note 30 to the 2023 consolidated financial statements presented in this Universal Registration Document. The Group has strengthened its teams, particularly in the Legal Department and the shared services centers, to ensure that contracts with the Group's suppliers have been drafted appropriately. Since 2015, the Hercules program has strengthened the shared and, standardized approach to supply chain management between the Houses.\n\nReal estate contracts are reviewed by specialized teams (see the section on \"Real estate\" risks in this chapter for more details).\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nThe Kering Group regards intellectual property used in the creative and innovation processes of its Houses as crucially important and  has  established  a  master  intellectual  property  protection  and  defense  policy  adhered  to  by  the  Group's  Houses.  For  this purpose,  the  Group  has  formed  and  retains  legal  organizations  at  regional  (Asia,  the  Americas  and  Europe),  local  (Houses  and subsidiaries) and central levels specialized in intellectual property management. In line with the general directives introduced by Kering, the Legal departments of the Group's Houses take steps to make sure products do not infringe the rights of third parties and determine which elements need protecting. The intellectual property rights portfolio is reviewed and updated on a regular basis to reflect and protect the activities of the Group's Houses.\n\nLastly, Kering works to protect its rights and campaigns against counterfeiting in all its markets, as this can have an impact on revenue and damage the reputation of the Group and its products. The Group takes steps to combat the various breaches of its rights, the sale and trafficking of counterfeit goods or copied goods, as well as imitations that devalue the creative work of the Houses. In physical markets, this policy is implemented through customs seizures, police raids and legal action and on the internet by withdrawals of advertising and investigations followed by litigation. Litigation is overseen by the Houses' Legal departments, according  to  the  general  policy  principles  recommended  by  the  Group  with  the  help  of  the  Group's  legal  units  and  external advisors, in conjunction with the competent authorities at local level (subsidiaries). The cost of protecting rights is borne by the legal functions and aligned with the Group's scale and size.\n\nAll these measures are also applied to the Group's latest acquisitions.\n\n305 -",

To curb the risk of inappropriate use of these data  and  to  comply  with  the  relevant  legislation,  the  Kering  Group's  Houses  have  taken  further  measures  to  tighten  up  the protection of personal data within their commercial and digital strategy. The Privacy Framework is an internal framework in which the  Houses  are  stakeholders  through  direct  and  formal  executive-level  engagement.  It  paves  the  way  for  implementation  of  a coherent worldwide strategy protecting personal data. The various data controllers face many challenges in view of cross-border issues and growing complexity of the legal framework for the protection of personal data.\n\nThe  Kering  Group's  activities  operate  under  constantly  changing  rules  that  vary  from  location  to  location  and  from  subject  to subject. The Group has increased the size of its Privacy team to address this priority and expand its data protection capabilities. It now  consists  of  regional  managers  (Europe,  Middle  East  and  Africa,  Asia-Pacific  and  Americas)  and  dedicated  managers  for  a number of countries.\n\n- \u00b7 There have been numerous new and changes to existing privacy rules in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, with the adoption of new legal frameworks in several states during 2023.\n- \u00b7 In the Asia-Pacific region, the Houses have undertaken various initiatives to comply with China's Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) and to seek government approval for cross-border personal data transfers. Across the region, new personal data protection rules were introduced in India, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea and Indonesia.\n- \u00b7 In  the  Americas  region,  maintaining  a  tight  grip  on  data  processing  activities  has  become  imperative  in  view  of  the  growing corpus of applicable law and the scale of the Group's operations. Special attention is paid to this issue in the United States where the relevant and state-level legislation is both complex and in flux. Similarly to the Asia-Pacific region, there has been a flurry of lawmaking activity in South America, notably in Brazil, Argentina and Chile.\n\nSince supporting customers is a central concern of the Houses, the Group set up in 2022 a shared service guaranteeing effective and rules-compliant management of requests by individuals to exercise their right to access, correct, object to the processing of and delete the information gathered. In 2023, the Houses reported an uptrend in the number of requests (up 49% in 2023 versus 2022), requiring  the  allocation  of  specialized  resources.  The  service  is  now  provided  to  the  Houses  to  ensure,  on  their  behalf,  that  all requests  received  are  processed  rapidly  and  rigorously,  regardless  of  the  channel  by  which  they  are  received  and  the  type  of request involved. In 2023, the average request processing time was 11 days.\n\nEmployee training forms a key part of the strategy implemented. In 2021, Kering introduced mandatory (and optional for external participants) internal training with the aim of developing a culture that makes privacy a priority concern and genuinely addresses IT security issues head-on. The exercise was repeated in 2022, when it achieved a completion rate of over 93%.\n\nLastly,  one  of  the  Group's  Houses  underwent  a  coordinated  enforcement  inspection  in  2023  by  the  European  Data  Protection Committee concerning the designation and duties of the Data Protection Officers. The inspection was completed by the French Data Protection authorities (CNIL) in December 2023, without any recommendations or observations being made.",

Accordingly,  it  uses derivatives either to hedge foreign currency trade receivables and payables, or to hedge highly probable forecast exposures and/or firm commitments.\n\nHedging periods are aligned with each House's business cycle and only marginally exceed one year at each reporting date.\n\nThe Group also hedges foreign exchange risk on financial assets and liabilities issued in foreign currencies by using currency swaps for refinancing purposes or for investing cash in euros or the local currency.\n\nNote  21.2  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  sets  out  the  nature  of  the  hedging  instruments  held  by  the  Group  and  its exposure to foreign exchange risk (\"Exposure and sensitivity to foreign exchange risk\").\n\nKering Finance SNC processes, controls and provides administrative support for foreign exchange transactions on behalf of Group companies.  Its  organization  into  front-office,  middle-office,  back-office  and  accounting  departments  ensures  that  tasks  are properly  segregated,  transactions  are  kept  secure  and  derivatives  contracted  internally  are  unwound  on  the  market.  Kering Finance SNC uses market-standard techniques and information systems to price currency instruments.\n\n## Equity risk\n\nThe Group trades in its own securities either directly or through derivatives as part of its share buyback program in accordance with applicable regulations. Kering has also entered into an agreement with a financial intermediary to foster the liquidity and maintain the  regular  quotation  of  its  shares.  This  agreement  complies  with  the  Professional  Code  of  Conduct  drawn  up  by  the  French association  of  financial  markets  (Association  fran\u00e7aise  des  march\u00e9s  financiers  -  AMAFI)  and  approved  by  the  French  financial markets authority (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF).\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Kering held 840,597 treasury shares, representing just 0.7% of its share capital and confirming its low level of  exposure  in  this  regard.  Kering  also  retained  a  0.4%  interest  in  PUMA,  further  reducing  its  exposure  compared  to  previous reporting periods.\n\nAdditional information on equity risk is provided in Note 21.3 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nKering  may  need  to  use  derivatives  such  as  swaps  or  purchases  of  options  to  guard  against  changes  in  interest  rates.  Kering Finance SNC processes, controls and provides administrative support for interest rate transactions on behalf of Group companies. Its  organization into front-office, middle-office, back-office and accounting units ensures that tasks are properly segregated and transactions are kept secure. Kering Finance SNC uses market-standard techniques and information systems to price interest rate instruments.\n\nNote 21.1 to the consolidated financial statements sets out the Group's exposure to interest rate risk (\"Exposure and sensitivity to interest rate risk\").\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity  risk  management for the Group and each of its subsidiaries is closely monitored and periodically assessed by Kering, based on Group and House-level financial reporting procedures.\n\nIn order to manage liquidity risk that may arise when its financial liabilities are due, the Group's financing policy is geared towards optimizing its maturity schedule and cost of debt.\n\nThe Group's active risk management policy also seeks to diversify sources of funding and limit reliance on individual lenders.\n\nThe Group had unused confirmed lines of credit totaling \u20ac3,185 million as of December 31, 2023, up \u20ac150 million as of December 31, 2022 (see Note 20.6 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2023, the Group had issued \u20ac1,277 million of securities under its NEU CP program filed with the Banque de France.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Group had cash and cash equivalents totaling \u20ac3,922 million.\n\nInformation relating to liquidity risk is presented in Note 21.7 to the consolidated financial statements.",

Kering is also committed to ensuring that all Group entities pay all of the taxes due in each of the countries where they operate. According to its tax policy and its commitment to compliance and transparency, the Group has signed in France a protocol to enter into a \"tax partnership\" in 2023.\n\nKering can rely on a team of tax specialists in each of its regions and at its headquarters. They are highly skilled and receive regular training to keep their knowledge up to date.\n\nTo understand the various tax-related issues that may arise, the Group Tax Department's main tasks are:\n\n- \u00b7 consolidating tax information from all Group companies;\n- \u00b7 understanding and monitoring tax issues that arise at national or international level and coordinating responses in compliance with the applicable laws and standards;\n- \u00b7 ensuring that intra-group transactions are documented as required;\n- \u00b7 providing technical support on tax-related matters during the preparation of consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Tax Department has therefore implemented a number of verification and control tools to help identify and resolve any tax issues that may arise within the Group and to ensure compliance with the applicable national tax laws and international standards. These tools  include:  regular  analyses  of  comparable  information  to  ensure  that  intra-group  transactions  are  carried  out  on  an arm's length basis; annual reviews of Group entities; and close, detailed monitoring of any tax audits to which Group entities are subject.\n\nIn addition, the Tax Department actively ensures that all Group entities:\n\n- \u00b7 allocate all the physical, digital and human resources necessary to conduct their business;\n- \u00b7 only have a presence in countries where they actually conduct business;\n- \u00b7 comply with the applicable national laws and international standards on transfer pricing. To this end, it develops and updates all of the necessary documentation in this regard and provides the relevant resources, such as analyses of comparable transactions and functional analyses;\n- \u00b7 cooperate fully with local tax authorities and government agencies and, where relevant, share their experience and expertise.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Following on from the Balenciaga controversy, special training was provided in 2023 to all members of these crisis cells. The Safety Department worked together with the  Communication  Department  to  put  in  place  the  procedures  to  follow  in  the  event  of  a  reputational  crisis,  as  detailed  in section 2.2 of this chapter (Creativity risks - Image).\n\nLastly, Kering Tech and Kering Ops, which are responsible for the Group's information systems and logistics, each have a crisis cell established and trained in responding to any crises.\n\nIn addition, safety and security procedures for in-store employees and for the stores themselves have been put in place, along with a safety policy for business travelers, outlining the arrangements and rules to be followed to curb the risks of their coming to harm during business trips. The Group's logistics chain achieved ISO 28000:2007 certification (requirements for a security management system,  including  those  aspects  critical  to  security  assurance  of  the  supply  chain)  by  implementing  effective  safeguarding measures  and  certified  safety  risk  management  audits.  It  was  also  awarded  ISO  22301:2012  certification  (business  continuity management  systems)  through  processes  established  to  identify  potential  risks  that  may  disrupt  the  supply  chain  and  the development of specific business continuity plans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Lack of foresight, resilience or Group initiatives in response to the effects of climate change.\n\n## Example case(s)\n\n- \u00b7 Physical impact of climate change linked to the chronic risk of extreme weather events (drought, flooding, water scarcity, etc.) on the  supply  chain  or  certain  Group  installations:  the  higher  frequency  of  these  events  could  have  a  direct  impact  on  the availability and quality of key raw materials such as cotton, leather, cashmere and silk, which would translate into greater price volatility,  and  may  disrupt  the  supply  chain  or  affect  the  production  (restriction  of  certain  practices),  distribution  of  finished products and continuity of operations (manufacturing or storage facilities, etc.).\n- \u00b7 Economic activity and even the social stability of certain regions (such as coastal regions in Asia) could be severely impacted by the effects of climate change, which would further increase pressure on the Group's supply chain.\n- \u00b7 Transition  risk  and  mitigation:  greater  regulatory  burden,  stricter  environmental  regulations,  carbon  taxes  and  operational investments made to meet the challenges associated with climate change, potentially having an impact on the Group's activities by  increasing  production  costs  (raw  materials,  energy,  operational  investments,  transportation)  and  impairing  operational flexibility.\n- \u00b7 Inaccurate forecasting of consumer demand for responsible products.\n\n## Actions taken\n\nIn the global economic and political outlook, climate change has become a key issue that demands an effective response.\n\nKering's approach to tackling climate change features a two-pronged drive to: (i) reduce the impact of its operations, and (ii) to enhance its foresight and ability to adapt so that it can mitigate the impact of physical and transition risks on its business (shifting consumer expectations, physical risks to its installations, impact on sourcing of its raw materials, etc.). The Group has formulated a Climate Strategy and introduced ambitious targets to reduce its carbon footprint over the short (2030), medium (2035) and long (2050) term:\n\n- \u00b7 2030: Kering was the first Luxury group to be verified and approved in 2016 by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for its carbon footprint reduction targets. These were revised in 2021 to align them with the 1.5 \u00b0C scenario by 2030 (Scopes 1 & 2), in keeping with the commitments made as part of the Fashion Pact;\n- \u00b7 2035: an absolute reduction of 40% in its overall carbon footprint (Scopes 1, 2 and 3 of the GHG Protocol);\n- \u00b7 2050: Contribute to the carbon-neutral drive.\n\nThe Group pledged to reduce its carbon footprint -not just at its own operations but right across its value chain -enhance its energy efficiency and make its supply chains more resilient. A decarbonization roadmap has been drawn up for the entire Group. It has been adapted to fit each of the Houses and the main emission sources identified.\n\nKering's adaptation plans vary according to the type or risk and its probability of occurrence in the value chain. Upstream Kering is looking to secure its sourcing over the long-term and support natural solutions, with the development of regenerative agriculture a particular priority.\n\nAlongside its efforts to reduce carbon emissions, the Group offsets its emissions through carbon credits from approved forestry protection projects. In 2023, the Group offset its overall carbon footprint (Scopes 1, 2 and 3 calculated via the EP&L tool - excluding product use and end of life) for 2022 and as calculated for the 2022 report. To plan ahead for its carbon offsets, Kering launched the Climate Fund for Nature in 2022 together with Mirova and the L'Occitane group. The fund aims to protect and restore nature and is targeting  \u20ac300  million  in  total  commitments.  Of  this  amount  \u20ac195  million  had  already  been  committed  by  year-end  2023,  with \u20ac100 million from Kering.\n\nThe policies,  projects  and  actions  implemented,  the  outcomes  achieved  and  the  associated  performance  indicators  relating  to climate change and the Group's Climate strategy are presented in detail in section 5.2 \"Combating climate change\" of chapter 4 \"Sustainability\" of this Universal Registration Document.",

By working in partnership with its suppliers and stakeholders to curb these risks and by sharing best practices, Kering protects the reputation of the Group and its Houses and maintains the appeal of their creations. This commitment is underpinned by:\n\n- \u00b7 A Code of Ethics and a Human Rights Policy have been drafted at Group level and these cover Kering's operations and supply chains. Key documents forming an integral part of the contractual framework governing relationships with suppliers: a Supplier Charter included in the Code of Ethics and the Sustainability Principles applicable to suppliers.\n- \u00b7 In 2023, the Group reviewed its map of risks pertaining to severe impacts on human rights and fundamental freedoms, health and safety, and the environment resulting from the Group's operations and supply chain. The assessments were incorporated in the Group's overall map, and an action plan will be rolled out during 2024 to address areas for improvement detected during this exercise.\n- \u00b7 A whistleblowing system open to everyone working for the Group: employees and interns of Kering and its Houses, as well as external and temporary personnel working for external partners or service providers under contract with the Group. It can be used to report any suspected violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms within the Group and its supply chains.\n- \u00b7 A collaborative portal put in place in 2020 (the Vendor Portal) optimizing communication between Kering and its suppliers and providing  them  with  easy  access  to  training  and  key  Kering  documents -including  on  human  rights -and  also  evaluating suppliers' performance through questionnaires in a number of key areas, including human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n- \u00b7 Employment audits conducted each year across thousands of Group suppliers and service providers.\n\nThe policies,  projects  and  actions  implemented,  the  outcomes  achieved  and  the  associated  performance  indicators  relating  to human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms  are  presented  in  section  3  \"Duty  of  Care  Plan\"  in  this  chapter  and  in  section  2.5 \"Protection of human rights\" of chapter 4 \"Sustainability\" of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2.7 Insurance and risk protection\n\nThe  Kering  risk  management  policy  is  based  on  the  ongoing identification and evaluation of risks, risk prevention, protection of people and property, and safety and business continuity plans.\n\nThe Group's risk management policy also includes the transfer of risks to insurance companies.\n\n## Insurance against risks\n\nThe Group's policy of transferring significant risks to insurance companies is based on:\n\n- \u00b7 achieving the best economic balance between risk coverage, premiums and self-insurance; and\n- \u00b7 the  insurance  available,  insurance  market  constraints  and local regulations.\n\nCoverage  is  based  on  the  \"all  risks  except  those  specifically excluded\"  approach,  determined  by  assessing  the  financial consequences for the Company of a possible claim, especially in the areas of:\n\n- \u00b7 third party liability: bodily harm or property damage to third parties caused by products, fittings and equipment;\n- \u00b7 fire, explosions, water damage, etc.;\n- \u00b7 operating losses following direct damage.\n\nInsurance coverage is purchased based on an assessment by site and  company  of  the  level  of  coverage  necessary  to  face reasonably  estimated  potential  occurrences  of  diverse  risks (liability,  damage  and  third-party  retailer  counterparty).  This assessment  takes  account  of  the  analyses  of  the  insurers underwriting the Group's risks.\n\nThe  insurance  programs  now  in  force  at  the  Group,  which centralize most purchases of insurance policies such as property and casualty risks for subsidiaries, were arranged with reputable insurers  in  the  industrial  risk  insurance  sector.  The  Group  was assisted by internationally recognized insurance brokers specialized in covering major risks.\n\nMain existing insurance programs:\n\n- \u00b7 property  damage  from  fire,  explosion,  floods,  machine breakage,  natural  disasters  affecting  its  own  property: property, furnishings, equipment, merchandise, IT installations, and property for which it is responsible, as well as  any  resulting  operating  losses,  for  any  period  deemed necessary for normal business activities to resume;\n- \u00b7 damage and loss of equipment, merchandise and/or goods in transit;\n- \u00b7 damage resulting from theft, fraud, embezzlement, or acts of malice to valuable assets, data and/or property;\n- \u00b7 bodily harm or property damage following construction work carried  out  as  project  owner  (new  buildings,  renovations, refurbishments, etc.);\n- \u00b7 liability  for  bodily  or  property  damage  to  third  parties  by motorized vehicles belonging to the different Houses;\n\n- \u00b7 general  and  environmental  liability  for  \"operating  risk\", \"postdelivery risk\" and \"risk after services rendered\", due to damage caused to third parties in the course of the Group's business;\n- \u00b7 non-payment of receivables by third-party retailers, particularly in the event of default or insolvency;\n- \u00b7 cyberattacks targeting the Group's data and/or other assets.\n\nOther insurance contracts are taken out by Group companies to cover specific risks or to comply with local regulations.\n\nUninsured risks are exposures for which no insurance coverage is offered  on  the  insurance  market,  or  for  which  the  cost  of available insurance is disproportionate compared  to  the potential benefits of the coverage.\n\nThe Kering Group handles known and manageable risks given the current  scientific  and  medical  understanding  in  a  manner consistent with other French and international industrial groups with similar types of exposures. This is one of the reasons why the Group is able to place its risks with insurers prepared to deal with the unforeseeable and uncertain consequences of accidents.\n\nInsurance coverage concerns all Group companies.\n\nThe  levels  of  coverage  in  place  for  the  main  potential  risks facing  the  Group  as  a  whole  as  of  January  1,  2023,  were  as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 damage,  fire, explosions, water  damage  and  ensuing operating  losses:  \u20ac300  million  increased  to  \u20ac500  million  for the Group's major sites;\n- \u00b7 general liability: \u20ac145 million;\n- \u00b7 damage to or loss of goods in transit: \u20ac15 million;\n- \u00b7 fraud and acts of malice to goods and valuables: \u20ac15 million.\n\nThe  total  risk  financing  cost  for  Kering  includes  three  main items  (in  addition  to  \"physical\"  protection  and  prevention expenditure). It breaks down as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 cost  of  deductibles  and  non-insured  losses  retained  or  selfinsured by the subsidiaries in 2023: \u20ac1.115 million;\n- \u00b7 claims  covered  by  the  Group  itself  through  its  reinsurance company in 2023: \u20ac12.6 million (total estimated at year-end 2023);\n- Self-insurance by the Group's reinsurance subsidiary reduces insurance  costs  and  enhances  performance  because  (i) frequently  occurring  risks  are  pooled  within  the  Group  and insured  for  an  amount  that  is  fixed  per  claim  and  (ii) exceptionally  frequent  claims  made  in  a  given  year  are covered by reinsurance.\n- As of July 1, 2023, the Group's reinsurance company covered damage and operating losses of up to \u20ac3 million per claim, or more  on  natural  events  in  exposed  regions  (for  the  period from July 1 to June 30);\n- \u00b7 insurance premiums budgets and management fees including  engineering  visits  and  brokers  fees,  etc.  (final budget 2023 expenses): \u20ac23.525 million.\n\nThere is also a credit insurance budget of around \u20ac1.375 million covering non-payment risks related to sales to retailers (duty-free chains, department stores, specialized retailers, etc.).",

It endeavors not only to meet  but  to  exceed  its  legal  obligations  in  the  area.  The  latest version of the Kering Code of Ethics, released in 2018, is closely aligned  with  the  major  international  conventions  on  human rights,  fundamental  freedoms  and  environmental  protection.  It sets  forth  the  core  commitments  of  Kering's  approach  in  these areas.  In  this  respect,  Kering  considers  the  requirements  of  the Duty of Care Law to be an integral part of its ethical commitments and undertakes to ensure compliance with these requirements in all its activities and throughout its entire supply chain.\n\nIn 2017, Kering prepared a first duty of care plan which included a mapping of the relevant risks. Since then, Kering has updated its duty of care plan on an annual basis. In 2021, Kering performed a new and more in-depth assessment of the risks covered by the Duty of Care Law to see whether, and to what extent, such risks had evolved since 2017. It began the same exercise in 2023, and this  will  be  completed  during  2024.  A  significant  number  of internal  stakeholders  (including  from  Kering's  and  the  Houses' Human Resources, Sustainability,  Legal,  Compliance,  Audit  and Operations departments) were involved in preparing the risk map and  drafting  the  duty  of  care  plan  (the  \"Duty  of  Care  Plan\"). External legal advisors provided assistance to ensure the internal stakeholders acted in a fully independent manner and had all the relevant expertise to hand.\n\nKering's  Duty  of  Care  Plan  presents  an  overview  of  the  actions that  Kering  has  undertaken  over  a  number  of  years  to  act  as  a responsible company. It is built around the five key components established by the Duty of Care Law.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nplan to detect and prevent the risks of a severe impact on human rights and fundamental freedoms, severe harm to the health and safety of individuals, and  serious  environmental  damage, resulting  from  the  operations  of  (i)  the  Company,  (ii)  its subsidiaries  and  other  controlled  entities  or  (iii)  its  suppliers  or subcontractors.",

        "page_content": "## 3.2 Risk map\n\nAs stated above, significant internal and external resources were devoted to preparing the risk map in 2021 and the updated risk map due for completion in 2024. The operations of Kering, Gucci\n\nand Boucheron were covered in 2021 and those of Kering and of all  the  Houses  in  the  2023-2024  edition  under  the  Group's Compliance Department's oversight.\n\n## 3.2.1 Scope\n\nThe following risks were identified and evaluated as part of the risk mapping exercises:\n\n- 1. Forced Labor\n- - Child Labor\n- - Forced Labor/Debt Bondage/Illegal, Clandestine or Undeclared Employment/Migrant Labor/Human Trafficking\n- 2. Discrimination and Harassment\n- - Diversity\n- - Discrimination\n- - Women's Rights/Gender Equality\n- - Psychological or Sexual Harassment/Violence\n- 3. Absence of Dialog\n- - Freedom of Association/Right to Collective Bargaining\n- 4. Decent Working Conditions\n- - Right to a Living Wage\n- - Working Hours\n- - Dignity at Work/Mental Wellbeing\n\n## 3.2.2 Methodology\n\nThe risks listed above were assessed separately with respect to (i) the  internal  operations  of  Kering  and  the  Houses,  (ii)  the operations  of  their  first-level  suppliers,  and  (iii)  the  sourcing  of raw  materials.  This  risk  map  evaluated  the  gross  risk  and calculated  net  risk  by  evaluating  and  scoring  the  relevant controls in place.\n\nFirst,  gross  risks  related  to  internal  operations  were  assessed separately  per  country  based  on  a  combination  of  objective factors (number of employees, production sites and warehouses, located  in  each  country)  and  third  party  indicators  covering specific  countries  and  specific  risks  (varying  for  each  risk  and including among many others the Human Freedom Index, ITUC Global  Rights  Index,  the  Environmental  Performance  Index  and the Animal Protection Index) assessing the potential impact and the likelihood of occurrence.\n\nSecond,  gross  risks  related  to  the  operations  of  first  level suppliers  were  assessed  based  on  the  number  of  suppliers  per country  and  the  respective  sales,  which  were  once  again combined with third party indicators covering specific countries and specific risks.\n\n- 5. Health and Safety at Work\n- - Safe and Hygienic Working Conditions\n- - Chemicals/Hazardous Substances\n- 6. Pollution\n- - Energy Consumption\n- - Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change\n- 7. Waste and Packaging\n- - Waste and Packaging\n- 8. Water Use\n- - Water Consumption\n- - Wastewater Treatment\n- 9. Animals & Biodiversity Abuse\n- - Animal Protection\n- - Preservation of Biodiversity\n- 10. Local Communities Abuses\n- - Land Rights/Forced Eviction and Displacement of Populations\n- - Cultural Heritage/Local Communities\n\nLastly,  gross  risks  related  to  the  sourcing  of  raw  materials  were assessed  based  on  Environmental  Profit  &  Loss  data  and  other information  gathered  for  risk  mapping  purposes  using  six  third party indicators specific to each relevant country. The assessment also took into account two aggravating factors, i.e., whether the country appears (i) on the U.S. Department of Labor lists of countries producing goods and products that are believed to be produced by child labor and/or forced labor, and/or (ii) on the  list  of  conflict-affected  and  high-risk  countries  under  EU Regulation no. 2017/821.\n\nThe  respective  net  risks  were  then  obtained  by  evaluating  and scoring the relevant controls in place.\n\nIn this process, a distinction was also made to assess separately (i) the  risks  to  which  Kering  and  the  Houses  expose  their stakeholders,  and  (ii)  the  risks  to  which  Kering  and  the  Houses are exposed as a result of their activities, taking into account the potential  financial, legal (and  especially  compliance)  and reputational impact.\n\nOverall, the  exercise  involved  interviews  with  127  Group employees, a review of almost 2,000 documents, and the scoring of  thousands  of  country-specific  risks  based  on  56  third  partysupplied risk indicators.",

Nonetheless,  the  provisional  results  of  the exercise to a very large extent mirror the results of the 2021 risk map. Accordingly, the controls put in place to mitigate relevant risks related to the internal operations of Kering and the Houses appear sufficiently solid.\n\nWith respect to the operations of Kering's and the Houses' first level  suppliers,  it  is  worth  noting  that  the  majority  of  these production  suppliers  are  located  in  countries  with  relatively limited  risk  of  human  rights  abuse  or  environmental  damage, including  Italy  (and,  more  particularly,  Northern  Italy)  and France. Relevant risks are further mitigated by multiple controls and primarily  by  the  introduction  of  the  Hercules  management system (described below), which covers the onboarding of new suppliers  and  their  subcontractors  as  well  as  the  monitoring  of their performance throughout the entire contractual relationship.\n\nThe controls in place to limit relevant risks within the remainder of  the  supply  chain,  consist  primarily  in  implementing  the requirements  set  forth  by  the  Sustainability  Principles  by  our suppliers and their subcontractors, and the Kering Standards, as well as in the certifications obtained by suppliers.\n\nAction  plans  specific  to  Kering  and  to  each  House  aimed  at delivering subsequent improvements in the Group's practices in the three areas referred to above and bringing the related risks under tighter control are prepared and implemented by the end of each year in which a risk map is completed.\n\n## 3.2.4 Monitoring and updating\n\nKering  monitors  human  rights  and  environmental  rights  in  the highest-risk  countries  for  its  operations  and  supply  chain.  In addition,  as  stated  above,  Kering  updates  its  risk  map  on  a regular  basis  so  it  can  factor  in  any  new  entities,  among  other reasons.\n\n## 3.3 Regular assessments of the activities of subsidiaries, suppliers and subcontractors\n\n## 3.3.1 Subsidiaries and Other Controlled Entities\n\nSince  2018,  Kering  has  refocused  its  operations  on  Luxury,  and more  particularly  around  the  Couture,  Leather  Goods,  Jewelry, Eyewear and Beauty Divisions.\n\n## 3.3.1.1 Stores\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  Kering's  Houses  directly  operated 1,771  stores  worldwide.  As  stated  below,  Kering  has  adopted standards  to  achieve  its  sustainability  targets  that  cover  the commercial  life  of  its  stores.  These  standards  provide  specific guidance for achieving environmental efficiency during both the store  planning  and  construction  as  well  as  the  store  operation and management phases.\n\nThese  standards  also  provide  for  the  performance  of  periodic audits  to  ensure  that  relevant  practices  are  duly  respected, including with respect to energy and water use, as well as waste collection practices.\n\nMoreover, as with all other Group premises, stores are subject to regular  audits  by  the  Group  Internal  Audit  Department  to safeguard  compliance  with  local  regulations  and  with  Kering's policies and procedures. As noted above, these include a review of  relevant  working  conditions,  including  the  processes  used  to track working hours and employee leave as well as the measures in place to ensure that the privacy of employees is respected.\n\n## 3.3.1.2 Offices and other premises\n\nOffices  and  other  premises  owned  by  Kering  and  its  Houses, including production sites and warehouses, are subject to regular audits  by  the  Group  Internal  Audit  Department  to  ensure  that applicable  regulations  are  fully  respected  and  internal  policies and procedures are fully  implemented.  In  addition  to  the  more generalized testing of controls put in place, these audits assess the  working  conditions  of  employees  by  ensuring,  for  example, that employment  relationships  are  always  formalized  by dedicated  agreements  (in  particular  with  respect  to  temporary workers)  and  that  salaries  and  working  hours  are  properly managed and documented.\n\n## 3.3.2 Suppliers and subcontractors\n\nThe Group works with several thousand suppliers to produce its Houses'  collections.  As  of  December  31,  2023,  the  Group-wide centralized  supplier  database  (described  below)  comprised  a total  of  4,433  active  suppliers  throughout  the  Group.  The  chart below describes the geographical breakdown of these suppliers:\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The Hercules management system, which was first introduced in 2015 and has since undergone a regular series of improvements, aims to  create  and  share  best  practices  in  risk  assessment  and provide supply chain analysis for Kering's production processes. This is achieved through the following tools:\n\nSupplier management procedures. The Houses apply a set of consistent procedures for managing interactions with suppliers, including  with  respect  to  their  qualification,  assessment,  and relationship management. Kering has also introduced a template contract  that  incorporates  its  Code  of  Ethics  (including  the Suppliers' Charter) and  its Sustainability Principles. Both documents  are  systematically  issued  to  suppliers  and  form  an integral  part  of  the  contractual  relationship  with  Kering.  These documents  further  require  that  the  commitments  contained  in the contract be cascaded  to  relevant  sub-suppliers  and subcontractors.\n\nIntegrity  due  diligence  procedure. Kering's third party suppliers  and  service  providers  are  subject  to  the  integrity  due diligence process set forth in the Group's Anti-Corruption Policy and  Third  Party  Due  Diligence  Procedure.  More  specifically,  to properly  assess  and  manage  the  financial,  regulatory,  and reputational  risks  associated  with  the  relationships  with  these third  parties,  Kering  screens  them  through  the  World-Check database and conducts dedicated desktop searches. Depending on the risk profile, Kering might also require the completion of a dedicated  questionnaire  or  the  performance  of  an  external review from a law firm.\n\nSocial and safety audits. The Group conducts regular social and safety  audits  to  assess  and  monitor  the  Group's  supply  chain operations.  They  are  undertaken  both  directly  and  with  the support  of  third  party  firms.  These  audits  are  performed  by  a dedicated  team,  the  Kering  Supply  Chain  Audit  Department, which reports to the Group's Chief Audit Executive and ensures the  independence  and  impartiality  of  its  members.  The  Group has made regular improvements to the relevant audit standards\n\nand processes. As discussed at greater length in the Sustainability Chapter,  the  audits  cover  social  (including  child  labor,  forced labor  and  working  conditions),  environmental,  and  health  and safety  risks  pertaining  to  the  operations  of  Kering  and  of  the Houses' first level suppliers, first and second level subcontractors,  and  the  main  direct  suppliers  of  raw  materials. While key suppliers are audited every two years, the frequency of audits on other suppliers is determined through a dedicated risk assessment,  together  with  anomalies  identified  and  their severity. If a major anomaly subject to a \"zero tolerance\" policy comes to light during these audits (including, e.g., forced labor or undeclared  subcontracting),  Kering  refuses  to  enter  into  the agreement with the new supplier or terminates the relationship with  the  existing  supplier.  In  2023,  the  Supply  Chain  Audit Department performed 4,559 audits on these suppliers. Findings from  the  audits  performed  by  the  Kering  Supply  Chain  Audit Department are discussed in dedicated committees composed of representatives  from  key  functions  from  both  Kering  and  the Houses.\n\nSupplier  database. All  Kering's  Houses  have  access  to  a common  supplier  database,  which  includes  findings  from suppliers'  audits  as  well  as  supplier  information  available  from publicly  available  databases.  At  the  end  of  2023,  this  database comprised  4,433  active  suppliers.  The  database  includes production suppliers, the main suppliers of raw materials, Kering Eyewear suppliers, and strategic suppliers.\n\nVendor  Portal. In  line  with  the  objective  of  ensuring  its standards  are  implemented  by  its  suppliers  by  2025,  Kering designed and has implemented a new supplier portal since 2020 that  can  conduct  evaluations  and  share  information  and sustainability practices. By means of dedicated questionnaires of up to around 300 questions, this portal assesses implementation of  the  Kering Standards across the supply chain, environmental performance and suppliers' social performance.",

In this respect, Kering works in close synergy with its Houses to ensure that relevant controls are adequately deployed throughout the entire Group.\n\n## 3.4.1 Key Internal Stakeholders\n\nKering takes a cross-functional governance  approach  to upholding  human  rights  and  protecting  health,  safety  and  the environment. Specifically, day-to-day human rights and environmental governance spans various departments at Kering and House levels.\n\nKering  Compliance  Department. The  Group  Compliance Department is primarily responsible for monitoring the effective implementation  of  the  commitments  established  by  the  Kering Human  Rights Policy. As such, the Group Compliance Department  is  kept  informed  of  relevant  initiatives  and coordinates  the  efforts  undertaken  by  relevant  departments  at the  Group  and  House  level  (including  through  information sharing).  The  Group  Compliance  Department  also  tests  and assesses existing processes to map risks throughout the Group, and  supports  the  Houses  and  relevant  Kering  departments  in assessing risks associated with their day-to-day operations. The Compliance departments provide day-to-day support in connection with the operations of each House.\n\nKering  Sustainability  Department. The  Group  Sustainability Department  is  responsible  for  defining  and  implementing  the Group's  sustainability  strategy  and  policies  and  supporting  the Houses  with  respect  to  their  implementation.  The  Kering Sustainability Department is composed of around 50 specialists who report to the Chief Sustainability and Institutional Relations Officer,  who  is  both  a  member  of  the  Group's  Executive Committee and Chair of the Group's Ethics Committee. Overall, more  than  100  employees  focus  on  sustainability  issues  within the Group's Sustainability Department, the Houses' Sustainability  teams  and  dedicated  structures  such  as  the Material Innovation Lab and the Jewellery Innovation Lab.\n\nKering Human Resources Department. The Human Resources Department is responsible for implementing controls to uphold human  rights  within  the  Group.  This  applies  throughout  the entire employee journey, including the recruitment process and working conditions, as well as in respect of employee health. A dedicated  Inclusion  and  Diversity  team  within  the  Human Resources function works with the Group Houses to define and prioritize the initiatives that foster an inclusive working environment at all levels of the organization. In 2020, Inclusion & Diversity  Committees  were  created  in  each  House  and  at  the corporate level, led by a member of the House or of the Corporate Management Committee. These committees currently have more than 90 members. To embed the Inclusion and Diversity strategy more  firmly  at  regional  level,  three  Inclusion  and  Diversity managers  were  appointed  in  2022  at  the  Americas,  APAC  and EMEA regions.\n\nKering  Internal  Audit  Department. As  discussed  at  greater length at the beginning of this chapter, the Group Internal Audit Department assesses the implementation of the Kering internal controls  system  within  the  Group's  internal  operations  by performing regular audits in accordance with the Group's annual audit plan.\n\nKering  Security  Department. The  Security  Department's responsibilities  include  implementing  the  safety  measures  set out  in  the  Kering  Global  Safety  Policy  and  verifying  compliance with applicable safety regulations.\n\nKering Supply Chain Audit Department. As  noted  above,  the Kering  Supply  Chain  Audit  Department  conducts  regular  social and safety audits to assess and monitor the Group's supply chain operations  and  oversees  the  performance  of  audits  with  the support of third party firms.\n\nProduct Compliance Department. The Kering Product Compliance  Department  assists  the  Houses  with  testing substances  in  products,  including  through  a  dedicated  testing center that the Group recently opened in Florence.\n\nHouse  teams. Every  House  in  the  Group  has  dedicated Compliance, Sustainability, and Human  Resources  teams responsible  for  verifying  that  the  controls  established  by  the Kering  policies  and  procedures  described  below  are  properly deployed throughout their operations.\n\n## 3.4.2 Key Policies and procedures\n\nKering's subsidiaries, suppliers, and subcontractors are required to  strictly  abide  by  local  legislation  and  to  comply  with  the policies  and  procedures  summarized  below.  Should  these policies and procedures set forth more stringent standards than those established by local legislation, such standards must take precedence.\n\nCode  of  Ethics. As  noted  above,  the  Code  of  Ethics  forms  the cornerstone  of  Kering's  ethical  commitments  and,  as  such, includes  the  Group's  engagements  in  upholding  human  rights, fundamental freedoms, health and safety, and the environment. Building  on  this  platform,  the  Suppliers'  Charter  lays  down  the standards  and  commitments  expected  of  these  third  parties. Compliance with the Charter constitutes an essential condition of any  commercial  relationship  between  the  Group  or  the  Houses and  their  suppliers,  which  are  in  turn  required  to  extend  these requirements  to  their  own  suppliers  and  subcontractors. Following the 2018 update to the Code of Ethics, the document was  reissued  to  all  Group  employees  worldwide  in  2019.  This update  reaffirmed  Kering's  commitment  to  apply  all  major international conventions to its activities and to tighten up and clarify  what  is  required  of  its  suppliers.  For  example,  the Suppliers'  Charter  now  includes  a  requirement  to  pay  special attention  to  certain  categories  of  workers,  such  as  migrant workers, who are vulnerable to exploitation. The Code of Ethics and the Suppliers' Charter have been translated into the 14 most widely spoken languages within the Group.\n\nHuman Rights  Policy. The  Human  Rights  Policy,  published  in 2021 and available in French, English, Italian and Chinese, defines the  Group's  commitments  on  human  rights  and  fundamental freedoms, health and safety, and environmental protection. The Human Rights Policy further outlines the Group's policies related thereto  and  defines  the  means  by  which  the  Group  and  its business partners, including suppliers and contractors, can fulfill these commitments.",

        "page_content": "Sustainability Principles. The Sustainability Principles, created in 2015 and updated in 2023, are applicable across all Houses and cover  three  main  areas:  social  aspects  regarding  human  rights, environmental  aspects,  and  aspects  regarding  the  sourcing  of raw materials and packaging. Suppliers are required to abide by these  principles  and  supplier  compliance  is  evaluated  on  this basis.  The  principles  are  outlined  in  the  Sustainability  chapter and on the Group's website.\n\nKering Standards and Guidance for Sustainable Production. In  the  pursuit  of  its  commitment  and  approach  to  human  and environmental concerns, Kering has published dedicated standards on raw material sourcing and manufacturing processes. Under its 2025 strategy, Kering is committed to seeing that  all  its  suppliers  apply  these  standards  by  2025.  A  detailed description of the Kering Standards  is provided  in the Sustainability  Chapter.  These  standards  now  include  guides  to products not intended for sale, logistics and circularity.\n\nKering  Animal  Welfare  Standards. The  Group  published  in 2019 and updated in 2021 its animal welfare standards with the aim  of  ensuring  the  best  possible  treatment  for  all  species throughout  the  supply  chain.  The  Kering  Animal  Welfare Standards  are  the  first  ever  set  of  full  standards  for  the  Luxury and Fashion sectors and aim to drive positive change in practices in industry and beyond. For each of these species, the Standards highlight the specific challenges, laying down farming, transportation, and slaughter requirements, and provide the list of existing  benchmark  certifications.  These  standards  also include guidelines for slaughterhouses.\n\nEnvironmental  Policy. Kering's  Environmental  Policy,  which was  updated  in  2023,  contributes  to  the  fulfillment  of  the  Care pillar  of  Kering's 2025 sustainability strategy. It spans the entire supply  chain  of  the  Group's  operations  and  focuses  on  the following  objectives:  (i)  a  40%  reduction  in  absolute  terms  in Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 with respect to 2021; (ii) 100% alignment with the Kering Standards by 2025; and (iii) 100% traceability through to the country of origin for the Group's main raw materials by 2025.\n\nClimate  Strategy. Kering  firmly  believes  that  companies  can play a decisive role in the fight against climate change, and drew up in 2021 a holistic strategy with a clear commitment to a 1.5 \u00b0C pathway,  underlining  its  ambitions  in  sustainability,  circularity and biodiversity.  The  key  elements  of  Kering's  Climate  Strategy include: (i) a 90% reduction in absolute terms of Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  2030  from  a  2015  baseline;  (ii)  a 70%  intensity  reduction  (tCO2/  \u20ac.  million  in  gross  margin)  in Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from a 2015 baseline; (iii) an absolute reduction of 40% in Scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 from a 2021 baseline; and (iv) contributing to carbon neutrality (net zero) by 2050 in line with the ambitions of  the  Paris  agreement.  More  information  on  Kering's  Climate strategy can be found in the Sustainability Chapter.\n\nBiodiversity  Strategy. The  Biodiversity  Strategy,  published  in 2020, explains Kering's approach on preserving natural resources.  This  four-stage  approach  (avoidance,  reduction, restoration/regeneration  and  transformation)  has  three  main goals: (i) to stem the loss of biodiversity, (ii) to rebuild ecosystems and  rehabilitate  species,  and  (iii)  to  drive  systemic  change throughout  the  supply  chain  and  beyond.  Kering's  Biodiversity Strategy  was  updated  in  2023  with  greater  emphasis  being placed  on  various  points  including  the  policy  of  combating deforestation  and  converting  ecosystems.  More  information  on the  Biodiversity  Strategy  can  be  found  in  the  Sustainability Chapter.\n\nCircularity Ambition. Published in 2021, the Group's Circularity Ambition plan aims to demonstrate that moving away from the conventional model of \"take - make - waste\" is not only about recycling.  Transitioning  to  a  truly  circular  economy  requires  a complete  rethink  of  the  way  we  produce  and  use  resources  as well as the way we extend the life of products. Kering's \"Coming Full  Circle\"  approach is built on three main elements: (i) Luxury that  lasts;  (ii)  regenerative  sourcing  and  clean  production;  and (iii) making production processes more efficient.\n\nKering Standard for Stores - Store Planning and Construction &  Store  Operation  and  Management) .  Kering  has  developed standards for stores that set out expected performance levels in 11 key areas (including energy management, lighting, renewable energy, water use and waste treatment). The standards provide specific  guidelines  covering  the  environmental  efficiency  at  all phases in a store's lifecycle, namely site selection and relations with the lessor, design, construction  or  renovation,  and operation.  These  standards  serve  as  a  reference  for  new  stores and store renovations where the use of Leadership in Energy and Environmental  Design  (LEED)  or  equivalent  certifications  is  not possible.\n\nFashion  Models  Charter. The  Fashion  Models  Charter  was introduced  in  September  2017  to  ensure  that  Kering  and  its Houses comply with various major principles, including requiring models  to  present  valid  medical  certificates  attesting  to  their good  health,  discontinuing  the  modeling  of  size  32  clothes  for women and size 42 for men, and improving working conditions (e.g.,  providing  a  dedicated  changing  area  as  well  as  food  and drinks). Under  this  Charter,  Kering  and  its  Houses  have committed  to  only  hire  models  aged  18  and  over  to  represent adults at fashion shows and photo shoots.\n\nHealth  &  Safety  Policy. Kering's  Health  &  Safety  Policy addresses  its  own  employees,  service  providers,  and  visitors  to Group sites, so as to promote best practices, assert the Group's commitment to an environment  conducive  to  employee  health and  safety,  and  undertake  ambitious  measures  in  this  respect. This  policy  updated  in  2023  is  founded  on  Group-wide  best practices  and  aims  to  ensure  that  governance,  processes,  and regular internal audits are in place to achieve Kering's target of zero accidents.",

It  sets  out  practical  examples  on  the  main  ethics risks associated with Kering's operations, including with respect to  human  rights  violations.  The  Manual  outlines  the  basic concepts  and  legal  challenges  involved  and  gives  practical examples  enabling  employees  to  pinpoint  areas  requiring vigilance in their day-to-day work.\n\nThese  policies  and  procedures  back  up  the  other  documents adopted by the Houses in the relevant area.\n\n## 3.4.3 Risk Prevention and Mitigation Measures in the Internal Operations\n\nRaising  Employee  Awareness. Kering  seeks  to  ensure  that  its employees  throughout  the  Group  are  fully  acquainted  with  its policies and procedures (including with respect to human rights, sustainability  and  environmental  protection)  through  regular training,  internal  communications,  workshops  and  events.  The training  offer  includes  the  annual  Ethics  and  Compliance  elearning, with modules covering different ethics, compliance and sustainability-related topics, mandatory for all Group employees. In  2023,  this  training  encompassed  human  rights,  the  fight against  corruption,  wellbeing  at  work,  diversity,  energy  savings on  a  daily  basis  to  combat  global  warming  and  sustainability. This  training  framework  also  includes  the  Kering  Standards  elearning program, available to employees since 2019. These help employees  gain  a  better  understanding  of  Kering's  strategy  to reduce the environmental and social impacts arising from its raw materials and manufacturing processes.\n\nIn  addition, Kering and its Houses also share their commitment towards sustainability through the company social networks and harness them  to organize Group-wide events, celebrate recognized  initiatives,  such  as  the  World  Environment  Day  and raise employee awareness on environmental issues. To this end, they created The Kering Planet, a dedicated digital platform that raises awareness and provides regular information for employees about sustainability  issues.  It  features  interactive  tools,  such  as quizzes and challenges. Kering is keen to update the knowledge of  its  employees  and  also  held  several  Climate  Fresk  workshop sessions for its employees and those of its Houses in France and around the world. Over 300 people were trained in 2023. For the first time  in  2023,  Kering  also  organized  Atelier  2tonnes workshops.\n\nSustainability Certifications. Building on the Group's commitment to comply with the highest social and environmental standards, a number of entities and sites owned by Kering and its Houses have obtained a significant number of sustainability  certifications.  These  include  the  SA8000  (working conditions  and  social  standards),  ISO  14001  (environmental performance), ISO 45001 (health and safety), ISO 9001\n\n(requirements  for  introducing  a  quality  management  system), ISO  28000  (security  within  the  supply  chain),  and  ISO  22301 (business continuity management systems) standards. Certifications  related  to  the  implementation  of  environmental management systems are applied for primarily for the sites that have a more significant environmental impact, such as logistics centers  and  tanneries.  All  of  the  Group's  tanneries  have  been ISO 14001 certified since 2019.\n\n## 3.4.3.1 Key Control Measures Designed to Prevent Severe Impacts on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\n\nNo Child Labor/Forced Labor. Kering  and  its  Houses  reject  all forms  of  child  labor,  forced  labor,  and  human  trafficking.  The Group has put in place recruitment processes designed to uphold relevant  legal  requirements  (including  with  respect  to  the employment age) and prevent human rights abuses. To that end, employees from the Human Resources function received special training to ensure that such processes are fully implemented.\n\nPromoting Inclusion and Diversity and Preventing Discrimination. Kering  believes  that  diversity  is  a  source  of creativity  and  innovation  and  seeks  to  develop  an  inclusive approach  to  ensure  that  everyone  has  the  opportunity  to  be themselves.  Kering  is  also  committed  to  fostering  a  culture  of equality at all levels of the Group and offering its employees an open  and  stimulating  working  environment,  free  from  any discrimination. Kering launched the Baby Leave policy in January 2020. It  entitles  all  employees  worldwide  to  14  weeks'  leave  on full pay upon becoming parents, including fathers and partners. The Baby Leave policy aims to promote a better balance between employees'  professional  and  personal  lives  and  to  achieve equality  between  female  and  male  employees  -  regardless  of their  personal  situations  -  guaranteeing  all  Group  employees worldwide the same minimum benefits on a child's arrival. Since 2019, the Inclusion and Diversity team has been instrumental in adopting initiatives to foster a culture of diversity and inclusion throughout  the  Group.  More  specifically,  this  team  has  (i) supported the creation of Inclusion and Diversity Committees in each  House,  (ii)  developed  and  delivered  a  comprehensive Inclusive  Recruitment  training  course  for  recruiters  from  all Houses, and (iii) developed several initiatives to raise awareness, encourage meaningful conversations, and bring positive change. Under  its  multi-generational  inclusion  policy,  Kering  signed  in March  2022  its  first  inter-company  engagement  agreement covering the role of employees aged over 50 in the Group. In April 2022, it followed this up with a partnership charter on providing access  to  employment for  young  people,  vulnerable  adults  and people living with a disability and supporting them in the labor market.",

        "page_content": "Promote  Equality  and  Diversity. Empowering  women  is  a priority  at  Kering,  which  seeks  to  ensure  that  women  are  well represented  at  all  levels  of  management  in  the  Group.  In  2010, Kering  was  one  of  the  first  signatories  of  the  Women's Empowerment Principles  Charter  drawn  up  by  UN  Women  and the UN Global Compact. Kering and its Houses develop women's skills  through  specific  programs,  such  as  leadership  training, coaching and mentoring sessions to support women talents and enhance gender diversity in senior management positions. Kering is  closely  monitoring  the  representation  of  women  in  executive positions  and  is  committed  to  achieving  gender  pay  equity  at every  level  of  the  organization.  In  2022,  Kering  launched  its Women  in  Luxury  internal  network  in  France  to  foster  gender equality  and  empower  women  within  the  Group.  In  2023,  the network expanded to Italy, China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore and the United States. Also in 2023, the Human Resources teams carried out an externally accredited study to identify and analyze pay gaps between men and women.\n\nFree  from  Harassment  and  Violence. Kering  endeavors  to provide a working environment free from any form of harassment or  violence.  As  such,  Kering  and  its  Houses  encourage  all employees  to  report  any  instances  of  such  behavior,  which  is subject to disciplinary sanctions and, in many countries, criminal proceedings.  Kering  ensures  that  its  employees  are  perfectly aware  of  their  rights  in  this  area.  In  an  effort  to  extend  its commitment externally, Kering also supports victims of domestic violence via its Policy on Domestic Violence and the work of the Kering Foundation. And the Kering Foundation supports women impacted by violence, through partnering with survivor-centered services,  and  local  experts,  while  implementing  preventive programs with young people to deliver real change.\n\nIncreased Dialog with Employees. Kering is fully committed to guaranteeing applicable trade union rights and to engaging in a constant  and  productive  dialog  with  its  employees  worldwide, including  with  those  located  in  countries  that  do  not  allow collective bargaining. Kering conducts the Kering People Survey every two years. The latest edition in 2023 gathered employees' feedback  on  their  working  environment  confidentially  and securely.  Based  on  feedback  received,  Kering  develops  a  Group action plan that is adapted at each House and local level. Kering also conducts local actions to increase awareness and foster the adoption of wellbeing policies.\n\nDecent  Working  Conditions. Kering  and  the  Houses  seek  to ensure  that  the  work  of  employees  is  adequately  remunerated and  conducted  in  compliance  with  local  legislation,  including with respect to working hours. As such, the Group partnered with Fair  Wage  Network to conduct a study to evaluate whether the base  salary  of  the  Group's  employees  provides  an  adequate\n\nstandard  of  living  in  the  key  countries  where  Kering  operates. Kering  has  also  adopted  an  array  of  initiatives  designed  to protect  the  mental  wellbeing  of  employees,  including  optional free external psychological support services.\n\nSupporting Local Communities. Kering plays a role in the life of the communities where its sites are located and works to prevent and mitigate any negative impacts that its operations create or to which they contribute. In this respect, Kering is actively engaged in  safeguarding  artisan  traditions  and  the  communities  that support  artisans.  Kering  has  implemented  special  programs  to keep  alive  century-old  craftsmanship  and  local  traditions. Brioni's Scuola di Alta Sartoria , Bottega Veneta's Accademia Labor and Ingenium , Gucci's ArtLab, and Pomellato's Galdus Goldsmith Academy are among these programs.\n\n## 3.4.3.2 Key Control Measures to Prevent Severe Harm to the Health and Safety of Individuals\n\nSafe and Hygienic Working Conditions. Kering is committed to the  principle  of  risk  prevention  and  seeks  to  safeguard  the occupational  health  and  safety  of  its  employees  by  complying with all applicable regulations and by establishing relevant best practices.  The  Kering  Security  Department  is  responsible  for managing the security of Group sites, preparing emergency plans and  delivering  safety  training  to  employees.  Kering,  Gucci  and Bottega Veneta also obtained SA8000 and ISO 45001 certification covering  occupational  health  and  safety  management  systems. These  accreditations  aim  to  reduce  occupational  injuries  and diseases  and  promote  and  protect  employees'  physical  and mental health.\n\nMinimizing  Chemicals/Hazardous  Substances. Kering  works constantly  to  curb  the  use  of  chemicals  and  hazardous substances in all its Houses' products and production processes. For  this  purpose,  the  Group  has  created  two  lists  of  restricted substances:  one  for  production  processes,  the  Manufacturing Restricted  Substance  List  (\"MRSL\"),  and  one  for  products,  the Product Restricted Substance List (\"PRSL\"). The MRSL is focused on discontinuing the use of dangerous chemicals in manufacturing  processes  to  both  avoid  the  exposure  of employees to hazardous substances, and reduce toxic discharges into  water.  The  main  source  of  the  Group's  hazardous  waste production is related to the operations of its tanneries. As such, the  Group  is  actively  involved  in  researching  and  developing environmental-friendly tanning processes, and has introduced a heavy metal-free tanning method in leather tanneries.",

Since 2012, Kering has measured and quantified its progress towards becoming a more sustainable Group through its EP&L. The EP&L allows the Group to measure its impacts on natural capital right across its value chain and to assign a monetary value to them. The EP&L, the cornerstone of its environmental  approach,  also  serves  as  a  compass  guiding Kering's  roadmap  for  the  coming  years  in  terms  of  sourcing strategy, choice of materials, and production and transformation processes. In 2020, Kering also extended the scope of its EP&L to include the product use and end-of-life phases. In April 2022, the Group announced it had lowered the EP&L intensity  of  its  own activities  and  its  supply  chain  by  40%  in  2021  relative  to  2015, reaching its target four years earlier than scheduled. In line with its commitment to transparency, the Group's EP&L results and an analysis  of  progress  made  are  available  on  the  open-source platform  kering-group.opendatasoft.com.  In  2022  and  2023, Kering  published  its  EP&L  impacts  in  euros  and  also  its  premonetization monitoring indicators. More specifically, it provided information  including  the  Group's  overall  footprint  in  terms  of greenhouse gas emissions, land use, waste production and water use.  In  addition,  one  of  the  Group's  Statutory  Auditors  issued  a limited assurance report in February 2024 on selected information concerning the 2023 EP&L.\n\nReducing  Carbon  Emissions. The  Group  has  set  itself  carbon footprint reduction targets and laid down an ambitious Climate Strategy over the short, medium and long-term (2030, 2035, with the goal of a 40% reduction in the absolute value of its Scope 1, 2 and  3  greenhouse  gas  emissions  relative  to  2021  and  a  goal  of contributing to the carbon-neutral objective out to 2050). As part of  the  Fashion  Pact,  Kering  and  over  160  global  fashion  brands have  committed  to  take  action  to  halt  climate  change,  restore biodiversity  and  protect  the  oceans.  The  other  participating companies have undertaken, among other things, to take action to achieve the objective of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, in order to keep global warming below 1.5 \u00b0C between now and 2100. The same objectives have been set under the Watch & Jewellery Initiative launched by the Group and Cartier in 2022. As part  of  these  commitments,  Kering  continues  its  offsetting program fully covering its 2023 Scope 1, 2 and 3 (calculated via the EP&L tool - excluding product use and end of life) greenhouse gas emissions released in 2023 amounting to 2,135,568 tCO2. The carbon  credits  were  acquired  from  forestry  and  mangrove protection and reforestation projects and follow Kering's internal guidelines based on VCMI (Voluntary Markets Integrity Initiatives) best practices. Not only does this generate carbon credits, it also provides  substantial  support  for  local  populations  and  the protection of biodiversity.\n\nFavoring  Renewable  Energies. In  2022,  Kering  reached  its objective of using 100% renewable energy in every country where this  is  possible,  in  line  with  the  RE100  guidelines.  Kering  also favors  entering  into  agreements  to  purchase  locally  produced green  electricity.  Where  this  is  not  possible,  Kering  purchases Energy  Attribute  Certificates.  On  top  of  external  purchases,  the Houses continue to increase their reliance on renewable energy, for  example  by  installing  solar  panels.  In  addition,  the  Group undertakes  to  systematically  secure  certification  for  its  new locations  or  locations  that  it  renovates  for  energy  efficiency\n\npurposes. LEED is the preferred certification system selected by the  Group,  but  it  also  applies  other  certifications,  like  HQE (France)  and  BREEAM,  for  projects.  More  than  300  LEED certifications  had  been  obtained  by  Kering  and  its  Houses  for their sites and stores by the end of 2023.\n\nMonitoring Energy Use. While constantly seeking to maximize the  energy  efficiency  of  its  sites,  Kering  has  implemented  an energy consumption monitoring system which allows the Houses to  access  monthly  consumption  data  for  their  sites  on  an  IT platform.  The  system  also  streamlines  the  energy  procurement process by pooling and consolidating energy consumption, and increases the use of renewable energy.\n\nWaste Treatment. Kering and its Houses have created dedicated partnerships to find sustainable solutions for waste recycling in an  effort  to  minimize  the  waste  generated  by  the  Group's operations,  particularly  in  the  retail  sector.  In  addition,  as  the main source of the Group's hazardous waste production occurs in its  tanneries,  each  tannery  has  its  own  onsite  wastewater treatment plant, which pretreats all wastewater.\n\nMore Sustainable Packaging. Kering and its Houses make every effort  to  opt  for  the  most  sustainable  solutions  available  made from recycled or certified  biosourced materials. They also carry out initiatives to reduce the use of packaging while maintaining an  optimal  level  of  protection  for  the  goods  manufactured.  In 2020, Kering developed a new packaging standard setting out the eco-design  principles  to  improve  its  environmental  impact  of packaging  materials.  In  the  same  vein,  Kering  has  pledged  to eliminate  single-use  plastics  from  its  packaging  for  customers and business partners by 2025 and 2030, respectively.\n\nReducing  Water  Consumption. Kering  aims  to  reduce  the consumption of water in its operations: 68% of water consumed across  the  Group  is  used  for  domestic  purposes  and  32%  for industrial  purposes.  The  water  consumed  by  the  Group  for industrial  purposes  relates  primarily  to  tanneries.  However,  the Houses  have  continued  to  work  to  identify  innovative  tanning processes that eliminate heavy metals and use less water.\n\nProtecting  Biodiversity. Kering  is  committed  to  preserving biodiversity  through  several  conservation  and  regeneration programs for natural ecosystems. As noted above, the Group has formulated a Biodiversity Strategy, which aims to stem the loss of biodiversity, rebuild ecosystems, and rehabilitate species as well as  to  drive  systemic  change  throughout  the  supply  chain  and beyond.  Pursuant  to  its  commitments,  Kering  will  regenerate  a million  hectares  of  natural  ecosystems  in  its  supply  chains. Alongside  the  soil  regeneration  programs  already  launched several  years  ago  in  French  Guiana,  Mongolia  and  South  Africa, Kering set up the Kering Regenerative Fund for Nature in 2021. In practice,  the  Fund  makes  grants  to  groups  of  farmers,  project sponsors  and  NGOs  looking  to  develop  regenerative  raw materials (cotton, wool, cashmere, leather) and to connect them up  with  fashion  and  luxury  houses'  supply  chains.  To  date,  the Fund has selected seven projects in six different countries. Kering has  also  undertaken  to  protect  one  million  hectares  of  critical and  irreplaceable  habitats  outside  of  its  supply  chain  by  2025, primarily  through  programs  that  deliver  a  positive  impact  for biodiversity  protection,  carbon  sequestration  and  improved livelihoods for local communities. In late 2022, Kering launched the  Climate  Fund  for  Nature,  which  invests  in  nature-based solutions, to achieve this goal.",

        "page_content": "## 3.4.4 Risk Prevention and Mitigation Measures in Supply Chain Operations\n\nRaising Awareness among and Guiding Suppliers. Kering and its Houses conduct with multiple awareness-raising initiatives for suppliers, putting them in a position to comply with the highest social  and  environmental  standards.  For  instance,  the  Kering Material Innovation Lab has daily interactions with ready-to-wear and accessories suppliers to promote compliance with the Kering Standards.  Since  2020,  Kering  has  been  using  a  new  supplier portal,  which  can  be  accessed  online.  This  portal  is  a  tool  for conducting evaluations and sharing information and sustainability  practices.  Kering  Eyewear  has  also  invited  its principal Italian suppliers to a sustainability-focused training day.\n\nSustainability  Certifications. Multiple Kering and  House suppliers  have  obtained  third  party  sustainability  certifications covering  environmental  and  social  standards,  among  other aspects.  Kering  regularly  compares  the  standards  underpinning these  certifications  with  those  laid  down  by  its  Sustainability Principles  and  Kering  Standards  so  it  may  determine  which certifications  are  aligned  with  them  and  those  that  cannot  be accepted.\n\n## 3.4.4.1 Key Control Measures to Prevent Severe Impact on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\n\nNo Child Labor/Forced Labor. Kering and its Houses prohibit all forms of child labor or forced labor throughout the supply chain and consider them breaches for which they have zero tolerance, leading to immediate termination of the supplier relationship. As such, the audits performed as part of the Hercules management system include various measures to identify potential instances of  child  labor  or  forced  labor.  As  part  of  its  drive  to  detect  any unfair working  practices,  the  Kering  Supply  Chain  Audit Department performs a periodic analysis on suppliers to assess the cost of their work per minute, with any anomalies leading to targeted investigations.\n\nPromoting Inclusion and Diversity and Preventing Discrimination. Kering  and  its  Houses  expect  their  business partners  to  respect  and  promote  equal  opportunity  and treatment  at  work  and  to  create  an  inclusive  workplace.  In addition  to  the  commitments  included  in  the  Sustainability Principles,  the  audits  performed  as  part  of  the  Hercules management  system  also  review potential instances of discriminatory  practices  within  the  operations  of  suppliers.  In collaboration  with  the Camera  Nazionale  della  Moda and  three specialized  organizations  (BSR,  Wise  Growth,  and  Valore  D), Kering and its Italian Houses issued practical recommendations on enhancing gender equality in the Italian Luxury sector supply chain  following  an  extensive  study  that  investigated  challenges faced  by  women  in  this  supply  chain.  This  study  covered  more than  180  suppliers  and  surveyed  880  people  (70%  women)  on\n\ngender equality via in-person interviews and questionnaires. Four priority  focuses  were  identified  during  the  study:  (i)  \"working conditions  and  economic  opportunities,\"  (ii)  \"leadership  and career  advancement,\"  (iii)  \"motherhood\"  and  (iv)  \"workplace conduct  and  harassment\".  The  second  stage  of  the  project focused  on  implementing  the  recommendations  by  raising awareness of the four priorities identified. Kering also worked on a project focused on empowering women around gold mines in Ghana  using  tools  such  as  micro-loans  and  skills  training,  and worked  on  a  project  to  support  150  cotton  farmers  in  India through community education on women's rights, education and health and safety.\n\nFree  from  Harassment  and  Violence. Kering  and  its  Houses expect their suppliers to treat employees with dignity and respect and to prohibit physical punishment, mental or physical coercion or  verbal  abuse.  As  such,  suppliers  and  sub-suppliers  must  not engage  in  any  conduct  that  is  offensive,  abusive,  demeaning, intimidating  or  threatening,  such  as  verbal  abuse,  negative stereotyping, unwelcome contact or unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors.\n\nIncreased  Dialog. Kering  and  its  Houses  expect  their  business partners to engage in open and constructive dialog with workers and their representatives and to respect the right of workers to form  and  join  organizations  of  their  own  choosing  and  bargain collectively.  In  addition  to  the  commitments  included  in  the Sustainability  Principles,  the  audits  performed  as  part  of  the Hercules management system cover the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining among other rights.\n\nDecent Working Conditions. Kering expects its suppliers to pay their employees no less than the minimum legal standard or the appropriate  prevailing  industry  standard,  whichever  is  higher. Kering is committed to ensuring that workers in its supply chain are  fairly  compensated  for  their  work.  Kering  expects  business partners  to  comply  with  applicable  regulations  regarding working  hours,  which  should  not  exceed  48  hours  per  week. Wages  and  working  hours  are  also  checked  during  the  audits performed  as  part  of  the  Hercules  management  system,  which covers wages and working hours as well as subcontracting and the risk of illegally using subcontractors that underpay workers. Among  other  initiatives,  the  Group  is  actively  involved  in  the Utthan  project  in  India,  which  aims  to  empower  embroidery artisans,  in  particular  by  working  on  the  areas  of  a  living  wage and working hours regulations.\n\nProtecting  Against  Local  Community  Abuses. Kering  and  its Houses are committed to respecting and actively contributing to the economic and social development of the local communities impacted by their operations worldwide. In this respect,  Kering undertakes to avoid forced evictions and population displacements  linked  to  its  operations.  Kering  and  its  Houses encourage their suppliers and sub-suppliers to build a constructive  relationship  with  local  communities,  and  require them to source raw materials in strict accordance with the Kering Standards and the Sustainability Principles.\n\n323 -",

Kering and its Houses expect  their  business  partners  to  create  a  healthy  and  safe working environment through the implementation of appropriate effective measures to avoid jeopardizing the health and  safety  of  workers  in  the  workplace.  For  example,  suppliers are  obliged  to  provide  relevant  employees  with  the  personal protective equipment required under the applicable regulations free  of  charge  and  to  offer  them  training  on  relevant  safety standards  and  procedures  they  must  follow.  Employees  should also have free access to clean toilet facilities and potable water. The  audits  performed  as  part  of  the  Hercules  management system expressly  cover  select  issues  dedicated  to  the  review  of health and safety practices within the workplace.\n\nMinimizing Chemicals/Hazardous  Substances. As noted above,  Kering  is  committed  to  phasing  out  and  eliminating  all hazardous chemicals from its production processes. The Group's chemical  management  framework  goes  beyond  regulatory requirements  and  includes  specific  guidelines,  the  PRSL  and MRSL  lists  described  above,  that  identify  restricted  substances within  products  and  production  processes.  Kering  requires  all suppliers and  sub-suppliers to strictly comply  with  this framework and to report any non-compliance. Action programs and  specific  checks  are  carried  out  to  ensure  compliance  with these requirements.\n\n## 3.4.4.3 Key Control Measures Designed to Prevent Serious Environmental Damages\n\nEnvironmental Profit & Loss. As noted above, the EP&L is the cornerstone of the Group's environmental approach and allows Kering  and  its  Houses  to  measure  their  environmental  impact throughout  the  supply  chain.  Suppliers  and  sub-suppliers  are invited to share with Kering and its Houses information on factors including  atmospheric  emissions,  energy  use,  land  use,  waste production, water use and water discharge. As stated previously, the Group announced in April 2022 that it had achieved the target of a 40% reduction in the carbon intensity of its EP&L in 2021, four years ahead of schedule.\n\nSourcing  of  Raw  Materials. The  Group's  EP&L  clearly  shows that  most  of  the  environmental  impact  linked  to  products' lifecycle  and  marketing  (86%)  arises  upstream  of  its  supply chains through the production of raw materials and their initial transformation  process  (Tiers  3  and  4,  74%).  In  2023,  Kering traced 97% of its key raw materials back to their country of origin at  least,  and  even  further  for  animal-based  materials  (leather, and  precious  skins).  By  2025,  Kering  aims  to  achieve  100% traceability of its key raw materials at least as far as the country of origin and make certain that these are fully compliant with the Kering  Standards  so  it  can  further  reduce  its  environmental footprint. Kering scale up an internal purchasing platform to have access  to  high  quality,  sustainable  raw  materials  following  the success  of  the  Kering  Precious  Metals  Platform.  At  the  Houses' level, Kering Eyewear has developed a data-sharing platform for purposes that  include  enhancing  visibility  and  traceability  right across  its  supply  chain.  Saint  Laurent  and  Balenciaga  are currently rolling out other tools for improving the traceability of leather and textiles.\n\nReducing  Carbon  Emissions. As  stated  previously,  the  Group continues to offset its greenhouse gas emissions. In 2023, Kering voluntarily offset its Scope 1, 2 and 3 (calculated via the EP&L tool -  excluding  product  use  and  end  of  life)  greenhouse  gas emissions  amounting  to  2,135,568  tCO2  in  2022.  The  carbon credits were acquired from forestry and mangrove protection and reforestation  projects  and  follow  Kering's  internal  guidelines based  on  VCMI  (Voluntary  Markets  Integrity  Initiatives)  best practices.\n\nWaste  and  Packaging. Moving  away  from  the  conventional model  of  \"take  -  make  -  waste\"  is  not  only  about  recycling. Transitioning  to  a  truly  circular  economy  requires  a  complete rethink of the way we produce and use resources as well as the way  we  extend  the  life  of  products.  As  such,  Kering  released  a report  in  2021  presenting  its  new  circular  economy  goals  and helped  formulate  the  Ellen  MacArthur  Foundation's  vision  for circular  fashion,  published  in  October  2020  to  unite  the  sector around a common frame of reference and definitions. As regards materials used, the Kering Standards allow the Group's Houses to identify sourcing preferences - recycled, bio-sourced or certified - by material. As stated above, in line with the Group's Circularity Ambition,  the  Kering  Standards  now  include  a  section  on products' end of life in order to promote a circular economy. In addition,  the  Material  Innovation  Lab  provides  House  design teams  with  a  pool  of  sustainable  and  innovative  materials  and assists  them  in  the  selection  of  circular  materials.  Kering  also participates in the Clean by Design program to have the Houses propose free environmental related audits to suppliers, aimed at improving  their  environmental-related  practices,  especially  at reducing  waste  and  emissions.  Finally,  the  audits  performed  as part of the Hercules management system also investigate waste management practices of suppliers, including recycling practices.\n\nAnimal Welfare. Kering requires that its suppliers capture, farm, transport,  handle  and  slaughter  animals  in  compliance  with applicable  local  animal  welfare,  social,  environmental  and animal welfare laws and regulations. In terms of animal welfare, Kering has published its Standards for all animal species present in  its  supply  chains.  It  also  released  standards  covering  cattle, sheep and goats, among others, which account for a particularly sizable  proportion  of  the  leather  supply  chain.  Taking  its commitment to animal welfare to the next level, Kering decided that all of its Houses' collections would be fur-free starting from 2022.  Kering's  teams  and  those  of  its  Houses  make  numerous visits  to  farms  and  have  continued  to  engage  actively  with  the various potential and existing suppliers to assess and assist them in  improving  their  sustainable  environmental,  biodiversity,  and animal welfare management practices. The Group also continued to roll out its action plan for verifying the alignment of the Kering Standards  with  practices  in  its  exotic  skin  supply  chains.  The assessment is carried out with specific programs for each supply chain,  taking  into  account  the  characteristics  of  each  animal species  and  each  type  of  supplier.  In  this  respect,  it  is  worth noting that the Group and its Houses comply with national and international legislation and regulations on the trade of precious skins:  all  skins  of  species  listed  as  endangered  or  vulnerable  by the  Convention  on  International  Trade  in  Endangered  Species (\"CITES\")  are  obtained  with  certificates  attesting  to  their  legal origin,  issued  by  CITES  and  the  export  authority,  to  ensure  that trade does not threaten endangered species.",

        "page_content": "Protecting  Biodiversity. As  noted  above,  as  part  of  its biodiversity strategy updated in 2023 to strengthen its policy of tackling  deforestation  and  converting  ecosystems,  Kering  has committed to achieving a net positive impact on biodiversity by 2025.  To  achieve  this,  Kering  has  agreed  to  protect  one  million hectares  of  essential  and  irreplaceable  habitats  outside  of  its supply  chain,  and  facilitate  through  the  Regenerative  Fund  for Nature the transition to regenerative agricultural practices on an additional  one  million  hectares  in  areas  where  raw  materials entering  Kering's  supply  chain  are  extracted.  In  addition,  the Houses avoid sourcing materials with known negative impacts on\n\nthe  environment,  particularly  in  areas  of  critical  ecological importance.  As  specified  in  the  Kering  Standards,  this  includes ensuring that supplies are all sourced from materials that do not cause  deforestation  as  well  as  ensuring  that  materials  adhere closely  to  the  guidelines  as  published  within  the  framework  of CITES. When impacts are inevitable, Kering and its Houses strive to  reduce  negative  impacts  on  the  environment  by  sourcing materials  from  preferred  sources  as  defined  in  the  Kering Standards, which list  recommended third party certifications in our supply chains guaranteeing low-impact agricultural practices, such as organic farming for instance.\n\n## 3.5 Whistleblowing system\n\nIntroduced in 2005, Kering's whistleblowing system was enhanced initially in 2013 with the creation of two regional Ethics Committees  (Asia-Pacific  and  Americas),  supplementing  the Group  Ethics  Committee  established  in  2005,  and  further strengthened in 2018 to ensure compliance with France's Duty of Care  Law  and  Sapin  II  Law.  The  whistleblowing  system  was updated  to  satisfy  the  requirements  introduced  under  the Waserman Law no. 2022-401, with further enhancements being made continuously.  The  whistleblowing  system  is  accessible  to all  Group  employees,  external  and  temporary  staff  and  to  the employees  of  any  service  provider  or  external  partner  with  a contractual relationship with the Group and/or its Houses. Once the  whistleblowing  system  was  opened  up  to  all  suppliers  and service providers, these third parties were informed accordingly.\n\nKering is fully committed to keeping the identity of whistleblowers  and  the  information  they  provide  strictly confidential. It prohibits retaliatory action of any kind from being taken  against  those  who  blow  the  whistle  in  good  faith.  The Group's whistleblowing procedure in force is laid down in full in\n\nthe  Kering  Code  of  Ethics,  which  is  publicly  available  on  the Group's website.\n\nKering is committed to ensuring that all the information provided by  whistleblowers,  including  about  the  implementation  of  the Duty  of  Care  Law,  should  be  properly  addressed  and  adequate measures  taken  to  remedy  the  allegations,  if  they  prove  to  be well founded.\n\nIn 2020, Kering undertook an extensive communication campaign notably designed to remind the employees of its direct suppliers  of  its  whistleblowing  system  and  how  to  use  it.  The campaign was translated into 15 languages and took two forms: (i) a poster displayed in relevant locations at supplier and service provider  sites,  to  gain  the  greatest  visibility  (cafeteria,  locker rooms, site entrance, etc.) and (ii) a flyer to be given directly to employees.  This  campaign  has  been  updated  in  2021  to  target newly enlisted suppliers. More information on the roll-out of this campaign can be found in the Sustainability Chapter.\n\n## 3.6 Monitoring system designed to assess the effectiveness of the controls in place\n\nIn  line  with  the  cross-functional adopted by Kering to achieve a better  grasp  of  the  challenges  involved  in  upholding  human rights and protecting the environment, the Executive Committee, together with other Group-level committees, oversees implementation  of  the  various  measures  set  out  above.  These committees include the Sustainability Committee and the Audit Committee,  and  the  Chief  Audit  Executive,  the  Chief  People Officer  and  the  Chief  Sustainability  and  Institutional  Relations Officer  report  to  them  regularly  on  implementation  of  existing controls. A dedicated committee also oversees deployment of the Hercules management system.\n\nAs  noted  above,  Kering  periodically  updates  its  risk  map  to constantly review the controls designed to mitigate risks relevant to  the  Duty  of  Care  Law.  In  addition,  overall  implementation  of the  action  plans  drawn  up  on  the  basis  of  the  risk  mapping exercises  is  tracked  and  supervised  by  the  Group  Compliance Department. The Department also conducts compliance reviews to  ensure  that  the  Kering  compliance-related  policies  and procedures  are  properly  implemented  by  Group  entities  and Houses. The Compliance Department also monitors human rights and  environmental  rights  in  the  highest-risk  countries  for  its operations and supply chain.\n\nA  number  of  other  functions  at  the  Group  level,  including  the Sustainability Department and the Human Resources Department, also support the Houses with implementing Kering's policies and strategies. The implementation of the Kering internal control system within the Group's internal operations is assessed at  regular  intervals  by  the  Group  Internal  Audit  Department through the internal audits performed under the Group's annual audit plan.\n\nAs  noted  above,  the  Kering  Supply  Chain  Audit  Department conducts  regular  supply  chain  audits  designed  to  evaluate  the implementation  of  the  Kering  Sustainability  Principles  by  the Group's suppliers, including in the areas of human rights, health and  safety  and  environmental  protection.  The  most  serious anomalies  detected  during  these  audits  are  discussed  and evaluated  during  these  committee  meetings  attended  by  the Supply  Chain  Audit  Department  and  the  relevant  Houses  to consider  what  action  to  take  concerning  supplier  relationships. Dedicated follow-up audits, at intervals varying according to the risk profile and anomalies detected, are also arranged to confirm whether the suppliers have put an end to these.",

Kering is a global Luxury group that manages the development of a collection of renowned Houses in Fashion, Leather goods and Jewelry.\n\nOn  February  7,  2024,  the  Board  of  Directors  approved  the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 and authorized their publication. These  consolidated  financial statements will only be considered as final after their adoption by the April 25, 2024 Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 reflect the accounting position of Kering SA, its subsidiaries and its associates (the \"Group\").\n\nPursuant to European Regulation no. 1606/2002 of July 19, 2002, these  consolidated  financial  statements  were  prepared  in accordance  with  applicable  international  financial  reporting standards  (IFRSs)  as  endorsed  by  the  European  Union  and mandatorily applicable as of the reporting date.\n\nThe  accounting  policies  and  methods  applied  by  the  Group pursuant to IFRSs are set out in Note 33 - Accounting policies and methods.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, amounts are stated in millions of euros. In general,  amounts  stated  in  the  consolidated  financial statements  and  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements are  rounded  to  the  nearest  unit.  As  a  result,  the  sum  of  the rounded amounts may show non-material differences relative to the stated total.\n\n## NOTE 1 SIGNIFICANT EVENTS OF 2023\n\n## Acquisition of prestigious real-estate assets in Paris\n\nIn  2023,  Kering  acquired  three  prestigious  buildings  in  Paris, located on Rue de Castiglione (close to Place Vend\u00f4me in the first arrondissement ) and Avenue Montaigne (in the eighth arrondissement ).\n\nIn  accordance  with  its  long-term  financial  strategy,  the  Group intends  to  implement  a  disciplined  and  flexible  approach  to managing its real-estate portfolio.\n\nThose  investments  form  part  of  Kering's  selective  real-estate strategy aimed at securing key locations that are highly desirable for its Houses.\n\n## Kering Beaut\u00e9 acquires Creed, the high-end luxury heritage fragrance house\n\nOn June 26, 2023, Kering Beaut\u00e9 announced that it had signed an agreement  to  acquire  100%  of  Creed.  The  transaction  was completed  on  October  17,  2023  and  Creed  has  been  fully consolidated  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  since November 1, 2023.\n\nEstablished in 1760 by James Henry Creed, the House of Creed is the  largest  global  independent  player  in  the  fast-growing  highend fragrance market, with distinctive, timeless and sophisticated  fragrance  collections.  In  recent  years,  Creed  has delivered double-digit growth, along with outstanding profitability and  very  high  EBITDA  margins,  while  never compromising on product quality and maintaining its very strong brand  image.  In  its  financial  year  ended  March  31,  2023,  Creed generated  revenue  of  more  than  \u20ac250  million.

The  performance  adjustment  ratio  used  to calculate the final number of shares to be delivered is determined in  line  with  Kering's  share  performance  over  the  three-year vesting period versus the performance of the industry as a whole, as measured by an index of eight European luxury stocks. As well as  the  performance  conditions  applicable  to  all  beneficiaries, specific  performance conditions apply to the corporate officers, as  outlined  at  the  Annual  General  Meetings  of  June  16,  2020, April 22, 2021, April 28, 2022 and April 27, 2023.\n\n## Other free share and performance share plans\n\nKering  may  also  include  share-based  payments  in  plans specifically  introduced  for  key  executives  from  the  Houses, reflecting the creation of value at their respective brands.\n\nA plan of this type was set up in 2020 and was settled in Kering shares in 2023 after an accelerated vesting period of three years compared with the initial vesting period of five years.\n\nThe fair value of this benefit at the grant date was calculated by an  independent  expert  using  the  Black  &  Scholes  and  Monte Carlo methods, and amounted to \u20ac55 million.\n\n## NOTE 7 OTHER NON-RECURRING OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                                     | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Gains relating to changes in scope                  | 28     | 29     |\n| Capital gains on disposals of non-current assets    | 85     | -      |\n| Restructuring reversal                              | 35     | -      |\n| Other                                               | 19     | 4      |\n| Other non-recurring operating income                | 167    | 33     |\n| Losses relating to changes in scope                 | (1)    | (21)   |\n| Capital losses on disposals of non-current assets   | -      | -      |\n| Impairment of goodwill and other non-current assets | (70)   | (41)   |\n| Restructuring costs                                 | (111)  | (36)   |\n| Acquisition costs                                   | (39)   | (29)   |\n| Other                                               | (50)   | (101)  |\n| Other non-recurring operating expenses              | (270)  | (227)  |\n| Other non-recurring operating income and expenses   | (103)  | (194)  |\n\nRestructuring costs in 2023, net of reversals, mainly concern the continuation  of  the  restructuring  that  began  at  Gucci  in  2022.

They  do  not generate currency effects. Monetary  items  that  are  not denominated  in  the  functional currencies in which the subsidiaries  operate  undergo  currency  hedging  in  accordance with applicable procedures.\n\n## Analysis of sensitivity to foreign exchange risk\n\nBased on market data as of December 31, 2023, the direct impact on equity and income (excluding the tax effect) of a 10% increase or decrease in the euro exchange rate against the principal currencies to which the Group is exposed (USD, JPY and CNY) would be as follows:\n\n| Dec. 31, 2023   | Impact on equity   | Impact on equity   | Impact on income   | Impact on income   |\n|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| (in \u20ac millions) | 10% increase       | 10% decrease       | 10% increase       | 10% decrease       |\n| USD             | 134                | (164)              | -                  | -                  |\n| JPY             | 102                | (109)              | -                  | -                  |\n| CNY             | 37                 | (43)               | -                  | -                  |\n\n| Dec. 31, 2022   | Impact on equity   | Impact on equity   | Impact on income   | Impact on income   |\n|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| (in \u20ac millions) | 10% increase       | 10% decrease       | 10% increase       | 10% decrease       |\n| USD             | 197                | (240)              | -                  | -                  |\n| JPY             | 30                 | (36)               | -                  | -                  |\n| CNY             | 131                | (159)              | -                  | -                  |\n\nAll  other  market  variables  are  deemed  to  be  constant  when calculating sensitivity.\n\nThe  impact  on  equity,  recognized  in  the  \"Remeasurement  of financial  instruments\"  item,  results  from  foreign  exchange instruments eligible for cash flow hedge accounting.\n\nThe  impact  on  the  income  statement,  recognized  under \"Financial  result\",  relates  to  foreign  exchange  instruments  that are  not  eligible  for  hedge  accounting  and  to  the  change  in  the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges.\n\n## 21.3 Exposure to the risk of fluctuations in share prices\n\nThe Group is exposed to this risk through its PUMA shares (0.4% stake as of December 31, 2023), the valuation of which depends on movements in their share price (cf. Note 16.2).\n\nThe  Group  has  limited  exposure  to  other  shares  in  nonconsolidated investments, which are not hedged.\n\nBased on market data on the closing date, a change of 10% in PUMA's share  price  would  have  an  impact  of  \u20ac3  million  on  the value of the Group's interest in PUMA as recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n## 21.4 Exposure to the risk of fluctuations in precious metals prices\n\nThe  Group  may  be  exposed  to  changes  in  the  prices  of  certain precious metals through its Houses' activities, and particularly in its  jewelry  operations.  As  a  result,  hedging  may  be  arranged, particularly  through  derivative  financial  instruments  to  secure production  costs  or  through  price  negotiations  with  refiners  or producers of semi-finished products.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, hedging transactions with a remaining maturity of less than one year are treated as forward purchases with a notional amount of \u20ac6 million and a non-material market value (notional amount of \u20ac38 million as of December 31, 2022).\n\nThe Group's view is that a 1% change in these precious metals prices would have no impact as of the balance sheet date.",

These  additional benefits take the form of defined contribution or defined benefit plans.\n\nUnder  defined  contribution  plans,  the  Group  is  not  obliged  to make  any  additional  payments  beyond  contributions  already made. Contributions to these plans are expensed as incurred.\n\nAn actuarial valuation of defined benefit plans is carried out by independent experts. These benefits primarily concern mandatory supplementary pension plans in Switzerland, statutory  severance  pay  in  Italy,  and  retirement  termination payments and long-service bonuses in France.\n\n## Mandatory supplementary pension plans (LPP) - Switzerland\n\nIn Switzerland, pension plans are defined contribution plans that guarantee  a  minimum  interest  rate  credited  to  pension  assets and  provide  for  a  fixed  salary  conversion  rate  on  retirement. However, the pension plans operated by the Group's entities in Switzerland offer benefits over and above those mentioned in the LPP/BVG  pension  act.  Consequently,  a  provision  is  booked  in respect of defined benefit plans for the amounts that exceed LPP/ BVG pension act requirements.\n\nThese  pension  plans  are  generally  operated  as  separate  legal entities  in  the  form  of  a  foundation,  which  may  be  a  collective institution or affiliated to a specific plan. The Board of Trustees of these foundations, comprising an equal number of employer and employee  representatives,  is  responsible  for  administering  the plan  and  bears  the  investment  and  longevity  risks.  Collective foundations insure some of their risk with an insurance company.\n\n## Statutory severance pay (TFR) - Italy\n\nThe  TFR  (Trattamento  di  Fine  Rapporto)  plans  in  Italy  were created by Italian act no. 297, adopted on May 29, 1982, and are applicable to all workers in the private sector on the termination of  their  employment for any reason (resignation, termination at the employer's initiative, death, incapacity or retirement). Since 2007, companies with at least 50 employees have had to transfer their TFR funding to an external fund manager. This concerns the large majority of plans operated by Kering group companies.\n\n## Retirement termination payments and longservice bonuses - France\n\nIn France, retirement termination benefits are fixed and paid by companies to their  employees on retirement.  The  amount  paid depends on the number of years of service on retirement, and is defined  in  the  relevant  collective  bargaining  agreement.  The payments  do  not  confer  any  vested  entitlement  to  employees until they reach retirement age. Retirement termination benefits are  not  related  to  other  statutory  retirement  benefits  such  as pensions paid by social security bodies or top-up pension funds such  as  ARRCO  and  AGIRC  in  France,  which  are  defined contribution plans.\n\nLong-service bonuses are not compulsory in France - i.e. there is no legal obligation to pay these awards to employees - but they hold  symbolic  value.  Nevertheless,  some  of  Kering's  French entities choose to pay long-service bonuses after 20, 30, 35 and 40 years of service.",

The aim of the reform is to ensure that companies with consolidated revenue  or  consolidated  assets  of  more  than  \u20ac750  million  (as disclosed  in  their  consolidated  financial  statements  for  two consecutive  years)  pay  a  minimum  effective  income  tax  rate  of 15% in each of the jurisdictions in which they operate.\n\nThe amendment to IAS 12 provides for:\n\n- \u00b7 A temporary exemption from the recognition of deferred tax resulting from the implementation of this Pillar Two reform;\n- \u00b7 Specific disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements,  allowing  readers  to  understand  the  Group's exposure  based  on  information  that  is  known  or  can reasonably be estimated;\n- \u00b7 Separate presentation of the current tax that will result from the application of the Pillar Two provisions (after they come into force).\n\nSimulations  performed  by  the  Group  on  previous  years  show  a non-material impact as of the date of the reform.\n\n- \u00b7 IFRS  17  \"Insurance  contracts\"  and  amendments  to  IFRS  17 published in May 2017, June 2020 and December 2021.\n\nIFRS  17,  which  is  also  mandatorily  applicable  for  accounting periods starting on or after January 1, 2023, does not apply to the Group's  consolidated  financial  statements,  since  its  captive insurance companies  only  operate  internally and Group subsidiaries are their only insured beneficiaries.\n\nFinally,  as  of  the  accounts  closing  date,  the  Group  was  in  the process of analyzing the impact of standards, amendments and interpretations applicable on or after January 1, 2024.\n\n## 33.1.2 Changes to legislation\n\nOn April 14, 2023, France's pension reform act became law. The measures  resulting  from  that  reform  were  taken  into  account when determining the Group's liabilities as of December 31, 2023. The impact shown by that analysis is not material for the Group.\n\n## 33.1.3 Use of estimates and judgment\n\nThe  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  requires Group  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that can affect the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities, income and expenses, and the disclosures in the accompanying notes. Group  management  reviews  these  estimates  and assumptions on a regular basis to ensure they are appropriate in view  of  past  experience  and  the  current  economic  situation. Items  in  future  financial  statements  may  differ  from  current estimates as a result of changes in current assumptions.\n\nThe  main  estimates  made  by  the  Group's  management  when preparing the consolidated financial statements concern:\n\n- \u00b7 goodwill;\n- \u00b7 the useful lives associated  with  property,  plant  and equipment and intangible assets;\n- \u00b7 contingency provisions and uncertain tax positions;\n- \u00b7 inventory impairment provisions;\n- \u00b7 assumptions used to calculate lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities;\n- \u00b7 provisions for pensions and long-term remuneration including share-based payment;\n- \u00b7 the recognition of deferred tax assets;\n- \u00b7 and certain financial instruments.\n\nIn  its  main  estimates  and  in  its  risk  analysis,  the  Group  has taken into account:\n\n- \u00b7 the  impact  of  commitments  and  decisions  made  regarding the  reduction  of  carbon  emissions,  in  particular  when carrying out impairment tests;\n- \u00b7 the current macroeconomic context, including the increase in inflation,  even  though  the  Group  has  little  exposure  to  it. Hyperinflation  in  certain  countries,  particularly  Turkey  and Argentina, has no material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements;\n- \u00b7 official  inflation  rates  published  to  determine  the  actuarial assumptions  used  to  calculate  post-employment  benefits and the discount rates used in carrying out impairment tests and devising medium-term plans.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  use  of  estimates,  Group  management  uses judgment to determine the appropriate accounting treatment of certain transactions, pending the clarification of certain IFRSs or where prevailing standards do not cover the issue at hand.\n\n369 -",

The analysis carried out so far does not show any material impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\nIn 2023, Kering began work in view of the entry into force of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), involving all internal stakeholders and departments concerned (Risk Management, Finance, HR and Legal Departments, representatives of the Houses etc.). That work included changing the  approach  to  materiality  analysis  by  adopting  a  double materiality  analysis  approach,  the  methodology  of  which  was determined with the help of an independent consultancy in line with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (particularly ESRS 1 and 2). The review of issues, impacts and the associated  risks  and  opportunities  took  account  of  risk  factors already identified by the Group.\n\nWork carried out in 2022 and 2023 led to the conclusion that the Group's climate issues had no impact on the revenue and margin figures  used  in  carrying  out  impairment  tests.  Only  the  cost  of carbon  offsetting,  historically  allocated  to  Corporate  and  Other segment, has been allocated to the trajectories of each CGU or group of CGUs in proportion to their estimated consumption.\n\n## Proactive carbon offsetting strategy\n\nAt  the  15th  Conference  of  Parties  (COP)  of  the  Convention  on Biological  Diversity,  which  took  place  in  Montreal  in  December 2022,  Kering  and  upscale  sustainable  cosmetics  company L'Occitane announced that they were teaming up to create the Climate Fund for Nature.\n\nAs part of its proactive strategy to offset its carbon emissions, on February 16, 2023 Kering undertook to invest up to \u20ac100 million in  a  carbon  fund  managed  by  Natixis  subsidiary  Mirova.  This commitment  to  the  Climate  Fund  for  Nature  will  be  fulfilled gradually, mainly in the first eight years, through successive calls for funds driven by the funding needs of projects.\n\nThe  fund  invests  in  carbon  removal  and  avoidance  projects involving nature-based solutions that generate carbon credits for Kering  and  other  co-investors.  Those  carbon  credits  are transferred  to  its  shareholders  as  and  when  they  are  delivered through  a  forward  purchase  agreement  recognized  under  offbalance sheet commitments, and purchases of carbon credits for Kering's  own  use  will  be  recognized  as  they  arise  and  at  the contractual price.\n\n## Signature of a collective power purchase agreement\n\nOn  December  8,  2022,  The  Fashion  Pact  announced  that  its members  had  begun  plans  for  a  Collective  Virtual  Power Purchase  Agreement  (CVPPA),  the  aim  of  which  is  to  speed  up\n\nadoption of renewable energy sources by investing in new clean energy infrastructure, initially in Europe.\n\nAs  part  of  those  plans,  on  October  12,  2023  Kering  signed  a renewable  power  purchase  agreement,  involving  no  physical delivery,  with  Spain's  Caletona  Servicios  y  Gestiones.  Energy certificates arising from renewable energy production - under the European Energy Certificate System (EECS\u00ae) - will be transferred to the Kering group as the agreement is performed.\n\nThe agreement is for a 10-year term starting on the commercial operation date, which is likely to be March 1, 2026.\n\nSince the agreement was signed in late 2023, the impact on the financial  statements  on  the  accounts  closing  date  was  not material.\n\n## 33.1.5 Use of alternative performance indicators\n\nThe  alternative  performance  indicators  used  by  the  Group  and presented in the consolidated financial statements are:\n\n## Recurring operating income and other nonrecurring operating income and expenses\n\nThe  Group's  operating  income  includes  all  revenues  and expenses directly related to its activities, whether these revenues and expenses are recurring or arise from non-recurring decisions or transactions.\n\nOther  non-recurring  operating  income  and  expenses  consist  of items that, by their nature, amount or frequency, could distort the assessment of the Group's operating performance as reflected in its recurring  operating  income.  They  include  changes  in  scope,  the impairment  of  goodwill  and  brands  and,  where  material,  of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, capital gains and  losses  on  disposals  of  non-current  assets,  restructuring  costs and disputes (cf. Note 7).\n\n\"Recurring operating income\"  is  therefore  an  alternative performance  indicator  for  the  Group,  defined  as  the  difference between  operating  income  and  other  non-recurring  operating income and expenses. This indicator is intended to facilitate the understanding of the operating performance of the Group and its Houses and can therefore be used as a way to estimate recurring performance. It is presented in a manner that is consistent and stable  over  the  long-term  in  order  to  ensure  the  continuity  and relevance of financial information (cf. Note 3).\n\n## EBITDA\n\nThe Group uses EBITDA as an alternative performance indicator to  monitor  its  operating  performance.  This  financial  indicator corresponds  to  recurring  operating  income  plus  net  charges  to depreciation, amortization and  provisions on non-current operating  assets  recognized  in  recurring  operating  income  (cf. Note 3).\n\n## Effective tax rate on recurring income\n\nThe  effective  tax  rate  on  recurring  income  corresponds  to the effective tax rate excluding tax effects relating to other nonrecurring operating income and expenses (cf. Notes 7 and 9).",

        "page_content": "## Net debt\n\nNet  debt  is  one  of  the  Group's  main  financial  indicators,  and  is defined  as  borrowings  less  cash  and  cash  equivalents.  Lease liabilities  are  not  included  in  the  calculation  of  this  indicator. Borrowings include put options granted to minority interests (cf. Note 33.21).\n\n## 33.2 Consolidation principles\n\nThe  Group's  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the financial  statements  of  the  companies  listed  in  Note  34.  They include the financial statements of companies acquired as from the  acquisition  date  and  companies  sold  up  until  the  date  of disposal.\n\n## 33.2.1 Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries  are  all  entities  (including  structured  entities)  over which the Group exercises control. Control is defined according to three criteria: power over the investee; exposure, or rights, to variable  returns  from  involvement  with  the  investee;  and  the ability  to  exert  power  over  the  investee  to  affect  the  amount  of the  investor's  returns.  This  definition  of  control  implies  that power over an investee can take many forms other than simply holding voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights  are  considered  when  assessing  control,  if  the  rights  are substantive.  Control  generally  implies  directly  or  indirectly holding  more  than  50%  of  the  voting  rights  but  can  also  exist when a smaller proportion of voting rights is held.\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the effective date of control.\n\nIntercompany  assets  and  liabilities  as  well  as  transactions between  consolidated  companies  are  eliminated.  Gains  and losses  on  internal  transactions  with  controlled  companies  are fully eliminated.\n\n## 33.2.2 Associates\n\nAssociates are entities in which the Group exercises a significant influence  over  the  entity's  management  and  financial  policy, without  exercising  control  or  joint  control.  Significant  influence generally implies holding 20% to 50% of the voting rights.\n\nAssociates are accounted for under the equity method. They are initially  measured  at  cost,  except  when  the  associates  were previously  controlled  by  the  Group,  in  which  case  they are measured at fair value as of the date control is lost and the impact is recognized in the income statement.\n\nIn subsequent periods, the share in profits or losses of the associate attributable to the Group is recognized in \"Share in earnings (losses) of equity-accounted companies\", and the share in other comprehensive income of associates is carried on a separate line of the statement of comprehensive income. If the Group's share in the losses  of  an  associate  equals  or  exceeds  its  investment  in  that\n\nThe  cost  of  net  debt  corresponds  to  all  financial  income  and expenses  associated  with  these  items,  including  the  impact  of derivative instruments used to hedge the fair value of borrowings (cf. Note 8).\n\nassociate, the Group no longer recognizes its share of losses, unless it has legal or constructive obligations to make payments on behalf of the associate.\n\nGoodwill related to an associate is included in the carrying amount of  the  investment,  presented  separately  within  \"Investments  in equity-accounted companies\" in the balance sheet.\n\n## 33.2.3 Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations, where the Group acquires control of one or  more  other  activities,  are  recognized  using  the  acquisition method.\n\nBusiness combinations  are  recognized  and  measured  in accordance  with  the  provisions  of  IFRS  3.  Accordingly,  the consideration  transferred  is  measured  at  the  fair  value  of  the assets transferred, equity interests issued and liabilities incurred by the acquirer at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets and liabilities  are  generally  measured  at  their  fair  value  on  the acquisition date. Costs directly attributable to an acquisition are recognized within other non-recurring operating expenses in the income statement.\n\nGoodwill  is  recognized  to  represent  the  difference  between  the Group's share of the identified assets and liabilities measured at fair  value.  If  the  difference  is  negative,  a  gain  is  immediately recognized  in  the  income  statement  within  other  non-recurring operating income.\n\nThe Group may choose to measure any minority interests resulting from each business combination at fair value (full goodwill method) or at the proportionate share in the identifiable net assets acquired, which  are  also  generally  measured  at  fair  value  (partial  goodwill method).\n\nGoodwill is determined at the date of control over the acquired entity is obtained  and  may  not  be  adjusted  after  the measurement  period.  No  additional  goodwill  is  recognized  on any  subsequent  acquisition  of  minority  interests.  Acquisitions and  disposals  of  minority  interests  are  recognized  directly  in equity attributable to the Group.\n\nThe accounting for a business combination must be completed within  12  months  of  the  acquisition  date.  This  applies  to  the measurement of identifiable assets and liabilities, consideration transferred and minority interests.",

The Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which serves as its presentation currency.\n\n## 33.3.2 Foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the  entity's  functional  currency  at  the  exchange  rate  prevailing on the transaction date.\n\nMonetary  items  (assets  and  liabilities)  in  foreign  currencies  are translated at the closing exchange rate at the end of each reporting period.  Any  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  this translation  or  from  the  settlement  of  these  monetary  items  are recognized  within  other  financial  income  and  expenses  in  the income statement.\n\nNon-monetary items in foreign currencies valued at historical cost are  translated  at  the  rate  prevailing  on  the  transaction  date,  and non-monetary items in foreign currencies measured at fair value are translated  at  the  rate  prevailing  on  the  date  the  fair  value  is determined.  When  a  gain  or  loss  on  a  non-monetary  item  is recognized  directly  in  equity  within  other  comprehensive  income, similar treatment is applied to the foreign exchange component of this  gain  or  loss.  Otherwise,  the  component  is  recognized  in  the income statement.\n\n## 33.4 Operating segments\n\nIn  accordance  with  IFRS  8,  segment  information  is  reported  on the  same  basis  as  used  internally  by  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer and the Group Managing Director - the Group's chief  operating  decision  makers  -  to  allocate  resources  to segments and assess their performance.\n\nAn operating segment is a separate component of the Group that engages in business activities  from  which  it  may  earn  revenues and  incur  expenses,  whose  operating  results  are  regularly reviewed by the entity's chief operating decision maker, and for which discrete financial information is available. Each operating segment is monitored separately for internal reporting purposes, according  to  performance  indicators  common  to  all  of  the Group's  segments.  The  segments  presented  are  operating segments or groups of similar operating segments.\n\nFinancial information  provided  on  operating  segments  is prepared in accordance with the same accounting rules as in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe  treatment  of  currency  hedges  in  the  form  of  derivatives  is described in Note 33.17.\n\n## 33.3.3 Currency translation of foreign subsidiaries' financial statements\n\nThe  income  statements  and  balance  sheets  of  Group  entities with  a  functional  currency  that  differs  from  the  presentation currency are translated into euros as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 items  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  other  than  equity  are translated  at  the  exchange  rate  at  the  end  of  the  reporting period;\n- \u00b7 items in the income statement are translated at the average exchange rate for the period, corresponding to an approximate value for the rate at the transaction date in the absence of significant fluctuations;\n- \u00b7 translation  differences  are  recognized  directly  in  equity within  other  comprehensive  income  as  currency  translation adjustments.\n\nGoodwill  and  fair  value  adjustments  arising  from  a  business combination  with  a  foreign  activity  are  recognized  in  the functional currency of the entity acquired. They are subsequently translated into the Group's presentation currency at the closing exchange  rate,  and  any  resulting  differences  are  recognized directly in equity within other comprehensive income as currency translation adjustments.\n\nThe performance of each operating segment is measured based on recurring operating income, which is the approach used by the Group's chief operating decision maker.\n\nRecurring  charges  to  depreciation,  amortization  and  provisions on non-current operating assets reflect net charges to depreciation,  amortization  and  provisions  on  intangible  assets, lease  right-of-use  assets  and  property,  plant  and  equipment recognized in recurring operating income.\n\nAcquisitions  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  intangible assets correspond  to  gross  non-current  asset  purchases, including cash timing differences, as presented in the consolidated cash statement.\n\nThe presentation of revenue by region is based on the geographic location of clients.",

When  such  returns  are not contractual, the provision for returns is estimated based on\n\n## 33.6 Personnel expenses\n\nPersonnel expenses primarily consist of wages, salaries and payroll taxes,  expenses  relating  to  pensions  and  other  post-employment benefits under defined benefit plans (see Note 33.22), and expenses related  to  share-based  payments  (see  Note  33.7).  Wages,  salaries and  payroll  taxes  include  fixed  remuneration,  variable  short-term\n\nremuneration,  long-term  remuneration  plans,  expenses  related  to employee  profit-sharing  and  other  incentive  plans,  and  any associated  payroll  taxes.  Other  personnel  expenses  include severance paid to individual employees or as part of a restructuring plan, and directors' fees paid to directors of Group entities.\n\n## 33.7 Share-based payment\n\nThe Group may operate long-term variable remuneration plans that  feature  share-based  payments.  These  plans  are  classified as either cash-settled plans or plans settled in Kering shares.\n\n- \u00b7 Cash-settled  plans  result  in  the  recognition  of  personnel expenses in the income  statement  spread  over  the entitlement vesting period, along with a matching liability in the balance sheet. The fair value of the benefit granted to the beneficiaries  is  remeasured  at  the  end  of  each  reporting period, taking into account any changes in market-based or internal performance conditions.\n- \u00b7 Plans  settled  in  Kering  shares  result  in  the  recognition  of personnel expenses in the income statement spread over the entitlement  vesting  period,  and  of  an  offsetting  entry  in equity attributable to the Group. The fair value of the benefit granted to the beneficiaries is set at the grant date of the plan using  the  Black  &  Scholes  and  Monte  Carlo  models,  which\n\n## 33.8 Income taxes\n\nIncome  tax  expense  comprises  the  current  and  deferred  tax expense.\n\nDeferred  tax  is  calculated  using  the  liability  method  on  all temporary differences between the carrying amount recorded in the consolidated balance sheet and the tax value of assets and liabilities,  except  for  goodwill  that  is  not  deductible  for  tax purposes and certain other exceptions. The valuation of deferred tax balances depends on the way in which the Group intends to recover  or  settle  the  carrying  amount  of  assets  and  liabilities, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the closing date.\n\nDeferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  not  discounted  and  are presented  separately  in  the  balance  sheet  within  non-current assets and liabilities.\n\ntake into account  the  impacts  of  any  market-based performance conditions from the inception of the plan. The impacts  of  any  internal-based  performance  conditions  are remeasured at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe payroll taxes relating to these long-term variable remuneration plans are also recognized in personnel expenses in the income statement as and when entitlements under the plans vest, with a matching liability in the balance sheet, regardless of whether the plans are settled in cash or in Kering shares. These payroll taxes are remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the most certain assumptions as regards the outcome of  the  plans.  Payroll  taxes  relating  to  plans  settled  in  Kering shares  reflect  the  best  estimate  of  the  number  of  shares  to  be delivered  upon  expiry  of  the  plan  at  the  end  of  each  reporting period.\n\nA  deferred  tax  asset  is  recognized  on  deductible  temporary differences  and  for  tax  loss  and  credit  carry-forwards  to  the extent that their future offset is probable.\n\nA  deferred  tax  liability  is  recognized  on  taxable  temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and associates unless the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nUncertain  income  tax  positions  are  analyzed  and  reviewed internally in accordance with IAS 12 and IFRIC 23 and are shown on the balance sheet in the \"current tax liabilities\" line item.\n\nhistorical  data.  Provisions  for  returns  are  presented  in  the balance  sheet  under  liabilities  in  respect  of  future  refunds.  An asset (with an offsetting adjustment corresponding to the cost of sales) representing the right to recover the goods from the client is also recognized.\n\n## 33.5.2 Royalties from operating licenses\n\nRoyalties  received  with  respect  to  operating  licenses  are recognized  in  accordance  with  the  contractual  obligations specific  to  each  agreement,  over  time  as  the  performance obligation is satisfied, for example, when calculated based on the value of the underlying sales generated by the licensee under the agreement.",

The  CGUs  or  groups  of  CGUs  to  which  goodwill  has  been allocated  are  tested  for  impairment  each  year,  or  whenever events  or  circumstances  indicate  that  an  impairment  loss  is likely.\n\n## 33.11 Brands and other intangible assets\n\nBrands  and  other  intangible  assets  are  recognized  at  cost  less accumulated amortization and impairment.\n\nBrands  and  intangible  assets  acquired  as  part  of  a  business combination, which are controlled by the Group and are separable or  arise  from  contractual  or  other  legal  rights,  are  recognized separately from goodwill.\n\nBrands, which represent the majority of intangible assets within the Group,  are  intangible  assets  with  indefinite  useful  lives  and  are therefore  not  amortized  but  are  tested  as  part  of  the  impairment test carried out on CGUs. Where that test indicates an impairment loss, brands are tested separately.\n\nEarnings  per  share  from  continuing  operations  excluding  nonrecurring  items  is  also  calculated  by  adjusting  net  income  from continuing operations attributable to the Group for the amount of non-recurring items net of tax. Non-recurring items correspond to  other  non-recurring  operating  income  and  expenses  in  the income statement (cf. Note 33.1.5).\n\nCGUs  or  groups  of  CGUs  and  the  related  impairment  tests  are described in Note 33.12.\n\nOther intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are  tested  for  impairment  when  there  is  an  indication  that  an impairment loss has taken place. The usual useful lives are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Brands: indefinite;\n- \u00b7 Internal IT developments, software and websites: 1-8 years;\n- \u00b7 Rights,  patents  and  other  intellectual  property:  5-2    years (maximum protection period).\n\nThe configuration and customization costs of software as part of a  Saas  (Software  as  a  service)  arrangement  are  analyzed  and recorded in expenses for the period where they do not meet the criteria for capitalization under IAS 38.\n\nSoftware developed in-house by the Group and meeting all the relevant  criteria  is  capitalized  and  amortized  on  a  straight-line basis over its useful life.\n\nImpairment tests are described in Note 33.12.\n\n## 33.12 Cash-generating units and impairment tests\n\nThe  Group  tests  the  value  of  its  assets  at  the  level  of  its  cashgenerating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs. Impairment tests are performed  each  year,  or  whenever  events  or  circumstances indicate that an impairment loss is likely. A CGU is the smallest group of assets, including goodwill, that generates cash inflows from  continuing  use  that  are  largely  independent  of  the  cash inflows from other assets or CGUs.\n\nCGUs or groups of CGUs as defined by the Group represent the various brands under which the Group operates (cf. Note 33.4).\n\nImpairment  tests  seek  to  determine  whether  the  recoverable amount  of  a  CGU  is  less  than  its  net  carrying  amount.  The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair  value  less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is determined with respect to future cash flow projections, taking into account the time value of money and the specific risks attributable to the CGU or group of CGUs.\n\nFuture cash flow projections are based on medium-term budgets and  plans.  These  plans  are  drawn  up  for  a  period  of  five  years with  the  exception  of  certain  CGUs  or  groups  of  CGUs undergoing strategic repositioning, for which a longer period may be  applied  (typically  ten  years).  To  calculate  value  in  use,  a terminal  value  equal  to  the  perpetual  capitalization  of  a normative annual cash flow is added to the estimated future cash flows. The perpetual growth rates are appropriate in view of the country  mix,  since  the  Group  now  operates  in  regions  whose markets are enjoying faster-paced growth than in Europe.\n\nWhen the CGU's recoverable amount is less than its net carrying amount,  an  impairment  loss  is  recognized.  Impairment  is charged  first  to  goodwill  and  recognized  under  \"Other  nonrecurring  operating  income  and  expenses\"  in  the  income statement (cf. Note 33.1.5).",

Impairment  recognized  in respect of goodwill may not be reversed.\n\n## 33.13 Leases\n\nThe Group applies IFRS 16 for all of its leases, with the exception of:\n\n- \u00b7 short-term leases, with a lease term of 12 months or less as of the commencement date;\n- \u00b7 leases for which the underlying asset is of low value.\n\nPayments  under  these  leases  that  are  not  recognized  on  the balance  sheet  are  recognized  as  operating  expenses  on  a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nUnder IFRS 16, for each affected lease, the following items are recognized in the balance sheet as of the commencement date:\n\n- \u00b7 a  lease  liability,  corresponding  to  the  present  value  of  all  fixed future payments for the estimated term of the lease. The current and  non-current  portions of these liabilities are shown separately. Fixed future lease payments include the remeasurement of any payments that depend on an index or a growth rate established in the lease. They may also include the value  of  any  purchase  options  or  estimated  penalties  for terminating the lease, where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise these  options.  In  addition,  any  lease  incentives receivable  as  of  the  commencement  date  are  deducted  from fixed payments;\n- \u00b7 a  lease  right-of-use  asset,  corresponding to the value of the lease liability less any incentives received from the lessor and plus any prepaid lease payments, initial direct costs and the estimated cost of restoring the asset where required by the terms and conditions of the lease.\n\nAfter  the  start  of  the  lease,  the  liability  related  to  future  lease payments  is  reduced  by  the  amount  of  payments  made  with respect  to  lease  payments,  and  increased  by  the  amount  of\n\n## 33.14 Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  recognized  at  amortized historical cost less any impairment losses, with the exception of land, which is not depreciated. They are not revalued.\n\nThe  various  components  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are recognized  separately  when  their  estimated  useful  life  and therefore  their  depreciation  periods  are  significantly  different. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes the expenses that are directly attributable to its acquisition.\n\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, based on the purchase price or production cost, less any residual value, which is reviewed annually if considered material.\n\nThe usual useful lives are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Buildings: 10-100 years;\n- \u00b7 Improvements and fixtures: 3-15 years;\n- \u00b7 Improvements  to  leased  assets:  3-10  years  (limited  to  the lease term defined in accordance with IFRS 16);\n\nFor  2023,  the  way  in  which  the  Group  took  into  account the macroeconomic situation and climate issues in its impairment tests is described in Notes 33.1.3 and 33.1.4.\n\ninterest.  The  liability  may  be  remeasured  to  reflect  a  new assessment of, or change in, future lease payments. The right-ofuse asset, initially measured at cost including the lessee's direct costs and  prepayments,  minus  lease  incentives  (rent-free periods)  and  restoration  costs,  is  depreciated  on  a  straight-line basis over the lease term as defined in accordance with IFRS 16.\n\nIFRS  16  provides  that  the  discount  rate  for  each  lease  is determined  with  reference  to  the  incremental  borrowing  rate, which corresponds to the rate of interest that the Group would have  to  pay  to  borrow  over  a  similar  term,  and  with  similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the lease right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment.\n\nThe incremental borrowing rates applied by the Group are based on  a  combination  of  risk-free  interest  rate  curves  per  currency/ country,  euro/foreign  currency  swap  points,  and  the  Group's credit  spread,  also  accounting  for  the  nature  of  the  underlying (real estate) asset.\n\nAn  \"industry\"  beta,  which  varies  according  to  the  lessee's operating segment, is added to these inputs to reflect the specific risk of each activity.\n\nThe rate curves take into account the average lease term and are prepared on a quarterly basis.\n\nLease rights are a separate component of right-of-use assets and are depreciated over the term of the underlying leases, less any residual value. This residual value is tested for impairment each year and an impairment loss is recognized where necessary.\n\nThe Group recognizes deferred tax in relation to the right-of-use asset and lease liability.\n\n- \u00b7 Plant and equipment: 3-20 years;\n- \u00b7 Other property, plant and equipment: 2-7 years.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when an indication of impairment exists, such as a scheduled closure of a  store  or  site,  a  redundancy  plan  or  a  downward  revision  of market  forecasts.  When  an  asset's  recoverable  amount  is  less than its net carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. Where the recoverable amount of an individual asset cannot be determined  precisely,  the  Group  determines  the  recoverable amount of the CGU or group of CGUs to which the asset belongs.\n\nWhen  an  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is  sold,  the disposal  gain  or  loss  resulting  from  the  difference  between  the selling  price  and  the  carrying  amount  of  the  assets  sold  is recognized in the income statement.",

There  are three categories of financial assets:\n\n- \u00b7 financial assets measured at amortized cost;\n- \u00b7 financial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  through  the  income statement (profit or loss);\n- \u00b7 financial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  in  equity  through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe  Group  determines  the  classification  of  its  financial  assets upon  initial  recognition,  based  on  their  characteristics  and  the management  objective  behind  the  asset's  purchase.  Purchases and  sales  of  financial  assets  are  recognized  on  the  transaction date, which is the date the Group is committed to the purchase or sale  of  the  asset.  A  financial  asset  is  derecognized  if  the contractual  rights  to  the  cash  flows  from  the  financial  asset expire or the asset is transferred.\n\n## 33.15.1 Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial assets are carried at amortized cost if they are held as part of a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThis  category  includes  loans  and  receivables,  deposits  and guarantees,  trade  receivables  and  most  other  current  and  noncurrent receivables.\n\nThese  financial  assets  are  initially  recognized  at  fair  value  and subsequently  at  amortized  cost  using  the  effective  interest method.\n\nThe effective interest rate is determined for each transaction and corresponds  to  the  rate  that  would  provide  the  net  carrying amount of the financial asset by discounting its estimated future cash  flows  until  maturity.  The  calculation  includes  transaction costs  and  any  premiums  and/or  discounts.  Transaction  costs correspond to the costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue  of  a  financial  asset.  Net  gains  and  losses  on  loans  and receivables relate to interest income and impairment allowances.\n\nImpairment allowances are recognized in the income statement based on the expected loss model:\n\n- \u00b7 for its trade receivables, the Group applies a provision matrix for  each country/brand based on historical loss data. Credit insurance that may be taken out by the Group is taken into account in the measurement of the risk and therefore of the provision;\n- \u00b7 for  other  financial  assets  measured  at  amortized  cost,  an analysis is carried out taking into account the probability of counterparty default.\n\n## 33.15.2 Financial assets measured at fair value through the income statement\n\nFinancial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  through  the  income statement  mostly  comprise  financial  assets  giving  rise  to contractual cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThis category includes:\n\n- \u00b7 non-consolidated investments and other financial investments,  unless  the  Group  has  chosen  to  carry  specific investments at fair value under the fair value option, in which case  they  are  recognized  directly  in  equity  through  other comprehensive income;\n- \u00b7 financial assets held by the Group for trading purposes that the  Group  intends  to  resell  in  the  near  future  and  that  are part of a portfolio of financial instruments that are managed together  and  for  which  there  is  evidence  of  a  recent  actual pattern of short-term profit-taking;\n- \u00b7 assets designated as at fair value under the fair value option.\n\nChanges in the fair value of these assets are taken to the income statement.  Net  gains  or  losses  arising  on  financial  assets measured at fair value through the income statement generally correspond  to  interest  income,  dividends,  changes  in  the  fair value of the assets (unrealized gains or losses) and capital gains or losses on disposals (realized gains or losses).\n\n## 33.15.3 Financial assets measured at fair value in equity through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets are carried at fair value directly in equity through other  comprehensive  income  when  they  are  held  as  part  of  a business  model  whose  objective  is  achieved  both  by  collecting contractual  cash  flows  (corresponding  solely  to  payments  of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding) and selling these financial assets.\n\nThis  category  includes  debt  instruments,  such  as  bonds,  that have the contractual cash flow and business model characteristics set out above.\n\nIt may  also  include  non-consolidated  investments  or  other financial investments, in which case changes in the fair value of the  assets  are  recognized  directly  in  equity  through  other comprehensive  income  until  the  assets  are  sold,  with  the exception  of  dividends  received,  which  are  systematically recognized in the income  statement  irrespective  of  the classification of the underlying financial asset.",

There  are  two categories of financial liabilities:\n\n- \u00b7 financial liabilities measured at amortized cost;\n- \u00b7 financial liabilities measured at fair value through the income statement (profit or loss).\n\nThe Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities upon initial recognition, based on their characteristics.\n\n## 33.16.1 Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial liabilities are carried at amortized cost if they are held as  part  of  a  business  model  whose  objective  is  to  disburse contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThis  category  includes  borrowings  (with  the  exception  of put options granted to minority interests - cf. Note 33.21), trade payables and most other current and non-current liabilities.\n\nThese financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs, and subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## 33.17 Derivative instruments\n\n## 33.17.1 Derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments\n\nThe  Group  uses  various  derivative  instruments  to  reduce  its exposure to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and the risk of movements in the prices of certain precious metals.\n\nDerivative instruments are recognized in the balance sheet within current or non-current financial assets and liabilities, depending on their maturity. They are recognized at fair value as from the transaction date.\n\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments are classified by category  of  hedge  based  on  the  nature  of  the  risks  being hedged:\n\n- \u00b7 a  cash  flow  hedge  is  used  to  hedge  the  risk  of  changes  in future  cash  flow  from  recognized  assets  or  liabilities  or  a highly  probable  transaction  that  would  impact  the  income statement;\n- \u00b7 a fair value hedge is used to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value  of  recognized  assets  or  liabilities  or  a  firm commitment  not  yet  recognized  that  would  impact  the income statement;\n\nHedge  accounting  can  only  be  applied  if  all  of  the  following conditions are met:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 3: financial assets whose fair value is determined using valuation  techniques  drawing  on  non-observable  inputs (inputs  whose  value  does  not  result  from  the  price  of observable  market  transactions  for  the  same  instrument  or from observable market data available as of the end of the reporting period) or inputs which are only partly observable.\n\nThe effective interest rate is determined for each transaction and corresponds  to  the  rate  that  would  provide  the  net  carrying amount  of  the  financial  liability  by  discounting  its  estimated future  cash  flows  until  maturity.  The  calculation  includes transaction costs and any premiums and/or discounts. Transaction costs correspond to the costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial liability.\n\nThe  net  carrying  amount  of  financial  liabilities  measured at  amortized  cost  that  qualify  as  hedged  items  as  part  of  a fair  value  hedging  relationship  is  adjusted  with  respect  to the hedged risk (cf. Note 33.17.1).\n\n## 33.16.2 Financial liabilities measured at fair value through the income statement\n\nThe  Group  may  elect  to  carry  some  financial  liabilities  at  fair value  through  the  income  statement.  In  this  case,  unlike  in  the amortized  cost  method,  the  transaction  costs  associated  with setting  up  these  financial  liabilities  are  recognized  immediately within  other  financial  income  and  expenses  in  the  income statement.\n\n- \u00b7 the hedged instrument and the hedging instrument are both eligible;\n- \u00b7 there  is  a  formal  designation  and  documentation  of  the hedging relationship as of the date of inception;\n- \u00b7 there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.\n\nThe accounting treatment of derivative instruments qualified as hedging instruments, and their impact on the income statement and  balance  sheet,  differ  depending  on  the  type  of  hedging relationship:\n\n- \u00b7 for cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially recognized directly in equity through other comprehensive income. They are  then  transferred  to  the  income  statement  when  the hedged items are recognized. For foreign currency derivatives,  the  effective  portion  is  recorded  in  operating income,  and  the  ineffective  portion,  option  premiums  and difference between  spot  and  forward  exchange  rates (contango/backwardation)  are  recorded  within  \"Financial result\";\n- \u00b7 for  fair  value  hedges,  gains  and  losses  are  recorded  in  the income  statement  in  the  same  item  as  the  hedged  items, except  for  the  ineffective  portion,  which  is  always  recorded within \"Financial result\".",

When they are not closely related to the underlying instrument, these embedded derivatives are recognized separately  in  the  balance  sheet  as  a  derivative  instrument  held for trading. Any changes in their fair value are taken in full in the income statement in other financial income and expenses within \"Financial result\".\n\nAn  impairment  allowance  on  inventories  is  recognized  on  the basis  of  expected  inventory  turnover  and  obsolescence  and  if they are damaged.\n\nInvestments with a maturity exceeding three months, along with blocked or pledged bank accounts, are excluded from cash and cash equivalents.\n\nBank  overdrafts  are  presented  in  borrowings  on  the  liabilities side  of  the  balance  sheet.  In  the  statement  of  cash  flows, cash  and  cash  equivalents  at  the  opening  and  closing  of the reporting period include bank overdrafts.\n\nOn disposal, the consideration received for these shares, net of transaction costs and the related tax impacts, is also recognized directly in equity attributable to the Group.\n\n## 33.21 Put options granted to minority interests\n\nThe Group has undertaken to repurchase the minority interests of shareholders of certain subsidiaries. The strike price of these put options  may  be  set  or  determined  according  to  a  predefined calculation formula, and the options may be exercised either at any time or on a specific date.\n\nThe  Group  recognizes  a  financial  liability  in  respect  of  any  put options granted to minority interests. This liability is recognized at the present value of the best estimate of the strike price, with an  offsetting  entry  in  equity  attributable  to  the  Group.  Any subsequent  changes  in  the  financial  liability  relating  to  put options  granted  to  minority  interests  are  recognized  directly  in equity, including the impact of unwinding the discount.\n\nThe financial liability recognized in respect of put options granted to minority interests is shown in the balance sheet within current and non-current borrowings, as appropriate. Put options granted to  minority  interests  are  therefore  included  in  consolidated  net debt (see Note 33.1.5).\n\nDepending on the agreements signed by the Group with minority interests,  minority  shareholders  may  in  some  cases  waive  their dividend rights until the put option is exercised. In this case, the corresponding  minority  interests  are  canceled,  with  a  direct offsetting entry in equity attributable to the Group. If the minority interests retain their dividend rights until the option is exercised however,  the  minority  interests  continue  to  be  shown  in  the balance sheet.",

        "page_content": "## 33.22 Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits\n\nBased  on  the  laws  and  practices  of  each  country,  the  Group recognizes various types of employee  benefits,  including pensions and other post-employment benefits.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nUnder  defined  contribution  plans,  the  Group  is  not  obliged  to make additional payments over and above contributions already made to a fund if the fund does not have sufficient assets to cover the  benefits  corresponding  to  services  rendered  by  personnel during  the  current  period  and  prior  periods.  Contributions  paid into  these  plans  are  expensed  in  the  income  statement  as incurred.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nUnder  defined  benefit  plans,  obligations  are  valued  using  the projected  unit  credit  method  based  on  agreements  in  effect  in each entity. Under this method, each period of service gives rise to  an  additional  unit  of  benefit  entitlement  and  each  unit  is measured  separately  to  build  up  the  final  obligation.  The obligation is then discounted. The actuarial assumptions used to determine  the  obligations  vary  according  to  the  economic conditions  of  the  country  where  the  plan  is  established.  These plans  are  valued  by  independent  actuaries  on  an  annual  basis.\n\n## 33.23 Provisions\n\nProvisions for litigation, disputes and miscellaneous contingencies  and  losses  are  recognized  as  soon  as  a  present obligation arises from past events, which is likely to result in an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits, the amount of which can be reliably estimated.\n\nProvisions  maturing  in  more  than  one  year  are  valued  at  their discounted  amount,  representing  the  best  estimate  of  the expense necessary to extinguish the current obligation at the end of  the  reporting  period.  The  discount  rate  used  reflects  current assessments of the time value of money and specific risks related to the liability.\n\nThe valuations take into account the level of future compensation,  the  probable  active  life  of  employees,  life expectancy and staff turnover.\n\nThe provision recognized in the balance sheet corresponds to the present  value  of  the  obligations  calculated  as  described  above, less  the  fair  value  of  the  plans'  financial  assets  under  wholly funded pension plans.\n\nThe  current  service  cost  for  these  plans  is  recognized  within personnel  expenses  in  the  income  statement.  The  interest  cost relating to the benefit obligation net of interest income on plan assets under wholly funded plans is recognized in other financial income and expenses within \"Financial result\". Past service cost, designating the increase in an obligation following the introduction of a new plan or the impact of amendments to an existing plan, is expensed immediately in the income statement within  personnel  expenses,  regardless  of  whether  or  not  the benefit entitlement has already vested or is still vesting.\n\nChanges in actuarial assumptions and the impact of experience adjustments (the difference between outcomes estimated using actuarial assumptions and actual outcomes) give rise to actuarial gains  and  losses,  which  are  recognized  directly  in  equity  within other  comprehensive  income.  These  actuarial  gains  and  losses are never transferred to the income statement.\n\nA provision for restructuring costs is recognized when there is a formal and detailed restructuring plan and the plan has begun to be  implemented  or  its  main  features  have  been  announced before  the  end  of  the  reporting  period.  Restructuring  costs  for which a provision is made essentially represent employee costs (severance pay, early retirement plans, payment in lieu of notice, etc.), work stoppages and compensation for breaches of contract with third parties.\n\n## 33.24 Discontinued operations, assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale\n\nThe  Group  applies  IFRS  5,  which  requires  the  separate recognition and presentation of assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations.\n\nNon-current  assets,  or  groups  of  assets  and  liabilities  directly associated with those assets, are considered as held for sale if it is highly  probable  that  their  carrying  amount  will  be  recovered principally  through  a  sale  rather  than  through  continuing  use. Non-current  assets  (or  disposal  groups)  held  for  sale  are measured  and  recognized  at  the  lower  of  their  net  carrying amount  and  their  fair  value  less  the  costs  of  disposal.  These assets are no longer depreciated or amortized from the time they qualify  as  assets  (or  disposal  groups)  held  for  sale.  They  are presented  on  separate  lines  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet, without restatement for previous periods.\n\nA discontinued operation is defined as a component of a group that generates cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group and represents a separate line of business or geographical  area  of  operations.  For  all  periods  presented,  the net income or loss from these activities is shown on a separate line of the income statement within discontinued operations and is restated in the statement of cash flows.",

        "page_content": "## NOTE 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS\n\nThe annual financial statements are prepared in accordance with regulation no. 2014-03 of the French accounting standards authority ( Autorit\u00e9 des normes comptables - ANC).\n\n## 2.1 Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets are recorded in the balance sheet at their acquisition cost, which includes all expenses that can be directly attributed to them and that are necessary for them to operate or be brought into service. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method based on the nature and useful life of each component.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are depreciated and intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method and the following useful lives:\n\n| Software                                     | 1 to 5 years   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Internally generated software                | 3 to 10 years  |\n| Improvements to property                     | 10 to 24 years |\n| Technical installations, tools and equipment | 10 to 15 years |\n| Computer equipment                           | 1 to 10 years  |\n| Office furniture                             | 10 years       |\n\n## 2.2 Long-term investments\n\n## Investments\n\nSecurities  classified  as  \"Investments\"  are  those  considered necessary for the Company's activities, particularly because they provide  the  Company  with  influence  over,  or  control  of,  the issuer.\n\nThe Company recognizes acquisition expenses in the cost price of investments,  in  accordance  with  the  standard  method  under French generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nAs  of  the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  the  gross  value  of investments  is  compared  to  their  recoverable  value  for  the Company,  determined  with  reference  to  the  subsidiary's estimated  economic  value  and  taking  into  consideration  the purpose  of  the  original  transaction.  Recoverable  value  is determined using a multi-criteria approach based on future cash flow projections, the revised asset value, the share of consolidated  or  revalued  shareholders'  equity,  and  other methods.\n\nAn impairment loss is recorded when this value falls below the gross value.\n\n## Other long-term investments\n\nOther  long-term  investments  include  other  investments  and certain treasury shares.\n\n## 2.3 Receivables\n\nReceivables are recorded in the balance sheet at their nominal value and are written down where they present a risk of non-recovery.\n\n## 2.4 Marketable securities and negotiable debt securities\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury  shares  acquired  for  the  express  purpose  of  being subsequently  granted  to  employees  under  stock  option  plans and free share plans are recorded under \"Marketable securities\". No  impairment  is  recognized  on  treasury  shares  to  reflect  the share price.\n\nTreasury shares are measured according to the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.\n\n## Other shares\n\nShares are recorded at their acquisition cost. An impairment loss is  recognized  when  their  closing  price  falls  below  their  carrying amount.\n\n399 -\n\n## Other investments (excluding treasury shares)\n\nOther investments are investments that the Company plans or is required to hold on a long-term basis, but which are not deemed necessary for the Company's activities.\n\nThe gross amount of these investments is equal to the acquisition cost plus any related acquisition fees.\n\nAn  impairment  loss  is  recognized  based  on  the  value  in  use  of these securities to the Company.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury  shares  acquired  under  liquidity  agreements  are recorded under \"Other long-term investments\". These shares are written down where necessary to reflect the average share price over the last month of the fiscal year.\n\nTreasury shares acquired for the express purpose of being used in a  future  capital  reduction  are  also  classified  under  \"Other  longterm investments\". These shares are not written down to reflect the share price.\n\nTreasury shares are measured according to the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Bonds\n\nBonds  are  recorded  on  the  acquisition  date  at  their  par  value adjusted for any premium or discount. Accrued interest as of the acquisition  date  and  as  of  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  is recorded in an accrued interest account.\n\nAs  of  the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  the  cost  of  the  bonds  is compared  to  the  market  value  of  the  principal  over  the  last month  of  the  year,  excluding  accrued  interest.  An  impairment loss is recorded when this value falls below the gross value.\n\n## 2.5 Foreign currency transactions\n\nIncome  and  expenses  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  are recorded at their euro-equivalent value on the transaction date. Borrowings,  receivables  and  liquidity  positions  denominated  in foreign currencies are translated at the closing exchange rate. In the case of foreign currency hedging, borrowings and receivables are translated at the hedging rate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mutual funds (SICAV)\n\nUnits in SICAV mutual funds are recorded at their acquisition cost excluding subscription fees, and their net asset value is estimated as of the end of the reporting period. A provision for impairment is  recorded  in  respect  of  any  unrealized  capital  losses.  No unrealized capital gains are recognized.\n\n## Negotiable certificates of deposit, certificates of deposit and notes issued by financing companies\n\nNegotiable debt securities are subscribed on the primary market or  purchased  on  the  secondary  market.  They  are  recorded  at acquisition  cost  less  accrued  interest  as  of  the  acquisition  date when purchased on the secondary market.\n\nPrepaid  interest  is  recognized  as  financial  income  on  a proportional basis for the fiscal year.\n\nAny translation differences resulting from the valuation of foreign currency  borrowings  and  receivables  are  recorded  in  accrual accounts, as an asset for unrealized losses and as a liability for unrealized  gains.  A  contingency  provision  is  recorded  to  cover any unhedged  unrealized  losses. Where  borrowings  and receivables  are  hedged  by  financial  instruments,  any  foreign currency  gains  or  losses  are  recorded  in  the  income  statement when the hedged item is settled.\n\n## 2.6 Bond issue and capital increase fees - Bond redemption premiums\n\nBond issue fees are recognized as of the issue date.\n\nCosts associated with increases in capital, mergers or restructuring  are  charged  against  the  additional  paid-in  capital arising from the merger or restructuring.\n\nBonds are recorded at their par value.\n\n## 2.7 Provisions\n\nProvisions  are  recognized  in  accordance  with  CNC  regulation no.  2000.06  and  include  pension  and  other  employee  benefit obligations pursuant to ANC recommendation no. 2013-02.\n\nUnder  defined  benefit  plans,  obligations  are  valued  using  the projected  unit  credit  method  based  on  agreements  in  effect  in the  Company.  Under  this  method,  each  period  of  service  gives rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement and each unit is measured  separately  to  build  up  the  final  obligation.  The obligation is then discounted. The actuarial assumptions used to determine the obligations vary depending  on  economic conditions.\n\n## 2.8 Tax consolidation\n\nKering has set up a tax consolidation group in France with several sub-groups and subsidiaries.\n\nAny issue or redemption premiums are assigned to the relevant balance sheet item and amortized over the term of the bond.\n\nFor  convertible  bonds,  the  redemption  premium  is  recognized over the term of the bond.\n\nThese benefit obligations are assessed by independent actuaries on an annual basis. The valuations take into account the level of future compensation, the probable active life of employees, life expectancy and staff turnover.\n\nKering applies CRC notice no. 2008-17 of November 6, 2008, on the  accounting  treatment  of  stock  option  and  employee  free share plans.\n\nEach subsidiary recognizes a tax expense for the amount of tax it would  have  paid  on  a  stand-alone  basis.  The  tax  savings generated  by  the  Group  as  a  result  of  tax  consolidation  are retained  by  Kering  SA  as  the  parent  company  of  the  tax consolidation group.",

However, the term agreed by the parties may not exceed 60 days or, as an exception, 45 days from the end of the month, as of the date of issue of the invoice.\n\nThe agreed payment term must be specified on the invoice and in the general terms and conditions of sale.\n\nInvoices issued periodically (or summary invoices) must be paid within a maximum of 45 days from the date of issue.\n\nPurchases of VAT-exempt goods and services delivered outside the European Union may be settled up to 90 days from the invoice date. The term must be indicated in the sales contract.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  will  always  detect  a  material  misstatement  when  it  exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in article L. 821-55 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material  misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for  one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u00b7 obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- \u00b7 evaluates  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and  related disclosures made by management in the financial statements;\n- \u00b7 assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- \u00b7 evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented,  as  well  as  the  results  of  our  audit.  We  also  report,  if  any,  significant  deficiencies  in  internal  control  regarding  the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur  report  to  the  Audit  Committee  includes  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgment,  were  of  most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also  provide  the  Audit  Committee  with  the  declaration  provided  for  in  article  6  of  Regulation  (EU)  N\u00b0  537/2014,  confirming  our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 821-27 to L. 821-34 of the  French  Commercial  Code  ( Code  de  commerce )  and  in  the  French  Code  of  Ethics  for  statutory  auditors.  Where  appropriate,  we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, February 29, 2024\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nFrench original signed by\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s\n\nCamille Phelizon\n\nPatrice Morot\n\nDavid Dupont-Noel\n\nB\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Margerin",

This includes the  19,338  Company  shares  held  by  employees  through  the employee  investment  fund  and  the  95,153  shares  owned  by\n\nemployees as part of the KeringForYou program. This employee share ownership program, implemented for the first time in 2022, gives  eligible  employees  in  several  countries  the  opportunity  to become Kering shareholders on preferential terms and thus have a direct interest in its development and future performance.\n\n(1)\n\nD\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Other securities giving access to the share capital\n\n## Special report on stock subscription and purchase options and free share grants\n\nA  free  share  plan  was  put  in  place  on  October  3,  2023  (see Note 6.2 to the consolidated financial statements, \"Plans settled in Kering shares\").\n\n## Stock subscription and purchase option plans\n\nNo stock subscription and purchase option plans have been set up  since  2007.

Its actions are targeted and customized to offer different audiences - private individual shareholders and the financial community messages suited to their respective expectations while complying with  the  principle  of  equal  access  to  information.  Kering  also places considerable importance on maintaining a dialog with and earning even greater trust from its shareholders, both institutional  and  individual.  It  provides  transparent  information to  them  on  a  regular  basis  about  the  Company's  latest developments  by  holding  meetings  throughout  the  year  particularly with institutional investors - and making sure that it answers any questions and responds to any comments they may have.\n\n## Toward individual shareholders\n\nPrivate individual shareholders have access to various media and tools to keep themselves informed about the Group and events affecting  its  shares.  These  include  the  twice-yearly  Letter  to Shareholders,  the  Shareholders'  Guide  (available  online,  in French only), the shareholders' hotline (+33 (0)1 45 64 65 64) and email address (actionnaire@kering.com), financial notices in the press and online, the Group's website, and the annual report.\n\n## Toward the financial community\n\nThe Group maintains close relationships with the European and international financial community in three main ways:\n\n- \u00b7 dialog  regarding  financial  performance  and  strategy:  the head  of  investor  relations  and  her  team,  overseen  by  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Deputy CEO, Operations  and  Finance  and  the  Chief  Financial  Officer, organize  meetings  with  analysts  and  the  main  institutional investors  in  relation  to  the  publication  of  annual  and  halfyear financial results and quarterly revenue figures. As well as these  periodic  events,  the  Group  proactively  organizes individual and group meetings with the financial community as  part  of  financial  roadshows  in  Europe  and  around  the world. Kering also takes part in numerous sector conferences organized by major banks;\n\n429 -",

The  Group's  Chief  Sustainability  and  Institutional Affairs Officer also takes part in the ESG roadshow held every November and attended by significant institutional investors, during which she presents details of the Group roadmap, the resources  deployed  by  the  Group  and  its  achievements, particularly in terms of its climate ambitions and biodiversity policy.  For  more  than  10  years,  the  Group  has  reported annually  to  shareholders  in  the  AGM,  through  its  Chief Sustainability  and  Institutional  Affairs  Officer,  about  its environmental  ambitions  and  progress.  Dedicated  teams within  the  Sustainability  Department  regularly  interact  with non-financial  ratings  agencies  in  relation  to  their  requests and questionnaires;\n- \u00b7 dialog regarding governance: this is mainly conducted by the Lead  Independent  Director  and  the  Investor  Relations Department under the oversight  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer, in tandem with the Board Secretary and the Legal Department. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may  also  hold  discussions  with  institutional  investors  on these matters. In 2023, as it does every year, the Group held an ESG roadshow in the fourth quarter for major investors in the Company (representing around 40% of the free float and 22.5% of total share capital). The Lead Independent Director, the Board Secretary, the Chief Sustainability and Institutional Affairs  Officer  and  the  Investor  Relations  Department  took part  in  the  roadshow.

This information is filed with the AMF at the time of its disclosure and stored on the Kering website.\n\nFull and effective communication is carried out electronically in compliance  with  the  criteria  defined  by  the  AMF's  General Regulations,  which  require  communication  to  a  wide  audience within  the  European  Union  and  under  conditions  guaranteeing the security of the communication and information. Accordingly, Kering's  Financial  Communications  Department  has  chosen  to work with a professional communications agency satisfying the communication  criteria  set  by  EU  Regulation  no.  596/2014  on market abuse and the AMF's General Regulations. The communications agency is included on the list published by the AMF,  thus  benefiting  from  a  presumption  of  full  and  effective communication.",

Failing this, the meeting elects its own chair.\n\nMeeting  minutes  are  prepared  and  copies  thereof  are  certified and issued in accordance with the law.\n\nIn  all  Annual General Meetings, a voting right that is double the right  conferred on the other shares is granted to all shares that are fully paid up and for which proof is provided that they have been held in registered form for at least two years in the name of the same shareholder. This double voting right, which existed in the Articles of Association of Pinault SA prior to its merger with Printemps SA, was restated at the time of their 1992 merger.\n\nThis double voting right may be withdrawn outright at any time pursuant to a decision of the Extraordinary General Meeting and after ratification  by  a  special  meeting  of  the  beneficiary shareholders.\n\n(article 19 of the Articles of Association)\n\nThe double voting right existed at both Pinault SA and Printemps SA  prior  to  their  1992  merger.  The  Company's  Articles  of Association do not provide that, in the event of a free allocation of registered shares to a shareholder in respect of old shares for which  he/she/it  had  a  double  voting  right,  the  new  shares  are also entitled to a double voting right.\n\nPursuant  to  the  relevant  legislation,  double  voting  rights  are canceled for any share converted to a bearer share or in the event of  a  transfer  of  ownership  except  in  the  case  of  a  transfer following  inheritance,  liquidation  of  joint  property  between spouses, or donation between living family members (spouse or relative) with legal inheritance rights.\n\nVoting rights are not limited under the Articles of Association.\n\n## Provisions of the Articles of Association relating to shareholder notifications\n\nThe  shares  shall  be  in  registered  or  bearer  form  at  the shareholder's  discretion.  The  shares  shall  be  entered  into  an account under the conditions and in accordance with the terms provided for by the regulations in force.\n\nThe Company is authorized to use the provisions of the law and regulations  regarding  the  identification  of  the  holders  of securities  that  grant  immediate  or  deferred  access  to  voting rights at its own Annual General Meetings.\n\nIn addition to the legal obligations to notify the Company and the French  financial markets  authority  ( Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF ) when shareholdings reach or fall below a given threshold,  any  individual  or  legal  entity  directly  or  indirectly holding  shares  in  the  Company,  whether  acting  alone  or  in concert, shall notify the Company of the total number of shares and voting rights held if said number reaches or exceeds 2% or any  multiple  thereof,  including  multiples  exceeding  the  legal threshold of 5%. Notifications shall be made by registered letter with return receipt sent to the registered office no later than 15 days  after  the  date  on  which  the  threshold  was  crossed  or reached, or by any other equivalent means for shareholders not residing  in  France,  it  being  specified  that  the  contents  of  the notification must comply with the legal and regulatory provisions applicable to shareholder notifications concerning legal thresholds, and must include the information to be provided in such  circumstances  to  the  AMF,  as  stated  in  its  General Regulations. The same notification obligation shall apply under the  same  conditions  when  a  shareholder's  total  shares  and/or voting  rights  reach  or  fall  below  any  of  the  aforementioned thresholds.\n\nIf  the  notification  is  not  submitted,  the  shares  exceeding  the threshold for which the notification should have been made may be  deprived  of  voting  rights  at  the  request  of  one  or  more shareholders  holding  a  combined  or  individual  total  of  at  least 5% of  the  Company's  share  capital  and/or  voting  rights,  under the conditions set forth in the sixth paragraph of article L. 233-7 of the French Commercial  Code.  If the notification is subsequently made, the corresponding voting rights may not be exercised until the period of time defined by law or the prevailing regulations has expired.\n\n(article 7 of the Articles of Association)\n\nThere are no shares not representing capital.\n\nThe  steps  required  to  amend  shareholder  rights  are  those provided for by law.",
