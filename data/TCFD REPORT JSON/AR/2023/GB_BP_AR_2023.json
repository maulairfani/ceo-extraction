We want to help the world reach net zero and improve people's lives.\n\n## Who we are\n\n'Who we are' defines what we stand for at bp, building on our best qualities and those things that are most important to us.

For bp, this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit before interest and tax, which reflects the replacement cost of inventories sold in the period and is arrived at by excluding inventory holding gains and losses from profit before interest and tax. Replacement cost profit for the group is not a recognized measure under IFRS. For further information see Financial statements - Note 5.\n\n## Financial reporting segment performance\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the group's reportable segments were gas & low carbon energy, oil production & operations and customers & products. Each is managed separately, with decisions taken for the segment as a whole, and represents a single operating segment that does not result from aggregating two or more segments (see Financial statements - Note 5).\n\n## Gas & low carbon energy a\n\nComprises our gas & low carbon energy businesses. Our gas business includes regions with upstream activities that predominantly produce natural gas, integrated gas and power, and gas trading.

From the ongoing complexity of the energy transition to economic uncertainty and market volatility. Add to that, across the world conflict has continued to touch many lives - and our thoughts are with all those who have been affected.\n\nI will start with safety - both physical and psychological - because it always comes first at bp and is fundamental in the board's discussions and decision making.\n\nOn behalf of the board, I would like to recognize the work by bp's teams on operational safety - especially in achieving a reduction in the number of our most serious process safety incidents ( page 24 ). However, three people died while working for bp and this is unacceptable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chief executive transition\n\nIf bp made progress on safety and had a strong operational and financial performance in 2023, there were challenges too, including the change in CEO in September. However, for me and for the board, the positive here was the effectiveness of our emergency succession planning, which allowed us to appoint Murray Auchincloss immediately as interim leader, and avoid a leadership vacuum. The robust and competitive recruitment process that followed, and his performance in that process, led the board to appoint him as CEO on a permanent basis at the beginning of 2024.\n\nThe board was in full agreement that Murray was the best candidate - but this was not just our view. We sought feedback from many stakeholders including our shareholders. It was very important to have this dialogue with so many of you and I want to thank you for your advice and support.\n\nMurray has been at bp for more than two decades and he is deeply committed to the company and its people. He has a track record of performance, he knows how to bring out the best in a team, he was one of the chief architects of the strategy - and he knows the industry inside out. I say more about this transition on page 82 .\n\nI am grateful to my fellow board members for their support in this process. Their constructive scrutiny of candidates allowed us to make a decision that, we believe, is right for bp.\n\nMurray's strategic vision and focus on performance will help bp to unlock even more of our potential to compete, win and grow the value of bp. With her strong finance leadership experience, the subsequent appointment of Kate Thomson as chief financial officer in February gives the board great confidence in what can be achieved in 2024 and beyond.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic direction\n\nThis leadership transition marks a new chapter for the company, but not a new strategic direction.\n\nThis year, it has become even clearer that the world needs a better, more balanced energy system. One that is secure, affordable and lower carbon. bp's strategy to go from an international oil company to an integrated energy company is designed both to help build a better system and to create value for shareholders while doing so.\n\nbp had a strong operational performance in 2023 and its strategy remains well suited to the energy transition as it unfolds. The global move to a lower carbon energy system is not straightforward and presents both challenges and opportunities for an energy company like bp. With global markets remaining unpredictable, flexibility will be important and the strategy allows for this.\n\n## Role of culture\n\nAs bp's business activities evolve, the strength of its culture is paramount. It builds trust within bp's teams, encourages better performance and helps bp to attract and keep the best talent. A key aspect of this is its speak-up culture. bp encourages everyone to raise any concerns they have, including when they see something they think is inconsistent with the code of conduct or is unsafe or unlawful. bp tools allow them to do this safely, securely, in confidence and without fear of retaliation (see page 72 ).\n\n## Closing thanks\n\nEvery day, bp teams continue to go to work on rigs, in our refineries, in offices, at sea, at our retail sites and at our solar and wind installations - to mention just some of bp's many areas of operation. I want to thank them all for the considerable progress bp made in 2023.\n\nI also want to thank Paula Rosput Reynolds and Sir John Sawers for their distinguished service. Over almost nine years, Paula has been a valued member of the board, including roles as chair of the remuneration committee (Remco) and senior independent director (SID). I am pleased that Amanda Blanc will take on the role of SID and, for an interim period, Tushar Morzaria the role of Remco chair, both with effect from the end of our annual general meeting in April 2024. Sir John's considerable work since 2015 includes supporting our safety and sustainability committee and our people and governance committee and he has been highly regarded as chair of our geopolitical advisory council. Both will step down at the end of our annual general meeting in April 2024.\n\nI will close with a final thank you. As I look back at this year, one of the highlights for me personally has been my meetings with you, my fellow shareholders - this year more than ever. In a time of internal change and external uncertainty, I want to thank you for your advice, your belief in bp - and for your trust and support throughout.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHelge Lund Chair 8 March 2024\n\n## $6.5bn\n\nshare buybacks announced from our 2023 surplus cash flow\n\n## $4.8bn\n\ntotal dividends distributed to bp shareholders",

It is an honour to lead your company as CEO.\n\nOur destination is unchanged. We're moving from an international oil company to an integrated energy company - IOC to IEC. We're investing in today's energy system, which is mainly oil and gas, while building out tomorrow's.

In 2023 three people lost their lives while working for bp - a contractor at bpx energy and two colleagues at our newly acquired TravelCenters of America business. We will never accept this as part of doing business. Our goal is the elimination of all fatalities, life-changing injuries and the most serious process safety incidents.\n\nIn 2023 we continued to make progress on process safety, but there is always more to do. We need to constantly reinforce and build on our operating culture across the business, rigorously applying our Operating Management System (OMS), embedding the Lifesaving Rules and living our Safety Leadership Principles. We are determined to keep building a safer bp.\n\n## A year of delivery\n\nIn 2023 we delivered a resilient operational and financial performance, with earnings (adjusted EBITDA ) of $43.7 billion a and operating cash flow of $32.0 billion. This contributed to:\n\n- \u00b7 Profit for the year attributable to bp shareholders of $15.2 billion.\n- \u00b7 Underlying replacement cost profit of $13.8 billion.\n- \u00b7 Return on average capital employed (ROACE) of 18.1% b .\n- \u00b7 Net debt reduced to $20.9 billion c - its lowest in a decade.\n\nIn turn this has allowed us to deliver competitive distributions to our shareholders:\n\n- \u00b7 A 10% increase in the dividend per ordinary share (compared with the fourth quarter of 2022).\n- \u00b7 $6.5 billion in share buybacks from our 2023 surplus cash flow .\n- \u00b7 17% reduction in issued share capital between the end of the first quarter of 2021 and 31 December 2023.\n- a Adjusted EBITDA for the group is a non-IFRS measure and its nearest IFRS-equivalent measure is profit for the year 2023.\n- b ROACE is a non-IFRS measure and its nearest IFRS measures of numerator and denominator are profit for the year 2023 attributable to bp shareholders of $15.2 billion and total equity at the end of 2023 of $85.5 billion respectively.\n- c Net debt is a non-IFRS measure and its nearest IFRS-equivalent measure is finance debt at the end of 2023.\n\nWe continue to maintain a disciplined financial frame. The strength of our underlying financial performance, the disciplined approach to strengthening the balance sheet over the last few years, and our confidence in our drive towards 2025 gave us the capacity to update the financial frame earlier this year. As we announced in February 2024, we have tightened our capital expenditure guidance and enhanced our share buyback guidance, all while continuing to prioritize a strong balance sheet and strong investment grade credit rating.\n\n## Strategic progress\n\nWe are four years into our journey from IOC to IEC. Our strategy is based on the judgement that oil and gas will be needed for decades, but that a global shift to lower carbon energy is well underway. Since the pace of that shift is uncertain we will continue to be flexible and pragmatic, responding to changing demand and societal need, as we did in February 2023.\n\nOur strategic progress in 2023 included:\n\n- \u00b7 Oil and gas production growth of 2.6%, underpinned by strong growth from bpx energy and good management of our base business.\n- \u00b7 Strong underlying year-on-year growth in our convenience gross margin .\n- \u00b7 EV charge points up 35% globally, energy sold up 150%.\n- \u00b7 Biogas supply volumes up 80%, biofuels production up 18%.\n- \u00b7 21.1GW net growth in our renewables pipeline.\n- \u00b7 1.1mtpa net growth in our hydrogen pipeline .\n- \u00b7 Completed the planned implementation of methane measurement approach across our operated upstream oil and gas assets.",

        "page_content": "## Energy markets\n\n## The operating environment\n\nbp operates across volatile energy markets. Here we discuss broader economic trends we have observed that influence our sector as a whole.\n\nThrough 2023 energy markets and prices were volatile as demand and supply flows continued to adjust to post-COVID-19 recoveries in demand and disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine war. Concerns about energy security and emissions continued to boost renewables as the world transitions towards a lower carbon future.\n\nEconomic growth was uneven across regions, as past increases in energy prices and steep rises in interest rates had varying effects in different countries.\n\nInflation rates fell significantly as the effects of past increases in food and energy prices on annual inflation eased. However, inflation across much of the world remained above central banks' targets, and a combination of squeezed incomes and the sharp tightening in monetary policy contributed to a below-average growth rate of around 3% for the global economy in 2023.\n\nGrowth in advanced economies was 1.5% a , with weakness in the euro area contrasting with continued robust growth in the US. Emerging economies grew by around 4% a , with China experiencing a rebound in growth to 5.2% a as it emerged from COVID-19 lockdowns. Expansion of other emerging economies was dampened by higher interest rates and weak demand for their exports.\n\n## Oil\n\nOil prices were elevated across much of 2023, supported by a combination of robust oil demand growth and OPEC production cuts. Brent averaged $83/bbl in 2023, down from $101/bbl in the previous year. Global oil demand grew by 2.3mmb/d to 101.7mmb/d in 2023 b . The structural post-COVID-19 rebound of mobility (jet and gasoline), including a significant increase in Chinese oil demand of 1.7mmb/d b , supported the well-above-trend growth.\n\n- a IMF World Economic Outlook, October 2023 update.\n- b IEA Oil Market Report, January 2024.\n- c Platts Dutch TTF Day Ahead price.\n- d Platts Henry Hub cash price.\n- e Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report, EIA.\n- f Baker Hughes Rig Count.\n- g The RMM may not be representative of the margin achieved by bp in any period because of bp's particular refinery configurations and crude and product slates. In addition, the RMM does not include estimates of energy or other variable costs.\n\nh\n\n- IEA Renewables 2023 report; PV capacity additions converted from DC to AC basis by dividing by 1.25.\n\nA combination of official and voluntary cuts caused OPEC+ production to fall by 390kb/d b in 2023, led by Saudi Arabia, which accounted for a 900kb/d contraction versus 2022 b . However, these reductions were offset by strong growth in non-OPEC+ supplies, which increased by 2.3mmb/d in 2023 b , with the US accounting for two-thirds of that increase b .\n\n## Natural gas\n\nA combination of a relatively warm European winter in 2022-23 and muted European gas demand caused European and Asian natural gas prices to fall early in 2023. Even so, European gas prices in 2023 were still double their 2015-2019 average level c following the loss of the majority of Russian pipeline gas supply to the EU in 2022.\n\nAsian liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices followed European gas prices lower in 2023, and moved back to trading predominantly at a premium to European prices in a reversal of the trend seen in 2022. The increased demand for LNG cargoes following the loss of Russian gas pipeline supply to the EU, combined with below-average growth in new LNG supply capacity in 2023, meant the global LNG market remained sensitive to supply risks, for example reacting strongly to potential outages in Australia.\n\nIn the US, Henry Hub (HH) gas prices averaged 61% d lower than in 2022 as the growth in dry natural gas production outpaced demand. Lower HH prices incentivized coal-to-gas switching in the power sector, and heightened demand for cooling during summer heatwaves helped to avoid storage congestion. US gas storage stocks were 13% e above historical average levels at the end of 2023. In response to the lower prices, the number of US gas rigs operating declined by a third from its peak in 2022 f .\n\n## Refining marker margin\n\nWe use a global refining marker margin (RMM) to track the refining margin environment. Global RMM fell from the record highs reached in 2022, when Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to refining operations and established trade flows. RMM values averaged $25.8/bbl, $7.3/bbl lower than in 2022 g , mainly due to elevated refinery output, including as a result of new capacity additions.\n\n## Power and renewables\n\nTotal solar and wind capacity additions in 2023 were expected to have reached around 380GW (on alternating current basis), a record increase historically, and more than 100GW higher than in 2022 h , with the increase driven mainly by China and solar photovoltaic (PV) deployment. The ongoing effects of the Russia-Ukraine war have increased countries' focus on their energy security, supporting greater deployment of renewable energy capacity.\n\nHigher commodity prices, rises in interest rates and continued supply chain bottlenecks led to some increases in costs for solar and wind power in several countries. The offshore wind sector was particularly affected, and some projects were cancelled as their economic viability was eroded. However, we saw governments in many key offshore wind markets remain committed to achieving their offshore wind targets and developing their domestic offshore supply chains, providing continued support to the sector.",

However, high costs and the slow pace of enabling policy have caused increased challenges for the sector. While the sector-wide project pipeline for production of low-emissions hydrogen operational by 2030 has grown significantly, only a very small amount is either currently operational or under construction.\n\nGreen hydrogen costs have increased significantly, driven by higher renewable costs, elevated interest rates and competition for renewable electricity.

The Outlook helps inform bp's core beliefs about the energy transition.\n\nThe scenarios within it explore the possible implications of different judgements and assumptions concerning the nature of the energy transition. The uncertainty associated with the transition is substantial, and these scenarios are not predictions of what is likely to happen or what bp would like to see happen. We use the output from these scenarios to inform our strategic thinking.\n\n## New momentum\n\nNew momentum captures the broad trajectory of the current global energy system. It places weight on the marked increase in global ambition for decarbonization in recent years, as well as on the manner and speed of decarbonization seen over the recent past. CO2 -equivalent (CO 2e) emissions from energy and industrial processes peak in the 2020s, and by 2050 are around 30% below 2019 levels.

        "page_content": "## bp Energy Outlook 2023 updates\n\nIn January 2023 we published the bp Energy Outlook 2023 (2023 Outlook) . This was updated from the 2022 Outlook to consider two major developments: the Russia-Ukraine war and the passing of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war was judged likely to have a persistent effect on the future path of the global energy system, causing a change in the composition of global energy supplies, reducing economic growth, and increasing countries' focus on energy security. Also modelled was the IRA, which included a package of largely supply-side measures supporting low carbon energy sources and decarbonization technologies in the US.\n\nIn July 2023 we released an additional chapter of the bp Energy Outlook , 'How energy is used', which considers the outlook for the end uses of energy over the next 30 years. This chapter discusses energy use in the transport, industry and buildings sectors of the global economy.\n\nIt showed that, in all three scenarios outlined on page 10 , electricity increasingly replaces oil as the main energy carrier for light road vehicles in the transport sector. Heavier vehicles also electrify, although hydrogen and biomethane also play a role in some applications. Industry also gradually electrifies, but at a slower rate than transport due to the difficulties of electrifying high-temperature heat, with heavy industry also making use of low carbon hydrogen and bioenergy. In the buildings sector, growth in overall energy demand slows as space heating and cooking appliances become more efficient and energy conservation increases. The share of electricity in the energy used by buildings rises as fossil fuel boilers are replaced by heat pumps and emerging economies phase out traditional biomass.\n\nWe plan to continue to update the bp Energy Outlook in response to new developments in the energy transition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbp.com/energyoutlook\n\n## Scenarios for strategic decision making\n\nWe use scenarios to inform strategy, manage risk, and improve decision making.\n\nSome scenarios start from today and project forward over a timeframe in which the current structure of the energy system helps to inform the pace and nature of the transition path. Others start in the future, breaking free from the inherent inertia in the energy system, and look back to the present from that new perspective.\n\nIn thinking about appropriate scenarios to inform our strategy, we used both approaches.\n\n## How scenarios inform our strategy\n\nThe use of scenarios described in the 2023 Outlook , and those from other organizations, aids our understanding of the energy transition and helps us to think about how different outcomes might impact our strategy.\n\nThe use of a broad range of scenarios to inform our strategy supports our efforts to make it robust and resilient to the range of uncertainty we face.\n\nBy considering various time horizons, we can identify key milestones or signposts which might emerge over the next five, 10 or 30 years and inform our view of the key sources of uncertainty affecting the global energy system.\n\nWe actively monitor for changes in the external environment and refresh or review the scenarios as needed in response to these signals, as we did with the Russia-Ukraine war and the impact of the IRA in the 2023 Outlook .\n\nFor the purposes of testing the resilience of our strategy to the range of uncertainty in the energy transition, we have used scenarios drawn from other credible sources such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) 'Climate Scenario Analysis Reference Approach for Companies in the Energy System', the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more on our resilience analysis and the outcome of that work on\n\npage 64\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we create scenarios\n\nWe quantify a range of scenarios in the 2023 Outlook using our global energy modelling system. This comprises a suite of models to help us understand the supply and demand dynamics of the global energy system.\n\nThe modelling framework uses historical data based on the Energy Institute's Statistical Review of World Energy c , the IEA's data and a range of other data sets.\n\nEach scenario is determined by a set of key assumptions, including population and economic growth, pace of technological change, resource constraints and government policies. These are informed by expert views from external organizations including the United Nations, Oxford Economics and Rystad Energy. We benchmark our scenarios against external organizations including the IEA, the IPCC, IHS Markit and the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS).\n\nThe modelling techniques used vary by sector and include a combination of econometric modelling, least-cost optimization, adoption curves and consumer choice modelling.",

        "page_content": "## Consistency with the Paris goals\n\n## Pursuing a strategy that is consistent with the Paris goals\n\n## What we mean by Paris-consistent\n\nThe 2019 CA100+ resolution requires us to disclose the strategy that the board considers in good faith to be consistent with the Paris goals.\n\nWhen we refer to 'consistency with Paris' we consider this to mean consistency with the world meeting the temperature goal set out in Articles 2.1(a) and 4.1 of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change .\n\nThe Paris goals, which we support, were reaffirmed under the UAE Consensus at COP28 in December 2023, by the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan agreed by the Parties at COP27 in November 2022, and the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed by the Parties at COP26 in November 2021.\n\nWe believe the world is on an unsustainable path, and the carbon budget to meet the Paris goals is running out.\n\nbp's strategy is informed by these considerations. It is designed to create long-term value for shareholders, while enabling delivery of our net zero ambition - to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner, and to help the world get to net zero. It is designed to be resilient to the uncertainty of the energy transition across many different potential pathways, including various Paris-consistent pathways.\n\nIn the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 we set out, based on three key principles , why the board considers our strategy to be consistent with the Paris goals. Here we set out, on the same three grounds, why the board continues to consider this to be the case.\n\n## Informed by Paris-consistent energy transition scenarios\n\nThe speed and nature of the energy transition is uncertain, and so we consider a range of scenarios from multiple sources including the bp Energy Outlook to inform our beliefs about the energy transition and to develop and test our strategic thinking. This helps to reinforce our confidence in the robustness and resilience of our strategy to the range of uncertainty we face.\n\nWe are confident that our approach is sciencebased. We see the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the most authoritative source of information on the science of climate change, and we use it and other sources to inform our strategy. The IPCC highlights that there are a range of global pathways by which the world can meet the Paris goals, with differing implications for regions, industry sectors and sources of energy.\n\nThe bp Energy Outlook 2023 updated the 2022 Outlook to reflect the significant developments in global energy markets over the preceding year, including the possible impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the pace of the energy transition. It includes three main scenarios - two of which we regard as Paris-consistent (Accelerated and Net Zero) - that we use to inform our strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnergy outlook page 10 and bp.com/energyoutlook\n\n## Strategic resilience\n\nWe believe our strategy positions bp for success and resilience in a Paris-consistent world - a world that is progressing on one of the many global trajectories considered to be Paris-consistent, and ultimately meets the Paris goals.\n\nThe strategy diversifies bp's portfolio and business interests, reducing the risk that challenges facing a single business area might adversely affect bp's strategic resilience.\n\nIn addition, within the inevitable constraints associated with factors such as long-term capital investments, contractual commitments and organizational capabilities at any given time, bp's ability to maintain its strategic resilience rests, in part, on the governance used to keep the strategy and associated targets and aims under review in light of new information and changes in circumstances.\n\nIn our climate-related financial disclosures on page 63 , we describe how we have conducted an analysis to test our view of the resilience of our strategy to different climate-related scenarios, using the update on strategic progress presented in February 2023. This includes scenarios that are classified by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to be consistent with well-below 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C outcomes a .\n\nAs further explained on page 64 , while the results of any such analysis must be treated with caution overall, this resilience test again reinforced our confidence in the continued resilience of our strategy to a wide range of ways in which the energy system could evolve throughout this decade, including in scenarios consistent with limiting temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nThe analysis also again highlighted that, while WBCSD data may point towards a broad directional correlation between oil price and the temperature goal with which scenarios are associated, there is considerable uncertainty as to the extent of this correlation. This is demonstrated by the range within, and overlap between, the prices indicated for each scenario family.\n\nIn the version of the WBCSD catalogue used for the analysis, the lowest oil price is associated with a 1.5\u00b0C scenario; however a number of the 1.5\u00b0C and well-below 2\u00b0C scenarios have oil prices in 2030 that are substantially higher. And when compared to bp's own central oil price case planning assumption for 2030, the oil price in a number of the well-below 2\u00b0C scenarios is also higher, supporting our view that our oil price planning assumption is broadly consistent with Paris-consistent scenarios.",

        "page_content": "## Contributes to net zero\n\nWe believe that our strategy enables bp to make a positive contribution to the world achieving net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and meeting the Paris goals - outcomes which we believe to be in the best interests of bp as well as beneficial to society generally.\n\nWe see huge opportunity in the energy transition - the transformation of the energy system that we believe to be a necessary feature of the world's efforts to meet the Paris goals. There are many ways a company at the heart of the energy sector can make a meaningful contribution to the world getting to net zero. In addition to investing in and scaling our own lower carbon businesses, these include: policy advocacy and seeking to use the company's influence with trade associations that conduct climate-related advocacy; low carbon collaboration and support for others in their own decarbonization efforts (such as cities and corporates); and making venturing investments in promising new businesses and technologies that have the potential to contribute to the energy transition. bp seeks to advance these areas through our aims in support of our net zero ambition, including aims 6-10 which are focused on activities which can help the world get to net zero, see page 50 .\n\nAnd, as we pursue our strategy, our diversification and the growth of our low carbon businesses may also contribute to helping the world get to net zero. Some ways of contributing are more readily measured by quantitative metrics than others - but all can be important, whether or not they translate into GHG reductions for bp. For example, in Teesside in the UK, we continue to work to advance components of the East Coast Cluster - a vision for decarbonizing local heavy industries at scale, with CO2 from their emissions taken offshore for permanent storage through Northern Endurance Partnership's carbon capture and storage facilities.\n\nIn 2023 two bp-led lower carbon projects, Net Zero Teesside Power and H2Teesside, part of the East Coast Cluster, were chosen to proceed to negotiations for government support. bp and Equinor were awarded a carbon storage licence by the North Sea Transition Authority, which will enable the development of further CO2 storage sites. Together with Equinor we now hold four storage licences on behalf of the Northern Endurance Partnership. There is potential to store up to 23 million tonnes of CO 2 a year in the southern North Sea by 2035.\n\nAs a further illustration, in terms of low carbon investment , by 2030 we aim to increase to 50GW the amount of developed renewables to FID , supported by the capital expenditure we plan to invest in our transition growth engines.\n\nThis aim supports the Paris goals by increasing the low carbon options available to energy consumers. However, it does not reduce our Scope 1, 2 or 3 emissions. And it may not result in a decrease in the overall carbon intensity of bp's sold products, because that is dependent on the extent to which we - rather than another party such as a buyer of the developed project - market the resulting renewable power, which is a commercial consideration. Where we do not directly sell that power, our development of the renewables is effectively 'invisible' in terms of our GHG metrics.\n\nAs another example, our aim 6 is to more actively advocate for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing. Helping policymakers to design and put in place low carbon policies that support the transition to net zero can help deliver our strategy and capitalize on the huge opportunities associated with achieving the Paris goals, but the benefit of such advocacy, if successful, extends well beyond any implications for bp's own GHG metrics. That is because well-designed low carbon policies can also advance the decarbonization of a whole economy something potentially of far greater impact than anything a single company can achieve through its own portfolio. We publish examples of our activity in support of aim 6 online at bp.com/advocacyactivities .\n\n## Responding to increased shareholder interest in Paris consistency\n\nIn 2019 the board recommended that shareholders support a special resolution requisitioned by Climate Action 100+ (CA100+) on climate change disclosures. The CA100+ resolution passed with more than 99% of votes cast. This is the fifth year we have included responses throughout the annual report and we have adopted a similar approach to previous years.\n\nThe CA100+ resolution, which includes safeguards such as protections for commercially confidential and competitively sensitive information, is on page 373 . Key terms related to this resolution response are indicated with and defined in the glossary on page 373 . These should be reviewed with the following information.\n\n| Element of the CA100+ resolution                                                                                                         | Related content                                                                              | Where      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Strategy that the board considers in good faith  to be consistent with the Paris goals.                                                  | Our strategy and business model Pursuing a strategy that is consistent  with the Paris goals | 12 & 16 14 |\n| How bp evaluates each new material capex  investment  for consistency with the  Paris goals and other outcomes relevant  to bp strategy. | Our investment process                                                                       | 30         |\n| Disclosure of bp's principal metrics and                                                                                                 | Key performance indicators                                                                   | 24         |\n| relevant targets or goals over the short,  medium and long term, consistent with  the Paris goals.                                       | Sustainability: net zero targets  and aims   See 'TCFD Metrics & Targets' for  an overview   | 49  68     |\n| Anticipated levels of investment in:                                                                                                     | Financial frame: disciplined  investment allocation                                          | 28         |\n| (i)  Oil and gas resources and reserves.

As markets evolve, we plan to invest in building global export hubs for hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives such as ammonia. Here, our experience of moving gas through pipelines, integrating renewables into our portfolio and transporting LNG on water will accelerate our route to market for hydrogen and ammonia.\n\nRenewables & power: We are focusing our investment in renewables on opportunities where we can create integration value and enhance returns. We are evaluating options to build a renewables portfolio in green hydrogen , e-fuels, EV charging and power trading. This includes building a global platform in offshore wind, enabled by our capabilities in large-scale, complex offshore projects, as well as our planned acquisition of Lightsource bp. By combining our power trading and marketing activities into this growth engine, we can integrate through the value chain from generation to customer, enhancing returns, building market position and supporting the decarbonization of electricity.\n\n## Transforming Teesside\n\nIn 2023 two bp-led lower carbon projects, Net Zero Teesside Power and H2Teesside, part of the East Coast Cluster, were chosen to proceed to negotiations for government support.\n\nbp and Equinor were awarded a carbon storage licence by the North Sea Transition Authority, which will enable the development of further CO2 storage sites. Together with Equinor we now hold four storage licences on behalf of the Northern Endurance Partnership. There is potential to store up to 23 million tonnes of CO2 a year in the southern North Sea by 2035.\n\nThis is a huge step forward for these transformative projects, which will help drive the region's low carbon revolution and deliver the UK's net zero targets.\n\n## Louise Kingham\n\nUK head of country and SVP Europe\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Peacock Solar construction starts\n\nWe started construction of our 187MW solar project in Texas, US, in mid-2023.

This KPI comprises Scope 1 (from running the assets within our operational control boundary) and Scope 2 (associated with importing electricity, heating and cooling that is bought in to run those operations) data covered by aim 1 (to be net zero across our operations by 2050 or sooner). It comprises 100% of Scope 1 and 2 emissions or activities within bp's operational control boundary.\n\n## 2023 performance\n\nScope 1 (direct) emissions, covered by aim 1, were 31.1MtCO 2 e - an overall increase from 30.4MtCO2e in 2022. Of these Scope 1 emissions, 30.2MtCO2e were CO2 and 1.0MtCO2e methane c . Overall emissions increased due to temporary operational changes, project start-ups and growth, which was partially offset by delivery of SERs and divestments.\n\nIn 2023 our Scope 2 (indirect) emissions, covered by aim 1, decreased by 0.4MtCO2e, to 1.0MtCO2e, compared with 2022 d . Lower carbon power agreements, including those at our Cherry Point and Whiting refineries, contributed to this decrease.\n\n## Basis of calculation f\n\nbp's reported GHG emissions include methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Other GHGs are not included as they are not material to our operations. CH4 emissions are converted to CO2 equivalent using the 100-year global warming potential (GWP) recommended by the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nData is required to be submitted into the bp group reporting tool, OneCSR, in accordance with bp's Operating Management System (OMS) requirements, broadly based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and the Ipieca Petroleum Industry Guidelines for Reporting Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2nd Edition, May 2011.

Throughput from bp-operated oil and gas terminals is excluded to avoid double counting despite their associated CH4 emissions being included in the metric. CH4 data is required to be submitted into the bp group reporting tool, OneCSR, in accordance with OMS requirements, broadly based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and the Ipieca Petroleum Industry Guidelines for Reporting Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2nd Edition, May 2011. The responsibility for quantifying and submitting CH4 emissions for reporting is assigned to individual bp facilities and business departments, which are termed RUs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

SERs reported include Scope 1 (direct) CO2 emission reductions, direct CH4 emission reductions and Scope 2 (indirect) GHG emissions reductions. The responsibility for calculating and submitting SERs lies with individual bp facilities and business departments, which are termed reporting units (RUs).

It is underpinned by a cash balance point of around $40 per barrel Brent, $11 per barrel RMM and $3 per mmBtu Henry Hub (all 2021 $ real).\n\nSince the fourth quarter of 2022 our dividend per ordinary share has grown by 10% to 7.270 cents.\n\nBased on our current forecasts, at around $60 per barrel Brent and subject to the board's discretion each quarter, we expect to have capacity for an annual increase in the dividend per ordinary share of around 4% per annum.\n\n## #2 Strong investment grade credit rating\n\nOur second priority is a strong investment grade credit rating. Through the cycle, we are targeting to further improve our credit metrics within an 'A' grade credit range.\n\nFor the full year 2023, finance debt increased from $46.9 billion at the end of 2022 to $52.0 billion, primarily reflecting net long-term debt issuances. But we reduced net debt from $21.4 billion to $20.9 billion, the lowest in a decade.\n\n## #3 & #4 Disciplined investment allocation\n\nWe plan to invest with discipline, driven by value, and focused on delivering returns consistent with our hurdle rates across both our transition growth engines (#3) and our oil, gas and refining businesses (#4). Investment is allocated across our businesses based on a set of criteria that balances strategic alignment, hurdle rates, volatility, integration value, sustainability and risk (see page 30 for more information).\n\nIn 2023 capital expenditure was $16.3 billion. We expect capital expenditure to remain around $16 billion per annum between 2024-25. Our capex frame between 2026 and 2030 remains \u00a314-18 billion per annum. This includes expenditure on inorganic opportunities.\n\n## Strong investment grade credit rating\n\n## 'A' range credit metrics through cycle\n\n## Share buybacks\n\n## $3.5bn 1H24 b\n\n## At least $14bn\n\nthrough 2025 c\n\n#5 Committed to returning at least 80% surplus cash flow c on a point forward basis\n\n## #5 Share buybacks\n\nWe have simplified and enhanced our share buyback guidance. We are committed to announcing $3.5 billion of share buybacks for the first half of 2024. We plan share buybacks of at least $14 billion through 2025, at current market conditions and subject to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating. This is part of our commitment, on a point forward basis, to returning at least 80% of surplus cash flow to shareholders.\n\nWe announced share buybacks of $6.5 billion from 2023 surplus cash flow. Between the end of the first quarter 2021 and 31 December 2023, we have reduced our issued share capital by 17%.\n\nIn setting the dividend per ordinary share and buyback each quarter, the board will continue to take into account factors including the cumulative level of and outlook for surplus cash flow, the cash balance point and maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating.",

        "page_content": "## Our investment process\n\n## How we use price assumptions\n\nOur price assumptions are used for our investment appraisal processes. They are also used to inform decisions about internal planning and the value-in-use impairment testing of assets for financial reporting.\n\n## The role of price assumptions\n\nAs part of our regular strategy review, we consider our portfolio and capital requirements to deliver the strategy. This work (and, where applicable, our decisions on individual investments) is informed by our view of the price environment and considers the balanced investment criteria discussed below.\n\nOur price assumptions continue to reflect a range of possibilities, including that the transition to a lower carbon economy and energy system could accelerate. Our investment appraisal assumptions, which take a long-term perspective, focus on the fundamental trends affecting the energy sector and our businesses.\n\nThroughout 2023 we held our key investment appraisal price assumptions constant at the levels set out in the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2022 . For relevant investment cases assessed in 2024, we have applied and plan to apply the prices shown in the key investment appraisal assumptions table (right) for our central price case. Brent oil and Henry Hub gas assumptions average around $64/bbl and $4.0/mmBtu respectively (2022 $ real) from 2024 to 2050. We consider these prices to be broadly consistent with a range of transition paths compatible with meeting the Paris goals, but they do not correspond to any specific Paris-consistent scenario. We also consider a range of other price assumptions for our investment appraisal, including product- and market-specific prices relevant to individual investment cases.\n\nWe continue to apply carbon prices rising to $100/tCO2e in 2030 and $250/tCO2e by 2050 (2021 $ real) in certain cases (see box on the right). In 2022 $ real terms, this corresponds to $108/tCO2e by 2030 and $270/tCO2e by 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInformation that supports TCFD Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures in relation to Metrics and Targets\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nOur best estimate of future prices for use in value-in-use impairment testing continues to be based on our investment appraisal price assumptions, with quarterly review of near-term prices to confirm that the assumptions appropriately reflect any changes to expectations due to short-term market trends.\n\nImpairment price assumptions were held constant in 2023 at the levels disclosed in the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2022 until the fourth quarter, when the updated investment appraisal price assumptions shown below were used for value-in-use impairment testing.\n\n## Key investment appraisal assumptions a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022 $ real\n\n|                                   |   2025 |   2030 |   2040 |   2050 |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Brent oil ($/bbl)                 |     70 |     70 |     63 |   50   |\n| Henry Hub gas ($/mmBtu)           |      4 |      4 |      4 |    4   |\n| Refining marker margin b  ($/bbl) |     14 |     14 |     11 |    8.5 |\n\nIn addition to the prices shown we also test whether investments meet our return expectations (see page 32 ) using a $60/bbl Brent oil price series.\n\n## Carbon price (US$/tCO 2e)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022 $ real\n\n|        |   2025 |   2030 |   2040 |   2050 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Carbon |     54 |    108 |    216 |    270 |\n\n- a The values in the table represent the central case.\n- b The disclosed RMM assumption in the table excludes carbon pricing impacts and assumes a normalized cost of renewable identification numbers (RINs).\n\n## Investment process price assumptions\n\nAll investments are evaluated against relevant price assumptions for oil, natural gas, refining margins or other commodities across a range of alternative price or margin series (typically a central, upper and lower series). In addition, all investment cases with anticipated annual operational GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) above 20,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (bp net basis) must estimate those anticipated GHG emissions and include an associated carbon cost in the investment economics, using the carbon prices above.\n\nOur investment price assumptions place some weight on scenarios in which the transition to a low carbon energy system is sufficiently rapid to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as scenarios in which the transition may not be sufficiently rapid. They also place some weight on a range of other factors that can drive prices, and which are not directly related to the Paris goals.\n\nThese price assumptions do not link to specific scenarios or outcomes, but instead try to capture the range of different possibilities surrounding the future path of the global energy system. The nature of the uncertainty means that the price ranges inevitably reflect considerable judgement. The ranges are reviewed and updated as necessary, as our understanding of and judgements about the energy transition evolve.\n\nIn addition to consideration of a range of price assumptions, investment cases also assess the impact of alternative assumptions covering other selected variables relevant to the economics of the investment. These variables may include cost, resource, policy changes and schedule, or other areas of uncertainty, to assess the robustness of investment cases to a range of other factors.\n\nFor investment appraisal, potential future operational emissions costs that may be borne by bp as a result of an investment are included as bp costs, as described in the box below (generally without assuming incremental revenue associated with those emissions), in order to incentivize engineering solutions that reduce operational carbon emissions on projects. For the treatment of emission cost assumptions in value-in-use impairment testing, see Financial statements - Note 1.",

        "page_content": "## Investment governance and evaluating consistency with the Paris goals\n\n## Governance framework\n\nbp's framework for investment governance seeks to ensure that investments align with our strategy, can be accommodated within our prevailing financial frame, and add shareholder value. It enables investments to be assessed in a consistent way against a range of criteria relevant to our strategy, including environmental and other sustainability criteria.\n\nInvestments follow an integrated stage-gate process designed to enable our businesses to choose and develop the most attractive investment cases. A balanced set of investment criteria is used (see page 32 ). This allows for the comparison and prioritization of investments across an increasingly diverse range of business models.\n\nThe governance framework specifies that proposed investments are evaluated using relevant assumptions, including carbon prices for projected operational emissions where applicable. It also sets out requirements for assurance by functions independent of the business before a final investment decision (FID) is taken.\n\n## The role of the board\n\nThe board assesses capital allocation across the bp portfolio, including the level and mix of capital expenditures and divestments, strategic acquisitions, distribution choices and deleveraging, as well as reviewing certain investment cases for approval.\n\n## Resource commitment meeting\n\nFor acquisitions and organic capital investments above defined financial thresholds, investment approval is conducted through the executive-level resource commitment meeting (RCM), which is chaired by the chief executive officer. The RCM reviews the merits of each investment case against a balanced set of criteria (see page 32 ) and considers any key issues raised in the assurance process.\n\nThe CA100+ resolution requires bp to disclose how we evaluate the consistency of new material capex investments with (i) the Paris goals and (ii) a range of other outcomes relevant to bp's strategy.\n\nbp's evaluation of the consistency of such investments with the Paris goals was undertaken by the RCM for new material capex investments sanctioned in 2023 (see page 34 ).\n\nbp's evaluation of an investment's consistency with 'a range of other relevant outcomes' is achieved by considering its merits against bp's balanced investment criteria, described on page 32 .\n\n## bp board\n\nReviews and approves investment cases of more than $3 billion for resilient hydrocarbons, more than $1 billion for all transition or low carbon investments and any significant inorganic acquisition that is exceptional or unique in nature.\n\n## Resource commitment meeting\n\nForum for executive management's approval of investments related to existing and new lines of business above $250 million or $25 million for acquisitions, or which exceed the relevant EVP's financial authority, and any project considered strategically important such as a new market entry.\n\n## Investment allocation committees\n\nEVP-level forums to review investment cases within a business group as per individual EVP financial authority (up to $250 million, or typically $25 million for acquisitions).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business group investment governance meetings\n\nSVP-level forums which review investment cases within a business group, enabler or integrator up to the individual SVP's financial authority.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cross-group meetings\n\nForums that facilitate discussions across businesses and functions, to support project development, sensitivity analysis, integration opportunities and risk assessment ahead of investment committee meetings.\n\n## Investment in non-oil and gas\n\nOur aim 5 is to increase the proportion of investment we make into our non-oil and gas businesses. Aim 5 aligns with our transition growth investment . In 2023 transition growth investment was $3.8 billion, compared to $4.9 billion in 2022. The change from 2022 reflects lower inorganic investment in our transition growth engines, outweighing an increase in organic investment into them over the year (see page 49 ).\n\nBioenergy: Following our 2022 acquisition of Archaea Energy, and continued growth through 2023, Archaea started up its modular design renewable natural gas (RNG) plant in Medora, Indiana in October 2023 (see page 18 ).\n\nEVs: Together with our strategic convenience site networks, our investment in EV charging is helping us to offer low carbon solutions to customers. In 2023 we continued to rapidly\n\nbuild scale in our EV charging network in key markets including China, the UK, Germany and the US (see page 21 ). We also announced a new global mobility agreement with Uber, which will see us work together to help accelerate Uber's commitment to becoming a zero-tailpipe emission mobility platform in the UK, US, Canada and Europe by 2030 and globally by 2040.\n\nConvenience: In 2023 we had 2,850 strategic convenience sites, and aim to have around 3,000 by 2025. In May 2023 we acquired TravelCenters of America, a leading travel centre operator in the US, with a network of around 290 sites strategically located on major highways across the country (see page 20 ).\n\nHydrogen: We aim to build a leading global position in hydrogen - initially by supplying our own refineries and then scaling up to meet growing customer demand. In parallel, as markets evolve, we aim to develop global export hubs for hydrogen and its derivatives. In 2023 we announced a $12.5 million investment in the hydrogen electrolyzer innovator, Advanced Ionics. This investment is expected to help drive Advanced Ionics' growth and facilitate the initial deployment of its Symbion\u2122 water vapour electrolyzer technology for heavy industry. The company's water vapour electrolyzer helps reduce the cost and electricity requirements of green hydrogen production. In the Valencia region of Spain, we launched plans for a green hydrogen cluster called HyVal, at our Castell\u00f3n refinery (see page 23 ).\n\nRenewables & power: In 2023 we were awarded the rights to develop two offshore wind projects in the German tender round. The two North Sea sites have a total potential generating capacity of 4GW (see page 23 ). We also announced our joint venture with Deep Wind Offshore to develop opportunities in South Korea, acquiring a 55% stake in the company's early-stage offshore wind portfolio. This includes four projects with a combined potential generating capacity of up to 6GW. In Texas, US, we started construction work on the 187MW Peacock Solar project (see page 22 ). And in November 2023 we agreed to acquire the remaining 50.03% interest in Lightsource bp, which we did not already own (see page 23 ).\n\n## Low carbon activity investment\n\nIn 2023 low carbon activity investment , a subset of our total aim 5 transition growth investment, accounted for 67% of our total aim 5 investment (80% in 2022). It decreased from more than $4 billion in 2022 to more than $2.5 billion in 2023, reflecting the impact of large low carbon acquisitions in 2022. Most of this investment was in biogas, offshore wind, EV charging and hydrogen. Our current business plans see low carbon activity comprising more than 80% of our aim 5 spend by 2030.",

        "page_content": "## Our investment process continued\n\n## Balanced investment criteria\n\nAll investment cases must set out their investment merits and are considered against a set of six balanced investment criteria although investment decisions may also take other factors into account as appropriate. This standardized approach is intended to create a level playing field for decision making and allows portfolio-wide comparisons of investment cases. The decision to endorse an investment based on the information provided represents our evaluation that it is consistent with what the 2019 CA100+ resolution refers to as 'a range of other outcomes relevant to bp's strategy'.\n\nThe six balanced investment criteria are:\n\nStrategic alignment: For all investment cases, we consider whether the investment supports delivery of our strategy, including our net zero aims. We also assess if the investment case involves distinctive capability that bp has, or intends to develop, and whether it adds to an existing 'scale' business within the portfolio or could help us create one.\n\nSafety and risks: For all investment cases, we provide an assessment of the key risks to the investment that have a significantly higher probability than usual or have a significantly greater impact (relative to the size of the project) were they to occur. Safety risk management at bp is underpinned by our Operating Management System (OMS) that is designed to help us sustainably deliver safe, reliable and compliant bp operations.\n\nSustainability: For all investment cases, we consider how any proposed business opportunity is connected to the energy transition, societal needs and the environment. This approach is underpinned by our purpose and sustainability frame. All RCM cases must consider significant impacts of an investment on key sustainability aims, informed by our sustainability assessment template for investment cases (for our use of carbon prices, see box on page 30 ).\n\nInvestment economics: For all investment cases, we consider investment economics against a range of relevant measures. Depending on the nature of the investment case, these may include return expectations (internal rate of return or IRR), net present value, discounted payback, and profitability index, reflecting assumptions about relevant commodity prices, margins and carbon prices (see page 30 ). The forward economics of an investment case are considered against the differentiated IRRs, applicable to that case at the time of the investment decision, depending on the business. We also refer to these expectations as hurdle rates, although as noted, each case is assessed according to its combined merit against our full set of balanced criteria.\n\n- 1.  For our resilient hydrocarbons portfolio, we seek a payback of less than 10 years for upstream oil and refining and 15 years for upstream gas; together with an IRR of 15-20%.\n- 2.  For bioenergy, we seek an IRR in excess of 15%.\n- 3.  For our convenience and EV charging businesses, we seek portfolio-level returns in excess of 15%.\n- 4.  For our hydrogen investments, we expect double-digit (unlevered) IRR.\n- 5.  For renewables investments, we seek an unlevered IRR of 6-8%.\n\nFor each investment, the relevant return expectations above are assessed using our central price assumptions. For additional capital discipline for investments in oil and gas production, we also compare the central price hurdle above (15-20%) to a case in which the Brent oil price starts at $60/bbl and later declines to the level of our key appraisal assumptions by 2050 (see page 30 ). In addition, for investments in our oil and gas and refined products businesses, as well as any other investments that do not fall within one of the specific businesses set out above, we also compare the IRR in our lower-price case to a cost of capital hurdle rate.\n\nVolatility and rateability: Our investment economics metrics also consider the degree of uncertainty of the cash flows when considering investment cases. For example, some cases have more certainty of future costs and revenue projections. Variation in net present values for the key variables in an investment case are quantified by sensitivity analysis to give a range of potential outcomes against our key investment hurdles.\n\nOptionality and integration: Our assessment considers the degree of optionality offered by a project - the ability to adapt our business to changing circumstances. This could be an option to sell a product with a floor price, or the right to purchase additional equity in a joint venture at specific terms. Other types of options include the right to develop (or not develop) extensions to existing projects, or to change the course of a project's development depending on market circumstances. We likewise seek out integration along value chains across multiple products, services, geographies and customers. For example, our gas production can supply liquefaction plants whose LNG is monetized by our trading business. Likewise, future carbon sequestration projects may allow us to add value to our gas production by converting it to low carbon power.",

        "page_content": "## Paris consistency evaluation process\n\nOur new material capex investments are intended to support the delivery of bp's strategy.\n\nFor evaluations conducted in 2023, investments in scope for evaluation were defined as:\n\n- \u00b7 New: investment in a new project or extension of an existing project/asset or share of an entity that is new to bp or a substantial increase in bp's share.\n- \u00b7 Material: more than $250 million capex investment.\n\nWe evaluated new material capex investment using our central price assumptions (see page 30 ), and, where applicable, using our lower-price case. Where relevant the evaluation also incorporated our carbon price assumptions, applied to the anticipated operational GHG emissions associated with the investment, through to 2050.\n\n## Quantitative evaluations\n\nFor our investment economics and sustainability investment criteria we considered quantitative guide levels, as set out below, to inform the evaluation of each investment's consistency with the goals of the Paris Agreement. As was the case last year, we have again lowered our operational carbon intensity guide levels in line with our decreasing portfolio average. As our approach matures with experience, we may continue to adjust or supplement our methodology. There may be instances when new material capex investments are evaluated as consistent with the Paris goals despite either the economic or sustainability guide levels not being met. The RCM may also take account, in its Paris consistency evaluation, of the six balanced investment criteria (above) using qualitative assessments.\n\nInvestment economics: We calculated economic indicators using our central price, and where applicable, our lower price cases, and applying our carbon price assumptions to relevant operational GHG emissions. (For our key central case oil and natural gas price assumptions, see page 30 , where we also set out our view on their consistency with achieving the Paris goals). We then compare the economic indicators to the relevant economic guide level (see below), based on the corresponding hurdles presented ( page 32 ). We typically target a threshold of >1.0x the relevant IRR guide level, and <1.0x any relevant payback guide level.\n\nSustainability: Where appropriate, we compared the expected operational carbon intensity of the investment relative to that of the portfolio average shown in the bp Sustainability Report 2022 for the segment or the related business activity (upstream and refining). We normally target a ratio of less than 100%, meaning that the investment is expected to reduce the average operational carbon intensity of the relevant portfolio. The potential impact of new material capex investments on bp's net zero aims is a further consideration.\n\n## Evaluation outcome\n\nIn 2023 there were nine new material capex investments approved. All were evaluated as being consistent with the Paris goals.\n\n## Evaluation of investment performance against quantitative guide levels a\n\nAll nine investments met the relevant IRR guide level as shown in the chart.\n\nThe four upstream hydrocarbon projects had emissions intensities below the relevant upstream intensity guide level. Five of the investments did not have an applicable carbon intensity guide for the relevant business. These investments are shown as 'n/a' in the operational carbon intensity chart.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a The 2023 investments have been compared to relevant guides (as applicable to the evaluation of each investment) and are presented here in order of the ratio to the relevant central-price case IRR guide level, and separately in order of the ratio to the relevant emissions intensity guide level. As a result, the evaluations against the economic and sustainability benchmarks do not necessarily follow the same order.\n- b For five of the investments, we do not have an applicable carbon intensity guide level for the relevant business.",

        "page_content": "## Our investment process continued\n\n## Decisions taken in 2023\n\nIn 2023 there were nine new material capex investment decisions evaluated for Paris consistency:\n\n## Argos Gulf of Mexico\n\nThe Argos Southwest Extension project aims to deliver production from a new drill centre in the Mad Dog field, tied back to existing equipment with subsea infrastructure. Argos is our most digitally advanced platform operating in the Gulf of Mexico, and is key to our strategy of building capacity to produce around 400,000boe/d. We expect volumes to average around 350,000boe/d through the second half of the decade.\n\n## Raven Infills\n\nThe Raven Infills Project is a two-well subsea tieback to existing Raven infrastructure in Egypt. The project's expected operational carbon intensity is significantly below bp's average for upstream operations.\n\n## Lightsource bp acquisition\n\nSubject to regulatory approval, bp agreed to acquire the remaining 50.03% interest in Lightsource bp, one of the world's leading developers and operators of utility-scale solar and battery storage assets. Lightsource bp operates with a capital-light, 'develop, engineer, construct and farm down' business model, which is designed to create value by selling interests in developed assets to strategic partners. The acquisition is expected to help meet growing demand for low carbon power from our transition growth engines.\n\n## Oman Block 61\n\nThe investment involves the development and construction of a wellsite for a large number of wells and flowlines in Oman. The programme supports delivery of supply commitments and enables optimal depletion of the reservoir.\n\n## TravelCenters of America\n\nbp completed its purchase of TravelCenters of America, one of the biggest networks of highway travel centres in the US, adding a network of around 290 sites, strategically located on major highways across the US. The deal is expected to almost double a our global convenience gross margin and, over time, brings potential growth opportunities in four of our five transition growth engines.\n\n## Offshore German wind auction\n\nbp was awarded the rights to develop two offshore wind projects in the North Sea in Germany, marking our entry into offshore wind in continental Europe. We expect renewable power from these projects to support our green hydrogen and biofuels production , electric mobility growth and refinery decarbonization, as well as wider industry decarbonization in Germany.\n\n## Murlach Redevelopment\n\nMurlach is a two-well subsea tieback to existing infrastructure in the North Sea. The use of existing infrastructure is expected to help keep down development costs and operational carbon intensity, which is expected to be significantly below bp's average for its upstream operations.\n\n## bp pulse On-The-Go US\n\nbp continued to advance its growth strategy in EV charging, approving a programme of investment of $500 million in EV charging infrastructure in the US, including an agreement with Tesla for the future purchase of $100 million of ultra-fast chargers in the US. The investment will facilitate the expansion of the bp pulse public network across the US, while also enabling support for EV fleet customers by deploying chargers at their private depots.\n\n## Power and gas supply acquisition\n\nbp has agreed to acquire GETEC ENERGIE GmbH, a leading independent supplier of energy to commercial and industrial (C&I) customers, with operations in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, and Poland. On completion the acquisition will significantly expand our European power and gas C&I supply presence.",

Each is managed separately, with decisions taken for the segment as a whole, and represent a single operating segment that does not result from aggregating two or more segments. See Financial statements - Note 5 Segmental analysis.\n\n## Results\n\nThe profit for the year ended 31 December 2023 attributable to bp shareholders was $15.2 billion, compared with a loss of $2.5 billion in 2022. Adjusting for inventory holding losses, RC profit was $16.2 billion, compared with a loss of $3.5 billion in 2022.\n\nAfter adjusting RC profit for a net impact of items, which bp has classified as adjusting (adjusting items) of $2.3 billion (on a post-tax basis), underlying RC profit for the year ended 31 December 2023 was $13.8 billion. The result reflected lower realizations, the impact of portfolio changes, the impact of lower refining margins and a lower oil trading performance.\n\nFor 2022, after adjusting RC profit for a net adverse impact of adjusting items of $31.2 billion (on a post-tax basis), underlying RC profit was $27.7 billion. The result reflected higher gas and liquids realizations and higher refining margins, partially offset by higher tax and the absence of bp's share of earnings from Rosneft.\n\nFor a discussion of bp's financial and operating performance for the years ending 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2022, see bp's Annual Report and Form 20-F 2022 , pages 32-44.\n\n## Adjusting items\n\nIn 2023 the net favourable pre-tax impact of items, which bp has classified as adjusting (adjusting items) was $1.1 billion including:\n\n- \u00b7 Favourable fair value accounting effects (FVAEs) relative to management's measure of performance of $9.4 billion primarily due to a decline in the forward price of LNG during 2023. Under IFRS, reported earnings include the mark-to-market value of the hedges used to risk-manage LNG contracts, but not of the LNG contracts themselves. The underlying result includes the mark-tomarket value of the hedges but also recognizes changes in value of the LNG contracts being risk managed. The impacts of FVAEs relative to management's internal measure of performance are provided on page 338 .\n\n- \u00b7 Net impairment charges of $5.7 billion largely as a result of changes in the group's price and discount rate assumptions, activity phasing and economic forecasts (in particular related to the Gelsenkirchen refinery).\n- \u00b7 In addition, $1.3 billion net impairment charges were reported through equityaccounted earnings (reported within the 'other' category), of which $1.1 billion relates to our US offshore wind projects.\n\nIn 2022 the net adverse pre-tax impact of adjusting items was $29.8 billion including:\n\n- \u00b7 A pre-tax charge of $24.0 billion relating to bp's decision to exit its 19.75% shareholding in Rosneft.\n- \u00b7 Adverse FVAEs relative to management's measure of performance of $3.5 billion primarily arising from an increase in forward gas prices during the year and the changes in the fair value of derivatives entered into by the group to manage currency exposure and interest rate risks relating to hybrid bonds. Under IFRS, reported earnings include the mark-to-market value of the hedges used to risk-manage LNG contracts, but not of the LNG contracts themselves. The underlying result includes the mark-to-market value of the hedges but also recognizes changes in value of the LNG contracts being risk managed. The impacts of FVAEs relative to management's internal measure of performance are provided on page 338 .\n- \u00b7 Net impairment charges of $4.8 billion principally as a result of expected portfolio changes in our oil production & operations segment, the annual review of price assumptions used for investment appraisal and value-in-use impairment testing and the annual review of discount rates used for impairment tests; partially offset by\n- \u00b7 A non-taxable gain of $1.9 billion arising from the contribution of bp's Angolan business to Azule Energy.\n\nSee Financial statements - Note 4 for more information on impairments, and pages 337 and 338 for more information on adjusting items and FVAEs.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe charge for corporate income taxes was $7,869 million in 2023 compared with $16,762 million in 2022. The decrease mainly reflects lower taxable profits. The effective tax rate (ETR) on the profit before taxation for the year in 2023 was 33%, compared with 109% in 2022.\n\nThe ETR on the profit before taxation for the year in 2023 was impacted by fair value accounting effect gains and other adjusting items. The ETR on the profit before taxation for the year in 2022 was impacted by the pre-tax charges relating to bp's decision to exit its shareholding in Rosneft, and the UK Energy Profits Levy. Excluding inventory holding impacts and adjusting items, the underlying ETR  in 2023 was 39% compared with 34% in 2022. The underlying ETR in 2023 is higher due to changes in the geographical mix of profits and the increased impact of the UK Energy Profits Levy. The underlying ETR for 2024 is expected to be around 40% but is sensitive to the impact that volatility in the current price environment may have on the geographical mix of the group's profits and losses. Underlying ETR is a non-IFRS measure. A reconciliation to IFRS information is provided on page 382 .\n\n## Outlook for 2024 2024 guidance\n\n- \u00b7 bp expects both reported and underlying upstream production to be slightly higher compared with 2023. Within this, bp expects underlying production from oil production & operations to be higher and production from gas & low carbon energy to be lower.\n- \u00b7 In its customers business, bp expects continued growth from convenience, including a full-year contribution from TravelCenters of America, a stronger contribution from Castrol underpinned by volume growth in focus markets, and continued margin growth from bp pulse driven by higher energy sold. In addition, bp expects fuel margins to remain sensitive to the cost of supply.\n- \u00b7 In products, bp expects a lower level of industry refining margins, with realized margins impacted by narrower North American heavy crude oil differentials. bp expects refinery turnaround activity to have a similar impact on both throughput and financial performance compared to 2023, with phasing of activity in 2024 heavily weighted towards the second half.\n- \u00b7 bp expects the other businesses & corporate underlying annual charge to be around $1.0 billion for 2024. The charge may vary from quarter to quarter.",

Compared with 2022, operating cash flows in 2023 primarily reflected lower realizations, refining margins and oil trading performance and the impact of portfolio changes.\n\nMovements in working capital adversely impacted cash flow in the year by $3.3 billion, including an adverse impact from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill of $1.2 billion. Other working capital effects were principally a decrease in other current liabilities, partly offset by decreases in inventory and other current assets. bp actively manages its working capital balances to optimize and reduce volatility in cash flow.\n\nOperating cash flow for the year ended 31 December 2022 was $40.9 billion, $17.3 billion higher than 2021. Compared with 2021, operating cash flows in 2022 reflected higher profits from operations partly offset by working capital movements and higher tax payments.\n\nMovements in working capital adversely impacted cash flow in 2022 by $6.3 billion, including an adverse impact from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill of $1.3 billion. Other working capital effects were principally an increase in other current assets and inventory offset by an increase in other current liabilities.\n\n## Net cash used in investing activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended 31 December 2023 increased by $1.2 billion compared with 2022.\n\nThe increase mainly reflected an increase in expenditure on fixed assets and lower divestment proceeds, partly offset by a decrease in acquisitions, as the prior year included $3.0 billion for the acquisition of Archaea Energy.\n\nTotal capital expenditure for 2023 was $16.3 billion (2022 $16.3 billion), of which organic capital expenditure was $15.0 billion (2022 $12.5 billion). Inorganic capital expenditure includes $1.1 billion, net of adjustments, in respect of the TravelCenters of America acquisition. Sources of funding are fungible, but the majority of the group's funding requirements for new investment comes from cash generated by existing operations. For 2024-25 bp expects capital expenditure of around $16 billion per annum, in line with our medium-term target of $14-18 billion.\n\nTotal divestment and other proceeds for 2023 amounted to $1.8 billion, including $0.5 billion relating to the sale of the upstream business in Algeria and $0.3 billion relating to the disposal of bp's interest in the bp-Husky Toledo refinery. Other proceeds for 2023 consist of $0.5 billion of proceeds from the sale of a 49% interest in a controlled affiliate holding certain midstream assets onshore US.\n\nTotal divestment and other proceeds for 2022 amounted to $3.1 billion, including $0.7 billion relating to the formation of Azule Energy and $0.3 billion relating to the disposal of bp's interest in the Sunrise oil sands project in Canada. Other proceeds for 2022 consist of $0.6 billion of proceeds from the disposal of a loan note related to the Alaska divestment. The cash was received in the fourth quarter 2021, reported as a financing cash flow and was not included in other proceeds at the time due to potential recourse from the counterparty.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, $17.8 billion of proceeds were received against our target of $25 billion of divestment and other proceeds between the second half of 2020 and 2025. bp continues to expect divestment and other proceeds of $2-3 billion in 2024.\n\n## Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended 31 December 2023 was $13.4 billion, compared with $28.0 billion in 2022. Compared with 2022, financing cash flows in 2023 primarily reflected higher proceeds from, and lower repayments of, long-term debt as a result of activity to manage the group's debt portfolio.\n\nIn 2023, 1,263 million of ordinary shares (2022 1,900 million) were repurchased for cancellation for a total cost of $7.9 billion (2022 $10.0 billion), including transaction costs of $43 million (2022 $54 million).\n\nTotal dividends paid to shareholders in 2023 were 27.760 cents per share, 4.83 cents higher than 2022. This amounted to total dividends paid to shareholders of $4.8 billion in 2023 (2022 $4.4 billion). The board decided not to offer a scrip dividend alternative in respect of the 2023 and 2022 dividends.\n\n## Debt\n\nFinance debt at the end of 2023 increased by $5.0 billion from the end of 2022 primarily reflecting net long-term debt issuances. The finance debt ratio at the end of 2023 increased to 37.8% from 36.1% at the end of 2022.\n\nNet debt at the end of 2023 decreased by $0.5 billion from the 2022 year-end position. Gearing at the end of 2023 decreased to 19.7% from 20.5% at the end of 2022. The decrease in net debt and gearing primarily reflected cash flows generated from operating activities during the year. Net debt and gearing are non-IFRS measures.

Natural gas decreased by 5% (7% decrease for subsidiaries and 6% increase for equity-accounted entities).\n\nThere was a net increase from acquisitions and disposals of 31mmboe within our US and North Africa subsidiaries.\n\nTotal hydrocarbon production for the group was 5.1% lower compared with 2022.

See Financial statements - Notes 4 and 16 for further information on net impairment charges.\n\nAfter adjusting RC profit for the net impact of items which bp has classified as adjusting, underlying RC profit before interest and tax for 2023 was $8,722 million, compared with $16,063 million for 2022. The decrease reflects\n\nlower realizations, and a higher depreciation, depletion and amortization charge.\n\nItems which bp has classified as adjusting for 2022 had a net adverse impact of $1,367 million including adverse FVAEs of $1,811 million, relative to management's view of performance, partially offset by a net impairment reversal.\n\nSee Financial statements - Note 5 for further information on segmental analysis.\n\n## Operational update\n\nReported production for 2023 was 929mboe/d, 2.9% lower than the same period in 2022. Underlying production for the full year was 2.3% lower, mainly due to base decline, partly offset by major projects delivery.\n\nRenewables pipeline at the end of the year was 58.3GW (bp net). In 2023 the pipeline grew by 21.1GW, including bp being awarded the rights to develop two North Sea offshore wind projects in Germany (4GW), increases to Lightsource bp's pipeline (5.3GW), and an increase in dedicated hydrogen renewables (12.4GW).\n\nIn renewables by the end of 2023 we had brought 6.2GW (bp net) developed renewables to FID .\n\n## Strategic progress Gas\n\nIn Indonesia, we announced that the first cargo of liquefied natural gas (LNG) produced by the new third liquefaction train at the Tangguh LNG facility, in Papua Barat, Indonesia, was safely loaded and sailed in October. The start-up of Tangguh Train 3 has added 3.8 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of gross LNG production capacity to the existing facility, bringing total plant capacity to 11.4mtpa gross.\n\nIn Australia, we purchased Shell's 27% interest in the offshore Browse project.\n\nIn India, the KGD6-MJ project offshore started at the end of June. Along with the two other KG D6 developments production is expected to account for around one third of India's current domestic gas production and meet approximately 15% of India's gas demand.",

        "page_content": "## Gas & low carbon energy continued\n\nIn Trinidad, we restructured the ownership and commercial framework of Atlantic LNG joint venture with its partners Shell and the National Gas Company of Trinidad & Tobago. The restructuring helps provide the certainty required for sanctioning the next wave of upstream gas projects and secures the long-term LNG equity offtake for shareholders, including bp. In addition, we and our partner Shell, were awarded three deepwater exploration blocks off Trinidad's east coast.\n\nIn Senegal, we have exited the Cayar Offshore Profond production sharing contract and transferred operatorship of Yakaar-Teranga gas resource to Kosmos Energy.\n\nIn March 2023 we confirmed that, together with ADNOC, we made a non-binding offer to take NewMed Energy private through an acquisition of the free float and a partial acquisition of Delek's stake, which would result in bp and ADNOC holding 50% of NewMed Energy.\n\nOn 14 February 2024 bp announced the formation of a new joint venture in Egypt (bp 51%, ADNOC 49%) under which, subject to regulatory approvals, bp will contribute its interests in three non-operated development concessions as well as exploration agreements in Egypt, and ADNOC will make a proportionate cash contribution.\n\n## LNG portfolio\n\n- \u00b7 In July bp and OMV announced the signing of a long-term agreement to supply up to 1mtpa of LNG for 10 years from 2026. This builds on bp in May agreeing 2bcm per year of regasification capacity for 20 years at the Gate terminal in Rotterdam.\n- \u00b7 In September we announced our third long-term LNG offtake contract from Woodfibre's British Columbia LNG facility with firm offtake totalling 1.95mtpa and any additional production on a flexible offtake basis.\n- \u00b7 In November we signed a nine-year sales and purchase agreement (SPA) with state-owned Oman LNG to buy one million metric tonnes per annum of LNG starting 2026.\n\nSee Oil and gas disclosures for the group on page 342 for more information on oil and gas operations in the regions.\n\n## Low carbon energy\n\n## Hydrogen and carbon capture and storage\n\nIn hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS), we progressed an additional 1.1mtpa net to bp of hydrogen opportunities for a total of 2.9mtpa to project pipeline (concept development stage).\n\nOur progress in hydrogen is focused on growing scale in key regionally integrated markets, such as Europe and the US, using our refineries as demand anchors. As hydrogen markets develop, we aim to create a portfolio of globally advantaged supply hubs.\n\n- \u00b7 In February 2023 we launched plans for a low carbon green hydrogen cluster called HyVal, at our Castell\u00f3n refinery in the Valencia region of Spain.\n- \u00b7 In the UK, in March 2023 we announced that two bp-led lower carbon projects, Net Zero Teesside Power and H2Teesside, part of the East Coast Cluster, were selected to proceed to negotiations for government support.\n- \u00b7 In April we signed an agreement with Harbour Energy to take 40% stake in the Viking CCS project in the North Sea.\n- \u00b7 In October in the US, the Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen (MachH2), of which we are a member, was selected by the US Department of Energy's Office of Clean Energy.\n- \u00b7 Demonstrations to develop a Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub. Under the proposals, it would include blue hydrogen production near our Whiting refinery.\n\n## Renewables and power\n\n## Offshore wind\n\nIn offshore wind, in 2023 we continued to build our position with access to the German and Korean markets in addition to the UK and US. These positions in offshore wind will enable us to leverage integration opportunities with green hydrogen, EV mobility and power trading as we build the business.\n\n- \u00b7 In Scotland, we announced a successful bid in the Innovation and Targeted Oil and Gas (INTOG) Scottish offshore wind leasing round, bp's first step in floating offshore wind.\n- \u00b7 In Korea, we announced the formation of a joint venture with Deep Wind Offshore to develop offshore wind opportunities in South Korea, which includes four projects across the Korean peninsula with a potential generating capacity of up to 6GW.\n- \u00b7 In July we were awarded the rights to develop two North Sea offshore wind projects in Germany. The sites are located 130km and 150km offshore, in water depths of about 40m, and have a total potential generating capacity of 4GW, raising our global offshore wind pipeline to 9.3GW.\n- \u00b7 In January 2024, we signed an agreement with Equinor under which we will restructure our US offshore wind project investments. Subject to approvals, we will be able to assume full ownership of the Beacon projects, and Equinor will assume full ownership of the Empire projects. bp plans to independently pursue future US offshore wind opportunities.\n\n## Onshore renewables\n\nIn solar, we announced we have agreed to acquire the remaining 50.03% of Lightsource bp (LSbp). LSbp is one of the world's leading developers and operators of utility-scale solar and battery storage assets, with 1,200 employees in 19 countries. LSbp has a hopper of 39GW of renewables pipeline and an additional 25GW of early stage opportunities. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nIn support of hydrogen projects, the onshore renewables pipeline has increased by 12.4GW.\n\n## Power trading\n\nIn January 2024 we announced we have agreed to acquire GETEC ENERGIE GmbH, a leading independent supplier of energy to commercial and industrial customers in Germany, subject to regulatory approvals.",

See Financial statement - Note 4 for further information on net impairment charges.\n\nAfter adjusting RC profit for the net adverse impact of adjusting items, underlying RC profit before interest and tax for 2023 was $12,781 million, compared with $20,224 million for 2022. The lower profit reflects lower realizations, and the impact of portfolio changes, partly offset by higher volumes.\n\nAdjusting items for 2022 had a net adverse impact of $503 million principally relating to impairments as a result of expected portfolio changes, partially offset by gains on disposals, mainly arising from the contribution of our Angolan business to Azule Energy.\n\nSee Financial statements - Note 5 for further information on segmental analysis.\n\n## Operational update\n\nReported production for 2023 was 1,383mboe/d, 6.7% higher than the same period of 2022. Underlying production for the year was 6.3% higher compared with the same period of 2022 reflecting bpx energy performance and major projects and base performance.\n\n## Strategic progress\n\n- \u00b7 Start-up of our fifth platform in the Gulf of Mexico, the Mad Dog Phase 2 Argos platform was announced (bp 60.5%, operator), with a gross production capacity of up to 140,000 barrels of oil per day.\n- \u00b7 We successfully started production from the Seagull oil and gas field and spudded the first of two wells for the Murlach oil and gas field in the UK North Sea.\n- \u00b7 We sanctioned the Argos Southwest Expansion project to tie back into the Argos facility.\n- \u00b7 Bingo, the second central processing facility of bpx energy in the Permian Basin was successfully brought online.\n- \u00b7 Partners approved the expansion of the Shell-operated Great White development in the Gulf of Mexico through a phased three-well campaign (bp 33.33%).\n- \u00b7 The Azeri Central East (ACE) platform topsides unit was installed in the field and the first pre-drill well was spudded. This is the seventh and most automated platform installed in the giant Azeri Chirag Gunashli (ACG) field with approximately 100,000 barrels a day installed capacity.\n- \u00b7 The contract was executed for the Bumerangue block (bp 100%), in the Santos Basin, in Brazil.\n- \u00b7 We successfully bid on the Tupinamb\u00e1 block, an area of 3,056km 2 located in the Santos Pre-Salt Basin, in Brazil (bp 100%).\n- \u00b7 Azule Energy signed a production sharing agreement for Block 31/21, which is a significant stride towards advancing exploration in the Lower Congo Basin.\n- \u00b7 Azule Energy progressed four new exploration agreements in blocks adjacent to existing operations (46, 47, 14/23 and 18/15).\n\nSee Oil and gas disclosures for the group on page 342 for more information on oil and gas operations in the regions.",

See Financial statement Note 4 for further information on impairments.\n\nAfter adjusting RC profit for the net adverse impact of items, which bp classified as adjusting, underlying RC profit before interest and tax was $6,413 million, compared with $10,789 million for 2022. The lower result primarily reflects the impact of lower refining margins and a lower oil trading performance.\n\nItems which bp has classified as adjusting for 2022 had a net adverse impact of $1,920 million (including favourable fair value accounting effects of $309 million - relative to management's view of performance), of which $1,874 million related to impairment of assets, which included an impairment of the Gelsenkirchen refinery.\n\nCustomers - the convenience and mobility result, excluding Castrol, for 2023 was lower than 2022. The benefits of a strong convenience performance and higher volumes, were more than offset by higher costs, including increased expenditure in our transition growth engines, inflationary impacts and increased depreciation.\n\nCastrol result for 2023 was higher than 2022, with higher margins partly offset by higher costs and adverse foreign exchange impacts.\n\nProducts - the result for 2023 was significantly lower than 2022. In refining, the result was primarily impacted by significantly lower industry refining margins, higher turnaround activity, albeit with a lower margin impact, partly offset by a lower level of unplanned maintenance activity. The contribution from oil trading was also significantly lower, as the first half of 2022 benefited from an exceptionally strong oil trading performance.\n\n## Operational update\n\nbp-operated refining availability for the full year was 96.1%, higher compared with 94.5% in 2022, due to a lower level of unplanned maintenance activity.\n\n## Strategic progress\n\n## Convenience & retail fuels\n\nIn support of our convenience transition growth engine delivery, in May 2023, we completed our purchase of TravelCenters of America. It is one of the biggest networks of roadside travel centres in the US, adding a network of around 290 sites to our retail network, strategically located on major highways across the US. To support growing demand for lower carbon mobility solutions, over time we plan to expand and develop new offers, such as electric vehicle ( EV) charging, biofuels, renewable natural gas and hydrogen.\n\nExcluding TravelCenters of America, convenience performance was strong, with 9% ab convenience gross margin growth in 2023, compared to 2022 at constant foreign exchange. Strategic convenience sites grew to 2,850, an increase of more than 450 sites compared to 2022. In addition:\n\n- \u00b7 In March 2023 we signed a new agreement with Rontec, one of the UK's largest roadside retail networks, to supply around two billion litres of fuel over the next five years to more than 60 of Rontec's sites.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 In July bp and Lekkerland extended their successful partnership to deliver REWE To Go stores at Aral retail sites until 2028. This is our largest European convenience supply agreement and brings together Germany's largest forecourt brand with one of the country's leading convenience specialists in support of our convenience growth engine delivery.\n- \u00b7 In August we signed an agreement with Auchan to extend its successful strategic convenience partnership in Poland, with plans to add more than 100 EasyAuchan stores to its retail network by the end of 2025.\n- \u00b7 In September 2023, we strengthened our BPme Rewards loyalty scheme with the launch of loyalty pricing, giving customers exclusive discounts on retail store products at around 300 bp-owned retail sites across the UK.\n- \u00b7 In November we entered into an agreement to sell the T\u00fcrkiye ground fuels business to Petrol Ofisi. This includes the group's interest in three joint venture terminals in T\u00fcrkiye. Completion of the sale is subject to regulatory approvals.\n\n## EV charging\n\nEV charging continues to show strong momentum. EV charge points installed and energy sold in the year grew by around 35% and 150% respectively, compared to 2022, with charge points now over 29,000. On 1 December bp and Iberdrola formed a joint venture to accelerate EV charging infrastructure roll-out in Spain and Portugal, with plans to invest up to \u20ac1 billion and install 5,000 fast EV charge points by 2025 and around 11,700 by 2030. In addition:\n\n- \u00b7 In March 2023 bp pulse announced a new global mobility agreement with Uber, which will see the companies work together to help accelerate Uber's commitment to become a global zero-tailpipe emissions mobility platform by 2040.\n- \u00b7 In August we announced we had approved $500 million of investment in the US to begin building our EV network over the next two to three years. As part of this investment, in October 2023, we announced we had entered into an agreement with Tesla for the future purchase of $100 million of ultra-fast chargers.\n- \u00b7 In September bp pulse , The EV Network and NEC Group, launched the UK's largest public EV charging hub at the NEC campus in Birmingham, UK. The new Gigahub at the NEC has capacity to charge up to 180 EVs simultaneously.\n- \u00b7 In January 2024 we continued to invest in fast-growing southern districts in China, and acquired 3,000 charge points through the bp Xiajou joint venture.\n\n## Castrol\n\nCastrol continued to grow its independent branded workshops, adding around 4,500 workshops in 2023, compared to 2022, with workshops now over 34,000 in total. Castrol also strengthened its market leading position in advanced EV-fluids, as now three out of four of the world's major vehicle manufacturers use Castrol ON products as part of their factory fill c .\n\nIn addition:\n\n- \u00b7 In June Castrol signed a strategic cooperation protocol with Yiwu TNFia, one of the largest automobile service chains in East China, positioning Castrol to expand its share of products in Yiwu TNFia's large and growing network of auto workshops.\n\nCastrol continued to invest in its technology centres in 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 In May Castrol opened its new EV lab at Castrol China Technology Centre in Shanghai, to focus on developing and testing EV fluids. The expansion supports bp's strategy to drive lower-carbon mobility in China and to help customers achieve their sustainability goals.\n- \u00b7 In September Castrol opened the Castrol Americas Technology Center, in Wayne, New Jersey. This is a 12,000 square foot, state-of-the-art laboratory to develop and test fluids for EVs, engine and driveline oils and industrial lubricants.\n\n## Bioenergy\n\nIn October bp's Archaea Energy announced the official start-up of its original Archaea Modular Design (AMD) renewable natural gas plant in Medora, Indiana, located next to a landfill site owned by Rumpke Waste and Recycling.\n\n- \u00b7 In December bp's Archaea Energy announced it had brought two more renewable natural gas plants online, the Monty plant in Kentucky and the Red Top plant in California.\n\nIn addition:\n\n- \u00b7 In February 2023 bp and BHP, one of the world's largest iron ore producers, announced a partnership to trial the use of blended diesel with hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) to assist BHP to reduce carbon emissions from its iron ore operations in Western Australia.\n- \u00b7 In March 2023 Air bp announced the first sale of International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) EU sustainable aviation fuel produced at bp's Castell\u00f3n refinery in Spain, to the LATAM Group, one of Latin America's largest airlines.\n- \u00b7 In April our Rotterdam refinery in the Netherlands, became the first bp refinery to co-process Nuseed Carinta Oil as part of our partnership with Nuseed. Nuseed Carinata Oil is a sustainable low carbon biofuel feedstock which we plan to use in our refineries, as well as onward marketing.\n- \u00b7 In November Air bp collaborated with Virgin Atlantic, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and others, to fuel the first 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) transatlantic flight by a commercial airline. The SAF was a blend derived from inputs supplied by Air bp and Virent. Together, this enabled up to 70% lifecycle carbon emission savings compared to the conventional jet fuel it replaced.\n\n## Refining\n\nWe continue to high grade our portfolio:\n\n- \u00b7 On 28 February 2023 bp completed the sale of its 50% interest in the bp-Husky Toledo refinery in Ohio, US, to Cenovus Energy, its partner in the facility.\n- \u00b7 In May our Cherry Point refinery in the US successfully commissioned the hydrocracker improvement project and cooling water infrastructure project. The new vacuum tower and cooling water tower are now online and are expected to improve availability, reduce maintenance costs and CO 2 emissions.\n- a Nearest equivalent IFRS measure to change in convenience gross margin :\n\nChange in replacement cost profit before interest and tax for the customers & products segment is -52% for 2023 compared with 2022.\n\n- b At constant foreign exchange - values are at end 2023 foreign exchange rates, excluding TravelCenters of America and adjusted for other portfolio changes.\n- c Based on GlobalData report for 2023 for top 20 selling global OEMs (total new vehicle sales).",

Adjusting items include impacts of fair value accounting effects, which were a favourable impact of $630 million. Adjusting items also include impacts of environmental charges, which were an adverse impact of $604 million.\n\nAdjusting items for 2022 had a net adverse impact of $25,566 million mainly relating to bp's decision to exit its 19.75% shareholding in Rosneft and including adverse fair value accounting effects of $1,381 million.\n\nAfter adjusting RC profit for the adjusting items, underlying RC loss before interest and tax for 2023 was $866 million, compared with a loss of $1,171 million for 2022, reflecting increased interest income.\n\n## Strategic progress\n\nWe continued to invest in a portfolio of technology businesses, which we see as having the potential for high growth and to benefit and extend our transition growth engines, through bp ventures. Strategically significant investments made through 2023 include:\n\n- \u00b7 In April Magenta Mobility, one of India's largest providers of electric mobility for last-mile delivery, the journey from hub to customer.\n- \u00b7 In April Service4Charger, a Germany-based provider of intelligent, scalable e-mobility solutions and full-service implementation, including the planning, installation, operation and maintenance of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs).\n- \u00b7 In June WasteFuel, a US biofuels company, which is planning to develop a global network of plants to convert municipal and agricultural waste into bio-methanol, a biofuel that could play a significant role in decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors like shipping.\n- \u00b7 In July Electric Hydrogen, a US based developer of high-efficiency and lower cost electrolyzers with the aim of delivering its first 100MW product in 2024.\n- \u00b7 In August Dynamon, a UK-based software company, which provides advanced data analytics and simulation software tools that help transport and logistics companies adopt low carbon energy solutions such as EV charging infrastructure as they look to electrify their fleets.\n- \u00b7 In August Advanced Ionics, a US-based company developing a new category of hydrogen electrolyzers, supporting the expansion of green hydrogen production.\n\nIn 2022 we took the decision to no longer seek new companies for bp's launchpad accelerator, with our focus now to scale and build businesses within our five transition growth engines - bioenergy, convenience, EV charging, renewables & power and hydrogen.",

Of these Scope 1 emissions, 30.2MtCO2e were carbon dioxide and 1.0MtCO 2e methane g . Overall emissions increased due to temporary operational changes, project start-ups and growth, which was partially offset by delivery of SERs and divestments.\n\nIn 2023 our Scope 2 f (indirect) emissions, covered by aim 1, decreased by 0.4MtCO2e, to 1.0MtCO2e, compared with 2022. Lower carbon power agreements, including those at our Cherry Point and Whiting refineries, contributed to this decrease.\n\nWe report our Scope 1 and 2 emissions on an operational control and equity share basis in our ESG datasheet.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a Reduction in absolute emissions against 2019 baseline.\n- b Reduction in the average carbon intensity of sold energy products against the 2019 baseline.

It is associated with the CO2 emissions from the assumed combustion of upstream production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs).\n\nWe are targeting a 10-15% reduction by 2025 and will aim for 20-30% by 2030 against our 2019 baseline, underpinned by our aim to reduce our oil and gas production from 2019 levels by around 25% by 2030.\n\nThe estimated Scope 3 emissions from the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production were 315MtCO2 in 2023, a slight increase from 307MtCO 2 in 2022, mainly associated with an increase in underlying production due to the ramp-up of major projects and higher asset performance.\n\nSince 2019 our estimated Scope 3 emissions covered by aim 2 have reduced by 13%, which is around the mid-range of our 2025 target of a 10-15% reduction against our 2019 baseline. Our plans and forward path for emissions covered by aim 2 will take into account growth in underlying production due to major project start-ups out to 2025, deferred divestments and growth in bpx energy production.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAim 3 is to reduce to net zero the average carbon intensity of sold energy products by 2050 or sooner.\n\nThis aim applies to the average carbon intensity of sold energy products. It is estimated on a lifecycle (full value chain) basis from the use, production, and distribution of sold energy products per unit of energy (MJ) delivered.\n\nIn 2023 the average carbon intensity of the energy products we sell was 77gCO2e/MJ.\n\n## Average carbon intensity of sold energy products (gCO2e/MJ) ijk\n\n|                                  | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Average carbon intensity of sold |        |        |        |        |        |\n| energy products                  | 77     | 77     | 78     | 77     | 79     |\n| Refined energy products          | 92     | 92     | 92     | 92     | 95     |\n| Gas products                     | 67     | 67     | 67     | 67     | 68     |\n| Bioproducts                      | 40     | 43     | 43     | 44     | 47     |\n| Power products                   | 50     | 52     | 56     | 58     | 56     |\n\nThis represents a 3% l decrease from our 2019 baseline, driven by changes in the sold product mix, methodology updates and the impact of portfolio changes such as the full year accounting of sales by EDF Energy Services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAim 4 is to install methane measurement at all our existing major oil and gas processing sites by 2023, publish the data, and then drive a 50% reduction in methane intensity of our operations.\n\nWe will work to influence our joint ventures to set their own methane intensity targets of 0.2%.\n\nWe maintained our methane intensity at 0.05% in 2023 c . Methane emissions from upstream operations, used to calculate our intensity, increased by around 10% from 28kt in 2022 to 31kt in 2023. This increase is primarily from changes in flaring in our Azerbaijan-GeorgiaT\u00fcrkiye region and Tangguh operations. It was offset by methane emissions reductions from delivery of SERs. Marketed gas volumes increased by 4% to 3,332bcf in 2023.\n\nWe intend to take stock of our targets under aim 4 based on what we learn from our ongoing methane measurement activities and to take account of the Oil & Gas Decarbonization Charter announced at COP28, which we signed in 2023. The Charter includes aims to achieve net zero operations by or before 2050, and zero routine flaring and near-zero methane emissions by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAim 5 is to increase the proportion of investment we make into our non-oil and gas businesses.\n\nIn 2023 transition growth investment was $3.8 billion. This compares to $0.6 billion in 2019 and $4.9 billion in 2022. It represents around 23% of total capital expenditure for the year, which compares to around 3% in 2019 and around 30% in 2022. The change from 2022 reflects lower inorganic investment in our transition growth engines, outweighing an increase in organic investment in them over 2023.\n\nAs we highlighted in our 2022 report, it is not always possible to predict the timing of our capital investments, which means the progress we make on aim 5 can be expected to fluctuate - as it did between 2021 and 2023. Some of our capital investment goes into large transactions - for example, our acquisitions of Archaea Energy and EDF Energy Services in 2022 and TravelCenters of America in 2023. This is true both for the level of investment and for the proportion of our overall investment going into our transition growth engines, or into the low carbon activity subset.\n\nOur disciplined approach to capital investment means that individual investments will be made when we consider there to be a clear and compelling business case, in line with our balanced set of investment criteria, see page 30 .\n\n## Aim 5 transition growth investment\n\n(annual $ billion)\n\n|                              |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| More $ into   the transition |    3.8 |    4.9 |    2.4 |      1 |\n\n- j The aggregate lifecycle emissions and energy values used in the calculation of the average carbon intensity of sold energy products are provided in our ESG datasheet at bp.com/ESGdata.\n\nk\n\nPreviously reported aim 3 figures for the period 2019-2022 have been restated to correct misstatements in sales data identified through business reviews and digital improvement projects.",

Our annual bonus for all eligible employees, including the bp leadership team, has been linked to a sustainability measure since 2019.\n\nThe bonus scorecard against which our eligible employees are measured incentivizes them through three themes: safety and sustainability (30% of which sustainability makes up 15%); operational performance (20%); and financial performance (50%). For 2024 our sustainability measure b is now linked to our operated carbon emissions, which will cover all increases and decreases in those emissions over the year. This measure covers the same Scope 1 and 2 emissions reported under aim 1 (net zero operations).\n\nOur 2022-24 long-term incentive plan scorecard also links performance to progress on Scope 1 and 2 emissions in our aim 1 and, for group leaders c , two social measures are included - on employee engagement, and on improved ethnic minority representation in our senior-level leader d and above population.\n\nAs with the bonus scorecard, for 2024-26 we have adopted an absolute percentage reduction in operational emissions against our 2019 baseline as the basis for measuring our progress against aim 1 in our long-term scorecard. This means that collectively, 35% of our long-term incentive plan for group leaders is linked to sustainability-related measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDirectors' remuneration report, and Share ownership, page 71\n\npage 105\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAim 8 is to set new expectations for our relationships with trade associations around the globe.\n\nWe will make the case for our views on climate change within the associations we belong to, and we will be transparent where we differ.

        "page_content": "## Sustainability continued\n\n## Streamlined energy and carbon reporting (SECR) information continued\n\n## Energy efficiency measures\n\nSince 2016 we have delivered 8.9MtCO2e of sustainable emissions reductions (SERs) across our operated sites.\n\nThis is our key metric for tracking annual reductions in GHG emissions from energy efficiency savings and direct GHG emissions.\n\nA total of 172 SERs projects in 2023 contributed to reductions of 0.9MtCO2e. This is in addition to the 152 SER projects and associated reduction of 1.5MtCO2e in 2022. Those included reduced fuel consumption in the North Sea, waste heat recovery in the Azerbaijan-Georgia-T\u00fcrkiye (AGT) region and the automation of gas turbine generators, also known as power export optimization, in Oman. It also included projects across bpx energy sites in the US Permian Basin for example, electrification and removal of existing compressors to reduce fuel use.\n\nEnergy efficiency activities in 2023 included:\n\n- \u00b7 The implementation of bottom-up approaches to energy forecasting and management so our employees at sites better understand the energy balance of production assets. This has enabled them to avoid emissions by reducing the amount of additional equipment running for a given throughput of oil and gas.\n- \u00b7 The creation of a global energy dashboard for refining within bp Solutions to enable real-time performance management at sites. The tool is currently available for use by the energy sub-discipline network, which includes bp Solutions and site energy engineers.\n- \u00b7 bpx energy: projects focused on improving energy efficiency, including further electrification in Texas, conversion of continuous chemical treatment to a batch process reducing energy demand, and installation of solar air compressors to reduce reliance on imported electricity. The connection of multiple wells to our Bingo central delivery point reduces wellsite footprint and results in infrastructure emission reductions. The facility also utilizes instrument air instead of natural gas to operate pneumatic devices. In Eagle Ford, the Hawkville North East central facility point is undergoing an expansion to replace natural gas-driven compressors with electric-driven compressors. bpx energy has also been decommissioning legacy central delivery points that use natural gas-driven pneumatics and compressors and reroute them through a new central delivery point, utilizing electricdriven equipment.\n- \u00b7 Refining: projects delivered across refining included cooling water infrastructure and\n\nhydrocracker improvement projects to reduce emissions and production optimization at Lingen.\n\n- \u00b7 North Sea: operations have delivered a series of compressor optimization projects. ETAP has upgraded a gas turbine generator with a new combustion system that maintains power output and reduces fuel demand. Clair Ridge has optimized compressor discharge pressure to reduce compression power demand while still maintaining stable production rates.\n- \u00b7 Gulf of Mexico: projects included turbine generator controls upgrades to reduce fuel consumption, trialling a reduced spinning reserve (see definition in next paragraph), LED light replacement and water injection pump optimization. Optimization assessments conducted on drilling operations at Mad Dog have reduced the number of diesel generators being used on site. Equipment upgrades are taking place across Thunder Horse with the replacement of older T-Gens units with more energy efficient ones. Alongside this, the pressure of export gas compressors is being lowered, resulting in slightly lower power requirements.\n\nAs part of managing energy efficiency, we take a portfolio-wide approach to assessing and prioritizing spinning reserve reduction opportunities. Spinning reserve involves running additional power generation machines to provide an excess of energy supply. This can help to protect production from plant vulnerabilities, including power generation reliability. Reducing spinning reserve can increase exposure to power fluctuations for production. We take a risk-based approach when considering reducing the number of running machines. This allows bp to realize emissions and maintenance cost reductions from fewer running machines, while managing the associated production risk.\n\nIn production and operations we held energy and carbon workshops in the North Sea, Tangguh, AGT and the Gulf of Mexico. Each refinery developed draft plans for what it plans to do for energy reduction between now and 2030. These ideas are across maintenance, optimization and projects.\n\nIn 2023 we finished developing our real-time digital carbon and energy dashboards for all refineries to monitor energy performance and alert employees when energy use is high. In refining we held workshops at Whiting and Gelsenkirchen to develop new energy reduction ideas. These ideas were then prioritized and developed at Whiting and Gelsenkirchen, and introduced at Cherry Point.\n\nbp is involved in several external groups working on energy efficiency, including the Oil & Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP) and Energy Star. We run an annual training course for new chemical engineers, which includes energy efficiency and we offer GHG emissions and energy efficiency training for more experienced engineers and practitioners.\n\n## Reporting methodology\n\nOur approach to reporting GHG emissions broadly follows the Ipieca, API, IOGP Petroleum Industry Guidelines and the GHG Protocol for Reporting GHG Emissions. We calculate GHG emissions based on fuel consumption and fuel properties for major sources, such as flares.\n\nWe report CO2 and methane. We do not include nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride as they are not material to our operations and it is not currently practical to collect this data at scale.\n\nEnergy consumption is monitored and reported centrally from all operated sites by fuel type. This includes all energy, both imported and selfproduced, used to run our operations and aligned with our GHG reporting boundary, but excludes energy content of flared or vented gas. Although flaring and venting reflects loss of energy resources, it does not reflect energy use required for production or manufacturing of products.\n\n## Ratio of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions to gross production\n\nbp reports a ratio of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions to gross production, see SECR table on page 51 . This covers all our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions on an operational control boundary basis and uses gross operated sales from our operated oil and gas facilities, refinery throughput and petrochemicals produced. The denominator uses output from production businesses, refineries and petrochemical facilities, which account for 96% of total operated emissions. The intensity ratio has improved due to our aim 1 reductions, as described on page 48 .\n\nThe ratio provided in the SECR table uses production and throughput from our operated upstream, refining and chemicals businesses as a measure of output which can be consistently reported against. We report data on a consolidated basis in the Annual Report and Form 20-F and this differs to the production and throughput used for the ratio in the SECR table, which aligns with the operated emissions reporting boundary.",

This is a significant increase from 2022 (0.1% and 0.6% respectively) and is due to an update to World Resource Institute's (WRI) Aqueduct TM 4.0 in 2023 which changed the distribution of water stressed areas. As a result three of our refineries are located in regions that are now considered to have higher water stress.\n\n## Air emissions\n\nWe monitor our air emissions - including SOx, NOx and non-methane hydrocarbons - and, where possible, put measures in place to reduce the potential impact of our operational activities on local communities and the environment. In 2023 our total air emissions remained relatively flat compared with 2022.\n\nbpx energy contributed to these results by reducing its non-methane hydrocarbon emissions by 5% through various interventions including electrification, compressor optimization, base well tie-ins, new well designs and flaring reduction projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbp.com/ESGdata",

In 2023 we continued to work with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) in relation to their ongoing 'Climate Scenario Analysis Reference Approach for Companies in the Energy System'. Read about how we have used the WBCSD Scenario Catalogue b to inform our own scenario analysis on page 66 .\n\n## TCFD statement\n\nWe report in line with the FCA Listing Rule LR 9.8.6(8) c , which requires us to report on a 'comply or explain' basis against the TCFD Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2023 d .\n\nWe consider our climate-related financial disclosures to be consistent with all of the TCFD Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures and that they are therefore compliant with Listing Rule 9.8.6(8). We have set out our disclosures against each TCFD Recommended Disclosure and in doing so have covered both the Recommended Disclosure and the related Recommendation e . We have made disclosures that take into consideration references made to the materiality of information in the Recommendations related to Strategy and Metrics and Targets. In determining materiality for these purposes we considered whether particular information may have the potential to influence the economic decisions of our shareholders. We have also, where appropriate, considered the TCFD guidance and other supporting materials referred to in the Listing Rules f . In the Strategy (b) section below, we describe elements of our plans for the transition to a lower carbon economy as we execute our strategy.\n\nAs explained on page 14 , we consider our strategy to be consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. The strategy has been developed taking into consideration, among other things, the bp Energy Outlook 2023 scenarios (described on page 10 ), which take account of climate commitments and pledges made by countries in which we operate alongside a range of other factors.\n\nIn preparing our disclosures we have made several judgements, and while we are satisfied that they are consistent with the TCFD Recommendations, Recommended Disclosures and reporting requirements under the UK CFD Regulations, we will continue to evaluate our options for future disclosures. We will monitor guidance as it evolves and consider opportunities to enhance our disclosures.\n\n## Governance\n\n## TCFD Recommendation:\n\nDisclose the organization's governance around climate-related issues and opportunities.\n\n## Recommended Disclosure:\n\n- a. Describe the board's oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities.\n- b. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nThe role of the board is to promote the long-term sustainable success of the company, generating value for our shareholders while having regard to the interests of our other stakeholders and the impact of our operations on the communities where we operate and the environment.\n\nIn performing this role, the board sets and monitors bp's strategy. It is responsible for monitoring bp's management and operations and obtaining assurance about the delivery of its strategy.\n\nAny changes to the company's purpose, strategy and values (which we call 'Who we are') are reserved for the board for approval in accordance with the board-approved corporate governance framework.\n\nThe board's responsibilities extend to oversight of bp's internal control and risk management framework, including climate-related risks and opportunities. These responsibilities are set out in the terms of reference of the board, available online at bp.com/governance .\n\nThe board considers that our strategy allows bp to be flexible to adapt to the evolution of the external environment, including market changes, to remain consistent with the Paris goals, see page 33 .\n\nThe board and its committees have oversight of climate-related issues g , which include climate-related risks and opportunities. Board and committee activities in respect of climaterelated risks and opportunities are set out within the board activities section and committee reports respectively, which can be found on the pages detailed in the table on page 56 .\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities were discussed at each board meeting covering strategy in 2023, and the committees considered climate-related issues where appropriate to do so in fulfilling their responsibilities. Oral reports from each of the committee chairs are given at board meetings to keep the board apprised of the relevant matters discussed including, where applicable, climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nThe board also reviewed documents containing climate-related disclosures.\n\n- a This section provides disclosures pursuant to the FCA Listing Rule LR 9.8.6(8) and in line with the Companies (Strategic Report) (Climate-related Financial Disclosure) Regulations 2022 (The UK CFD Regulations). In the main, we consider our TCFD disclosures achieve UK CFD compliance. Where additional information has been provided beyond our TCFD disclosures to achieve compliance with the CFD Regulations, this has been specifically called out.\n- b Our 2023 analysis used data from the WBCSD Climate Scenario Catalogue version 2.0, published on 31-03-2023 and downloaded on 01-02-2024.\n- c https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/instrument/2020/FCA\\_2020\\_75.pdf.\n- d In considering the consistency of our disclosures with the TCFD Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures we have had regard to, among other things, the documents referred to in LR 9.8.6B and 6C, as applicable to the financial year 2023.\n- e In preparing the disclosures we have referred to the TCFD implementation guidance 'Annex: Implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (October 2021)', available from fsb-tcfd.org/publication.\n- f LR 9.8.6B and LR 9.8.6C.\n- g We interpret the term 'climate-related issues' to relate primarily to those climate-related risks and opportunities for bp which are relevant to the delivery of long-term shareholder value in the context of the low carbon transition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The CEO is responsible for proposing bp's strategy to the board for approval and leading the bp leadership team in delivering bp's strategy and annual plan.\n\nUnder this delegation, the CEO is responsible for overseeing the implementation of a comprehensive system of internal controls that are designed to, among other things (a) identify and manage risks that are material to bp, (b) protect bp's assets, and (c) monitor the application of bp's resources in a manner that meets external regulatory standards. Risks, for these purposes, include the climate-related risks and opportunities for bp associated with the issue of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy. This is set out in the CEO role profile at bp.com/board .\n\n## 2023 activity\n\nWhere considered appropriate, climate-related risks and opportunities were discussed at bp leadership team meetings in 2023 as part of regular business performance updates produced for these meetings.\n\nThe bp leadership team provides oversight of risk, including climate-related risk, through the various committees described on page 73 . The leadership team is informed about and monitors emerging risks via the 'emerging risk' paper, produced by our SVP treasury, which focuses primarily on short- to medium-term emerging risk. Members of the leadership team receive information on the longer-term risks and opportunities associated with the energy transition via updates produced by our chief economist. These papers are shared with the board.\n\n## SVP level and beyond\n\nThe bp leadership team is supported by bp's senior-level leadership and their respective teams, with dedicated business and functional expertise focused on climate-related risks and opportunities or on matters which may be affected by such risks and opportunities. This includes: health, safety, environment and carbon; risk; strategy and sustainability (which includes our carbon ambition, policy and economics teams). Alignment between group, business and functional leaders is fostered through other meetings, for example, the Strategy and Sustainability Management Forum in C&P or the TCFD working group which leads the preparation of bp's TCFD disclosures.\n\nThe assessment and management of climaterelated risks and opportunities is embedded across bp at various levels and delegated authority flows down from the board through the CEO. See page 73 for more information on risk governance and oversight.\n\n## Management consideration of climate-related risks and opportunities is organized as follows:\n\n| Resource commitment meeting      | Forum for approval of investments related to existing and new lines of business above $250 million  or $25 million for acquisitions, or which exceed the relevant EVP financial authority, and any project  considered strategically important such as a new market entry, see  page 31 .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Group sustainability committee   | Provides oversight, challenge and support in the implementation of bp's sustainability frame and the  management of potentially significant non-operational sustainability (including climate-related)  risks and opportunities. It met four times in 2023. During 2023 the committee considered progress  embedding sustainability, performance against targets and bp's position on certain strategic  sustainability issues that present risks or opportunities to delivery. This committee is chaired by the  EVP strategy, sustainability & ventures (SS&V) and comprises members of the bp leadership team. |\n| Group operational risk committee | Provides oversight of safety and operational risk management performance for the group, where  appropriate. Climate-related factors may affect certain sources of safety and operational risk, such  as severe weather events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Group financial risk committee   | Monitors the effectiveness of bp's financial reporting, systems of internal control and financial risk  management, namely material group financial risks.

This includes an impact and likelihood assessment which supports the consideration of relative significance and prioritization of risk management activities.\n\nThe impact criteria outlined on page 74 include health and safety, environmental, financial and non-financial (such as regulatory impact) criteria and are used for assessing risks, including climate-related risks. This provides a consistent basis for assessment across bp.\n\nFor the purposes of our TCFD disclosures, we continue to make use of the TCFD's distinction between 'physical' and 'transition' climaterelated risks.\n\n## Identification, assessment and management of climate-related opportunities a\n\nAs set out in our TCFD Strategy A and B disclosures on page 60 , we have identified potentially material climate-related opportunities and our strategy to transition to an integrated energy company has been informed by these. We identify climate-related opportunities by considering a range of information sources, including the bp Energy Outlook (see page 10 ), which helps to inform our core beliefs about the energy transition. Business opportunities are originated across bp, and taken forward through bp's investment governance framework, see page 31 .\n\nOur gas & low carbon energy business is accountable for the delivery of many of our low carbon opportunities through both organic and inorganic growth (see page 74 ). Our investment governance framework (see page 31 ) provides the mechanism by which alignment of these opportunities with our strategy is assessed and decisions on which to progress are made.\n\n## Risk Management\n\n## TCFD Recommendation:\n\nDisclose how the organization identifies, assesses and manages climate-related risks.\n\n## Recommended Disclosure:\n\na.

Describe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organization's overall Risk Management.\n\n## Risk Management process\n\nRisks which may be identified include potential effects on operations at asset level, performance at business level and developments at regional level from extreme weather or the transition to a lower carbon economy.\n\nAs part of our annual process the bp leadership team and board review the group's principal risks and uncertainties. Climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy continues to be identified as a principal risk, see page 75 . It covers various aspects of how risks associated with the energy transition could manifest. Physical risks such as extreme weather, which may be affected or intensified by climate change, are covered in our principal risks related to safety and operations.\n\n## Physical risk\n\nPhysical risks are typically identified at the asset or project level and are managed depending on the level of risk assessed.\n\nIn the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico, regions more prone to severe weather conditions, our offshore facilities monitor meteorological and oceanographic conditions through the collection of measurements. This data is collated and periodically compared against the 'Basis of Design' for the facility. If significant differences are observed, then this may trigger an update to the 'Basis of Design', prompting action to reassess risks such as structural integrity and station-keeping and if necessary, implement additional risk mitigations, for example updating procedures for shutting down and removing personnel from facilities ahead of severe weather events. Updates may also be made as a result of other new knowledge, analysis methods and data, including climate projections where appropriate.\n\nOur major projects are required to assess the potential impact of severe weather and projected climate-related physical impacts. Where relevant, potential changes in environmental conditions, such as sea level rise and ambient temperatures, over the expected lifetime of a project are to be considered as part of the design process.\n\nBuilding on a modelling exercise conducted in 2022, in 2023 we implemented a screening approach to support identification of potential severe weather and physical climate-related hazards at operational sites. Screening was conducted for a number of onshore sites and, where potential hazards have been identified, and as appropriate, this enables further work to be carried out to assess potential risks and implement appropriate management measures.\n\nFor other assets, such as our retail sites , that are typically not exposed to a comparable level of severe weather risk, climate-related risks such as flooding or wind damage may be managed where appropriate through the emergency response plans and business continuity plans which are mandated through company-wide policies.\n\nAdditionally, at a group level we recognize risk associated with the potential for increased water scarcity due to climate change and other factors and the impact this could have on our operations and in the catchments where we operate. In order to understand the water-related challenges that we face, we review our water impacts, risks and opportunities at our major operating sites. These reviews consider the quantity and quality of water used as well as any regulatory requirements. Over time, we anticipate site-level activities in support of our aim 17 contributing to our management of water-related risks and opportunities. Under aim 17, we aim to replenish more fresh water than we consume in our operations by being more efficient in operational freshwater use and effluent management. And, by collaborating with others to replenish fresh water in stressed and scarce catchment areas where we operate.\n\n## Transition risk\n\nThe board appraises bp's strategy and monitors bp's management and operations to obtain assurance over the delivery of its strategy. This approach enables the effective management of climate-related transition risks and opportunities facing bp associated with the energy transition. For the purposes of our TCFD disclosures, we have grouped transition risks identified by our businesses, integrators and enablers, into the three broad material climaterelated transition risks to bp, see page 61 . However, we continue to assess and manage the component parts of those broad transition risks, including:\n\n## Policy and legal risks\n\nOur policy and partnerships team monitors and develops policy positions in line with bp's sustainability aims. This team works with our regional organization as well as corporate entities to discuss regional\n\nand global policy trends and support external positioning and interactions relating to policy and advocacy topics.\n\nOur group sustainability committee provides oversight of sustainability matters and our issues and advocacy meeting covers emerging advocacy issues.\n\nOur legal team manages bp's litigation, including climate-related litigation and advises on the management of associated risks. This includes the use of internal lawyers and, where appropriate, external counsel.\n\n## Market risks\n\nIn developing our business strategies, we consider market risks, controls and mitigations, including future demand in the different geographies in which we might operate, the competitive landscape and the potential value proposition. We manage these risks through our investment decisions, our hedging and optimization activity, and through key business processes, including the group investment assurance and approval process.\n\n## Reputational risks\n\nOur investor relations and communications & external affairs (C&EA) teams work to mitigate reputation-related risks, which include the risk of shareholder action. Our investor relations team co-ordinates engagement with key investors on both a bilateral basis and through investor initiatives to support understanding of bp's strategy and gain insights to inform feedback they provide to the group.\n\nOur C&EA team manages corporate reputation through identification and monitoring of key issues and both proactive and reactive engagement with relevant stakeholder groups to communicate bp's positions. Under our aim 6, which is to actively advocate for policies that promote net zero, the team also leads advocacy campaigns for policies that support net zero, see page 50 .\n\n## Technology risks\n\nOur technology team works to both mitigate risks and identify opportunities associated with evolving and emerging technologies that play a role in the changing global energy system. The team generates technology assessments and disruptive technology reports for review by bp senior executives and the recommendations are overseen by the bp leadership team, through the Innovation Advisory Council. In appropriate cases this helps to underpin and appraise the business case for new investments, new partnerships, new customer offers or new business models where these are being driven by technology innovation.",

Describe the climate-related risk and opportunities that the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term.\n\nIn setting and monitoring delivery of bp's strategy, the board and leadership team consider climate-related risks and opportunities across the:\n\n- \u00b7 Short term (to 2025): aligning with our near-term business and financial planning timeframe.\n- \u00b7 Medium term (to 2030): aligning with our group business outlook timeframe, and enabling us to think beyond our short-term targets and adjust course if appropriate.\n- \u00b7 Long term (to 2050): using scenarios to help explore the wide range of uncertainties surrounding the energy transition over the next 30 years. For more detail on our approach, see page 11 .\n\nTCFD categorizes climate-related transition risk and opportunity as follows: policy and legal, market, reputation and technology. It also refers to climate-related acute and chronic physical risks and opportunities. Risks in each of these categories have been identified using a risk management process that our businesses, integrators and enablers are required to follow. For more about how the relative significance of identified risks is evaluated, see Risk Management on page 58 .\n\n## Climate-related transition risks and opportunities\n\nAt a group level, we have identified three broad, material climate-related transition risks, underpinned by underlying risks that are assessed and managed through the risk process outlined overleaf on page 61 . These transition risks may cut across our short-, medium- and long-term time horizons; however, we indicate below wherever there is a particular time horizon in which the risk has been considered. The transition risks are also global in nature, so we do not discuss specific geographies here, but the underlying risks refer to specific geographies\n\nwhere appropriate a . We also see significant potential for upside - or opportunity associated with some of these risks. These are discussed under each risk on page 61 and in relation to Recommended Disclosure (b) we also describe the potential impacts of both the risks and opportunities to bp.\n\n## Climate-related physical risks\n\nThe physical risks we have identified primarily relate to severe weather and often represent potential for increased drivers for safety and operational risks to our operations, particularly process safety, personal safety, and environmental risks, see Risk factors page 77 . In addition, we have identified the potential for changes in the availability of freshwater, including as a result of climate change, as a risk to some of our operations. Higher instances of extreme weather also have the potential to impact supply chains and critical infrastructure, such as air and sea ports, as well as our customers.\n\nWe recognize that we could also face other forms of physical climate-related risk over the longer term, for example associated with changes in sea level rise, extreme temperatures and flooding, which could impact our operations. As these risks are primarily operational, and location-specific, they are not grouped in the same way as transition risks.\n\n## Offshore facilities\n\nIn the case of our offshore facilities, climate change could create greater uncertainty around frequency and/or intensity of severe weather events, such as extreme waves, loop currents, and storms, particularly in the medium to long term. These factors could affect the future risk profile of an asset over its lifetime, and could also impact production or costs.\n\n## Water resources\n\nWater resources are increasingly under pressure from various factors, including climate change, and this poses a potential risk to some of our operations that depend on the availability of freshwater. Based on analysis using the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Global Water Risk Atlas, eight of our 17 major operating sites in 2023 were located in regions with medium to extremely high water stress. We have identified the potential for this risk to increase in the medium term. For more on water consumption, see page 54 .\n\nIn common with other businesses around the world, in the longer term we could face adverse market or value chain conditions associated with large-scale cumulative impacts of physical climate change if global mitigation and adaptation efforts are insufficient or unsuccessful. We support the goals of the Paris Agreement and believe that the best mitigation against these types of physical risk is to seek to contribute along with others to the success of global climate mitigation efforts. Our strategy seeks to position us to make such a positive contribution.\n\nWe do not currently foresee any material opportunities arising from changes in the physical environment as a result of climate change. However, the actions we are taking to make our operations more resilient, for example through improving efficiency of our freshwater use, may also bring about benefits such as reduced costs.\n\n## Recommended Disclosure:\n\nb. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning.\n\n## bp's plans for the energy transition\n\nWe describe below how we believe our strategy and net zero ambition are both good for business and support society's drive towards the Paris goals.\n\nIn this section we talk about some of our plans for the transition and where we do so we have identified these with . b\n\nThroughout the strategic report we set out bp's strategy and plans for the energy transition. This includes our progress against our strategic pillars and transition growth engines, see pages 18-23 .\n\nOur progress against our net zero aims and the actions we are taking to help the world get to net zero are described on pages 48-50 .\n\nOur strategy is to transition to be an integrated energy company, focused on delivering solutions for customers. This strategy, together with our net zero ambition and aims (see page 48 ), has been informed by various inputs, including the climate-related risks and opportunities associated with the energy transition described above; the same is true of our financial and business processes.

This could strengthen returns from our hydrocarbon businesses (including securing higher  proceeds from assets we choose to divest) which may enable us to deliver enhanced shareholder value, further  strengthen our balance sheet and grow investment in the transition, in line with our financial frame. Several factors could restrict the growth of our transition engines or returns from them. These factors  include: lack of, or insufficient development and application of, policies, regulations and frameworks that  support low carbon businesses; insufficient consumer demand for our low carbon offering; strong  competition in the market; or the insufficiently rapid development of supporting technologies and  infrastructure or constraints on supply chains for low carbon energies.

Consequently, we are continuing to drive greater competitiveness and value from our refineries, targeting around 96% Solomon refining availability by 2025 and to maintain Solomon first quartile net cash margins.\n\nOur refineries are also a foundation for both our bioenergy and hydrogen transition growth engines. In biofuels, we plan to grow production to around 100,000 barrels per day by 2030 (of which ~20,000 barrels would be from coprocessing at our refineries). In hydrogen, our existing refining demand is intended to be an anchor to build scale. As a result, we expect throughput to be sustained around current levels while the average carbon intensity of our refined products declines.\n\nTaking account of some of the climate-related transition opportunities we have identified, we also aim to increase biogas supply volumes , leveraging our position as the largest US biogas supplier to the road transportation sector and expanding our presence in Europe and internationally.\n\n- Convenience and mobility: given the opportunities in low carbon mobility that the energy transition offers, we are growing our EV charging network and seek to be a partner of choice for our customers as they navigate the energy transition. We are also expanding our Castrol business into the EV and industrial coolant sectors, and aiming to be a sector leader in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as the aviation industry transitions.\n\nWe recognize the risk of a decline in demand for conventional vehicle fuels and products due to the energy transition and we are working to increase the efficiency and resiliency of our existing fuels and lubricants businesses through operating cost reductions and margin optimization.\n\nOur convenience (non-fuels) business is a sizeable and growing part of our mobility ecosystem underpinned by global growth in the convenience and food on-the-go sector.\n\nForecourt convenience is expected to grow in general, even in markets where we see faster fuels declines, helping us to retain and redevelop our retail sites through the energy transition as we deploy new energy sources.\n\nOur acquisition of TravelCenters of America in 2023 enables us to respond to demand growth signals and further expand our low carbon fuels offer and our non-fuel offer in the US. We will increase the resilience of our existing fuels network by growing our presence on major transit routes and with fleet customers.\n\nOur integrated business model across biofuels, hydrogen, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and electricity also helps to provide security of supply and to safeguard margins in a potentially supply-constrained faster transition or during periods of high market volatility. However, the speed of the energy transition may impact the pace at which the EV, SAF, biofuels, hydrogen and LNG sectors develop, which could impact revenue from these opportunities.\n\nLow carbon energy: we recognize the opportunity to scale up our low carbon energy businesses over the next decade underpinned by growing demand and regulatory support.\n\nIn hydrogen, our ambition remains to become a global leader. We aim to leverage bp's existing refinery demand and growing biofuels ambitions to build regional supply positions, providing low carbon hydrogen and hydrogen derivative solutions to our customers in line with the development of the hydrogen sector. We aim to selectively pursue opportunities to grow our low carbon hydrogen production where there is regulatory support and CCS access (blue hydrogen ) or significant sustained cost benefit (green hydrogen ).\n\nTo mitigate uncertainties in the future pace of transition, our hydrogen opportunities are preferentially focused on advantaged locations, while our global hopper offers ongoing investment flexibility.\n\nIn renewable power, we are focusing our investments in opportunities where we can create integration value and enhanced returns, participating in service of green hydrogen, and e-fuels, EV charging and power trading (including flexible generation). We are building a global position in offshore wind, enabled by our capability in large-scale, complex offshore projects, and continue to progress a solar development and sell model with Lightsource bp. Within this, we aim to deliver, and largely operate, around 10GW net installed capacity in offshore wind, solar and onshore wind by 2030.\n\nAs the energy transition drives increasing electrification of the global energy system, our power trading business, which trades renewable and non-renewable electricity, allows us to optimize across the power value chain, from generation, including renewables and flexible generation, across grid markets, to customers. This becomes a differentiating factor in unlocking the full potential value of renewables for bp and helps position us for further electrification of the energy system as well as for further decarbonization of electricity. It may also increasingly help optimize across other value chains like green hydrogen and advanced mobility, that may be dependent on power as an anchor commodity.\n\nWe retain the ability to flex capital between our transition growth engines to optimize returns, recognizing the potential for the transition to occur faster or slower than anticipated and on different pathways. To help maintain resilience to the possibility of a slower transition, we also continue to consider whether the necessary regulatory support is in place and seek to secure a customer-backed route to market for a reasonable share of energy produced by our renewable power and hydrogen projects prior to final investment.\n\n## Impact on technology\n\nWe are investing in digital and technology solutions that can help to generate value for bp, manage risk and help accelerate the transition through focused scale-up and innovation. Over time, we expect our research and development spend to be increasingly focused on technologies with the potential to reduce carbon emissions and enable our new low carbon businesses. See page 46 for examples of technology investments in 2023.\n\nWe recognize the potential for disruptive technologies to impact our strategy. Alongside our research and development investments, our bp ventures portfolio also includes investments in emerging technologies and business models that may help enable the transition to a low carbon economy.\n\n## Physical risk\n\nThe potential impacts of the types of physical risks we have identified could include reduced production, throughput or sales - for example as a result of damage to facilities or supply chain disruption - or in a most extreme case loss of life or an asset. Due to uncertainties associated with the impact of climate change on severe weather events in the future, it is difficult to quantify the potential impacts associated with any increase in these risks as a result of climate change.",

        "page_content": "Having considered both geographic factors and the ability of climate models to adequately represent future trends in physical climate parameters, we seek to take the uncertainties concerning climate-related physical risk into account in our approach to design and operating criteria for existing assets and new major projects . Where appropriate, we have updated our metocean design criteria to include consideration of both forward-looking and historic models, including climate and synthetic models, in an attempt to mitigate both models and extrapolation uncertainty. The particular models chosen will depend in part on geographic location. See Risk Management, page 58 , for how we manage these uncertainties.\n\nAs a step in seeking to improve the resilience of our operations to the physical changes that might result from climate change that we have described above, we have undertaken screening of present-day and future potential physical risk exposure for selected key assets and identified those sites with potential for heightened exposure to physical risks in order to prioritize these for further site-based assessment.\n\nAs part of this prioritized approach, in 2023 we completed a detailed site-based study at our Castell\u00f3n refinery in Spain, which found that the weather hazard contributing the most to risks at site is intense summer storms. Taking account of the results of the study, the Castell\u00f3n integrity management team are assessing new risk barriers to support mitigation of potential risks.\n\nRecognizing the potential impact of climate change on water resources, as part of our aim 17 to become water positive by 2035, we are taking steps to be more efficient in operational freshwater use and effluent management (see page 54 ).\n\n## Impacts on our financial planning\n\nCapital allocation: We plan to invest sufficient capital to execute our strategy, enabling us to mitigate the risks and capture the opportunities we have identified. As part of our annual planning processes, we assess the distribution of capital across our business areas, including consideration of market evolution. In February 2024 we announced that we expect capital expenditure to be around $16 billion in 2024 and 2025; and in a range of $14-18 billion through to 2030. We expect the proportion of that investment directed annually towards our five transition growth engines to have grown by 2030 compared to 2024. To help maintain resilience to the pace of transition and access opportunities, we will continue to flex capital as policies, technologies and markets evolve.\n\nAccess to capital: While there is potential for concerns about the energy transition to impact banks' or debt investors' appetite to finance hydrocarbon activity, we do not anticipate any material change to funding in the short to medium term, and our financial frame includes working to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating, targeting further progress on credit metrics within the 'A' range. In 2022 we reduced our net debt by over $9 billion and by a further $0.5 billion in 2023. Since the end of 2019 we have repurchased around $24 billion of short-dated existing bonds and issued over $12 billion of new bonds with a duration of 20 years or longer, more than doubling the duration of our debt book to over 10 years. Additionally, we have continued to have good access to the commercial paper markets. Subject to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating, we intend to allocate around 20% of surplus cash flow in 2024 to further strengthen the balance sheet. We provide more detail on financial risk factors, including liquidity risk in Financial statements - Note 29.\n\nInvestment criteria: Investments are evaluated against a balanced set of investment criteria; the economic criteria utilize a set of price assumptions that reflect our view of market evolution (for our key investment appraisal price assumptions see page 30 ). In addition, the investment economics for all investment cases where annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from operations are anticipated to exceed specific thresholds include a carbon price for those emissions, that rises to $100/teCO2e (2021 $ real) in 2030.\n\nWhen taking investment decisions we continue to consider six balanced investment criteria including sustainability (see page 32 ).\n\n## Impacts on financial performance and position\n\nAssessing the impact of climate change and the energy transition requires the use of a number of judgements and estimates. We have set out the significant accounting policies, judgements and estimates used in assessing the impact of climate change in Financial statements Note 1.\n\nThis includes information on pricing, useful economic lives, timing of implementation of policies or decommissioning provisions, and assumptions related to how each might change over time and how such assumptions may impact our currently reported assets and liabilities.\n\nOur price assumptions, including those set out on page 30 , reflect a range of future possible scenarios and take account of the potential impact of climate-related risks and opportunities as well as current economic and geopolitical factors. Consequently, impairment losses and impairment reversals consider inputs that arise from climate change and the energy transition. It is not possible to quantify separately the impact of these different inputs on our impairments. However, in conducting our impairment sensitivity tests, that in part reflect transition downside risk, we consider prices within the range covered by the 1.5\u00b0C scenario family within the WBCSD data sets used for TCFD resilience testing below.\n\nFinancial statements - Note 1 provides information on impairment assumptions and sensitivities. Note 4 provides information on gains and losses on disposal or closure of business and operations, and impairments and impairment reversals, and Note 8 provides information on impairment losses relating to exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural gas resources. See Financial statements Note 1, Note 4 and Note 8 for more information.\n\n## Recommended Disclosure:\n\n- c. Describe the resilience of the organization's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario.\n\nOur strategy is designed to be resilient to a range of climate-related scenarios, including those consistent with well-below 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C outcomes, see pages 14-15 .\n\nAs in 2022, to help test our view of this, we have assessed the resilience of our strategy to different climate-related scenarios, including 1.5\u00b0C consistent scenarios. We did this in three steps:\n\n- 1.  First, we evaluated all business areas in our portfolio by i) quantitatively assessing their financial significance, in the context of bp's total financial frame, to understand the potential scale of financial/strategic impact that could be put at risk if exposed to transition uncertainty, including 1.5\u00b0C; and ii) considered whether there is a key variable such as price, margin or demand - which would represent a principal transition driver of such risk.",

Second, we quantitatively assessed the impact, to each business area, of potential transition exposure scenarios in 2030 - the point in our planning horizon at which there is widest transition uncertainty.\n- -  For each of those business areas with both sufficient scale and for which a specific transition risk driver was identified - which collectively represent over 80% of our 2030 adjusted EBITDA outlook - we performed a scenario analysis focused on that transition risk driver, across a range of transition pathways a , including 1.5\u00b0C, as set out below and in our methodology summary on page 66 .\n- -  For each of the remaining business areas we performed a simplified quantitative scenario analysis, by testing the financial impact of 'a scenario in which each business area's expected 2030 adjusted EBITDA is assumed to be reduced to zero - an outcome at least as detrimental to that business area's adjusted EBITDA as could reasonably be expected to result from business-as-usual (BAU), wellbelow-2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C transition pathways'.\n\nIn this way, all business areas were quantitatively tested at, or beyond, a range of transition scenarios.\n\n- 3.  Finally, on the basis of the results of steps 1 and 2, we identified those business areas for which the possible consequences of the downside scenario(s) were sufficiently significant to potentially jeopardize group strategic resilience - the only business areas for which this was found to be the case were oil and gas production with respect to their exposure to oil price. For these business areas we assessed the potential implications for bp's strategic resilience (as defined below) over the full period from 2025 to 2030.\n\nTo undertake steps 2 and 3, we identified financial criteria which can be modelled as proxies for strategic resilience - choosing to do this through three lenses: our ability to continue to (i) deliver a resilient dividend to shareholders, (ii) maintain a strong investment grade credit rating, and (iii) make disciplined investment allocations within our capital frame. These are consistent with our assessment in 2022.\n\nThis is not intended to represent a 'definition' of resilience beyond the purposes of this exercise, and a core assumption of this analysis is necessarily that, aside from any implications of the scenarios being tested, including potential controllable mitigations such as capital or cost management that we might naturally expect to take in response, bp will deliver the assumed underlying strategic and financial priorities out to 2030.\n\nOur approach, described in more detail in box 'Our approach to testing resilience to transition risk' on page 66 , is directly applicable to transition risks #1 and #2 - as well as their associated opportunities - as these lend themselves to a financially quantified scenariobased analysis. The approach does not directly address transition risk #3 - however, we believe that some of the potential drivers for transition risk #3, namely policy and societal trends, may be implicit in these scenarios, and we believe that the successful execution of our strategy will, over time, help to mitigate this risk to bp as well as positioning us to take advantage of the potential associated opportunities. This scenario analysis exercise also does not directly address climaterelated physical risk, our strategic resilience to which is further discussed below.\n\n## Key insights from our scenario analysis and resilience test\n\nWhile the results of any such analysis must be treated with caution - each is necessarily dependent on numerous assumptions and methodological choices, and each has its own limitations - overall, this analysis and resilience test reinforced our confidence in the continued resilience of our strategy to a wide range of transition scenarios, including those consistent with limiting temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C, and in particular, as our greatest transition exposure, to oil price scenarios, tested to 2030. In undertaking this analysis we observed:\n\n- \u00b7 There is considerable uncertainty across, and often within, each WBCSD Scenario Catalogue family in the pace and nature of the transition to 2030 - and therefore considerable range of financial impact across some of the variables selected for the analysis, reflecting the complexity and interdependencies of the energy transition (see table on page 67 ). Generally, we observed that the faster the pace of transition, the greater the uncertainty in the exact shape of the resulting energy system in 2030.\n- \u00b7 Oil price is likely to remain the main source of climate-related transition uncertainty for our strategy through to 2030, reflecting both the wide range of potential pathways and the contribution to our expected total adjusted EBITDA over this period, that oil-price-linked businesses represent b . In the 1.5\u00b0C family, the potential downside suggested by the lowest oil prices is around 27% of group adjusted EBITDA in 2030. However, in a number of the scenarios based on the WBCSD Scenario Catalogue ranges, including those consistent with well-below 2\u00b0C and BAU families, oil price could offer a financial upside relative to our reference 2030 group business outlook.\n- \u00b7 Even with the most extreme low oil price environment in any of the scenarios, sustained over the period from 2025-30 c and taking into account our ability to optimize our capital within the frames set out in our strategy (last communicated at the 10-11 October 2023 investor update), in our analysis we are able to deliver across the three lenses we use to consider strategic resilience, described above.\n- \u00b7 The maximum potential scale of downside impact on our 2030 expected group adjusted EBITDA (across the 1.5\u00b0C, well-below 2\u00b0C and BAU scenarios) from our other natural gas businesses was <6%,while from each of our conventional refining, fuels and low carbon activities was modelled to be <4%.\n- \u00b7 Our diversified portfolio helps mitigate the implications for our strategic resilience of the exposure of any of one of the individual business areas to the identified risk. It is reasonable to consider each potential outcome in isolation since the outcomes for different business areas vary across scenarios (see table on page 67 ).\n- \u00b7 In a BAU scenario, we believe our transitioning strategy mitigates the risk of what we and others have referred to as a 'delayed and disorderly' transition, which might follow in the medium to long term. Should the growth of any one of our in-scope transition growth engine areas be challenged by the downside range in the relevant variable, our analysis suggests that the impact of this on group adjusted EBITDA in 2030 would not be sufficient to impact the resilience of our strategy, as described above, in that timeframe.\n- a Although such scenarios do not and cannot represent all possible futures, we value them as a simplified and schematic way to consider the potential implications of, and uncertainty inherent within, a range of possible energy transition pathways to a future bp portfolio mix.",

The analysis should not be taken as a prediction of the future.\n\n## Maintaining strategic resilience to the transition\n\nTaking into consideration potential constraints associated with factors such as long-term capital investment, contractual commitments and organizational capabilities at any given time, bp's ability to maintain strategic resilience rests, in part, on the governance used to keep the strategy under review in light of new information and changing circumstances. To enable us to understand and respond to the changing pace of the energy transition, we monitor and assess key indicators and metrics, such as policy development, renewables installed capacity, EV sales and low carbon technology costs. Our strategy and capital allocation, the associated risks, opportunities and their implications for our resilience are all reviewed by the bp leadership team and the board and updated as they consider appropriate.\n\n## Resilience to physical risk\n\nAs described on page 62 , we have identified a number of physical risks which may affect our business and assets, the frequency or severity of which could be affected by climate change. Exposure to physical climate-related risk is highly dependent on geographical location and on factors such as asset design, and we seek to manage these risks accordingly. We consider that our approach to managing these risks, described in Risk Management Recommended Disclosure b) on page 59 , supports our strategic resilience to them.\n\nFor the purposes of this Recommended Disclosure, we have considered the potential for physical risks to bp-operated assets to increase as a result of climate change (namely, increases in the potential frequency or intensity of extreme weather events) to such an extent as to have the potential to impact the resilience of our strategy.\n\nDuring 2022, we undertook an analysis of potential changes in certain physical conditions, such as air temperature, precipitation, sea level rise and wave heights, for our onshore and offshore major operating sites, based on Shared Socioeconomic Pathway d (SSP) emission scenarios 1-2.6, 2-4.5 and 5-8.5.\n\nEven in the highest emissions pathway (SSP5-8.5) the results of our analysis suggest that, on the basis of the 50th percentile values and compared to the baseline used (1991-2020), changes in the physical parameters considered are generally unlikely to be significant over the medium term.\n\nThere is, however, uncertainty across different scenarios and wider variances were observed when looking at the 5th and 95th percentile values. Where the data do suggest greater potential for climate-related changes in physical conditions, we intend to consider whether further work is necessary to understand the potential for those changes to adversely impact our operations. For example, modelled changes in extreme precipitation by 2030 (50th percentile values) are less than 10% across all onshore major operating sites apart from Oman - where we have already undertaken hydrological studies and flood risk assessments that have supported the development of our operations there.\n\nOur transition risk scenario analysis identified impacts on the earnings of our oil-priced businesses as having the most potential to impact the resilience of our strategy in 2030. Therefore, and viewing resilience through the same lenses that we describe above, we have considered the extent to which our oil and gas production business would need to be impacted by evolving physical risk over the same timeframe for the scale of financial impact to be sufficient to jeopardize the resilience of our strategy out to 2030. We concluded that a significant proportion of our combined oil and gas portfolio would need to be either permanently shut in or temporarily shut down to jeopardize our strategic resilience in this way.\n\nHistorically, severe weather risks to our operated assets have not occurred at a scale which could reduce earnings so significantly as to jeopardize the resilience of our strategy. As reflected in the latest science from the IPCC, it is in the nature of climate-induced severe weather events that their occurrence, intensity and severity are unpredictable and uncertain. Our own analysis on major operating sites, described above, is consistent with this IPCC view.\n\nDespite this uncertainty, we have found no definitive basis in either the IPCC report or the limited number of detailed studies we have undertaken (see page 62 ), to conclude that climate-change-induced increases in the frequency or severity of severe weather events would be likely to result, at any point in time out to 2030, in disruption and shutdowns across our oil and gas portfolio on a scale that would reduce earnings so significantly as to jeopardize the resilience of our strategy.\n\nFor the purposes of this Recommended Disclosure, the resilience of our strategy was considered separately for the relevant transition and physical risks; accordingly, we did not seek to take account of any interdependencies or cumulative effects between the two types of climate-related risk, and the associated potential financial impact.",

        "page_content": "## Climate-related financial disclosures continued\n\n## Our approach to testing resilience to transition risk\n\nMost of our analysis focused on our mediumterm time horizon (2030) - far enough ahead to provide a divergent range of scenarios, while not so far ahead that it is unrealistic to attempt to generate credible financial metrics for bp, or an individual business area within bp. For variables considered most significant (see below), we also assessed resilience over the period 2025-30.\n\nOur analysis sought to quantify the potential impact of a range of scenarios, including those consistent with 1.5\u00b0C, on bp's currently held (at the time the analysis was completed) internal reference group business outlook to 2030. This outlook is used for internal corporate planning and holds a current deterministic view of our portfolio, activity set, cost and capital frame. The outlook used in our analysis aligned to the strategic direction shared at the 10-11 October 2023 investor update, and the financials lie within the range of financial outcomes set out in that announcement. a\n\nThe steps we took as part of our scenario analysis approach are outlined here at a high level.\n\n- 1. Whole company assessment: We defined, through quantitative analysis, which business areas could have both the financial scale and clear transition exposures to potentially impact bp's strategic resilience.\n- a.  We assessed the business areas in our portfolio by i) quantitatively evaluating each business area's 'potential significance' - i.e. its expected contribution to bp group adjusted EBITDA in 2030 and therefore the quantum of financial impact that might be put at risk by transition uncertainty (including pathways consistent with 1.5\u00b0C); and ii) by identifying, for each, whether there were primary potential value driver(s) that different transition pathways might impact ('transition risk driver(s)'). This was performed to allocate the most appropriate analysis technique to that business (see 1b and 1c).\n- b.  Ten business areas (see table on page 67 ), representing over 80% of our expected 2030 adjusted EBITDA, were identified as both providing a potentially significant financial contribution and facing primary transition risk drivers, and accordingly were subjected to the driver-based scenario analysis set out in steps 2a-2c below.\n- c.  The remaining business areas were taken forward to a simplified scenario analysis, per step 2d below.\n- 2. Scenario analysis: We tested the financial impact of transition on all of bp's business areas in 2030 through either specific 'driver-based' scenario modelling (that includes 1.5\u00b0C and current policies), or by 'simplified' conservative scenario analysis, that modelled cases likely to be beyond these ranges.\n- a.  For the driver-based scenario analysis, we selected the primary transition risk driver(s) for each business area - the variable(s) from the WBCSD Scenario Catalogue representing what we consider to be the primary driver(s) of that business area's exposure to the energy transition. For each transition risk driver, we extracted the full range of 2030 outcomes within each scenario 'family'. Given the global nature of the transition risks and opportunities we have identified, we used the 'world' values in the Catalogue except for gas price (see table on page 67 ).\n- b.  By calibrating the WBCSD Scenario Catalogue 2030 scenarios to relevant business metrics underpinning our strategic planning (for example, oil price or EV demand/utilization), we modelled the impact of each variable, across the full range of scenarios and each scenario family, on the 2030 expected earnings (adjusted EBITDA) for the associated business area(s). For example, we applied an earnings rule of thumb deemed appropriate to the period in question to the deviation of oil prices in WBCSD versus our reference case price. This analysis was unmitigated (see 'Other key considerations').\n- c.  This enabled us to assess the potential for each scenario to materially impact group adjusted EBITDA in 2030 (and by implication associated cash flows), against the reference group business outlook. By modelling the specific business area within the reference group business outlook (described in step 1b above), its exposure to the most extreme range of the respective scenario could be assessed to identify which (if any) variables(s) and scenario(s) could have the potential to impact strategic resilience (as defined below) most materially, and as such, which business areas should be carried forward into a multi-year resilience assessment.\n- d.  For the simplified scenario analysis, we took a simpler conservative approach, by evaluating whether a scenario in which each business area's expected 2030 adjusted EBITDA is assumed to be reduced to zero - an outcome at least as detrimental to that business area's adjusted EBITDA as could reasonably be expected to result from ranges associated with the trajectory of each of the 1.5\u00b0C, 2\u00b0C or BAU scenario families - could have the potential to impact strategic resilience (as defined below) materially.\n- 3. Multi-year resilience test: This step tested bp's resilience to the exposure of any sufficiently material business areas to downside scenarios that may have the potential to jeopardize the ability to generate surplus cash flow and a strong cash cover ratio and gearing level financial metrics that were treated for the purposes of the analysis as representing financial evidence of delivery of bp's strategic priorities. From step 2, only the exposure to oil price was assessed as sufficiently material in this sense, and hence carried forward for multi-year resilience analysis. Our multi-year (2025-30) oil price resilience test considered sustained low oil prices consistent with the most extreme WBCSD Scenario Catalogue 2025 and 2030 scenarios - for 2025 the IEA (World Energy Model Net Zero Energy 2050) price at $52/bbl, and for 2030 the UN PRI (Inevitable Policy Response Required Policy Scenario) at $31.8/bbl (both 2021 $ real).\n\n## Other key considerations\n\n- \u00b7 For the purposes of steps 2 and 3, we considered the resilience of our strategy to climate-related transition risk through the three lenses described on page 61 . We defined the following as proxy indicators for these lenses:\n- -  Group surplus cash flow, to confirm whether after funding, among other things, capital spend within our disclosed capital frame (10-11 October 2023 investor update) and the dividend/ share assumed in our reference group business outlook, sufficient surplus cash flow remains to maintain or reduce net debt and/or make share buybacks.\n- -Healthy cash cover ratio and gearing as indicators of the ability to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating.\n- a As was the case for the analysis presented in the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 , the financials used do not include any reference to the shareholding in Rosneft that bp announced its intention to exit from on 27 February 2022.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 For steps 2 and 3, we made the simplifying assumption that, aside from the driver being modelled, our strategy, operating model, cost basis, volumes, margins, sales proceeds and taxes would remain unchanged out to 2030. We have also not deviated from bp's reference view of potential future shareholder distributions and uses of surplus cash as a basis for analysis.\n- \u00b7 There are a range of mitigations or actions that we might naturally be expected to take in response to external market, price and demand trends, including cost reductions, portfolio adjustments, capital reallocation or capital reductions within the frames set out in our strategy.\n- \u00b7 For steps 2 and 3, given we would seek to make use of opportunities to maintain our strategic flexibility in the face of the many uncertainties of the energy transition, our methodology retains the optionality in downside scenario modelling to apply some or all of these mitigations.\n- \u00b7 The design of a strategic resilience analysis involves numerous methodological choices and assumptions - any one of which could reasonably have been different, leading to\n\ndifferent outcomes. We have found value in conducting this analysis; however, we are mindful of the limitations to any such exercise and the highly qualified nature of any conclusions which may be drawn from it. The disclosures provided here should be read in conjunction with the rest of our strategic report, where we discuss how we have developed, and continue to evolve, our approach to strategy.\n\n- \u00b7 As outlined above, we utilized our latest internal reference group business outlook as the basis against which resilience has been tested, as this is our latest deterministic view against which to model the transition sensitivities to 2030 and aligns to the strategic update provided to investors in October 2023. Alongside disclosed elements such as the capital frame range to 2030, this includes shaping assumptions such as future distribution and net debt management. Through conducting this analysis, we do not intend to imply or commit to a specific forward trajectory of usage of cash, beyond those disclosed in the investor update in October 2023 and previously published strategy updates.\n\n## Strategic report\n\nWhile we cannot disclose, for confidentiality reasons, the detail of the deterministic case, the test assesses whether the resilience indicators in our reference group business outlook are impacted by the transition uncertainties tested. Further, by the nature of the timeframes considered, a variety of uncertainties exist around this deterministic case (including transition risk itself) as indicated by the range of adjusted EBITDA disclosed in the full year and 4Q results update on 6 February 2024. It is not practical, and we have not attempted, to extend the analysis conducted here to any other potential outcomes within the disclosed range of group adjusted EBITDA.\n\n- \u00b7 Where rules of thumb have been applied, to convert variance in hydrocarbon price to variance in adjusted EBITDA, these are deemed appropriate to the period in question - i.e. they reflect the respective 2030 (step 2) and 2025-30 (step 3) portfolios and price leverage for this period. Due to the evolution of bp's portfolio, these rules of thumb may diverge from any short-term rule of thumb that we publish.\n\n## WBCSD Scenario Catalogue family ranges for 2030 key transition variables\n\n|                           |                                         |                                                               |                                                                | BAU        | BAU   | Below 2\u00b0C   | Below 2\u00b0C   | 1.5\u00b0C   | 1.5\u00b0C   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------|-------------|-------------|---------|---------|\n| Business area             |                                         |                                                               | TCFD/WBCSD variable                                            | Min        | Max   | Min         | Max         | Min     | Max     |\n| Resilient  hydrocarbons   | Oil and natural gas production          | Oil and natural gas production                                | Oil price a  ($2021/bbl)                                       | 62.12      | 82.00 | 47.70       | 76.88       | 31.80   | 68.87   |\n| Resilient  hydrocarbons   |                                         |                                                               | Natural gas price b  ($2021/mmbtu)                             | 3.73       | 5.42  | 2.91        | 5.61        | 1.90    | 5.88    |\n|                           | Refining                                | - refined oil demand                                          | Primary energy demand for oil                                  | - 0.1 15.2 |       | - 3 .1      | 11.6        | -16.8   | -1.0    |\n|                           |                                         | - bio-jet demand                                              | Final demand for liquid biofuels in  0.21                      | 1.03       |       | 0.21        | 1.64        | 0.44    | 1.73    |\n|                           | Biogas                                  | Biogas demand in road transport   (EJ/yr)                     | 0.00                                                           | 0.18       |       | 0.01        | 0.25        | 0.00    | 0.19    |\n| Convenience  and mobility | EV charging                             | EV charging                                                   | Final energy demand for electricity  in road transport (EJ/yr) | 2.53       | 6.49  | 3.40        | 8.37        | 4.09    | 9.18    |\n|                           | Aviation fuel sales                     | Liquid fuel consumption in aviation  (EJ/yr)                  | 14.95                                                          | 20.06      |       | 14.73       | 18.84       | 9.37    | 14.66   |\n|                           | Conventional fuels retail               | Final energy demand for liquid oil in  road transport (EJ/yr) | 72.17                                                          | 93.57      | 65.20 |             | 93.87       | 48.57   | 78.92   |\n|                           | Conventional B2B & supply               |                                                               |                                                                |            |       |             |             |         |         |\n| Low carbon  energy        | Conventional road lubricants Renewables | Renewable capacity additions   (GW vs 2020)                   | 3,055                                                          | 6,181      |       | 3,131       | 7,671       | 5,438   | 9,797   |\n|                           | Hydrogen production                     | Hydrogen consumption (EJ/yr)                                  | 0.20                                                           |            | 4.32  | 0.20        | 5.28        | 0.48    | 10.75   |\n\nFor the other business areas not shown above, we applied the generic scenario analysis methodology described in point 2d on page 66 , thereby ensuring coverage of all of bp's business areas.\n\n- a Oil price sensitivities have been applied to the oil and gas production portfolio that is linked to oil marker prices - as such it not only reflects oil production exposure, but also a proportion of bp's natural gas production that is contracted off oil marker prices.\n- b Gas prices shown reflect Henry Hub price ranges.

We want to improve our safety performance and work towards the goal we set in 2021 to eliminate fatalities, life-changing injuries and tier 1 process safety events.\n\nWe deeply regret the fatalities and life-changing injuries that occurred at bp in 2023. In May a contractor in our US Permian operations was fatally injured when operating a forklift, and in June a contractor in the same region suffered a life-changing injury while performing manual activity. At our TravelCenters of America business, one employee was struck by a vehicle and fatally injured and another employee was killed in a workplace violence incident a .\n\nWe have offered our condolences and support to the families and employees affected. We are taking action to learn from these incidents to help drive further improvements in safety.\n\n## Keeping people safe\n\nWe monitor and report on key workforce personal safety metrics in line with industry standards. We include both employees and contractors in our data.\n\nIn 2023 our recordable injury frequency (RIF) increased by 47% compared to 2022. We attribute an increase in injuries in part to the onboarding of retail operations we acquired such as Thorntons . Plans are in place to help prevent injuries in future.\n\nIn 2023 we made further improvements to mitigate safety risks in refining and production by strengthening our safety barriers and the guidance in our Operating Management System (OMS).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRIF key performance indicator, page 24\n\n## Driving safety\n\nDriving is one of the biggest personal safety risks we face at bp. In 2023 seven severe vehicle accidents occurred, a decrease from 10 in 2022. The number of kilometres driven fell by 4.2% over the same period.\n\n|                               |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Severe vehicle  accident rate |  0.023 |  0.037 |  0.034 |\n\n## Our Operating Management System\n\nOur OMS provides a single group-wide framework for delivering safe, reliable and compliant operations. Our OMS sets out the way in which our businesses around the world are expected to understand and manage their environmental and social impacts, including requirements on engaging with stakeholders who may be affected by our activities.\n\nWe review and amend these requirements from time to time to reflect our priorities. Any variations in the application of our OMS, in order to meet local regulations or circumstances, are subject to a governance process. Recently acquired operations need to transition to our OMS.\n\nIn 2023 we updated our OMS with a view to making it simpler and clearer, to support more rigorous application. The updates included revised requirements in our environmental and social practices that cover investment decisions, projects and operations. These updated practices set out requirements to identify, prevent and mitigate carbon, environmental and social impacts and risk and to identify related opportunities.\n\nOur OMS requires each of bp's operating businesses and functions to create and maintain its own OMS handbook, describing how it will carry out its local operating activities.\n\nWe use a 'three lines of defence' model to test the effective management of all types of risk, including safety. The nature and extent of first, second and third lines of defence activities are based on the type and level of risk.\n\n## Preventing incidents\n\nWe carefully plan our operations with the aim of identifying potential hazards and having rigorous operating and maintenance practices applied by capable people to manage risks at every stage. We design our new facilities in line with process safety, good design and engineering principles. We track our safety performance using industry-aligned metrics such as those found in the American Petroleum Institute recommended practice 754 and the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers recommended practice 456.\n\nOur combined reported tier 1 and tier 2 process safety events (PSEs) have generally decreased over the last 11 years, apart from in 2019. This downward trend continued in 2023, with 11 fewer (22%) than in 2022.\n\nWe investigate serious or complex incidents, which may include near misses, and we also use leading indicators, such as inspections and equipment tests, to monitor the strength of controls to prevent incidents.\n\nWe have also made progress in preventing and reducing spills. In 2023 there were 100 oil spills compared with 108 in 2022. Although portfolio changes may affect the overall baseline of our operations, our goal is still the elimination of tier 1 PSEs.\n\n|                                                        |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Tier 1 and tier 2  process safety  events Oil spills - |     39 |     50 |     62 |\n| number                                                 |    100 |    108 |    121 |\n| Oil spills -  contained                                |     52 |     57 |     73 |",

We maintain disaster recovery, crisis and business continuity management plans and work to build day-to-day response capabilities to support local management of incidents. We test our plans and preparedness through exercises that simulate real-life scenarios. In 2023 we conducted a number of exercises in countries including Egypt and Spain.\n\n## Security\n\nWe monitor for hostile actions that could harm our people or disrupt our operations. These actions might be connected to political or social unrest, terrorism, armed conflict or criminal activity. We take these potential threats seriously and assess them continuously. Our 24-hour response information centre in the UK uses state-of-the-art technology to monitor evolving high-risk situations in real time. It helps us to assess the safety of our people and provide them with practical advice if there is an emergency.\n\n## Cyber security\n\nThe severity, sophistication and scale of cyber attacks continues to evolve. Increasing digitization and reliance on IT systems and cloud platforms makes managing cyber risk an even greater priority for many industries, including our own. Direct or collateral impact can come from a variety of cyber threat actors, including nation states, criminals, terrorists, hacktivists and insiders. As in previous years, we have experienced threats to the security of our digital systems and our barriers have worked well to mitigate and contain them to minimize any impact on our business.\n\nWe have a range of measures to manage this risk, including the use of cyber security policies and procedures, security protection tools, threat monitoring and event detection capabilities, and incident response plans. We conduct exercises to test our response to, and recovery from, cyber attacks. We collaborate closely with governments, law enforcement and industry peers to understand and respond to threats.\n\nTo encourage vigilance among our employees, our extensive cyber security training courses and awareness programme provide regular education on a wide range of topics such as phishing and the correct classification and handling of our information. We also use a cyber barometer tool to empower individual risk mitigation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHow we manage risk, page 73 Additional disclosures - cyber security,\n\npage 360\n\n## Working with contractors\n\nThrough documents that help bridge between our policies and those of our contractors, we define the way our safety management system co-exists with systems used by our contractors to manage risk on a site. We conduct risk-based quality, technical, health, safety and security audits before awarding contracts. Once contractors start work, we continue to monitor their safety performance. Our OMS includes requirements and practices for working with contractors. Our standard model contracts include health, safety and security requirements. We expect and encourage our contractors and their employees to act in a way that is consistent with our code of conduct and take appropriate action if those expectations, or their contractual obligations are not met.\n\n## Our partners in joint arrangements\n\nWe monitor performance and how risk is managed in our joint arrangements , whether we are the operator or not.

Our culture frame 'Who we are' sets out the culture we want to build at bp.\n\nOur culture is reinforced by various factors including our code of conduct, our approach to diversity, equity and inclusion, compliance with local legislation and regulations, speak-up channels and monitoring employee sentiment. Read more about the board's role in overseeing bp's culture on page 97 .\n\n## Developing our people\n\nOur people are crucial to delivering our purpose and strategy. We aim to recruit talented people from diverse backgrounds, and we invest in training, development and competitive rewards for them. We focus our attraction, recruitment, development and retention activities to provide the support and skills they need to thrive and help bp succeed.\n\nIn 2023 we strengthened our development offer, evolving it to meet the demands of the energy transition. We launched several development initiatives, including new learning pathways on\n\nour OMS, code of conduct and other policies apply. We aim to report on aspects of our business where we are the operator - as we directly manage the performance of these operations. Where we are not the operator, our OMS is available as a reference point for bp businesses when engaging with other operators and co-venturers. We have a group framework to assess and manage bp's exposure related to safety, operational and bribery and corruption risk from our participation in these types of arrangements.\n\nWhere appropriate, we may seek to influence how risk is managed in arrangements where we are not the operator.\n\nThe people and governance committee reviews workforce policies and practices and their alignment with bp's strategy, purpose, beliefs and culture, and conducts workforce engagement measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeople and governance committee report, page 94",

This learning is available to all employees and covers safety, technical, leadership, digital and sustainability skills. Our development offer also includes our mandatory curriculum focused on compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as conformance with bp's internal standards.\n\n## Diversity, equity and inclusion\n\nOur aim 14 is greater diversity, equity and inclusion for our workforce and our customers, and to increase supplier diversity spend by 2025 to $650 million for US-related spend a . We want our workforce and customers to experience greater equity - fair treatment according to everyone's different needs and situations. We aim to do this by improving workforce diversity and workplace inclusion, making customer experiences more inclusive, and increasing our annual expenditure with certified diverse suppliers, including female and underrepresented or minority groups, to $650 million for US-related spend by 2025.\n\nWe report information and disclose against targets on the representation of women and ethnic minorities on our board and executive management. Read more on page 83 .\n\n## Gender equality\n\nWe are working to further improve the gender balance across our workforce. In December 2023 seven of the 11 positions in our leadership team were held by women. Our ambition is to reach gender parity for the top levels of leadership (top 120 roles) by 2025 and parity for all executive-level employees (group leaders) by 2030. We also have an ambition of 40% female representation for the next layer of senior leadership (senior-level leaders) by 2030. In 2023 34% of group leader roles were filled by women (2022 33%).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbp Gender and Ethnicity Pay Gap Report, bp.com/ukgenderpaygap\n\n## Ethnic diversity\n\nWe have made progress on our ambition to increase minority representation in the UK and US.\n\nIn 2023 we continued our Leadership Inclusion for Talent (LIfT) programme - a 12-month development experience - to support the progression of under-represented minority talent in the US and UK into senior leadership roles.\n\nWe also delivered our mandatory Race4Equity racial equity and inclusion training programme to almost 100% of our most senior leaders and 84% of employees at other levels in the US and UK.\n\nIn 2023 33% of our group leaders came from countries other than the UK and the US (2022 33%).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more in our DE&I report at bp.com/diversity\n\nComposition of the board, page 83\n\nDiversity reporting in line with the Parker Review, page 96\n\nDiversity reporting in line with the Listing Rules, page 133\n\n## Inclusion\n\nTo promote an inclusive culture, we provide leadership training and support employee-run advocacy groups in areas such as gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disability.\n\nAs well as bringing employees together, these groups support our recruitment programmes and provide feedback on the potential impact of policy changes. Each group is sponsored by a member of the bp leadership team.\n\nWe aim to provide equal opportunity in recruitment, career development, promotion, training and reward for all employees regardless of ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, marital status, disability or any other characteristic protected by applicable laws.\n\nWe have embedded 'Hiring Inclusively', a set of globally consistent recruiting principles to help enable an inclusive, equitable approach to hiring. It supports recruiters to review internal and external market data for skills availability by gender and by other historically underrepresented groups in some geographies.\n\n## Supporting disabled employees\n\nWe continue to take steps to help improve the experience of the workplace for employees with disabilities, with support from employee-led disability, neurodiversity, and mental wellbeing business resource groups (BRGs) offering:\n\n- \u00b7 Inclusive recruitment training, disability and neurodiversity awareness sessions, as well as specific internships and apprenticeships.\n- \u00b7 Access to assistive technology support (such as voice recognition software and screen readers) for all employees.\n- \u00b7 Improved accessibility in communications, ensuring bp's brand visual standards are more accessible.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf existing employees become disabled, our policy is to engage and use reasonable accommodations or adjustments to enable continued employment.\n\nWe have partnerships to help source talent, assist with research and training and support students with disabilities to build the skills they need to access the workplace. Our partners include the National Organization on Disability in the US, and the Business Disability Forum in the UK. bp is also part of the Valuable 500 - a global business collective made up of 500 CEOs and their companies, to drive lasting change for people around the world living with a disability.\n\n## Employee engagement\n\nOur managers hold team and one-to-one meetings with their team members, complemented by formal processes through works councils in parts of Europe.\n\nWe regularly communicate with employees on factors that affect bp's performance, and seek to maintain constructive relationships with labour unions formally representing our employees.\n\nWe monitor employee sentiment through our 'Pulse annual' employee survey, which is sent to all eligible employees, and through our 'Pulse live' survey, which is sent to a representative sample of employees weekly. Our overall engagement metric, employee engagement, increased to 73% (2022 70%), while pride in working for bp increased to a record 80% (2022 78%).\n\nWe will continue to develop engagement plans based on feedback from the annual and weekly surveys to help us deliver on safety, and meet our strategic objectives and our 2025 targets, focusing on four areas to drive further progress - leadership, transforming, psychological safety and inclusion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur employee engagement key performance indicator, page 27 How the board engaged with the workforce, page 92\n\n## Share ownership\n\nWe encourage employee share ownership and have a number of employee share plans in place.

Results from 2023 showed that employee wellbeing increased by four points to 72% (2022 68%).\n\nWe took further action to create workplaces where people can talk openly about mental health and get help if they need it. We updated our mental health training programmes, which are designed to build employees' awareness and their ability to care for themselves and others.\n\n## Ethics and compliance\n\n## Our code of conduct\n\nOur code sets standards and expectations for how we do the right thing and empowers our employees to speak up without fear of retaliation.\n\nIt puts safety first, and together with our Safety Leadership Principles and Operating Management System (OMS), helps us make safe and ethical decisions, act responsibly, comply with applicable laws and deliver on our sustainability frame.\n\nOur code applies to all bp employees, officers and board members. Our regular mandatory training and communications help employees understand how to apply our code and how to raise questions or concerns.\n\nAll bp employees are required to confirm annually that they have read and understand our code and complied with its principles. We expect and encourage all our contractors and their employees to act in ways that are consistent with it.\n\nAny concerns or enquiries can be raised through multiple speak-up channels. These include line managers, senior leaders, and contacts in our people & culture, ethics & compliance or legal teams. We also have a confidential global helpline, OpenTalk. It is available in 75 languages and can be accessed all day, every day on the telephone or internet, by employees, the wider workforce, communities, business partners and other stakeholders. In most locations, anyone has the right to contact OpenTalk anonymously except where this is prohibited by law.\n\nAny instances where we believe individuals have fallen short of our expectations, set out in our beliefs, 'Who we are' and our code of conduct, are taken very seriously and, where appropriate, a formal investigation is carried out.\n\nWe may take action in response to reported concerns, for example through training and monitoring trends in our 'Pulse annual' employee survey data to help proactively mitigate issues around misconduct. We follow a disciplinary process and will issue sanctions where appropriate, which may include dismissal.\n\nWe received more than 2,250 concerns or enquiries through these channels in 2023 (2022 1,350). In 2023 around 66 separations resulted from non-conformance with our code or unethical behaviour a .\n\nAs in 2022 the most frequently raised concerns related to bullying, harassment and discrimination, with these accounting for around half of all concerns. The second most common issue was alleged fraud.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## bp.com/codeofconduct\n\n## Anti-bribery and corruption\n\nWe operate in parts of the world where bribery and corruption present a high risk. We have a responsibility to our employees, our shareholders and the countries and communities in which we do business to be ethical and lawful in all our work.\n\nOur code of conduct explicitly prohibits engaging in bribery or corruption in any form. Our group-wide anti-bribery and corruption policies and procedures include measures and guidance to assess risks, understand relevant laws and report concerns. They apply to all bp-operated businesses.\n\nWe provide appropriate training including for those employees in locations or roles assessed to be at a higher risk of bribery and corruption. In 2023 around 10,500 employees completed anti-bribery and corruption training as part of our ethics and compliance risk-based learning. This is higher than the 7,500 employees trained in 2022, due to the rolling time schedule we use to assign training.\n\nWe also conduct anti-bribery compliance audits on selected suppliers to assess their conformance with our anti-bribery and corruption contractual requirements. We take corrective action with suppliers and business partners who fail to meet our expectations, which may include terminating contracts. In 2023 we issued 31 ABC supplier audit reports. (2022 37).\n\n## Political donations and activity\n\nWe prohibit the use of bp funds or resources to support any political candidate or party. We recognize the rights of our employees to participate in the political process and these rights are governed by the applicable laws in the countries where we operate. Our stance on political activity is set out in the bp code of conduct.\n\nIn the US we provide administrative support for the bp employee political action committee (PAC) - a non-partisan, employee-led committee that encourages voluntary employee participation in the political process. All bp employee PAC contributions are weighed against the PAC's criteria for candidate support and reviewed for compliance with federal and state law before funds are passed to the recipients requested by our employees, and are publicly reported in accordance with US election laws. Donations to political candidates made by the PAC are from employee contributions and not bp funds.\n\n## Tax transparency\n\nOur code of conduct informs the responsible approach we take to managing taxes. We have adopted the B Team responsible tax principles and we engage in open and constructive dialogue with governments and tax authorities.\n\nWe comply with the tax legislation of the countries in which we operate and we do not tolerate the facilitation of tax evasion by people who act for or on behalf of bp.\n\nWe are committed to transparency around our tax principles and the taxes we pay. We paid $11.9 billion in corporate income and production taxes to governments in 2023 (2022 $12.5 billion).\n\n<!-- image -->",

They do this by using a standard framework for collating risk data, assessing risk management activities, making further improvements and in connection with planning new activities.\n\n## Oversight and governance\n\nThroughout 2023, management, the leadership team, the board and relevant committees provided oversight of how principal risks to bp were identified, assessed and managed. They supported appropriate governance of risk management including having relevant policies in place to help manage risks.\n\nSuch oversight may include internal audit reports, group risk reports and reviews of the outcomes of business processes including strategy, planning and resource and capital allocation. bp's group risk team analyses the group's risk profile and maintains the group's risk management system. bp's internal audit team provides independent assurance to the chief executive and board as to whether the group's system of internal control is adequately designed and operating effectively to respond appropriately to the risks that are significant to bp.\n\n## Risk management processes\n\nWe aim for a consistent basis of measuring risk to:\n\n- \u00b7 Establish a common understanding of risks on a like-for-like basis, taking into account potential impact and likelihood.\n- \u00b7 Report risks and their management to the appropriate levels of the organization.\n- \u00b7 Inform prioritization of specific risk management activities and resource allocation.\n\nbp's risk management policy sets out requirements for the group to follow. These requirements support the consideration of three risk types:\n\n- \u00b7 Strategic and commercial.\n- \u00b7 Safety and operational.\n- \u00b7 Compliance and control.\n\nRisk identification - businesses, integrators and enablers identify risks across the risk types. Risks are identified on an ongoing basis - this can be done using a range of approaches including workshops, subjectmatter expertise, hazard identification processes and engineering requirements.\n\nRisk assessment - identified risks are assessed for potential impact and likelihood across a number of criteria, including health and safety, environmental, financial and non-financial (includes reputation and regulatory impact levels).\n\nThis aims to provide a consistent basis for the evaluation of potential impact and likelihood, facilitating a comparison across different risks.\n\nRisk management and monitoring - risk management activities are prioritized where improvements are needed based on a number of factors, including the risk assessment, strength of existing risk management measures, strategy and plans and legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nRisk management measures, including mitigations, are identified for each risk and monitored to the extent considered appropriate. To support leadership oversight of decisions relating to risk management, the appropriate organizational level (EVP, SVP, VP) are notified of risks and asked to endorse risk management measures, depending on the assessed potential impact and likelihood.\n\nAs part of bp's annual planning process, the leadership team and the board review the group's principal risks and uncertainties. These may be updated during the year in response to changes in internal and external circumstances.\n\nThere can be no certainty that our risk management activities will mitigate or prevent these, or other risks, from occurring. Further details of the principal risks and uncertainties faced are set out in Risk factors on page 77 .\n\n## Our risk profile\n\nThe nature of our business operations is long term, resulting in many of our risks being enduring in nature. However, risks can develop and evolve over time and their potential impact or likelihood may vary in response to internal and external events. These may include emerging risks which are considered through existing processes, including emerging risk communications to the board, bp's risk management system, the bp Energy Outlook , bp's technology-related news and insights publications, and ongoing emerging technology scanning and group strategic reviews.\n\nWe describe above how risks are managed. The following section provides examples of the particular risk management activities for each of bp's principal risks.\n\n## Strategic and commercial risks\n\n## Prices and markets\n\nOur financial performance is impacted by fluctuating prices of oil, gas and refined products, technological change, exchange rate fluctuations, and the general macroeconomic outlook.\n\nOur strategy is designed to accommodate a range of scenarios and be resilient to the volatility in the energy markets. This is supported through a diversified portfolio, a strong balance sheet and operating within a resilient and disciplined financial frame. We test our investment and project development costs against a range of pricing and exchange assumptions.\n\n## Accessing and progressing hydrocarbon resources and low carbon opportunities\n\nInability to access and progress hydrocarbon resources and low carbon opportunities could adversely affect delivery of our strategy.\n\nFor hydrocarbon resources our subsurface team is accountable for the delivery of highvalue, carbon-efficient resources to deliver predictable and reliable investments today, as well as the long-term renewal of our hydrocarbon resources. Additionally, the subsurface team partners with innovation & engineering to prioritize technology development needs for the future. Our gas & low carbon energy business is accountable for the delivery of many of our low carbon opportunities through both organic and inorganic growth. This includes the development of our offshore wind, solar, onshore wind, hydrogen and carbon capture, use and storage businesses.",

The organization contains capability which includes the centre of expertise for appraisal and optimization, expertise to manage the design and build of projects and programmes, and collaboration with our businesses and enablers to ensure project objectives are met. The projects team delivers using its major projects common process which is systematically reviewed and continuously improved.\n\n## Geopolitical\n\nThe diverse locations of our business activities and operations around the world expose us to a wide range of political developments and consequent changes to the economic and operating environment. Geopolitical risk is inherent to many regions in which we operate, and heightened political or social tensions or changes in key relationships could adversely affect the group.\n\nWe seek to manage this risk at multiple levels, through:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifying macro-level geopolitical trends in the geopolitical advisory council.\n- \u00b7 Providing a clear focal point for political risk management in our regions, corporates & solutions business.\n- \u00b7 Monitoring how geopolitical trends create risk at the country level through changes to our baseline threat assessments.\n\nMore broadly, we manage the risk on a day-to-day basis through development and maintenance of relationships with governments and stakeholders, and by being trusted partners in each country and region. In addition, we closely monitor events and implement risk mitigation plans where deemed appropriate.\n\n## Financial liquidity\n\nExternal market conditions can impact our financial performance. Supply and demand and the prices achieved for our products can be affected by a wide range of factors including political developments, interest rates, consumer preferences for low carbon energy, global economic conditions, access to capital markets and the influence of OPEC+.\n\nWe seek to manage this risk through bp's diversified portfolio, our financial framework, liquidity stress testing, maintaining a significant cash buffer, regular reviews of market conditions and our planning and investment processes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnergy markets, page 8 Liquidity and capital resources, page 340 Liquidity, financial capacity and financial, including credit, exposure, page 77\n\n## Joint arrangements and contractors\n\nVarying levels of control over the standards, operations and compliance of our partners including non-operated joint ventures (NOJVs), contractors and sub-contractors could result in legal liability and reputational damage.\n\nbp's exposure in NOJVs is primarily managed by the NOJV-facing business team in the business or entity where ownership of bp's interest in the NOJV sits.\n\nSupport, verification and assurance is provided by the NOJV solutions team, safety and operational risk assurance, ethics & compliance functional assurance and group internal audit to drive a focused, deliberate and systematic approach to the set-up and management of bp's interests and exposure in NOJVs.\n\nOur relationships with contractors are managed through the bp procurement processes with appropriate requirements incorporated into contractual arrangements.\n\n## Cyber security\n\nBoth targeted and indiscriminate threats to the security of our digital infrastructure and those of third parties continue to evolve rapidly and are increasingly prevalent across industries worldwide.\n\nWe seek to manage this risk through a range of measures, which include cyber security standards, security protection tools, ongoing detection and monitoring of threats and testing of cyber response and recovery procedures. We collaborate with governments, law enforcement agencies and industry peers to understand and respond to new and emerging cyber threats.\n\nWe build awareness with our employees, share information on incidents with leadership for continuous learning and conduct regular exercises, including with the leadership team, to test response and recovery procedures. For further detail on cyber security disclosures see page 360 .\n\n## Climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy\n\nDevelopments in policy, law, regulation, technology and markets, including societal and investor sentiment, related to the issue of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy could increase costs, reduce revenues, constrain our operations and affect our business plans and financial performance.\n\nRisks associated with climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy impact many elements of our strategy and, as such, these risks are managed through key business processes including setting the bp strategy and annual plan, capital allocation and investment decisions. The outputs of these key business processes are reviewed in line with the cadence of these activities. See page 59 for more information on how transition risks are managed.\n\n## Competition\n\nInability to remain efficient, maintain a highquality portfolio of assets and innovate could negatively impact delivery of our strategy in a highly competitive market.\n\nWe seek to manage this risk through our strategy, sustainability and ventures team by providing external insights on the economic, energy, market and competitive environment. Our strategy, sustainability and portfolio management teams use these insights to help define a resilient strategy for bp, including decisions related to portfolio, business development and resource allocation. The ventures team provides commercial innovation capacity that allows us to build new businesses.\n\n## Talent and capability\n\nInability to attract, develop and retain people with necessary skills and capabilities could negatively impact delivery of our strategy.\n\nOur people and culture team oversees all hiring activity for bp globally, both professional hiring and early careers. They help to ensure that the right talent and people capability is in place, using local market analysis, people analytics and insights to underpin our strategic workforce planning. Talent leadership focuses on translating bp's diversity, equity and inclusion ambitions and global framework for action into a robust and diverse talent pipeline. See page 71 for more information.",

We use internationally recognized incident command structures and for significant events business support teams and executive support teams are established to provide oversight and management. In addition, we provide a trained cadre of crisis professionals and niche expertise for deployment across the company through our mutual response team.\n\n## Insurance\n\nOur insurance strategy could expose the group to material uninsured losses.\n\nOur insurance team is accountable for aligning our insurance approach with bp's strategy and engaging with the businesses, integrators and enablers to determine the appropriate level of insurance. We retain in-house expertise and partner with insurance industry leaders. Our captive insurance companies are regulated within the jurisdictions in which they operate.\n\n## Safety and operational risks\n\n## Process safety, personal safety and environmental risks\n\nExposure to a wide range of health, safety and environmental risks could cause harm to people, the environment and our assets and result in regulatory action, legal liability, business interruption, increased costs, damage to our reputation and potentially denial of our licence to operate.\n\nOur Operating Management System (OMS) helps us manage these risks and drive performance improvements. It sets out the standards and requirements which govern key risk management activities such as inspection, maintenance, testing, business continuity and crisis response planning and competency development. In addition, we conduct our drilling activity through a wells organization in order to promote a consistent approach for designing, constructing and managing wells.\n\n## Drilling and production\n\nChallenging operational environments and other uncertainties could impact drilling and production activities.\n\nOur production and operations business group brings together all our hydrocarbon operations and our distinctive capabilities in one place to safely deliver competitive returns. The enablers, in particular wells and production, are accountable for safety, risk, quality and operational delivery. They execute capital and operational activity and manage associated expenditure.\n\n## Security\n\nHostile acts such as terrorism, activism, insider acts or piracy could harm our people and disrupt our operations. We monitor for emerging threats and vulnerabilities to manage our physical and information security.\n\nOur intelligence, security and crisis management teams provide strategic and operational risk management to our businesses through a network of regional security managers who provide front-line risk management as well as conduct assurance activities through a team independent of the business.\n\nWe continue to monitor threats globally and maintain disaster recovery, crisis and business continuity management plans.\n\n## Product quality\n\nSupplying customers with off-specification products could damage our reputation, lead to regulatory action and legal liability, and impact our financial performance.\n\nbp's product quality policy is aligned with our OMS and sets requirements for our business to meet specifications and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Compliance and control risks\n\n## Ethical misconduct and legal or regulatory non-compliance\n\nEthical misconduct or breaches of applicable laws or regulations could damage our reputation, result in litigation, regulatory action and penalties, adversely affect results and shareholder value, and potentially affect our licence to operate.\n\nOur code of conduct, the foundation of who we are, is applicable to all employees and central to managing this risk. Additionally, we have various group requirements and training covering areas such as anti-bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering, competition/ anti-trust law, data privacy and international trade regulations. We offer an independent confidential helpline, OpenTalk, for employees, contractors and other third parties with the option to raise concerns anonymously.\n\n## Regulation\n\nChanges in the law and regulation could increase costs, constrain our operations and affect our strategy, business plans and financial performance.\n\nOur businesses, integrators and enablers all seek to identify, assess and manage legal and regulatory risks relevant to bp's operations, strategy, business plans and financial performance. To support this work, we seek to develop co-operative relationships with governmental authorities in line with our code of conduct, to allow appropriate focus on areas of potential risk or uncertainty, while also protecting bp's interests within the law.\n\n## Trading non-compliance\n\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to risks around our trading activities which could arise from shortcomings or failures in our systems, risk management methodology, internal control processes or employee conduct.\n\nWe have specific operating standards and control processes to manage these risks, including guidelines specific to trading, and seek to monitor compliance through our dedicated compliance teams. We also seek to maintain a positive and collaborative relationship with regulators and the industry at large.\n\n## Reporting\n\nFailure to accurately report our data could lead to regulatory action, legal liability and reputational damage.\n\nOur accounting reporting and control team provides assurance of the control environment and is accountable for building control and compliance into finance processes and digital systems.",

If these reductions are significant or for a prolonged period, we may have to write down assets and reassess the viability of certain projects, which may impact future cash flows, profit, capital expenditure , the ability to work within our financial frame and maintain our long-term investment programme. Conversely, an increase in oil, gas and product prices may not improve margin performance as there could be increased fiscal take, cost inflation and more onerous terms for access to resources. The profitability of our refining activities can be volatile, with periodic oversupply or supply tightness in regional markets and fluctuations in demand.\n\nExchange rate fluctuations can create currency exposures and impact underlying costs and revenues. Crude oil prices are generally set in US dollars, while products vary in currency. Many of our major project development costs are denominated in local currencies, which may be subject to fluctuations against the US dollar.\n\nAccessing and progressing hydrocarbon resources and low carbon opportunities: inability to access and progress hydrocarbon resources and low carbon opportunities could adversely affect delivery of our strategy.\n\nDelivery of our strategy depends partly on our ability to progress hydrocarbon resources from our existing portfolio and access new resources in our existing core regions. Our ability to progress upstream resources and develop technologies at a level in line with our strategic outlook for hydrocarbon production could impact our future production and financial performance. Furthermore, our ability to access low carbon opportunities and the commercial terms associated with those opportunities could impact our financial performance and the pace of our transition to an integrated energy company in line with our strategy.\n\nMajor project delivery: failure to invest in the best opportunities or deliver major projects successfully could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nWe face challenges in developing major projects, particularly in geographically and technically challenging areas. Poor investment choice, efficiency or delivery, inflation, supply chain, or operational challenges at any major project that underpins production or production growth, could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nGeopolitical: exposure to a range of political developments and consequent changes to the operating and regulatory environment could cause business disruption.\n\nWe operate and may seek new opportunities in countries, regions and cities where political, economic and social transition may take place.\n\nPolitical instability, changes to the regulatory environment or taxation, international trade disputes and barriers to free trade, international sanctions, expropriation or nationalization of property, civil strife, strikes, insurrections, acts of terrorism, acts of war and public health situations (including the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic) may disrupt or curtail our operations, business activities or investments.\n\nThese may in turn cause production to decline, limit our ability to pursue new opportunities, affect the recoverability of our assets and our related earnings and cash flow or cause us to incur additional costs, particularly due to the long-term nature of many of our projects and significant capital expenditure required.\n\nTrade restrictions, international sanctions or any other actions taken by governmental authorities or other relevant persons have had and could continue to have an impact on global energy supply and demand, market volatility and the prices of oil, gas and products.\n\nLiquidity, financial capacity and financial, including credit, exposure: failure to work within our financial framework could impact our ability to operate and result in financial loss.\n\nFailure to accurately forecast or work within our financial framework could impact our ability to operate and result in financial loss. Trade and other receivables, including overdue receivables, may not be recovered, divestments may not be successfully completed and a substantial and unexpected cash call or funding request could disrupt our financial framework or overwhelm our ability to meet our obligations.\n\nAn event such as a significant operational incident, legal proceedings or a geopolitical event in an area where we have significant activities, could reduce our financial liquidity and our credit ratings. Credit rating downgrades could potentially increase financing costs and limit access to financing or engagement in our trading activities on acceptable terms, which could put pressure on the group's liquidity.\n\nThey could also potentially require the company to review the funding arrangements with the bp pension trustees. In the event of extended constraints on our ability to obtain financing, we could be required to reduce capital expenditure or increase asset disposals in order to provide additional liquidity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLiquidity and capital resources, page 340 Financial statements Note 29\n\nJoint arrangements and contractors: varying levels of control over the standards, operations and compliance of our partners, including non-operated joint ventures (NOJV's), contractors and sub-contractors could result in legal liability and reputational damage.",

If these are found to be lacking, there may be financial, reputational, operational or safety exposures for bp. Should an incident occur in an activity that bp participates in, our partners and contractors may be unable or unwilling to fully compensate us against costs we may incur on their behalf or on behalf of the arrangement. Where we do not have operational control of a joint arrangement or direct oversight of contractor activity, we may still be pursued by regulators or claimants, and may still be the focus for interest groups or media attention in the event of an incident.\n\nDigital infrastructure, cyber security and data protection: breach or failure of our or third parties' digital infrastructure or cyber security, including loss or misuse of sensitive information could damage our operations, increase costs and damage our reputation.\n\nThe energy industry is subject to fast-evolving risks, including ransomware, from cyber threat actors, including nation states, criminals, terrorists, hacktivists and insiders. Current geopolitical factors have increased these risks. There is also growing regulation around data protection and data privacy, critical national infrastructure and the evolving opportunities and threats from artificial intelligence. A breach or failure of our or third parties' digital infrastructure - including control systems - due to breaches of our cyber defences, or those of third parties, negligence, intentional misconduct or other reasons, could seriously disrupt our operations. This could result in the loss or misuse of data or sensitive information, including employees' and customers' personal data, injury to people, disruption to our business, harm to the environment or our assets, legal or regulatory breaches, legal liability and significant costs including fines, cost of remediation or reputational consequences. Furthermore, the rapid detection of attempts to gain unauthorized access to our digital infrastructure, often through the use of sophisticated and co-ordinated means, is a challenge and any delay or failure to detect could compound these potential harms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCyber security disclosures, page 360\n\nClimate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy: developments in policy, law, regulation, technology and markets, including\n\nsocietal and investor sentiment, related to the issue of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy could increase costs, reduce revenues, constrain our operations and affect our business plans and financial performance.\n\nLaws, regulations, policies, obligations, government actions, social attitudes and customer preferences relating to climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy, including the pace of change to any of these factors, and also the pace of the transition itself, could have adverse impacts on our business including on our access to and realization of competitive opportunities in any of our strategic pillars, a decline in demand for, or constraints on our ability to sell certain products, constraints on production and supply, adverse litigation and regulatory or litigation outcomes, increased costs from compliance and increased provisions for environmental and legal liabilities.\n\nInvestor preferences and sentiment are influenced by environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations including climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy. Changes in those preferences and sentiment could affect our access to capital markets and our attractiveness to potential investors, potentially resulting in reduced access to financing, increased financing costs and impacts upon our business plans and financial performance.\n\nTechnological improvements or innovations that support the transition to a lower carbon economy, and customer preferences or regulatory incentives that alter fuel or power choices, could impact demand for oil and gas.\n\nDepending on the nature and speed of any such changes and our response, these changes could increase costs, reduce our profitability, reduce demand for certain products, limit our access to new opportunities, require us to write down certain assets or curtail or cease certain operations, and affect investor sentiment, our access to capital markets, our competitiveness and financial performance.\n\nPolicy, legal, regulatory, technological and market developments related to climate change could also affect future price assumptions used in the assessment of recoverability of asset carrying values including goodwill, the judgement as to whether there is continued intent to develop exploration and appraisal intangible assets, the timing of decommissioning of assets and the useful economic lives of assets used for the calculation of depreciation and amortization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate-related financial disclosures, page 55 and Financial statements\n\n- -Note 1 and Note 33\n\nCompetition: inability to remain efficient, maintain a high-quality portfolio of assets and innovate could negatively impact delivery of our strategy in a highly competitive market.\n\nOur strategic progress and performance could be impeded if we are unable to control our development and operating costs and margins, if we fail to scale our businesses at pace, or to sustain, develop and operate a high-quality portfolio of assets efficiently. Furthermore, as we transition from an international oil company to an integrated energy company, we face an expanded and rapidly evolving range of competitors in the sectors in which we operate.\n\nWe could be adversely affected if competitors offer superior terms for access rights or licences, or if our innovation in areas such as new low carbon technologies, digital, customer offer, exploration, production, refining, manufacturing or renewable energy lags behind those of our competitors. Our performance could also be negatively impacted if we fail to protect our intellectual property.\n\nTalent and capability: inability to attract, develop and retain people with necessary skills and capabilities could negatively impact delivery of our strategy.\n\nThe sectors in which we operate face increasing challenges to attract and retain diverse, skilled and capable talent. An inability to successfully recruit, develop and retain core skills and capabilities and to reskill existing talent could negatively impact delivery of our strategy.\n\nCrisis management and business continuity: failure to address an incident effectively could potentially disrupt our business.\n\nOur reputation and business activities could be negatively impacted if we do not respond, or are perceived not to respond, in an appropriate manner to any major crisis.\n\nInsurance: our insurance strategy could expose the group to material uninsured losses.\n\nbp insures in situations where this is legally and contractually required.

The physical characteristics of an oil or natural gas field, and cost of drilling, completing or operating wells are often uncertain. We may be required to curtail, delay or cancel drilling operations or stop production because of a variety of factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in geological formations, equipment failures or accidents, adverse weather conditions and compliance with governmental requirements.\n\nSecurity: hostile acts against our employees and activities could cause harm to people and disrupt our operations.\n\nActs of terrorism, piracy, sabotage, activism and similar activities directed against our operations and facilities, pipelines, transportation or digital infrastructure could cause harm to people and severely disrupt operations.

In relation to trade restrictions or other sanctions, current geopolitical factors have increased these risks.\n\nRegulation: changes in the law and regulation could increase costs, constrain our operations and affect our strategy, business plans and financial performance.\n\nOur businesses and operations are subject to the laws and regulations applicable in each country, state or other regional or local area in which they occur. These laws and regulations result in an often complex, uncertain and changing legal and regulatory environment for our global businesses and operations. Changes in laws or regulations, including how they are interpreted and enforced, can and do impact all aspects of our business.\n\nRoyalties and taxes, particularly those applied to our hydrocarbon activities, tend to be high compared with those imposed on similar commercial activities. In certain jurisdictions there is also a degree of uncertainty relating to tax law interpretation and changes.\n\nGovernments may change their fiscal and regulatory frameworks in response to public pressure on finances or for other policy reasons, resulting in increased amounts payable to them or their agencies.\n\nChanges in law or regulation could increase the compliance and litigation risk and costs, reduce our profitability, reduce demand for or constrain our ability to sell certain products, limit our access to new opportunities, require us to divest or write down certain assets or curtail or cease certain operations, or affect the adequacy of our provisions for pensions, tax, decommissioning, environmental and legal liabilities. Changes in laws or regulations could result in the nationalization, expropriation, cancellation, non-renewal or renegotiation of our interests, assets and related rights.

        "page_content": "## Introduction from the chair\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThroughout the year, the board has extensively engaged with stakeholders - and with shareholders, in particular.\n\n## Dear fellow shareholders,\n\nEach year seems to bring more challenges for company boards - a more demanding operating environment in the context of geopolitical shifts, technology advancements and of course, the ongoing complexity of the energy transition. Our corporate governance framework was established in 2020, recognising the need for it to be both dynamic and flexible in its application to a range of different situations. Looking back on 2023, it's safe to say that it has served us well.\n\nThe framework provides a clear mandate and defines responsibilities for the board's main committees. It has enabled the board to apply its time to the most important areas requiring its focus and expertise.\n\nIn 2023 these included responding to an ever-changing macro environment and the appointment of a new chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO). Underpinned by this framework, throughout the year, the board has extensively engaged with stakeholders - and with shareholders, in particular. This engagement has been particularly valuable and has informed the board's discussions and decision making.\n\n## Executive director succession\n\nbp's succession plans are routinely reviewed by the board's people and governance committee and we were able to activate those plans swiftly last year.\n\nThe board appointed an interim CEO within hours of the former CEO's resignation in September, implementing an emergency succession process for this most important executive role. Our governance framework provided a similarly clear structure for us to progress through to the permanent appointments of Murray Auchincloss (previously CFO) as CEO and, in turn, Kate Thomson as CFO. This was all achieved within five months of the former CEO's departure. Although conducted at pace, the selection process was robust, competitive and resulted in full agreement among the board on the best candidates for these roles. See page 95 for more details.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMurray cares deeply about bp and its people. He brings in-depth understanding of the opportunities and challenges in the energy transition and he has demonstrated leadership that is focused on teamwork, performance and delivery. Kate's appointment recognizes her detailed understanding of bp and the energy and finance sectors, combined with deep technical expertise.\n\nThroughout this period of change, the board has maintained a constructive and productive relationship with the leadership team.\n\n## Focus on culture\n\nAs a board, we are conscious of our responsibility to assess and monitor bp's culture and to seek assurance from the leadership team that corrective action is being taken where practices or behaviours are not aligned with the company's 'Who we are' culture frame. With this in mind, a dedicated committee of the board was established in 2023 on an interim basis with a focus on psychological safety and speaking up. The committee's work was supported by data-led analysis and workforce engagement sessions.\n\nThe committee has served us well and its activities have provided a fresh foundation for the people and governance committee to now assume its responsibilities supporting the board in its assessment and monitoring of culture.\n\n## Purposeful engagement\n\nAmong the most rewarding experiences in 2023 was to see first-hand some of the work bp is doing around the world, particularly meeting the people delivering our strategy on the ground.\n\nOur safety and sustainability committee travelled to Indonesia and visited bp's liquefied natural gas facility at Tangguh, seeing for themselves the positive effect of our operations on the local community. Members of the board also went to the US, visiting operations in the Permian Basin and the Thunder Horse platform in the Gulf of Mexico, and in the UK they met our internal audit and finance teams in Sunbury and the trading and shipping teams in London.\n\nI also enjoyed meetings with people across bp, learning more about the business and the challenges being faced - and these views have been reflected in our board conversations.\n\nThis experience was complemented by our bespoke workforce engagement programme which allows my board colleagues to participate in small groups focusing on set themes. Having the themes aligned with the board's agenda for the year gave us a good insight into the views and concerns of a broad range of the bp workforce and further informed our discussions and the decisions we have taken.\n\n## Board evolution\n\nPaula Rosput Reynolds and Sir John Sawers will both shortly reach the end of their nine years' tenure on our board and will step down at the end of our annual general meeting in April 2024. I thank them for their valued service to bp.\n\nI am pleased that Amanda Blanc will take on the role of senior independent director and, for an interim period, Tushar Morzaria will become chair of the remuneration committee. Having undertaken a thorough assessment of time commitment (see page 133 ) the board is satisfied that they each have sufficient capacity to dedicate the time necessary for these roles.\n\nThe board continues to evolve, and I am pleased to say that with over 50% female and over 20% ethnic minority representation we exceed both the targets set out in the new UK Listing Rules and the 2027 Parker Review targets relating to ethnic diversity on UK boards. There is, of course, always more to do and I thank my board colleagues for their dedicated service in 2023 and their ongoing commitment to your company.\n\n## Closing thanks\n\nI would like to close by thanking the bp teams who have continued to operate bp safely and effectively and its leadership for their focus. And finally, I would like to thank you, fellow shareholders, for your continued confidence in bp.\n\n## Helge Lund\n\nChair\n\n8 March 2024",

Further to the board's decision in February 2023 to invest up to $8 billion more into our transition growth engines by 2030, three significant investment decisions were made by the board in 2023:\n\n## Convenience and mobility\n\nIn February 2023 bp agreed to purchase TravelCenters of America for $1.3 billion, adding around 290 sites to our retail network, strategically located on major highways across the US complementing bp's US convenience and mobility offering and combining conventional fuel sales with a significant convenience offer and the potential to integrate EV charging, biofuels, renewable natural gas and in time hydrogen mobility.\n\n## Wind\n\nIn July 2023 bp was awarded the rights to develop two offshore wind projects in Germany, marking bp's entry into offshore wind in continental Europe. The power from the wind farms is expected to be used to support bp's green hydrogen and biofuels production , electric mobility growth and refinery decarbonization, as well as wider industry decarbonization in Germany. bp expects to connect them to the grid by the end of 2030.\n\n## Solar\n\nIn November 2023 bp announced that it had agreed to acquire the non-bp-owned share of Lightsource bp, one of the leading global utility-scale solar and battery storage developers, providing low-cost green electrons at scale in service of bp's hydrogen, biofuels, EV charging and power trading. Subject to regulatory approvals, the deal is expected to close in the second half of 2024.\n\n## Stakeholders considered\n\nCustomers\n\nGovernments and regulators\n\nInvestors and shareholders\n\nPartners and suppliers\n\nWorkforce\n\nSociety\n\nIn considering the decisions outlined above, the board assessed a range of risks and opportunities across multiple stakeholder groups. Responding to what governments and customers ask of bp, the board advanced towards our net zero ambition by investment in our transition growth engines and also our resilient hydrocarbons.\n\nPartners and suppliers will benefit from the three transactions outlined above as they provide greater certainty of dealing with bp as a counterparty, whilst also helping to de-risk and underpin delivery of bp's related 2025 targets, for the benefit of the workforce and customers.\n\n## Appointment of new chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO)\n\nThe robustness of our governance framework and emergency succession plans enabled the board to take swift action following the resignation of bp's former CEO in September 2023.\n\n## Agility\n\nThe board met immediately after the former CEO confirmed his resignation from the board. The activation of our emergency succession plans allowed for the board to promptly appoint Murray Auchincloss as interim CEO, providing reassurance to our investors and our own people.\n\n## Leadership pipeline\n\nEvidencing the strength and depth of our senior-level leadership, and the rigour of the talent review process which underpins our succession planning, Kate Thomson was appointed as bp interim CFO within a week of the former CEO's resignation. In this interim role, Kate demonstrated strong finance leadership and deep knowledge of the sector in her delivery, confirming for the board her suitability for the role of permanent CFO.\n\n## Dedicated committee\n\nA new committee of the board was established on an interim basis to lead the process for the selection of our new CEO, comprising the chair and three non-executive directors. The committee recommended candidates which the full board considered for appointment. Read more on page 97 .\n\n## Role expectations\n\nThe committee agreed the primary accountabilities and leadership qualities for the new CEO to deliver against, providing a clear foundation on which to build the search.\n\n## Rigorous process\n\nA thorough and highly competitive search exercise supported by international search advisors included detailed consideration of a wide and diverse range of candidates, both internal and external to bp.\n\n## Stakeholders considered\n\nCustomers\n\nInvestors and shareholders\n\nPartners and suppliers\n\nWorkforce\n\nMeetings were arranged with investors, the workforce and key partners over several days immediately following the former CEO's resignation to enable transparent dialogue. This valuable engagement helped inform the board during the permanent CEO and CFO succession process.\n\nAs part of its decision making, the board took account of stakeholder views and impact in appointing new executive directors. The board unanimously agreed that Murray Auchincloss was the right leader to help drive bp's strategy and create value and that Kate Thomson would further strengthen the board as CFO.",

        "page_content": "## Our stakeholders\n\nThroughout 2023 directors engaged with a broad range of stakeholders collectively and individually, through different activities and channels, across a wide geographical reach.\n\n## Investors and shareholders\n\nDebt and equity investors are key stakeholders through their provision of finance and stewardship. Regular and constructive dialogue is important to hear their views, communicate bp's strategy and to build and maintain confidence in our ability to deliver it.\n\nDirectors engaged with investors via roadshows, quarterly results calls, presentations and the Annual General Meeting (AGM). Individual and group investor engagement meetings were held with the chair of the board and chair of the remuneration committee, who shared feedback with the wider board. Other committee chairs were available to investors as needed throughout the year. Feedback and insights from a meeting with retail holders via the UK Shareholder Association and ShareSoc were incorporated into a briefing for directors. Directors also discussed with management the implications of investor studies and surveys.\n\n## Customers\n\nCustomer interests are at the forefront of bp's strategy, whether end-use consumers, B2B customers or distributors. Focusing on customers provides the driving force for new business models and service platforms.\n\nDirectors visited retail sites including an EV charging location at one of our Aral sites in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, to gain insights into the customer experience. Other director visits included a safety review at one of our Hammersmith retail sites in London, supporting bp's commitment to put safety first.\n\n## Workforce\n\nThe board recognizes the value gained from engaging with bp's workforce. Regular engagement with members of the workforce helps bp attract, develop and retain talent.\n\nThe workforce engagement programme (WFEP) is the board's formal engagement mechanism, which is considered effective in complying with Provision 5 of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). Its effectiveness is reviewed annually by the people and governance committee (see pages 94-95 ).\n\nBeyond the WFEP, directors undertook site visits, town hall events and webcasts and a programme of meetings with high-potential employees. Engagements included a visit to the Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany and Castell\u00f3n refinery in Spain. 'Pulse annual' employee survey results and summary 'Open Talk' reports (bp's whistleblowing service, meeting Provision 6 of the Code) were also reviewed by the board.\n\nAdditional engagement centred on culture was undertaken by directors in 2023 via a specific committee, adding to bp's activities meeting Provision 2 of the Code (see page 97 ).\n\n## Governments and regulators\n\nEngagement with governments and regulators is important in upholding the legal and reputational standing of bp and enables the business to better contribute and respond to emerging standards.\n\nIn addition to reviewing regulatory updates in 2023, including proposed UK audit and corporate governance reforms, directors attended global political and economic events\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsuch as the Business 20 (B20) Summit and the World Economic Forum. Throughout 2023 board members met with government officials from Norway, Kuwait, Germany, Egypt and Spain amongst other nations. This included an event with over 250 officials, diplomats and regulatory agencies at bp's Washington DC office in the US.\n\n## Partners and suppliers\n\nStrong relationships with partners and suppliers are important to support business opportunities. Engagement with them helps bp meet our customers' needs today and in the future.\n\nThe chief executive officer and chief financial officer have regular meetings with key suppliers. Directors have attended partner-hosted events in 2023, such as the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition & Conference (ADIPEC), with a focus on bp's strategic priorities in both resilient hydrocarbons and low carbon energy.\n\n## Society\n\nThrough our business operations, we seek to benefit the people, businesses and environment in the communities we operate in, which span 61 countries. We also rely on wider society as potential customers, partners and employees.\n\nAs well as the consideration of geopolitical events, board members engaged with communities local to bp operations, for example when visiting Tangguh, Indonesia. Directors also received updates on research activities to understand society's energy needs, ranging from industrial fluids for robotics and wind at Castrol's headquarters, to a visit to the Global Applied Science Centre in Bochum, Germany.\n\n## Spotlight on safety and sustainability\n\nDirectors gained valuable insights from engagements with a wide range of stakeholders during the safety and sustainability committee's visit to our major liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility in Tangguh, West Papua, Indonesia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSafety and sustainability committee report, page 104",

The committee's major areas of focus in 2023 were succession planning, executive and non-executive, as well as overseeing management's embedding of our 'Who we are' culture frame, which encompasses bp's values and behaviours.\n\nExecutive succession plans were reviewed during the year, covering not only succession options and development plans for the bp leadership team, but also emerging talent throughout the organization. Given the importance the board attaches to ensuring a strong pipeline of future leaders, the committee oversaw the launch of a new leadership development programme. This programme provides structured development opportunities for all employees, but focuses in particular on those with high executive potential, while also helping to advance our diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) ambitions.\n\nThe committee reviewed bp's people-related priorities for 2023, which included the roll-out of the company's 'Who we are' culture frame, and further enhancing workforce engagement to better inform board-level debate and decisions. Read more on page 95 .\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, the committee's focus will remain on executive succession, the gradual refreshing of the board as non-executives reach the end of their tenure, and initiatives to develop and enhance bp's culture.\n\nThe committee's review of the effectiveness and further embedding of the 'Who we are' culture frame will provide valuable qualitative data about the company's culture and areas where further focus is required.\n\n## Role of the committee\n\nThe committee seeks to ensure that the composition and structure of the board remains effective and also monitors the balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity required. The process for the nomination, induction and orderly succession of candidates for the board, the leadership team and the company secretary role are led by the committee, as is the annual review of the board's performance.\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\nThe committee's full terms of reference can be viewed at bp.com/governance .\n\n## Helge Lund\n\nCommittee chair 8 March 2024\n\n## Meetings and attendance\n\nThe committee met five times in 2023.

During the year, directors met with colleagues from our offshore wind team, the gas & low carbon energy business group, the US retail operating organization, Archaea Energy, bp pulse and our hydrogen businesses in the UK, Australia and Germany.\n\nParticipants shared insights on customers, competitors and the energy transition, and views on bp's strategy, technology, market challenges, ways of working and culture. An anonymized summary of each session was reviewed by the committee, and key themes shared with the board.\n\nIn 2023 the committee also reviewed the workforce engagement mechanism and deemed the WFEP appropriate for the activities and structure of bp.",

The robustness and effectiveness of the committee's emergency succession plans were evidenced by the swift appointments of Murray Auchincloss as interim CEO and Kate Thomson as interim chief financial officer (CFO) following the resignation of the former CEO in September 2023. Read more on Murray's appointment as CEO on page 97 .\n- \u00b7 Leadership team succession planning is underpinned by a comprehensive talent review process. In being recognized as a succession candidate for the role of CFO, Kate Thomson underwent a rigorous evaluation, including an external third-party assessment, to identify the skills and qualities she could bring to an executive role. Following her appointment as interim CFO in September 2023, Kate demonstrated strong finance leadership confirming her suitability for the role of CFO and executive director of the board.\n\n## Key\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the launch of new bp-wide leadership development initiatives, including a new programme with INSEAD aimed at supporting the progression of leaders with high-potential.

Read more on page 94 .\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the results of the company's employee 'Pulse annual' employee survey and monitored progress against a defined set of 'Who we are' measures. These measures, underpinned by insights from the 'Pulse annual' employee survey, provided the committee with measurable insight into the adoption of bp's 'Who we are' culture frame and assisted the committee in understanding the sentiment of bp's workforce.\n\n## Board performance\n\n## Looking back on 2022\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewed progress on previously agreed actions, including to improve the board's effectiveness and efficiency by reviewing pre-read templates to support prioritization of the board's focus areas and a refresh of forward calendar planning to optimise board members' time commitment.\n- \u00b7 The actions identified by the board in concluding the prior year's performance were reviewed during 2023. Good progress has been made against these actions as evidenced by 2023's board review.\n- \u00b7 In light of the three-year evaluation cycle, the committee decided that the 2023 evaluation be facilitated internally, with the next external review anticipated in 2024.\n\n## 2023 board performance review\n\n- \u00b7 The chair and company secretary led the internal evaluation of the board and its committees. This was supported by the use of a digital platform to better capture and\n\n- organize feedback and to define and track identified actions. The chair and company secretary also held one-to-one meetings with each non-executive director which covered their individual performance.\n- \u00b7 A review of Murray's performance as interim CEO was led by the chair, with input from the senior independent director.\n- \u00b7 The chair's performance review was led by the senior independent director.\n- \u00b7 Feedback was consolidated and presented to the board in early 2024. The 2023 performance review concluded that the board and its committees continue to operate effectively. Alongside the ongoing renewal of the board to ensure it has the right balance of skills, experience and diversity to oversee the company's strategy and its execution, the review highlighted some actions to further enhance its effectiveness during 2024. With the appointment of Murray Auchincloss as the new permanent CEO in January 2024, the board will support his development and effectiveness, driving shareholder value and a further commitment to its oversight of bp's purpose and culture frame. Among the actions identified by the review, a detailed programme of strategy discussions to be held during 2024 is planned to help optimise capital investment proposals in an evolving macro environment.\n\n## Learning, development and induction Induction\n\n- \u00b7 On appointment, all directors receive a formal induction, tailored to their individual needs, skills and experience and which takes account of any committees they join.\n- \u00b7 In March 2023 Hina Nagarajan and Satish Pai were appointed as independent nonexecutive directors to the board, as well as to the audit committee and safety and sustainability committee respectively, with induction programmes provided in advance of and following their appointments.\n- \u00b7 These inductions included one-to-one meetings with members of the board and leadership team and with select members of senior management.\n- \u00b7 Feedback is sought from directors undertaking their induction programmes to ensure they are continually updated and improved.\n\n## Training and development\n\n- \u00b7 Beyond directors' initial induction, ongoing training and development is provided during the routine programme of meetings and board visits (e.g. the audit committee's visit to the security operations centre, where members learned first-hand about the operations of our digital security team).\n- Information that supports TCFD Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures in relation to Governance (see page 55 )\n- a None of the search agents have any connection with the company or individual directors, save that Egon Zehnder provides advice and support on bp's executive development programme and Spencer Stuart supports on executive recruitment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A knowledge session was also provided by bp's trading & shipping business to certain directors.\n\n## Diversity\n\nThe board believes that, to deliver on our purpose and strategy, we must foster diversity of thought.\n\n## Diversity of the board\n\n- \u00b7 The 2023 board DE&I policy was approved and recommended for adoption by the board at its meeting in February 2023.\n- \u00b7 The DE&I policy included revisions to recognize broader forms of diversity and a commitment by the board to undertake DE&I training and development initiatives.\n- \u00b7 The revised DE&I policy set, as a minimum, targets of at least 40% female representation on the board, at least one senior board position held by a woman and at least one member of the board from an ethnic minority background.\n- \u00b7 The DE&I policy:\n- -applies to the board and its committees and requires all aspects of diversity to be considered when reviewing composition, skills, experience and the overall balance of the board and its committees.\n- -aims to achieve better decision making and outcomes by bringing together people with differences of opinion and background, but who share a common ambition.\n- -complements bp's wider diversity policies and the group's values, code of conduct and sustainability frame. Read more at bp.com/governance .\n- \u00b7 Appointments to the board during 2023 and up to the date of publication of this report considered the objectives of the DE&I policy and, as a result, our female representation in senior board positions has doubled and our ethnic minority representation on the board has tripled since 2022.\n- \u00b7 As at 31 December 2023, the board exceeded the UK Listing Rules diversity benchmark targets, since more than 40% of the board are women, including our senior independent director, and three of our directors identify as being from a minority ethnic background (see page 133 ). bp's progress was also recognized in the FTSE Women Leaders Review: Achieving Gender Balance, published in February 2024.\n\n## Diversity of senior leaders\n\n- \u00b7 The committee oversees executive succession planning and monitors its alignment with bp's DE&I ambitions and strategy.\n- \u00b7 As at 31 December 2023, the composition of senior management, defined as the leadership team (being the first layer of management below board level) and the company secretary, in accordance with the\n- UK Corporate Governance Code 2018, and their direct reports comprised 51% women (2022 51%) and 26% Black, Asian and ethnic minority individuals (2022 25%).\n- \u00b7 The committee oversees the work undertaken by management to support career progression of under-represented groups in a sector that has historically been male-dominated with limited diversity in other forms.\n- \u00b7 The board is cognisant of the Parker Review objective for companies to set targets to 2027 for ethnic minority representation at senior management level. We have set diversity ambitions to 2025, which include our ambitions to achieve:\n- -30% of our group and senior leader roles in the US held by individuals from an ethnic minority background.\n- -15% of our group and senior leader roles in the UK held by individuals from an ethnic minority background.\n- \u00b7 For numerical data on the ethnic background and gender identity or sex of bp's board and executive management, in line with the UK Listing Rules, see page 133 .\n\n## Diversity of the workforce\n\n- \u00b7 DE&I remains a key part of bp's people strategy.\n- \u00b7 The board is supportive of bp's employee-led business resource groups, which provide forums for employees to obtain support and networking opportunities around specific themes such as ethnicity, sexual orientation and social mobility (see page 71 ).\n\n## Skills matrix\n\n## Background and experience\n\n|                         | Energy  markets   | Operational  excellence  and risk  management   | Global

        "page_content": "In 2023 two additional interim committees were established. More detail on their roles and key responsibilities can be found below.\n\n## CEO succession committee\n\nThe board met immediately after the former CEO resigned in September 2023. Our existing succession plans were activated and the board appointed Murray Auchincloss as interim CEO within a few hours. Demonstrating the strength of our senior-level leadership and the rigour of our emergency succession plans, Kate Thomson was appointed as interim CFO one week later.\n\nFollowing this, a new board committee was formed on an interim basis, focused on the selection of the next CEO. The committee led a thorough and highly competitive process for the identification, selection and appointment to the board of bp's next CEO. Helge Lund was committee chair, with Amanda Blanc, Tushar Morzaria and Johannes Teyssen committee members.\n\nThe committee had a clear remit including the workstreams leading to the appointment of the CEO. A project plan was agreed and the timeframe and delivery of key workstreams were monitored.\n\nWith inputs from the board, the committee agreed the role profile and the proposed hiring approach, which included, but was not limited to, psychometric testing, interview and candidate submission content. This approach was then confirmed with the chosen search firm, Egon Zehnder.\n\nOver a period of four months, the committee met regularly and interviewed a range of high-calibre internal and external candidates. Following robust due diligence on each candidate, the committee recommended a shortlist to be interviewed by the full board.\n\nThe process resulted in the board's unanimous agreement that Murray Auchincloss was the best candidate and the right leader for bp. Read more in the chair's letter on page 4 .\n\n## 'Who we are' oversight committee\n\nThe 'Who we are' oversight committee was established on an interim basis by the board in 2023, to gain insight into management's progress towards embedding bp's 'Who we are' culture frame, with a specific emphasis on psychological safety and speaking up.\n\nThe committee reviewed management's approach to measuring bp's culture, including the analysis of 'Pulse live' and 'Pulse annual' employee surveys of cross-sections of bp's workforce and comparative benchmark data, as well as external best practice. Additionally, the committee considered the effectiveness of the company's code of conduct and associated policies and guidelines and the operation of the company's confidential speak-up programme. bp's people & culture and ethics and compliance management supported the committee's work and attended meetings.\n\nThe work of the committee was supplemented by individual engagement sessions with different parts of the workforce to hear directly about issues of relevance to the measurement of bp's culture. Our existing workforce engagement programme described on page 94 provided the ideal framework for this, with engagement sessions focused on culture which have supported the committee's work.\n\nThe committee's activities have informed the board's assessment and monitoring of culture. Its work will additionally help to facilitate how the views of the workforce are considered in board discussions and decision-making. It is expected that the responsibilities of the 'Who we are' oversight committee will be absorbed by the people and governance committee.\n\nChaired by Helge Lund, the committee met twice in 2023. The other committee members were Amanda Blanc, Melody Meyer and Paula Rosput Reynolds.",

Read more under the oversight of audit fees and non-audit services section.\n- \u00b7 The external auditor is required to rotate the lead audit partner every five years and other senior staff every five to seven years. No partners or senior staff associated with the bp audit may transfer to the group.\n- \u00b7 External audit services were last tendered in 2016 and the external auditor has been in role for six years (since 2018). It is anticipated that a re-tender will be completed by 2026 or sooner, in line with relevant guidelines that require a tender at 10 years. This will allow sufficient time for potential tendering firms and the company to assess non-audit services that could impair independence. The committee believes that the anticipated timeline for the re-tender of audit services is in the best interests of shareholders as it provides an appropriate balance between factors such as knowledge of controls and risks, maintaining audit quality, independence and objectivity and value for money.\n- \u00b7 The company complies with the requirements of the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.\n\n## Assessment of quality and effectiveness\n\n- \u00b7 Assessed audit quality and effectiveness through reports from the external auditor and management, and private meetings with the external auditor. The committee was satisfied that the audit team was providing the required quality of services, demonstrated the necessary commitment and ability and had provided constructive challenge to management. The committee received the following audit quality reports as part of its assessment:\n- -External auditor insights report -summary of areas of opportunity for improvements to processes related to financial reporting or internal controls, management's response to the recommendations identified, progress made against any prior year items and areas of focus for the year ahead.\n- -Management survey - the survey sought views from key internal stakeholders on the external auditor's performance, for which the main measurement criteria were: planning and scope, robustness of audit, independence and objectivity, quality of delivery, quality of people and service, and value-added advice. The survey also sought feedback on bp's commitment to the audit. The overall score from the survey increased compared to the previous year with areas of strength noted including audit team judgement, integrity and attitude, as well as communication.\n- \u00b7 Discussed improvement opportunities, including the benefits of further information on how the external auditor used technology in their audit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Audit plan\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the external audit plan, in particular the materiality level versus prior years and key audit risks relating to: impairment of oil and gas property plant and equipment assets; accounting for complex transactions; valuation of financial instruments with significant unobservable inputs; and management override of controls. As part of the external audit plan, received a report on audit quality, including actions taken to address the FRC's annual report on the external auditor, as well as the inspection results of the external auditor's quality control procedures.\n- \u00b7 Approved the external audit plan, noting key scoping changes, resourcing, and received updates on delivery against the plan, as well as an update prior to year end on key audit risks. A summary of the audit approach, including audit risks, is set out in the independent auditor's report on pages 138-163 .\n\n## Oversight of audit fees and non-audit services\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the fee structure, resourcing and terms of engagement for the external auditor.\n- \u00b7 Retained oversight of bp's policy on non-audit services and the review and approval of non-audit services. The policy safeguards audit objectivity and independence through the prohibition of non-audit tax services being provided by the external auditor, the limitation of audit-related work which falls within defined categories, and by stating that the auditor may not perform non-audit services that are prohibited by the SEC, Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB),\n\n## Sunbury, UK visit 2023\n\nIn November 2023 Tushar Morzaria and members of the committee visited the accounting, reporting and control (ARC) team at bp's offices in Sunbury, UK for a showcase of their work on controls and reporting, including a simplified close approach to quarterly financial reporting. They engaged with members of the broader finance team during a floor walk, hearing their views and thoughts on a number of key topics.\n\nThe committee members also met with the internal audit senior leadership team to discuss in depth the proposed internal audit programme for 2024, as well as plans to further harness the use of data analytics. The visit was a great opportunity to build connections with the ARC and internal audit teams, and gain insight into key areas of focus planned for 2024.\n\nFinally, they visited the security operations centre, where they learned first-hand about the operations of our digital security team.",

The external auditor is considered for permitted non-audit services only when its expertise and experience of bp are important. Approvals for individual engagements of pre-approved permitted services below certain thresholds are delegated to the SVP accounting, reporting and control or the CFO. Any proposed service not included in the permitted services categories must be approved in advance by either the committee chair or the committee prior to engagement.\n- \u00b7 The committee, CFO and SVP accounting, reporting and control monitor overall compliance with bp's policy on audit-related and non-audit services, including whether the necessary pre-approvals have been obtained. The categories of permitted and pre-approved services are outlined in the principal accountant's fees and services on page 360.\n- \u00b7 The total non-audit fees paid to Deloitte for 2023 was $3 million. The majority of these fees related to work of an assurance nature. See Note 36 for further information.\n- \u00b7 Fees paid to the auditor for the year are set out in Note 36. The committee is satisfied that this level of fee is appropriate in respect of the audit services provided and that an effective audit can be conducted for this fee. Non-audit or non-audit-related services consisted of other assurance services.\n\n## Internal audit and internal controls Internal audit\n\n- \u00b7 Appraised the performance of the SVP internal audit and agreed their objectives.\n- \u00b7 Recommended the SVP internal audit's remuneration to the remuneration committee.\n- \u00b7 Met privately with the SVP internal audit. The committee chair also met with the SVP internal audit on a regular basis.\n- \u00b7 Continued to monitor and review the effectiveness and capabilities of internal audit during the year and concluded that the function had unrestricted scope, together with access to information and sufficient resources to fulfil its mandate.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the internal audit plan and alignment to risk factor coverage.

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration report continued\n\n## Chair's introduction\n\n## Dear fellow shareholders,\n\nOn behalf of the board, I am pleased to present our 2023 directors' remuneration report. This report provides details of the remuneration decisions we have reached regarding current and former executive directors. These decisions comply with the remuneration policy that was overwhelmingly approved at the 2023 Annual General Meeting (AGM) by 94% of the voting shares. The report also covers various matters pertaining to the wider workforce.\n\n## Performance and reward for 2023\n\n## Business performance\n\nDuring the year, bp's performance was robust - both operationally and financially. Among other metrics, the company achieved an underlying replacement cost profit of $13.8 billion and sustained high levels of reliability and availability of our operations. Operating cash flow was $32.0 billion and net debt was reduced to $20.9 billion.\n\nThere has been continued progress in bp's transformation to an integrated energy company, with momentum across our resilient hydrocarbons, convenience and mobility and low carbon businesses.\n\n## 2023 annual bonus\n\nThe 2023 annual bonus was based on a scorecard of performance measures across three categories: safety and sustainability (30%), operations (20%) and financials (50%).\n\n## Safety and sustainability\n\nSafety comes first for all employees at bp; avoiding incidents or injuries that irreversibly change lives is of paramount importance.\n\nTier 1 and tier 2 process safety events performance improved, with the number of events in each category lower than in 2022 and below our targets for 2023. This outcome reflects a relentless focus on process and personal safety. Nevertheless, the positive process safety performance was sadly overshadowed by three workforce fatalities one within bpx energy and two at our recently acquired TravelCenters of America facilities.\n\nDetails of these fatalities, including the actions taken by management in response, are set out on page 69 in the sustainability section of the strategic report.\n\nThe committee decided to apply downward discretion to the formulaic outcome for the entire bonus score reflecting the fatality in our bpx energy business; we reduced the bonus by 5 points for all participants in the 2023 annual cash bonus plan (ACB) to reinforce all employees' individual and collective responsibility for delivering safe operations. The TravelCenters of America incidents were not reflected in the adjustment, which is in line with our new framework for assessing newly acquired assets (see page 122 ).\n\nFurther detail on the impact of safety on pay outcomes is provided on page 115 .\n\nSustainability is measured in the annual bonus scorecard by the degree to which the company reduces Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We track sustainable emissions reductions (SER) and performance in 2023 was slightly ahead of target, delivering 0.908mte of reductions in 2023 and 7.973mte cumulatively since 2017.\n\n## Operations\n\nbp delivered strong performance against this category, driven by both high hydrocarbon plant reliability and refining availability , and achieved an outcome of 95.7% for this combined measure. In addition to reliability and availability of our hydrocarbons operations, we adopted another operational measure for 2023 intended to give focus to our newer businesses. Namely, we measured convenience & EV gross margin growth (%) which accounts for 10% of the award. The organization demonstrated robust year-on-year growth under this metric (10.6% vs. our target of 10%).\n\n## Financials\n\nOur financial performance has two measures: annual adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow . Adjusted EBITDA delivery was strong at $43.7 billion, resulting in a near maximum outcome for this measure. This outcome reflected both higher production and strong trading results. Adjusted free cash flow was $15.1 billion, which exceeded the maximum target we set for 2023.\n\nAs a reminder, in line with policy, the targets for both financial measures are adjusted for the actual price environment to reflect underlying performance.\n\n## Overall result\n\nThe formulaic outcome of the annual bonus considering safety, operational and financial performance was 1.64 out of 2.00. As described above, the committee decided to exercise its discretion on the mechanical outcome on account of the fatality within bpx energy and reduced the outcome by 5 points to 1.59 out of 2.00 for all participants of the plan (which translates to 79.5% of the maximum opportunity).\n\n## 2021-23 performance shares\n\nbp started its transition to an integrated energy company in 2020. As a result, this is the second cycle of equity (2021-23) in which we have evaluated performance over a three-year period since the strategy was set in place.\n\nThe 2021-23 performance shares were measured against relative TSR (20% weighting), return on average capital employed (ROACE) (20% weighting) , adjusted EBIDA per share CAGR (20% weighting) and strategic progress (40% weighting). The relative weighting of these measures for this award reflected the need, we perceived at the time, to create a significant incentive for strategic progress in the period immediately following the strategy change announced in 2020, ensuring a continued focus on ambitious financial goals and the delivery of shareholder value.\n\nbp's relative TSR performance recovered in the 2021-23 period compared to the prior 2020-22 period. bp achieved median returns relative to peers - placing bp fourth out of eight in the comparator group. This performance resulted in 25% vesting.\n\nUnderlying financial performance was resilient over the performance period and both performance measures achieved full vesting; the 2021-23 average ROACE performance was 20.6%, which materially exceeded the ambitious target we set in 2021. Similarly, adjusted EBIDA per share CAGR outperformed target and achieved an outcome of 15.8%.\n\nUnlike the three measures described above, strategic progress was not a quantitative assessment. By design, this measure is assessed in the round - and in two successive policy votes, shareholders have affirmed their willingness to have this committee make these judgements on progress.",

        "page_content": "When assessing outcomes under the strategic progress measure for the 2021-23 performance shares, the committee considered how management have delivered on bp's transition plans, including its financial resilience, and how they relate to our communicated 2025 targets.\n\nOverall, bp's hydrocarbons business has performed well with all underlying measures on track towards our 2025 targets. In low carbon energy we have seen growth in our pipeline against the backdrop of tough economic conditions, and our convenience and mobility businesses have shown resilient performance in tough trading conditions.\n\nWhen considering strategic progress in the round, the committee determined that an outcome of 75% of maximum was appropriate.\n\nLooking forward, the committee has decided to evaluate strategic progress based on value generation potential rather than volume goals. The committee will be looking for evidence that the transition growth engines are generating sustainable, and growing, earnings. Simultaneously, we will continue to assess progress in the resilience of our hydrocarbon portfolio.\n\nFurthermore, for the next performance share cycle - 2024-26 - the committee has decided to lower the weighting of strategic progress in the scorecard to 20% of the total. We will also raise the relative TSR weighting to 25%. These changes are permitted under the current remuneration policy.\n\nThe committee has come to these conclusions with the benefit of shareholder feedback we have received. Namely, shareholders have supported our strategy, but they have noted that vesting of performance shares must reflect the broader shareholder experience over the cycle. They are particularly keen to see the financial resilience of the transition growth engines. We hope you will agree that using value-driven criteria for the outstanding awards and de-rating of strategic progress for future awards is an appropriate response to shareholder feedback received.\n\nOverall, the sum of the several components that go into performance share vesting for the 2021-23 cycle was 75% of maximum. The committee believes that this outcome is reflective of performance during the period and therefore has not applied any further discretion.\n\n## Looking ahead to 2024\n\nFor 2024, we have reviewed the operation of the bonus and performance shares against our strategy and are proposing only modest changes, all consistent with our shareholderapproved remuneration policy.\n\n## Alignment with strategy Sustainability performance\n\nIn 2023, we consulted with shareholders about changing the measurement of our progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions to provide a direct link to bp's aim 1, to achieve net zero operations by 2050 or sooner.\n\nIn our annual bonus scorecard, instead of SER we will use a measure of operated carbon emissions. Unlike SER, operated carbon emissions is a measure recognized by stakeholders and thus allows comparability of our results with those of others in our industry. This measure covers the Scope 1 and 2 emissions reported under aim 1 (net zero operations) and will have the same weighting as SER previously did (15% of award).\n\nIt is our intent to measure and reward progressive improvements in operated carbon emissions performance both over the short and long term. We are therefore introducing this operated carbon emissions metric to our 2024-26 executive directors' incentive plan (EDIP) scorecard to better align with our strategic ambition of net zero by 2050 or sooner. This measure will be weighted at 15% and for reference, we will use 2019 as the baseline year (which is consistent with the baseline year for bp's aim 1).\n\n## Recognizing the transition growth engines\n\nbp has aims to accelerate the growth in earnings from transition growth engines. Rather than picking business unit specific operating metrics (e.g. convenience margin, EV sales growth), we will measure and report on earnings growth overall in our transition growth engines. This measure should provide better visibility to shareholders as to the financial quality of our transition growth investment and focus our teams on ensuring that these new businesses can generate meaningful earnings over time. We will weight this metric at 10% in the annual bonus.\n\n## Focus on safety\n\nA number of shareholders provided feedback in 2023 that we were not giving a meaningful enough message through bonus adjustments when fatalities occurred. We have carefully considered the comments and agree that we should modify our approach. Namely, if any workforce fatality occurs during the year, the committee will make it normal practice to adjust the overall bonus outcome downwards. The downward adjustment will vary based on the specific circumstances and will apply broadly across the organization. Notwithstanding this change, safety is an underpin to all of our plans and so we retain absolute discretion to reflect lapses in safety in remuneration outcomes.\n\nFurther details have been set out on page 122\n\n.\n\n## Alignment with stakeholders\n\n## Wider workforce\n\nWhen reflecting on pay decisions in relation to the executive directors, the committee is mindful of the pay arrangements of the wider workforce. For 2024, the wider workforce will receive an average salary increase of 4.5% in the UK. Adjustments in other jurisdictions vary by local conditions. All bp employees in the UK earn at least the UK Living Wage.\n\nWe are aware that a number of bp's UK pensioners have asked bp management to consent to a trustee request to provide an additional discretionary increase that is over and above the 5% increase they have received under the scheme rules, to their pensions. Discretionary pension increases under bp's many pension schemes around the world are a matter for management. We do note that management made additional funding to the bp Helios Fund and the Retail Trust, which has enabled the trustees of those bodies to support pensioners who are most in need through a one-off grant.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration report continued\n\n## Shareholder engagement\n\nIn 2023, during the development of our directors' remuneration policy, we engaged extensively with our shareholders and the main proxy agencies. We discussed the company's strategy, their expectations in relation to executive pay, and in some cases, our approach to remuneration upon the departure of our former CEO. By letter and in individual conversations, we have engaged with our largest shareholders and proxy agencies on the proposed outcomes for 2023 and the implementation of our policy going forward.\n\n## Executive director changes\n\nAs announced on 12 September 2023, Bernard Looney resigned as CEO with immediate effect. The board triggered its emergency succession plan to ensure continuity in leadership, resulting in Murray Auchincloss's appointment as interim CEO with immediate effect. As you will have read in our disclosures elsewhere, the board undertook a robust and competitive executive succession process, ultimately resulting in the decision to appoint Murray Auchincloss as the permanent CEO on 17 January 2024. On 2 February 2024, Kate Thomson, who had been acting as interim CFO, was appointed as permanent CFO and became an executive director of the board.\n\n## CEO arrangements\n\nUpon appointment as interim CEO, the committee agreed that Murray Auchincloss should receive base pay equal to that of his predecessor for 2023, but that his bonus would be based on a pro-rated salary rather than his new higher salary and that no additional equity grants would be made in the interim. His annual salary was therefore set at \u00a31.45 million, reflecting his increased responsibility, and the competitive landscape.\n\nUpon appointment as permanent CEO, Murray's salary remained unchanged at \u00a31.45 million and he will not receive a salary increase for 2024. All elements of his remuneration will be in line with the shareholder-approved remuneration policy The details have been set out in full on pages 119 to 120 .\n\n## CFO arrangements\n\nHaving acted as interim CFO since September 2023, Kate Thomson was appointed to the board and as permanent CFO on 2 February 2024.\n\nUpon appointment, her base pay has been set at \u00a3800,000 and will not be reviewed until 1 April 2025. The committee believes it is appropriate that Kate's salary be set at a lower level than that of her predecessor, reflecting her limited experience in a board role. However, the committee will keep the CFO salary under review each year, with regard to performance in the role and market conditions. As such, it is possible that any future adjustments may exceed the percentage for the wider workforce for a period, subject to performance. All elements of Kate's new package are consistent with our remuneration policy.\n\n## Former CEO departure terms\n\nIn December 2023, the board determined that serious misconduct had occurred in relation to the former CEO. At that time, we disclosed the provisions of his separation. Full details of which are provided on page 127 .\n\nAll remuneration decisions have been made in accordance with our shareholder-approved policy.\n\n## Concluding remarks\n\nAt the close of this year's AGM, I will depart the board of bp as my nine-year tenure concludes.\n\nAs I depart, I want to express my appreciation to my colleagues on this committee, the advisors and executives who support us in our deliberations - and to you, our shareholders, for your constructive feedback and candour. I am gratified that we have always come to agreement on the way forward, after what has often been vigorous and challenging discussion.\n\nI trust that 2024 will be no exception. The committee has remained true to the policy you approved and where we have used discretion, it has been thoughtfully undertaken. As always, we welcome your comments on the materials covered herein. One final time, I respectfully ask for your vote in favour of the resolution to approve the 2023 directors' remuneration report at the upcoming AGM.\n\n## Paula Rosput Reynolds\n\nCommittee chair 8 March 2024",

We aim to create an open dialogue among our board, senior management and the wider workforce - including on topics such as remuneration (see section below).\n\nDuring 2023, the committee was particularly mindful of the higher cost of living and the challenges inflation presents for many. bp has introduced a range of initiatives to help improve the wellbeing of our colleagues.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nDuring the year, the committee continued its direct engagement sessions with the wider workforce through a number of forums. The intention of the sessions was to better understand the views of our workforce and to encourage an open discussion on relevant matters. More detail on bp's workforce engagement agenda can be found on page 92 .\n\nWith regards to remuneration, a session was held with recent joiners at management level to discuss their initial views on bp's culture and remuneration models (including executive pay). The selected participants came from different parts of the business, from energy to consumer to technology, and represented a diverse group. Without exception, they expressed support for bp's strategy.\n\n## Enhance wellbeing\n\nWe have continued to review our pay arrangements in our retail businesses and are committed to ensuring that our offering is fair. This includes a commitment to increase our hourly wage for ~6,000 UK staff from 1 April 2024 in line with the Real Living Wage.\n\nThe results of these initiatives are showcased in our recent 'Pulse annual' employee survey results, where we were pleased to see that all our wellbeing scores improved year on year. Highlights are set out below.\n\nThere was a shared sense that the culture at bp was welcoming and open, with colleagues wanting to drive success. Our transition to an integrated energy company was frequently cited as a reason for joining the organization. While commentary on our remuneration models was broadly positive, we received feedback that there could be greater simplicity in the structure of incentives.\n\nAs ever, we were impressed by our colleagues' readiness to share open and honest feedback with board members and will continue to reflect on our workforce views as we consider executive pay decisions.\n\nOur aim 15 is to enhance the health and wellbeing of our employees, contractors and local communities. This is achieved through the innovative programmes, partnerships and offers at bp.\n\n## Physical and mental wellbeing\n\nObjective: Support employees to proactively improve their physical and mental health.\n\n- \u00b7 Achieved menopause-friendly employee accreditation from 2023 for the UK. This included launching new guidance, e-learning modules for colleagues and leaders and collaborating with our external providers.\n- \u00b7 In 2023, bp provided more paid leave and enhanced medical coverage in several countries - including Singapore, Malaysia, India and Hungary.\n- \u00b7 In the process of designing a new global mental health education programmes for our wider workforce called 'Healthy Minds'.\n- \u00b7 Following the success of rolling out free membership for the Headspace app, around 9,000 employees enrolled globally.\n- \u00b7 For the first time, 'Thrive Together' our wellbeing challenge was available globally - inspiring employees to take positive action and enhance their wellbeing.\n\n## Financial wellbeing\n\nObjective : Alleviate the impact of money concerns on overall wellbeing.\n\n- \u00b7 During the year, we hosted a series of global events on financial wellbeing for our below board employees. The sessions aimed to provide practical tips on how to manage day-to-day finances and signposted the financial support systems in place at bp.\n- \u00b7 These events were made available to all site-based employees globally, with relevant material being extended to our retail and non-site-based employees.\n- \u00b7 Introduced financial coaching sessions to support colleagues in the UK with managing their personal finances. Following this success, we plan to roll-out a global toolkit for financial wellbeing in 2024.\n- \u00b7 In the UK, all new joiners are entitled to a free 1:1 financial coaching session with other colleagues receiving a discounted service.\n\n## Focus on retail\n\n- \u00b7 Accredited as a Living Wage Employer in the UK since 2020 - first major energy, mobility and convenience employer to achieve this.\n- \u00b7 Increased the hourly wages of ~6,000 staff as part of an \u00a38 million annual investment in pay which is effective 1 April 2024. In practice, this will mean that staff nationwide will receive over \u00a32,000 extra a year.\n- \u00b7 Continue to ensure our retail employees are offered a competitive benefits package, which includes discounted food and shopping and paid breaks (worth ~\u00a32,500 a year).\n\n## ~69,000\n\nemployees with access to financial wellbeing support\n\n~9,000\n\nemployees enrolled with Headspace\n\n## 26%\n\nincrease in our global wellbeing platform usage\n\n~180,000\n\nviews of our global wellbeing guides\n\n<!-- image -->",

The committee agreed that his remuneration package should be broadly in line with that of his predecessor and his base pay was set at \u00a31.45 million.\n\nMurray has been an advocate of bp's strategy to transition to an integrated energy company and remains focused on delivering exceptional performance - this was clearly evident when he undertook the interim CEO role. The committee believes it was in our shareholders' interest that Murray's remuneration was set at a level that appropriately reflected the responsibility and scope of the role, while motivating and retaining him during this interim period, thus ensuring a continued focus on delivering our long-term strategy. The extensive external search we undertook confirmed our view that a base pay of \u00a31.45 million was competitive to lead a company of bp's size, business complexity and strategic ambition.\n\n## Benefits\n\nExecutive directors received car-related benefits, coverage of tax return preparation, security assistance, health and life insurance and medical benefits.\n\nTransitional changes to the car-related benefit provided to Murray Auchincloss, as approved by the committee, is the primary reason for the increase in the value of taxable benefits compared with 2022. The cost of this benefit is expected to fall in 2024.\n\n## Cash allowance in lieu of pension\n\nUpon appointment to the board in 2020, Murray's cash allowance in lieu of pension was aligned to the flexible benefit allowance for the majority of the wider UK workforce at that time (15% of salary).\n\nIn the 2023 directors' remuneration policy, the cash allowance in lieu of pension for executive directors was changed to 20% of salary (in line with the wider workforce). This amendment to our policy was supported by shareholders and approved at the 2023 AGM with a vote of 94%. From the 2023 AGM, Murray's cash allowance was therefore adjusted to 20% of salary. As disclosed in last year's report, Bernard Looney's allowance remained unchanged at 15% of salary.",

In line with our remuneration policy, awards are typically calculated using salary as at year-end. However, given Murray's relatively short tenure as interim CEO during the performance period, the committee felt it would be appropriate to base his award on a pro-rated salary.\n\nIn relation to the deferral requirement, the committee reviewed Murray's shareholding during the year to assess if the minimum shareholding requirement had been met. Given that his bonus award is based on a pro-rated salary, it was considered appropriate to calculate his shareholding on the same basis. As of 16 February 2024, the CEO achieved a shareholding of 6.4x salary (based on a pro-rated salary). This is above the minimum shareholding requirement for the CEO of 5x salary and his 2023 award will therefore be subject to a deferral rate of 33%.\n\n## 2023 annual bonus scorecard and outcome\n\nFor 2023, the committee assessed performance against a bonus scorecard of seven measures across three categories: safety and sustainability, operations and financials. These measures align with our strategy (see page 12 ) and were set out under the terms of our 2023 policy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Safety and  sustainability 0.41                | Operations  0.24 +                                   |                                            | +             | Financials  0.99                         | =                                        | Formulaic score 1.64 out of 2.0 Outcome   |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Measures                                       |                                                      | Weighting                                  | Threshold (0) | Target (1)                               | Maximum (2)                              |                                           |\n| Safety and  sustainability  (30% weight)       | Tier 1 process safety  events                        | 15%                                        | 12  0         | 10 0.075                                 | 8 0.15                                   | 39 (tier 1: 9, tier 2: 30)                |\n|                                                | Sustainable emissions  Tier 2 process safety  events | 15%                                        | 47 0 <7.77    | 39 0.075 7.97                            | 31 0.15 8.27                             | 7.973 0.26                                |\n| Operations  (20% weight)                       | bp-operated reliability  and availability            | 10%                                        | 94.5% 0       | 95.5% 0.1                                | 96.4% 0.2                                | 95.7% 0.13                                |\n|                                                | Convenience & EV  gross margin % growth              | 10%                                        | 4% 0          | 10% 0.1                                  | 16% 0.2                                  | 10.6% 0.11                                |\n| Financials  (50% weight)                       | Adjusted free cash  flow                             | 25%                                        | $12.6bn 0     | $13.6bn 0.25                             | $14.6bn 0.5                              | $15.1bn 0.50                              |\n|                                                | Adjusted EBITDA                                      | 25%                                        | $40.7bn 0     | $42.2bn 0.25                             | $43.7bn 0.5                              | $43.67bn a 0.49                           |\n| Formulaic score                                |                                                      |                                            |               |                                          |                                          | 1.64 out of 2.0                           |\n| Formulaic scorecard  outcome  1.64 out of 2.00 |                                                      | Committee judgement for  fatalities - 0.05 |               | Final scorecard outcome 1.59 out of 2.00 | Final scorecard outcome 1.59 out of 2.00 | 79.5% of maximum                          |",

        "page_content": "Safety performance as measured by tier 1 and 2 process safety events, was strong with the mechanical outcome achieving between target and maximum performance. The committee's review of safety performance is detailed below and in the safety and sustainability committee (S&SC) report on page 103 .\n\nSustainable emissions reductions (SER) of 7.973mte cumulative (2023 vs. 2017) met target for the fourth year running, demonstrating consistent progress against our aim 1. At the start of the year bp identified opportunities for emission reductions based on planned activity totalling 704kt in 2023. However, an SER target of 900kt was set to continue embedding a net zero mindset and ownership of emissions performance across the operating entities. This approach led our sites to review existing activity sets and identify projects with SER potential that were not in existing plans. Key contributions across bp's portfolio included Whiting and Cherry Point refineries switching to low carbon power (255kt), bpx energy projects including electrification, vapour recovery and centralized processing in the Permian and Eagle Ford (240 kt), and a focus on flare system and practices improvements across production sites (102kt).\n\nReliability and availability is a measure of bp-operated refining availability and bp-operated plant reliability with a performance outcome of 95.7% - slightly above target. Refining availability strengthened year-on-year to 96.1% (94.5% in 2022). Plant reliability was below the target outcome at 95.0%.\n\n## A focus on safety\n\nSafety comes first at bp and avoiding safety incidents within the workforce is paramount. Our goal is to eliminate tier 1 process safety events, fatalities and life-changing injuries.\n\nEach year the committee, with advice from the S&SC, reviews the formulaic outcome of the annual bonus scorecard against broader contextual factors when determining the final performance outcome. As part of this holistic review, careful consideration is given to annual and long-term safety performance, any major safety incidents and any workforce fatalities during the year.\n\n## Process safety performance\n\nTo improve the focus on tier 1 process safety events, the committee determined that for the 2023 annual bonus scorecard tier 1 and tier 2 events would be measured independently rather than a combined measure. The committee is pleased to report that both tier 1 and tier 2 process safety events - particularly tier 1 - were lower than prior years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe overall strong process safety performance resulted in a score of 87.5% of maximum for this element of the annual bonus scorecard. With the overall trend in process safety performance over time being positive, the committee felt this outcome was fair.\n\nConvenience & EV gross margin % growth (v. 2022) was above target with an outcome of 10.6%. Over the period, our EV energy sales grew by 150% and our convenience gross margin, excluding TravelCenters of America and adjusted for other portfolio changes at constant foreign exchange, was up by 9%.\n\nFinancial performance, as measured by adjusted free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA , was strong. bp generated adjusted free cash flow of $15.1 billion, which resulted in the maximum outcome. Similarly, adjusted EBITDA performance was strong with an outcome of $43.67 billion, slightly below our maximum target. Our targets are environment-adjusted at year end and the revised targets for adjusted free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA were $13.6 billion and $42.2 billion respectively.\n\n## Overall outcome\n\nThe formulaic score for the 2023 annual bonus was 1.64 out of 2.00 (82% of maximum).\n\nThe committee, advised by the S&SC, considered the circumstances of all of the fatalities and resolved to apply a downward adjustment to the annual bonus for one of the fatalities (see 'A focus on safety' below).\n\nThe formulaic score has therefore been reduced by 5 points from 1.64 to 1.59 (79.5% of maximum) for all plan participants.\n\n## Impact of fatalities\n\nIn 2023, three people lost their lives while working for bp - a contractor within bpx energy and two employees from our newly acquired TravelCenters of America business. Our thoughts, as ever, are with their family, friends and co-workers.\n\nAlongside the S&SC, the committee reflected on the fatalities that occurred during the year. While the fatality in bpx energy was within bp's ultimate responsibility, the incident was contractor led and under a third party management system. However, after careful consideration the committee concluded that the fatality should directly impact the annual bonus.\n\nTravelCenters of America was acquired mid 2023 and is not fully integrated into bp - either from a safety culture or remuneration perspective (employees there do not participate in the bp annual cash bonus plan). The committee has therefore determined that applying a discretionary adjustment to all bp employees for the fatalities in TravelCenters of America would not be appropriate at this time. This is consistent with our approach to target setting more generally for recent acquisitions, where a transition period normally applies. Details on the TravelCenters of America acquisition are provided on page 20 .\n\nReflective of the fatality in our bpx energy business, the overall formulaic outcome of 1.64 has been reduced by 5 points (3%), resulting in an overall performance outcome of 1.59. This adjustment has been applied to all participants of the bp annual cash bonus plan to emphasize our collective responsibility with regard to safety.\n\nWe hope to see fatalities eliminated. Nevertheless, in response to shareholder feedback, a framework has been developed to guide the committee's decisions regarding the impact of fatalities on incentive outcomes. This new framework will formally take effect from 2024 (the committee has applied its principles when determining 2023 outcomes). Further detail on the framework has been provided in the implementation section of this report (see page 122 ).\n\nb",

The committee assesses performance against objectives within these pillars and takes into account the broader stakeholder experience during the performance period.\n\nDuring our review of strategic progress, the committee was mindful of bp's mid-cycle announcement in February 2023 updating its transition strategy. These updates were strongly supported by the board and the committee.\n\nOn balance, the committee determined that the strategic progress measure should result in 75% of maximum vesting.\n\n## 1. Deliver value through a resilient hydrocarbon business\n\n## Unit production costs\n\nUnit production costs have reduced by 15% over the three-year period, from $6.82/boe in 2021 to $5.78/boe in 2023. This currently places bp ahead of our 2025 target of $6.00/boe by 2025.\n\nThis performance has largely been driven by portfolio high grading and efficiency gains. Looking ahead to 2025, the aim is to maintain a production cost at ~$6.00/boe - which is ambitious given the challenges in the current market.\n\n## Plant reliability\n\nBut, bp remains on track to reach its 2025 target and continues to be focused on delivering major projects with higher reliability.\n\n## Refining availability\n\nRefining availability was 96.1% in 2023, compared to 94.5% in 2022 and slightly above the 2025 target of ~96%. During the period, we have seen strong performance across the sites with focus on continuously enhancing availability through ongoing improvement initiatives and safely delivering turnaround events.\n\nFor 2023, hydrocarbon plant reliability was 95.0% which was a slight decline from our 2022 high-point of 96.0%.\n\n## 2. Demonstrate track record, scale and value in low carbon energy\n\nDuring the year, bp has continued to make progress against our low carbon energy strategic pillar. Focus remains on the transition growth engines as bp works towards achieving its 2025 targets.\n\n## Developed renewables to FID\n\nDuring the performance period we have delivered 2.9GW to FID (bp net), with main contributions from Lightsource bp (50% JV) and the 100% bp solar pipeline (Cygnus). Driven by supply chain challenges in the US and the principle of value over volume, Lightsource bp has reduced the number of delivered sanctioned projects in 2023. In US offshore wind, given challenging\n\nmacroeconomic conditions we have restructured our Beacon and Empire projects taking full ownership of Beacon and transferring Empire ownership to Equinor. Slower pace in solar FIDs and US restructuring in relation to offshore wind resulted in slower GW to FID progression.\n\n## Renewables pipeline\n\nbp has materially scaled the renewables businesses with the pipeline of projects increasing from 10.9GW (end of 2020) to 58.3GW (end of 2023). bp's offshore wind organization pipeline was built from a zero base and the pipeline has doubled in recent years - with a total potential generating capacity of 4GW in Germany.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                              |   2021 |   2022 |   2023 |   2025  target |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|----------------|\n| Upstream unit  production  costs ($/boe)     |   6.82 |   6.07 |   5.78 |              6 |\n| bp-operated  upstream plant  reliability (%) |  94    |  96    |  95    |             96 |\n| bp-operated  refining  availability (%)      |  94.8  |  94.5  |  96.1  |             96 |\n\n|                                    |   2021 |   2022 |   2023 | 2025  target   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|----------------|\n| Developed  renewables  to FID (GW) |    4.4 |    5.8 |    6.2 | 20             |\n| Renewables  pipeline (GW)          |   23.1 |   37.2 |   58.3 |                |",

Accelerate growth in convenience and mobility\n\n## Convenience gross margin growth\n\nFor 2021-23, convenience gross margin growth was an average of 9% and remains on track to achieve the 2025 target of 10%.\n\nDuring the period, bp extended the convenience partnership with Lekkerland and Auchan to deliver services at retail sites in Germany and Poland.\n\n## Strategic convenience sites\n\nStrategic convenience sites are on track to exceed the 2025 target of 3,000 sites. This has been supported by taking full ownership of Thorntons in 2021 and the acquisition of TravelCenters of America in 2023, which added around 290 sites.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                        | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   | 2025  target   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|----------------|\n| Convenience gross  margin growth (%) a | 11     | 9      | 9      | 10             |\n| Strategic  convenience sites           | 2,150  | 2,400  | 2,850  | 3,000          |\n| Castrol performance ($bn)              | 6.8    | 6.9    | 7.0    | 7.5            |\n\n## Castrol performance\n\nDuring the period, Castrol has strengthened its market leading position in EV fluids. For instance, three out of four of the world's major vehicle manufacturers use Castrol ON products as part of their factor refill.\n\nThis success has been supported by investments in our technology centres, e.g. a new EV laboratory in Shanghai, China and a new laboratory in New Jersey, US.\n\nHowever, performance to date is tracking lower than the 2025 targets. This is partly due to the challenging market environment.\n\n## Approach to outstanding awards\n\nHaving reflected on our approach to assessing strategic progress as part of the EDIP scorecard, the committee intends to judge this measure primarily through value-driven criteria for outstanding awards. This evaluation will include consideration of the financial performance of the transition growth engines, which has been raised as a key indicator of our strategic progress by shareholders in our recent consultation.\n\nIt is also to be noted that for 2024, the strategic progress measure is to be weighted at 20% of the award (previously 25%) while relative TSR will increase from 20% to 25%. For further details on the implementation of our policy for 2024, please refer to pages 119 to 120 .\n\n## Other vesting considerations\n\nAlong with the results from the scorecard measures, the committee considers an 'underpin' to the formulaic outcome in order to determine the final vesting percentage. The underpin broadens our performance assessment, allowing us to consider vesting outcomes with overall alignment to absolute shareholder returns, environmental and safety factors and progress in low carbon and climate change matters. Where relevant, we take input from the safety and sustainability committee and the audit committee to deepen and enhance our perspective.\n\nWindfall gains: As part of this holistic review, the committee also considered potential 'windfall gains'. Last year, the committee applied a downward adjustment to the 2020-22 performance share award in response to the fall in share price of 40% from the prior year's grant. That adjustment was viewed as extraordinary given the pandemic-related circumstances and was not intended to be embedded into the policy. For 2021-23, the grant price was ~4% lower than the share price used for the prior year grant. Therefore, an adjustment for windfall gains was not deemed appropriate for this cycle.\n\nHaving considered the above, the committee concluded that the vesting outcome was suitably reflective of the company's underlying performance and the experience of stakeholders overall. The committee therefore agreed it was not necessary to apply discretion to the out-turns and approved the formulaic vesting of 75% for the 2021-23 performance share awards. This decision yields the outcomes shown in the table below. The scorecard detail is shown on page 116 .\n\n## 2021-23 performance share plan outcome (audited)\n\n|                    | Shares  awarded   | Unvested shares  following  application of  performance  factor   | Value of unvested  shares following  application of  performance  factor   | Impact of share price change   |\n|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Murray Auchincloss | 1,122,009         | 943,565                                                           | \u00a34,651,775                                                                 | \u00a31,811,645                     |",

        "page_content": "## Salary\n\nAs announced on 17 January 2024, Murray Auchincloss was appointed as CEO with immediate effect and his base pay was set at \u00a31.45m (in line with his predecessor). As part of the search process for a new CEO, external and internal candidates were considered. During this process, the committee became acutely aware of the challenges of competing in the global talent market (particularly in the US). We also reflected on the nature of the CEO role, which is inherently complex as we continue to drive our strategic transformation. On balance, our market positioning is considered appropriate and suitably reflective of the role.\n\nKate Thomson was appointed to the board and as CFO on 2 February 2024. Her base pay has been set at \u00a3800,000 (lower than her predecessor). The committee felt this was appropriate, balancing her limited experience as a board member and CFO of a FTSE 20 company, with her market positioning and with her proven capability within bp. We will continue to review her salary as she develops within the role, with regard to performance and market competitiveness. As such, adjustments in future years may exceed the percentage accorded the wider workforce for a period.\n\nFor 2024, Murray and Kate will not receive a salary increase as part of our annual pay review. For reference, the average wider workforce increase will be 4.5% in the UK.\n\n## Measures for the 2024 annual bonus\n\nFor 2024, two new measures are being introduced to the scorecard to reflect our strategic priorities for the year - operated carbon emissions and transition growth engines adjusted EBITDA % growth.\n\nWe are replacing our sustainable emissions reductions (SER) measure with operated carbon emissions to better align with our aim 1 - net zero operations by 2050 or sooner. This measure incorporates all operated emissions (Scope 1 and 2) and takes into account all activities that contribute to or reduce emissions during the year. This provides a more comprehensive view of our sustainability performance during the year than sustainable emissions reductions, which is only measured against interventions taken to reduce emissions in year. Operated carbon emissions is recognized by stakeholders and allows comparability of our performance with those of others in our industry. The committee believes that the introduction of operated carbon emissions will drive the right behaviours in the scorecard by remaining focused on activities impacting emissions during the year.\n\nUnder operations, we are introducing a more holistic transition growth engines adjusted EBITDA % growth measure in place of the convenience & EV margin growth measure. This change is reflective of our continued focus on financial delivery within all our transition growth engines and aims to widen the scope of how we assess performance within the scorecard.\n\nProvided below is a summary of the measures we have chosen for the 2024 annual bonus plan scorecard. The targets are commercially sensitive and will be disclosed in the 2024 directors' remuneration report.\n\n## Safety and sustainability\n\n## 30%\n\n| Measures include                                               | Weighting   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Tier 1 and tier 2 process safety  events (measured separately) | 15%         |\n| Operated carbon emissions                                      | 15%         |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operational\n\n## 20%\n\n| Measures include                                    | Weighting   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| bp-operated reliability and  availability           | 10%         |\n| Transition growth engines  adjusted EBITDA % growth | 10%         |\n\n## Financials\n\n## 50%\n\n| Measures include           | Weighting   |\n|----------------------------|-------------|\n| Adjusted free cash flow    | 25%         |\n| Earnings (adjusted EBITDA) | 25%         |",

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration report continued Directors' remuneration report continued\n\n## Introduction of framework on fatalities\n\nIt is always our goal to eliminate workforce fatalities. Nevertheless, should such tragic losses occur, from 2024 onwards, a framework is being introduced to help guide decisions regarding the impact of workforce fatalities on the annual bonus scorecard. In developing the framework, the committee listened to shareholder feedback during the 2023 engagement cycle and sought the input of the safety and sustainability committee (S&SC).\n\n## The framework is based on the following guiding principles:\n\n| Collective responsibility   | The entire annual bonus score will typically be adjusted by the same percentage for all participants of the  plan in the event of a workforce fatality. This is to reinforce that safety is everyone's priority at bp.                                                                                           |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Meaningful adjustment       | Any reduction will be applied to the overall outcome of the annual bonus scorecard, rather than impacting  only the safety elements of the bonus.                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Judgement within a frame    | The level of adjustment will be a judgement within a range up to a maximum set by reference to the  weighting of the safety component of the annual bonus scorecard. There is no value that we would  associate with a loss of human life and therefore are not proposing a formulaic policy in such situations. |\n| Treatment of new assets     | To enable the embedding of bp's safety culture, operating systems and practices, major acquisitions will be  excluded for an initial period of time. This will be agreed upfront and allow for a period of transition to bp.                                                                                     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Application of framework\n\nThe framework will be consulted where there has been any workforce fatality during the year. The committee will seek input from the S&SC, who will provide a view on the individual fatalities. This will broadly include consideration of the following:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTaking into consideration the S&SC's input, the committee will then apply judgement on the level of adjustment to be applied to the overall formulaic bonus.\n\n## Treatment of new assets\n\nAs stated above, major acquisitions will be excluded from the framework for an initial period to enable the embedding of bp's safety culture, operating systems and practices.\n\nFor example, it has been agreed that Lightsource bp will be excluded for two years; 2024 and 2025 performance years, based on an acquisition date expected in 2024, and TravelCenters of America for three years; 2023, 2024 and 2025 performance years, based on an acquisition date of May 2023. The difference in timeframes between the two is reflective of TravelCenters of America being a complex business with over 20,000 employees and therefore requiring a longer period of time to fully embed bp's safety culture. Practically, this means that any fatality in Lightsource bp or TravelCenters of America may impact the annual cash bonus plan outcomes for bp cash bonus plan participants from performance year 2026.\n\nWhere an acquisition has been excluded for an initial transitionary period, there will still be careful consideration of safety performance within this business during the performance period. Where a workforce fatality has occurred, the committee will consider the individual incident - alongside input from the S&SC - and will determine whether a downward adjustment to bonus outcomes for the specific business is appropriate.\n\n## Overriding discretion\n\nAlongside this framework, the committee will retain the right to exercise discretion and will review the formulaic outcome against broader considerations. While the committee has ultimate discretion with regards to the level of adjustment that will be applied, typically adjustments will be made with reference to the range set out within our framework.\n\nDetails of any adjustment based on the framework will be provided in full retrospectively.",

The categories remain unchanged from the prior year, however the weighting on strategic progress has reduced from 25% to 20% following shareholder feedback. The weighting on relative TSR has increased from 20% to 25%, providing further alignment between executive directors and the wider shareholder experience.\n\nUnder our ESG category, we are proposing to introduce a cumulative reduction % in operated carbon emissions measure. This is to provide direct alignment with bp's net zero ambition so that all operated emissions are captured. The weighting will remain unchanged at 15% to ensure a meaningful percentage of the EDIP is focused on operational emissions reduction and performance.\n\nFor strategic progress, as referenced in the chair's statement, the committee has reflected on how performance will be assessed under this measure. While the strategic pillars remain unchanged, and following feedback from shareholders, a greater focus will be placed on value-driven objectives and financial resilience within our transition growth engines. In assessing final strategic progress outcomes, a holistic review of performance will be undertaken and outcomes will be aligned with the overall shareholder experience.\n\n## rTSR\n\n## 25%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeer group of seven companies: Chevron, Eni, Equinor, ExxonMobil, Repsol, Shell and TotalEnergies (and bp) a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Underpin will take into account safety outcomes prior to determining final vesting percentage.\n- \u00b7 Remuneration committee discretion will reflect shareholder experience, environment, societal and other inputs.\n- \u00b7 Robust malus and clawback may apply in certain circumstances.\n- a Nil vesting for fifth place or lower.\n- b   Based on the average over 2024, 2025 and 2026.

Our policy therefore requires the CEO and CFO to build a personal shareholding of five times and four and a half times, respectively, their salary within five years of their appointment. They are expected to maintain this level of personal shareholdings for two years post-employment.\n\n## Directors' shareholdings and aggregated interests (audited)\n\nThe table below details the personal shareholdings of each executive director. These figures include all beneficial and non-beneficial ownership of shares of bp (or calculated equivalents) that have been disclosed to the company.

As per the past four years, we have selected Option A as our reporting basis, being the most accurate approach available, and we confirm that no broadly applicable components of pay have been omitted. Where necessary, full-time equivalent pay has been calculated by simple engrossment of part-year values. Employee values relate to pay and benefits for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\nChanges in pay ratio over time reflect the fact that CEO remuneration is more heavily weighted to variable pay, resulting in larger year-on-year swings than wider workforce pay. This is evidenced by the variability of the CEO pay ratio over the past five years. This volatility in the pay ratio reporting from year to year is expected, and illustrates one of the challenges in commenting on whether pay differentials are appropriate. In 2023 the 50th percentile pay ratio decreased from 172:1 to 103:1. This was driven by the former CEO not receiving any variable pay in respect of 2023, as he was not paid any annual bonus in respect of 2023 and his 2021-23 EDIP lapsed in full on departure. For further details of his treatment upon departure, please see page 127 . It is the view of the committee that the remuneration frameworks we have in place for the executive directors and the wider workforce are fit-for-purpose and deliver pay outcomes appropriate to the circumstance of the year, with differentials that reflect the relative contributions made at different levels in our organization.\n\nThe committee is satisfied that the median pay ratio reported this year is consistent with bp's pay policies for employees and does not constitute a reason to modify our pay programmes.",

For the purposes of comparison, the employee percentages shown below represent the relative change between the median full-time equivalent pay for every employee employed at BP p.l.c. at any point during the relevant financial year, and the equivalent median value for the preceding financial year.\n\nTaxable benefit changes for the chair in 2023 principally arose as a result of additional travel commitments in relation to his bp duties, and for the current CEO as a result of transitional changes to the car-related benefit, as approved by the committee.\n\n|                           | 2023 v 2022   | 2023 v 2022   | 2023 v 2022   | 2022 v 2021   | 2022 v 2021   | 2022 v 2021   | 2021 v 2020   | 2021 v 2020   | 2021 v 2020   | 2020 v 2019   | 2020 v 2019   | 2020 v 2019   |\n|---------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Percentage change for a : | a             | b             | c             | a             | b             | c             | a             | b             | c             | a             | b             | c             |\n| Employees                 | 6%            | 1%            | 4%            | 2%            | 1%            | 45%           | 7%            | -9%           | 100%          | 0%            | 0%            | -100%         |\n| Bernard Looney b          | -27%          | -60%          | -100%         | 4%            | 233%          | -2%           | 2%            | -29%          | 100%          | -             | -             | -             |\n| Murray Auchincloss c      | 30%           | 283%          | 31%           | 7%            | 530%          | 3%            | 5%            | 5%            | 100%          | -             | -             | -             |\n| Dame Amanda Blanc d       | 38%           | 100%          | n/a           | -             | -             | n/a           | -             | -             | n/a           | -             | -             | n/a           |\n| Pamela Daley              | 2%            | 2%            | n/a           | 7%            | 43%           | n/a           | 4%            | 1385%         | n/a           | -15%          | -92%          | n/a           |\n| Helge Lund (chair)        | 3%            | 78%           | n/a           | 0%            | 97%           | n/a           | 0%            | -24%          | n/a           | 0%            | -74%          | n/a           |\n| Melody Meyer              | 2%            | -14%          | n/a           | 13%           | 139%          | n/a           | -4%           | 283%          | n/a           | 9%            | -77%          | n/a           |\n| Tushar Morzaria c         | 2%            | -46%          | n/a           | 25%           | 100%          | n/a           | 5%            | 0%            | n/a           | -             | -             | n/a           |\n| Hina Nagarajan e          | -             | -             | n/a           | -             | -             | n/a           | -             | -             | n/a           | -             | -             | n/a           |\n| Satish Pai e              | -             | -             | n/a           | -             | -             | n/a           | -             | -             | n/a           | -             | -             | n/a           |\n| Paula Rosput Reynolds     | 2%            | -14%          | n/a           | 16%           | 145%          | n/a           | 6%            | 228%          | n/a           | 2%            | -92%          | n/a           |\n| Karen Richardson f        | 11%           | -20%          | n/a           | 30%           | 96%           | n/a           | -             | -             | n/a           | -             | -             | n/a           |\n| Sir John Sawers           | 2%            | 105%          | n/a           | 17%           | 1%            | n/a           | 0%            | 1588%         | n/a           | 0%            | -83%          | n/a           |\n| Johannes Teyssen f        | 3%            | 12%           | n/a           | 21%           | 65%           | n/a           | -             | -             | n/a           | -             | -             | n/a           |\n\n## Independence and advice\n\nThe board considers all committee members to be independent with no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the committee's decisions. Further detail on the activities of the committee in 2023 is set out in the remuneration committee report on page 125 .\n\nDuring 2023 Ben Mathews, who was employed by the company and reported to the chair of the board, acted as secretary to the remuneration committee.\n\nThe committee also received advice on various matters relating to the remuneration of executive directors and senior management from Kerry Dryburgh, EVP people & culture and Ashok Pillai, SVP reward.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) continued to provide independent advice to the committee in 2023. PwC advice included, for example, support with remuneration benchmarking and updates on market practice. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consulting Group and, as such, operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration in the UK. The committee is satisfied that the advice received is objective and independent. The committee is comfortable that the PwC engagement partner and team who provides remuneration advice to the committee do not have connections with the company or its directors that may impair their independence.\n\nTotal fees or other charges (based on an hourly rate) for the provision of remuneration advice to the committee in 2023 (save in respect of legal advice) were \u00a394,714 to PwC. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP (Freshfields) provided legal advice on specific compliance matters to the Committee. PwC and Freshfields provide other advice in their respective areas to the group.\n\n## Considerations related to the Corporate Governance Code\n\nWhen setting the 2023 policy, the committee concluded that a scorecard-based approach to setting targets and measuring outcomes helps it to engage transparently with shareholders and the wider workforce on remuneration. Thus, bp continues to operate a simple, clear structure of marketaligned salary with annual and three-year performance-based incentives. Risks are managed through careful setting of performance measures and targets and the committee retains the exercise of its discretion in assessing outcomes. These are complemented with robust malus and clawback measures. Remuneration outcomes are predictable, as shown in the implementation charts of the 2023 policy, and proportional by virtue of the challenging performance levels required to achieve target pay outcomes. Through material weighting in measures related to safety, sustainability and strategy, as shown on page 123 , remuneration aligns closely with bp's culture, as expressed through our purpose and ambition.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration report continued\n\n## Shareholder engagement\n\nThroughout 2023, the committee engaged frequently on remuneration policy and approach with bp's largest shareholders, as well as their representative bodies. This dialogue will continue throughout 2024.\n\nThe table below shows the recent votes on the directors' remuneration report and policy.\n\n| Year                                  | % vote 'for'   | % vote 'against'   | Votes withheld   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| 2023 - Directors' remuneration report | 81.95%         | 18.05%             | 179,106,094      |\n| 2023 - Directors' remuneration policy | 94.23%         | 5.77%              | 36,921,641       |\n\n## Service contracts and letters of appointment\n\nThe service contracts of executive directors do not have a fixed term. Service contracts for each executive director are available for shareholders to view upon request at the company's registered office. Each executive director's service contract contains a 12-month notice period. Consistent with the best interests of the group, the committee will seek to minimize termination payments.\n\n|                    | Date of contract   | Effective date   |\n|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| Murray Auchincloss | 17 Jan 2024        | 17 Jan 2024      |\n| Kate Thomson       | 2 Feb 2024         | 2 Feb 2024       |\n\nThe non-executive directors (NEDs) have letters of appointment, which are available for shareholders to view upon request at the company's registered office. All directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders at the annual general meeting. Normally, NEDs will be encouraged to serve for up to nine years from their appointment in line with the provisions of the 2018 Code, subject to annual re-election.\n\n## External appointments\n\nThe board supports executive directors taking up appointments outside the company to broaden their knowledge and experience. Each executive director is permitted to retain any fee from their external appointments. Such external appointments are subject to agreement by the chair and reported to the board. Any external appointment must not conflict with a director's duties and commitments to bp. Details of appointments as NEDs of publicly listed companies during 2023 are shown below.\n\n|                    | Appointee  company   | Additional position held  at appointee company   |   Total fees,  \u00a3 |\n|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Murray Auchincloss | Aker BP ASA a        | Director                                         |                0 |\n| Kate Thomson       | Aker BP ASA a        | Director                                         |                0 |\n\nThis directors' remuneration report was approved by the board and signed on its behalf by Ben J.S.

        "page_content": "## Other disclosures\n\n## Appointment and succession plans\n\nThe chair, senior independent director (SID) and other independent non-executive directors (NEDs) each have letters of appointment with BP p.l.c. and do not serve, nor are they employed, in any executive capacity by bp. In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (Code), bp proposes all directors for annual re-election by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) where letters of appointment for each NED are available for inspection. Details on the skills and experience of each director seeking re-election, as well as their individual contributions to the long-term success of the company, are set out in the Notice of AGM. In accordance with the Code, NEDs would not be expected to serve beyond nine years unless there are exceptional circumstances. For information on board meetings held during 2023 and director attendance at board meetings, please see page 85 . On behalf of the board, the people and governance committee reviews the formal appointment process and succession plans for the board. Appointments and succession plans are both based on merit and assessed against objective criteria with the promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion as central considerations. This includes diversity of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds as well as cognitive and personal strengths. In reviewing appointments and succession plans, due consideration is given to ensure the smooth transition of board members with specific responsibilities (e.g. committee chair roles) by allowing sufficient time for a detailed handover. This is balanced by the need to have new board members join at regular intervals such that over time there is a controlled approach to board members reaching the end of their tenure. Further detail on board succession and tenure can be found in the people and governance committee report\n\n- on page 95 and board at a glance disclosure\n- on page 83\n- , respectively.\n\n## Time commitments\n\nThe expectation regarding time commitment for board members to effectively discharge their duties is set out in the directors' letters of appointment. The time commitment varies with the demands of bp business and other events. The NEDs' external time commitments whether through executive, non-executive, advisory or other roles - are regularly reviewed by the company secretary to ensure that directors are able to allocate appropriate time to bp. A register of directors' time commitments and conflicts is maintained and is also reviewed annually by the people and governance committee. The review process takes into account outside appointments and other external commitments and considers the complexity of the organization, the nature of the role, the sector (especially regulated and/or potentially competing sectors) and any leadership roles (e.g. a chair position). NEDs are also required to consult with the company secretary and chair before accepting any other role that may impact their ability to commit appropriate time to bp. The process for the approval of any new external appointment, significant or otherwise, for an existing director assesses the impact of that appointment on the director's time in order to ensure the director has sufficient capacity for their role with bp. As part of that same review process, a review of independence and potential conflicts of interest is undertaken, taking account of institutional investor and proxy advisor guidance and market best practice. Any external proposed commitments that could exceed the mandates set out in such guidance are given particular consideration. The board was satisfied that significant appointments undertaken during\n\n2023 did not impact the directors' ability to prepare for and attend meetings, engage with stakeholders and participate in learning and development opportunities. The board has concluded that, notwithstanding external appointments held, each director is able to dedicate sufficient time to fulfil their bp duties. In compliance with the Code, none of the executive directors who served during 2023 held more than one non-executive directorship in a FTSE 100 company or other significant appointment throughout their tenure on the board. For more information on the external commitments of bp's directors, see page 83 .\n\n## Independence and conflicts of interest\n\nAll directors have a statutory duty to exercise independent judgement. Independence of NEDs is crucial in bringing constructive challenge to the chief executive officer (CEO) and the leadership team at board meetings, while providing support and guidance to promote meaningful discussion and, ultimately, informed and effective decisionmaking. In addition, each director has a statutory duty to disclose actual or potential conflicts of interest. In accordance with the criteria set out in the Code, the chair was considered independent at the time he was appointed. NEDs are required to provide sufficient information to allow the board to evaluate their independence prior to and following their appointment. Formal procedures are in place for new potential conflicts to be reported and recorded during the year. As a consequence of regular reviews in 2023, the board is satisfied that there were no matters giving rise to conflicts of interest which could not be authorized by the board. It has therefore concluded that all bp NEDs are independent.\n\n## Reporting in line with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(10)\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, 50% of the board comprises women, our SID is a woman and three directors identify as from an ethnic minority background. Following Kate Thomson's appointment to the board as chief financial officer (CFO) in 2024 and as at the date of publication of this report, 54% of the board comprises women, two senior board positions are held by women and three directors identify as being from an ethnic minority background. Data for the below tables is collected on an annual basis through a standardized process under which each member of the board and executive management is asked to self-declare, or elect not to declare, their ethnic background and gender identity or sex. The information is correct as at 31 December 2023. For the purposes of this table, executive management includes bp's leadership team and the company secretary.\n\n| Gender identity or sex                                         | Number of   board members   | Percentage   of the board   | Number of senior   positions on the board   (CEO, SID and chair)   | Number in  executive  management   | Percentage   of executive  management   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Men                                                            | 6                           | 50%                         | 2                                                                  | 5                                  | 42%                                     |\n| Women                                                          | 6                           | 50%                         | 1                                                                  | 7                                  | 58%                                     |\n| Other categories                                               | -                           | -                           | -                                                                  | -                                  | -                                       |\n| Not specified/prefer not to say                                | -                           | -                           | -                                                                  | -                                  | -                                       |\n| Ethnic background                                              |                             |                             |                                                                    |                                    |                                         |\n| White British or other white (including minority-white groups) | 9                           | 75%                         | 3                                                                  | 11                                 | 92%                                     |\n| Mixed/Multiple Ethnic Groups                                   | -                           | -                           | -                                                                  | -                                  | -                                       |\n| Asian/Asian British                                            | 3                           | 25%                         | -                                                                  | 1                                  | 8%                                      |\n| Black/African/Caribbean/Black British                          | -                           | -                           | -                                                                  | -                                  | -                                       |\n| Other ethnic group, including Arab                             | -                           | -                           | -                                                                  | -                                  | -                                       |\n| Not specified/prefer not to say                                | -                           | -                           | -                                                                  | -                                  | -                                       |",

        "page_content": "## Directors' statements\n\n## Statement of directors' responsibilities\n\nThe directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. The directors are required by the UK Companies Act 2006 to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the financial position of the group and the parent company and the financial performance and cash flows of the group and parent company for that period. Under that law they are required to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the United Kingdom and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and United Kingdom accounting standards (United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice), including FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework'. In preparing the consolidated financial statements the directors have also elected to comply with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU).\n\nIn preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.\n- \u00b7 Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.\n- \u00b7 Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information.\n- \u00b7 Provide additional disclosure when compliance with the specific requirements of IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the group's financial position and financial performance.\n- \u00b7 State that applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and company and enable them to ensure that the consolidated financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and the parent company financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nHaving made the requisite enquiries, so far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418(3) of the Companies Act 2006) of which the company's auditors are unaware, and the directors have taken all the steps they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company's auditors are aware of that information.\n\nEach of the current directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 83-85 , confirms that to the best of their knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 The consolidated financial statements, prepared on the basis of IFRS as issued by the IASB, IFRS as adopted by the United Kingdom and EU and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under international accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group.\n- \u00b7 The parent company financial statements, prepared in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, performance and cash flows of the company.\n- \u00b7 The management report, which is incorporated in the strategic report and directors' report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\n## Helge Lund\n\nChair\n\n8 March 2024\n\n## UK Corporate Governance Code compliance\n\nThroughout 2023, bp applied the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (Code) and has complied with all the provisions. The information set out in the Directors' report, including the committee reports on pages 94-132 , is intended to provide an explanation of how bp applied the principles and complied with the provisions of the Code during the year. The Code can be found on the Financial Reporting Council website: frc.org.uk .\n\n## Risk management and internal control\n\nUnder the Code, the board is responsible for the company's risk management and internal control systems. In discharging this responsibility the board, through its governance principles, requires the chief executive officer to operate the company with a comprehensive system of controls and internal audit to identify and manage the risks, including emerging risks that are material to bp. In turn, the board, through its monitoring processes, satisfies itself that these material risks are identified and understood by management and that systems of risk management and internal control are in place to mitigate them. These systems are reviewed periodically by the board, have been in place for the year under review and up to the date of this report and are consistent with the requirements of Principle O of the Code.\n\nThe board has processes in place to:\n\n- \u00b7 Assess the principal and emerging risks facing the company.\n- \u00b7 Monitor the company's system of internal control (which includes the ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the principal and emerging risks).\n- \u00b7 Review the effectiveness of that system annually.\n\nAcquired businesses which have not transitioned into bp's system of internal control and non-operated joint ventures and associates have not been dealt with as part of this process.\n\nA description of the principal risks facing the company, including those that could potentially threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity, is set out in Risk factors on pages 77-79 . During 2023 the board undertook a robust assessment of the principal and emerging risks facing the company. The principal means by which these risks are managed or mitigated are set out on page 73-76 .",

        "page_content": "In assessing the risks faced by the company and monitoring the system of internal control, the board and the audit and safety and sustainability committees requested, received and reviewed reports from executive management, including management of the business segments, corporate activities and any functions, at their regular meetings. A report by each of these committees, including its activities during the year, is set out on pages 94-132 .\n\nDuring 2023 the committees, as relevant, also met with management, the SVP internal audit and other monitoring and assurance functions (including group ethics & compliance, safety and operational risk, group control, group legal and group risk) and the external auditor. Responses by management to incidents that occurred were considered by the relevant committee or the board, as appropriate.\n\nAt a meeting in March 2024, the audit committee considered reports from the group risk function on the system of internal control and the function's categorisation of significant failings or weaknesses. The audit committee also considered a report from internal audit on their assessment of bp's systems of internal control and risk management, based on audit work conducted during 2023. In considering these reports and assessments, the audit committee noted that bp's systems of internal control and risk management is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\nThe board then considered the review undertaken by the audit committee and the proposed disclosures outlining the company's risk management and internal control systems prior to publication of the annual report and accounts.\n\nA statement regarding the company's internal controls over financial reporting is set out on page 133 .\n\n## Longer-term viability\n\nIn accordance with provision 31 of the Code, the directors have assessed the prospects of the company over a period significantly longer than 12 months. The directors believe that a viability assessment period of three years remains appropriate. This assessment is based on management's reasonable expectations of the position and performance of the company over this period, its internal detailed budgets and planning timeframes and the targets and aims that it has set out.\n\nOur risk management system, described in how we manage risk starting on page 73 , outlines our risk identification, assessment and management approach for all risks, including our principal risks, described starting on page 77 .\n\nTaking into account the company's current position and its principal risks, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years.\n\nThe directors' assessment included a review of the potential financial impact of, and the financial headroom that could be available in the event of, the most severe but plausible scenarios that could threaten the viability of the company. The assessment took into consideration the robust financial position of the group and the potential mitigations that management reasonably believes would be available to the company over this period. Mitigations considered include use of cash, access to debt facilities and credit lines, raising of capital, reductions in capital expenditure, divestments and dividend reductions.\n\nThe scenarios that have been modelled are based on the most severe but plausible outcomes and associated costs are based on actual experience where possible. The scenarios have been considered individually and as a cluster of events. They include:\n\n- \u00b7 A significant process safety incident when operating facilities, drilling wells or transporting hydrocarbons.\n- \u00b7 A sustained significant decline in oil prices over three years.\n- \u00b7 A significant cyber security incident.\n- \u00b7 A loss of a significant market or producing asset for six months.\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nThe directors also considered the impact on viability from an extended pandemic scenario, as well as the potential risks associated with climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy. They consider that the most likely impacts of these risks are broadly captured and modelled through the sustained low oil price and loss of a producing asset scenarios.\n\nIn assessing the prospects of the company, the directors noted that such assessment is subject to a degree of uncertainty that can be expected to increase looking out over time and, accordingly, that future outcomes cannot be guaranteed or predicted with certainty.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable\n\nThe board considers the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company's position and performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## Going concern\n\nIn accordance with provision 30 of the Code, the directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.\n\nForecast liquidity has been assessed under a number of stressed scenarios to support this assertion. Reverse stress tests performed indicated that the group will continue to operate as a going concern for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements even if the Brent price fell to zero.

We also revisited the key audit matter of accounting for complex  transactions and valuation of commodity financial derivatives identified in the prior year and concluded that given the evolving  nature of these risks in the business and our response thereto, it would be appropriate to identify them as two separate key audit  matters. |\n|                     | All other key audit matters are consistent with those we identified in the prior year and the developments in fact patterns of these  previously identified key audit matters are explained in the respective sections below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Materiality         | The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was $1,000 million (2022 $1,250 million) which was determined  based on profit before tax and underlying replacement cost profit before interest and tax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n\n## 4. Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nOur evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group's and parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u00b7 considering whether material uncertainties exist that could cast significant doubt on the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months after the date of approval of the financial statements\n- \u00b7 assessing the financing facilities including the nature of the facilities, repayment terms and covenants\n- \u00b7 assessing whether the impact of potential margin calls in respect of derivative exchange contracts used to risk manage the physical portfolio has been appropriately considered given price volatility\n- \u00b7 assessing management's identified potential mitigating actions and the appropriateness of the inclusion of these in the going concern assessment\n- \u00b7 testing the clerical accuracy of the going concern model\n- \u00b7 assessing the historical accuracy of forecasts prepared by management\n- \u00b7 performing our independent sensitivity analysis and\n- \u00b7 assessing the disclosures made within the financial statements.\n\nBased on our assessment, we concluded that the assumptions used by management were reasonable overall and the disclosures made within the financial statements were appropriate.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn relation to the reporting on how the group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\n\n## 5. Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current year and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.\n\nThroughout the course of our audit, we identify risks of material misstatement ('risks'). We consider both the likelihood of a risk and the potential magnitude of a misstatement in making the assessment. Certain risks are classified as 'significant' or 'higher' depending on their severity. The category of the risk determines the level of evidence we seek in providing assurance that the associated financial statement item is not materially misstated.\n\nThis page does not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

The carrying values of goodwill may no longer be recoverable as a consequence of climate change and therefore may need to be impaired. For oil production & operations (OP&O), goodwill is allocated to CGUs in aggregate at the segment level and for gas & low carbon energy (G&LCE) goodwill is allocated to the hydrocarbon CGUs within the segment. The most significant assumption in the goodwill impairment tests affected by climate change relates to future oil and gas prices (see 'Impairment of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets' below). Given the significant level of headroom in the goodwill impairment tests, management identified no other assumption that could lead to a material misstatement of goodwill due to the energy transition and other climate change factors. Disclosures in relation to sensitivities for goodwill are included within Note 14 on page 205. The customers & products (C&P) segment has a goodwill balance of $5.4 billion, of which the most significant element is $2.7 billion relating to the Castrol business. Notwithstanding the expected global transition to electric vehicles which may reduce demand for Lubricants, due to the substantial headroom in the most recent impairment test (as described in Note 14), management has assessed as remote the likelihood that the recoverable amount of goodwill is less than its carrying value.\n- \u00b7 Climate change-related litigation brought against bp, as disclosed in Note 33 to the financial statements, may lead to an outflow of funds requiring provision.\n\nThe above considerations were a significant focus of management during the period which led to this being a matter that we communicated to the audit committee, and which had a significant effect on the overall audit strategy. We therefore identified this as a key audit matter.\n\n## Overall response\n\nWe held discussions with management, with our climate change specialists and within the group engagement team to identify the areas where we felt climate change could have a potential impact on the financial statements.\n\nWe also continued to utilise a climate change steering committee comprising a group of senior partners and specialists with specific climate change and technical audit and accounting expertise within Deloitte to provide an independent challenge to our key decisions and conclusions with respect to this area.\n\n## Audit procedures\n\nThe audit response related to two of the audit risks identified is set out under the key audit matters for 'Impairment of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets' on pages 143-145 and 'Decommissioning provisions' on pages 146-147. Other procedures are as follows:\n\nIn respect of the recoverability of E&A assets capitalised as at 31 December 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the relevant controls within the group's E&A write-off and impairment assessment processes.\n- \u00b7 We challenged and evaluated management's key E&A judgements with regards to the impairment criteria of IFRS 6. Where impairment indicators were identified, we corroborated key judgements with internal and external evidence for assets that remained on the balance sheet. This included analysing evidence of future E&A plans, budgets and capital allocation decisions, assessing management's key accounting judgement papers, reading meeting minutes and assessing licence documentation and evidence of active dialogue with partners and regulators including negotiations to renew licences or modify key terms.\n\nWe considered the impact of potential changes in supply and demand on the group's refining portfolio and reviewed internal and external market studies of future supply and demand. In relation to the Gelsenkirchen refinery impairment test, we assessed the valuation methodology, tested the integrity and mechanical accuracy of the impairment model and assessed the appropriateness of key assumptions and inputs, notably forecast refining margins and energy input costs, challenging and evaluating management's assumptions by reference to third party data where available. We also evaluated management's ability to forecast future cash flows and margins by comparing actual results to historical forecasts and tested management's internal controls over the impairment test and related inputs.\n\nWe challenged management's analysis that identified the specific assets that are likely to be disposed of by bp as part of its strategy. Where relevant, we challenged bp's asset impairment assessments based on their estimated disposal proceeds and whether transactions are judged likely to proceed or not. We obtained evidence of any negotiations with third parties, considered bp's strategic intent in this context and challenged management's assessment of the recoverable amounts for material transactions. We also tested relevant controls which covered both the recoverable amounts determined and the likelihood of transaction completion.\n\nIn respect of the impairment tests performed on certain offshore wind asset low carbon energy investments, we tested the result by:\n\n- \u00b7 Testing the relevant controls over these low carbon energy impairment tests including controls over key assumptions and the discount rate\n- \u00b7 Assessing the low carbon energy discount rate with input from our valuation specialists\n- \u00b7 Challenging and evaluating the key assumptions within the impairment tests. This included the fair value of land and sea bed leases, capital and operating cost assumptions, and forecast yield and power price assumptions impacting the fair value of the development project and\n- \u00b7 Testing the mechanical accuracy of the impairment models.",

        "page_content": "## Key observations\n\nWe challenged management's assertion that no changes are required to the assessed useful economic lives of refining assets as a consequence of climate change factors. In doing this, we obtained third party reports assessing future refined petroleum product demand for those countries which are included in our group full audit scope for the C&P segment. In particular, we considered the forecasts as set out in the IEA World Energy Outlook 2023 which shows that demand for refined petroleum products is expected to remain sufficient for at least the current remaining useful economic lives of the refineries such that current depreciation rates are appropriate, including under the Announced Pledges Scenario which is associated with a temperature rise of 1.7 \u00b0C in 2100 (with a 50% probability).\n\nWe performed procedures to satisfy ourselves that, other than future oil and gas price assumptions, there were no other assumptions in management's oil and gas goodwill impairment tests to which reasonably possible changes due to the energy transition and other climate change factors could cause goodwill to be materially misstated. We obtained evidence which supported management's conclusion that goodwill relating to the C&P segment activities is not impaired due to climate change or other factors.\n\nWith regard to climate change litigation, we designed procedures specifically to respond to the risks that provisions could be understated or that contingent liability disclosures may be omitted or be inaccurate including:\n\n- \u00b7 Holding discussions with the group general counsel and other senior bp lawyers regarding climate change matters\n- \u00b7 Conducting a search for climate change litigation and claims brought against the group\n- \u00b7 Making written inquiries of, and holding discussions with, external legal counsel advising bp in relation to climate change litigation and\n- \u00b7 Assessing the contingent liability disclosures in the annual report on pages 241-243.\n\nWe read the other information included in the Annual Report and considered (a) whether there was any material inconsistency between the other information and the financial statements; or (b) whether there was any material inconsistency between the other information and our understanding of the business based on audit evidence obtained and conclusions reached in the audit.\n\nKey observations in relation to oil and gas price assumptions used in oil and gas PP&E asset impairment tests, and the impact of climate change on decommissioning provisions are set out in the relevant key audit matter below.\n\nWe concluded that the key E&A assessments had been appropriately determined and the judgements management had made were appropriately supported. We did not identify any additional impairments or write-offs from the work we performed. We also confirmed management's view that they did not consider that the progression of any of their E&A assets would be inconsistent with bp's current strategy and management's capital frame and capital allocation intentions in light of climate change and the energy transition.\n\nWe are satisfied:\n\n- \u00b7 with the results of our procedures relating to the carrying value of refining assets and that the impairments recorded are reasonable\n- \u00b7 that management's planned disposal related asset impairment assessments are reasonable and we did not identify any additional material impairments\n- \u00b7 with the results of the low carbon energy impairment tests. The discount rate used by management was within the range that we would have expected.\n- \u00b7 with the results of our procedures relating to the assessment of the useful economic lives of refining assets and therefore depreciation charges, based on the market studies we read\n- \u00b7 with the sensitivity analysis disclosures around the energy transition and other climate change factors performed in respect of the goodwill balances; and that the group's goodwill balances are not materially misstated\n- \u00b7 with management's assertion that no provision should currently be made in respect of climate change litigation. Based on the audit evidence obtained both from internal and external legal counsel, we concluded that management's disclosure of the contingent liabilities in respect of these matters is appropriate and\n- \u00b7 that management's other disclosures in the Annual Report relating to climate change are consistent with the financial statements and our understanding of the business.\n\nWhilst many of bp's oil and gas properties and refining assets are long term in nature, by 2050, the remaining carrying value of assets currently being depreciated will be immaterial, this date being the target set by the majority of governments with 'net zero' emissions targets and also by bp, being Aim 1 of the 'Getting to net zero' strategy set out on page 48. At current rates of depreciation, depletion and amortisation (DD&A), the average remaining depreciable life of the upstream oil and gas PP&E (within the OP&O and G&LCE segments) is six years and the refining assets (within the C&P segment) is twelve years.",

In addition, we conducted the following substantive procedures.\n\n## Oil and gas prices\n\n- \u00b7 We independently developed a reasonable range of forecasts based on external data obtained, against which we compared management's oil and gas price assumptions in order to challenge whether they are reasonable.\n- \u00b7 In developing this range, we obtained a variety of reputable and reliable third party forecasts, peer information and other relevant market data.\n- \u00b7 In challenging management's price assumptions, we considered the extent to which they and each of the forecast pricing scenarios obtained from third parties reflect the impact of lower oil and gas demand due to climate change and the energy transition.\n- \u00b7 The 2015 Conference of the Parties (CoP) 21 Paris Agreement goals of 'holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels' was reaffirmed at CoP 28 in Dubai during December 2023. We specifically analysed third party forecasts stated, or interpreted by us, as being consistent with scenarios achieving the Paris 'well below 2\u00b0C goal' and/or '1.5\u00b0C ambition' and evaluated whether they presented contradictory audit evidence.\n- \u00b7 We challenged and evaluated management's judgement, described in Note 1 on page 170, that the potential impact of further emission costs being borne by producers including bp is not expected to have a material impact on bp's oil and gas CGU carrying values. We obtained evidence supporting that oil and gas price forecasts included in our reasonable range are forecast on a 'net producer prices' basis, (i.e., net of potential future emissions costs that are assumed to be borne by oil and gas end users), consistent with the basis of bp's value-in-use price assumptions.\n- \u00b7 We assessed management's disclosures in Note 1, including the sensitivity of forecast revenue cash inflows to lower oil and gas prices and how climate change and the energy transition, potential future emissions costs and/or reduced demand scenarios may impact bp to a greater extent than currently anticipated in bp's value-in-use estimates for oil and gas CGUs.\n\n## Discount rates\n\n- \u00b7 We independently evaluated bp's discount rates used in impairment tests with input from our valuation specialists, against relevant third party market and peer data.\n- \u00b7 When performing procedures over specific assets, we assessed whether specific country risks and tax adjustments were reasonably reflected in bp's discount rates.\n- \u00b7 We challenged and evaluated management's disclosures in Note 1, including in relation to the sensitivity of discount rate assumptions.\n\n## Reserves and resources estimates\n\nWith the assistance of our oil and gas reserves specialists we:\n\n- \u00b7 assessed bp's reserves and resources estimation methods and policies for reasonableness\n- \u00b7 assessed how these policies had been applied to a sample of bp's reserves and resources estimates which included those that we judged to represent the greatest risk of material misstatement\n- \u00b7 read and evaluated a sample of reports provided by management's external reserves experts and assessed the scope of work and findings of these third parties\n- \u00b7 assessed the competence, capabilities and objectivity of bp's internal and external reserve experts, through understanding their relevant professional qualifications and experience\n- \u00b7 assessed whether management's production forecasts are consistent overall with bp's strategy, including the group's expectation to reduce its hydrocarbon production (by around 25% by 2030 relative to 2019 - see page 171)\n- \u00b7 compared the production forecasts used in the impairment tests with management's approved reserves and resources estimates and\n- \u00b7 performed a retrospective assessment in order to assess management's ability to accurately estimates reserves and resources and to check for indications of estimation bias over time.",

The estimation of decommissioning provisions is a highly judgemental area as it involves a number of key  estimates related to the cost and timing of decommissioning, in particular inflation and discount rate assumptions. Given  management expects upstream hydrocarbon production to be around 25% lower by 2030 relative to 2019 as stated on  page 171, consistency of that expectation with the timing of decommissioning expenditure and underlying cost                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                | assumptions remains a key consideration.  Consistent with prior years, management estimates that the average rate of forecast inflation applicable to the substantial  majority of bp's decommissioning cost estimates is 1.5%, which is 0.5% lower than its estimated long term general  inflation rate of 2%. The extent to which average future decommissioning cost inflation will differ from the general inflation  rate depends on industry demand and supply of rigs and other relevant services at the time future decommissioning  occurs, which in turn will be influenced by future oil and gas demand, and increasingly by structural changes in the  industry supply chain driven by the energy transition, which are uncertain. With the impact of inflation on relevant costs  now better understood and able to be factored into cost estimates, and general inflationary pressures easing in some |\n|                                                                | areas during 2023, we considered this judgement to be a higher rather than a significant audit risk for 2023.

The increase was primarily driven by the increased US treasury bond rates. Additionally, bp is exposed to decommissioning obligations that could revert back to the group in respect of historical  divestments to third parties. Judgement is required to assess the potential risk of reversion and if applicable, the  estimated exposure, for each historically divested asset. The risk of reversion could be elevated by the potential impact of                                                           |\n| How the scope of our audit  responded to the key audit  matter | Long

We assessed the relevant internal and external evidence used in forming this judgement, including the financial health of the counterparty or counterparties in the ownership chain for the divested assets and the existence of any other pertinent factors which could indicate a higher probability of decommissioning obligations reverting to bp.\n\n## Potential decommissioning of refinery assets\n\n- \u00b7 We challenged and evaluated management's analysis which supported the judgement that no decommissioning provisions should be recognised in respect of refineries where there is ongoing activity and management has no current intention to cease these activities.\n- \u00b7 We have reviewed analysis undertaken by management, as well as third party studies, of forecast demand for refined products in regions served by bp's refineries. Furthermore, we read external profitability benchmarking which supported a conclusion that the group's remaining refineries would likely remain operational for longer than many of their regional competitors, in the event of refining capacity reductions.\n- \u00b7 We also met with refinery management to understand the potential plans under consideration for refineries in the future and obtained evidence that management is developing plans for the existing refinery sites remaining in the portfolio which would be compatible with net zero emissions, for instance through the production of alternative low carbon and sustainable fuels.\n\nWe concluded that the assumed inflation rate of 1.5% remains reasonable as a long-term inflation rate for decommissioning liabilities. We accept as reasonable that the high level of general inflation experienced in 2023 does not require a change to bp's long term average inflation assumption. With respect to the extent to which average future decommissioning cost inflation will differ from the general inflation rate, which is influenced by the demand and supply of rigs and other relevant services at the time future decommissioning occurs, we concluded that market forecasts support the assertion that demand for rigs will not increase in the long term as a result of the impact of the energy transition and therefore that inflation of rig costs will be limited.\n\nWe concluded that the cost and timing assumptions used in the decommissioning provision calculation were reasonable and the assumptions are appropriately supported by industry data. The disclosure included on page 184 with respect to the estimated undiscounted cost of bp's decommissioning obligations and the timing of future decommissioning payments are consistent with these conclusions.\n\nBased on our audit procedures, we consider bp's increased 4.0% discount rate to be reasonable.\n\nNo material additional decommissioning provisions have been made in respect of historical divestments where bp are exposed to decommissioning reversion risk as a result of the potential future bankruptcy of the current asset owner. Based on our review and challenge of management's assessment, we consider this judgement to be reasonable. We also consider the contingent liability disclosure to be reasonable.\n\nIn respect of the group's refining assets, taking into consideration both the IEA demand forecasts and management's strategic plans for the group's refineries, including developing production of low carbon and sustainable fuels, we are satisfied that it is not currently possible for management to determine closure dates for the remaining operational refineries or estimate reliably a settlement date for any decommissioning obligations prior to a decision being made to cease refining operations. Accordingly, we have not identified any triggers that would require a decommissioning provision to be recorded.",

To discharge this responsibility, T&S regularly executes commodity contracts, physically settled or  otherwise, which are accounted for as a derivative and fair valued under IFRS 9. These contracts, therefore, result in  unrealised gains/losses that are recognised on account of fair value movements in the associated derivative assets and  liabilities. Determining the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities can be complex and subjective, particularly where the |\n|                                                                                                                                                         | valuation is dependent on significant inputs which are not observable and are classified as level 3 in the fair value  hierarchy set out in IFRS 13. This degree of subjectivity also makes such fair value estimates liable to potential fraud by  management incorporating bias in the inputs used in determining fair values. Given the significant judgements, sensitivity  to management assumptions, and the absolute value associated with these positions, we have identified a significant risk  in respect of certain financial instruments where the valuation is dependent on significant unobservable inputs.                   |\n|                                                                                                                                                         | sentiment and outlook.

We assessed accounting estimates for bias and evaluated whether the  circumstances producing the bias, if any, represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. A number of the most  significant estimates are covered by the other Key Audit Matters set out above. This assessment included: evaluating  whether the judgements and decisions made by management in making the accounting estimates included in the  financial statements, even if they are individually reasonable, indicate a possible bias on the part of bp's management that  may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud; and performing a retrospective analysis of management

Our application of materiality\n\n## 6.1 Materiality\n\nWe define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.

We also report to the audit committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\n## 7. An overview of the scope of our audit\n\n## 7.1 Identification and scoping of components\n\nAs a result of the highly disaggregated nature of the group, with operations in over 60 countries through approximately 930 cons units, a significant portion of our audit planning effort was ensuring that the scope of our work is appropriate in addressing the identified risks of material misstatement.\n\nThe factors that we considered when assessing the scope of the bp audit, and the level of work to be performed at the cons units that are in scope for group reporting purposes, included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The financial significance of an operating unit (which will typically include multiple cons units) to bp's revenue and profit before tax, or PP&E, including consideration of the financial significance of specific account balances or transactions.\n- \u00b7 The significance of specific risks relating to an operating unit, history of unusual or complex transactions, identification of significant audit issues or the potential for, or a history of, material misstatements.\n\nThis page does not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

There are certain cons units which have fallen out of scope due to disposals, asset impairments and non-recurring one off transactions which were in scope in the prior year. Our fullscope audits are in the UK, US, Australia, Azerbaijan and Germany.\n\nIn addition, component teams performed audit procedures on specified account balances in 24 cons units (2022 19) also covering Trinidad and Tobago, Mauritania & Senegal, Indonesia, Egypt, India and UAE. The group engagement team performed audit procedures on specified account balances to component materiality, with certain additional specific procedures performed by component teams, covering an additional 27 cons units (2022 33).\n\nThe remaining cons units are not significant individually and include many small, low risk components and balances. On average, they each represent 0.04% of group revenue (2022 0.03%), 0.03% of property, plant and equipment (2022 0.03%) and 0.04% of profit before tax (2022 0.04%).\n\nIn our assessment of the residual balances not covered by the above procedures, we have considered the risk that there could be a material misstatement within the large number of geographically dispersed businesses, in particular within the C&P segment. This assessment included use of our analytic tools to interrogate data, preparation of trend analysis and comparison of business performance to market benchmark prices. We also tested management's group-wide controls across a range of locations and segments. We concluded that through this additional risk assessment, we have reduced the audit risk of such a misstatement arising to a sufficiently low level.\n\nOur audit coverage of 'Property, plant and equipment', 'Sales and other operating revenue' and 'Profit before tax' is materially the same as in the prior year .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 7.2 Our consideration of the control environment\n\nOur audit approach was generally to place reliance on management's relevant controls over all business cycles affecting in scope financial statement line items. We tested a sample of these controls through a combination of tests of inquiry, observation, inspection and re-performance.\n\nIn limited situations where we were not able to take a controls reliance approach due to controls being deficient and there not being sufficient mitigating or alternative controls we could rely on instead, we adopted a non-controls reliance approach. All control deficiencies which we considered to be significant were communicated to the audit committee. All other deficiencies were communicated to management. For all deficiencies identified we considered the impact and updated our audit plan accordingly.\n\nThe group's financial systems environment is complex, with 140 separate IT systems scoped (including 23 systems acquired by bp through recent acquisitions) as being relevant to the audit for the following key locations (UK, US, Germany, Azerbaijan and Australia) as well as other minor locations. These systems are all directly or indirectly relevant to the entity's financial reporting process.\n\nWe planned to rely on the General IT Controls ('GITCs') associated with these systems, and having tested controls over access security, change management, data centre operations and network operations, were able to do so .\n\n## 7.3 Working with other auditors\n\nThe group audit team are responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process and provide direct oversight, review, and coordination of our component audit teams. We interacted regularly with the component Deloitte teams during each stage of the audit and reviewed key working papers. We maintained continuous and open dialogue with our component teams in addition to holding formal meetings quarterly to ensure that we were fully aware of their progress and results of their procedures.\n\nConsistent with prior year, the senior statutory auditor and other group audit partners and staff conducted visits to meet with the component teams responsible for all of the full scope locations during the year as well as Egypt, Indonesia and Trinidad and Tobago. These visits included attending planning\n\nThis page does not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

In addition, a global audit planning meeting was held in London for three days in July led by the senior statutory auditor and involving the group audit team, partners and staff from all full scope component teams, audit teams responsible for testing at key Global Business Services (GBS) locations and senior management from bp.\n\nFollowing the group's decision to exit Rosneft in February 2022, Rosneft is no longer classified as a reportable segment and the investment was fully impaired in that year. Accordingly, Rosneft was no longer a significant component in scope of the group audit and we therefore did not require reporting from Rosneft's auditor. The group audit team audited the Rosneft investment valuation and other Rosneft related judgements including the decision not to recognise dividends.\n\n## 8. Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\n| We have nothing to report   |\n|-----------------------------|\n| in this regard.             |\n\n## 9. Responsibilities of directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## 10.Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## 11.Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above,  to  detect  material  misstatements  in  respect  of  irregularities,  including  fraud.  The  extent  to  which  our  procedures  are  capable  of  detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\n## 11.1 Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities\n\nIn identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following:\n\n- \u00b7 our meetings throughout the year with the Group Head of Ethics and Compliance and reviews of bp's internal ethics and compliance reporting summaries, including those concerning investigations.\n- \u00b7 enquiries of management, internal audit, and the audit committee, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the group's policies and procedures relating to:\n- - identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance\n- - detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud and\n- - the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations.\n- \u00b7 review of the terms of reference of the Fraud Governance Board set up by management to support the creation and delivery of the Group Fraud Risk Strategy, periodically monitor the threat outlook and review the risk appetite.\n- \u00b7 review of the Fraud Governance Board's meeting minutes and its fraud risk assessment.\n- \u00b7 enquiries of those charged with governance with regards to the facts and circumstances related to the resignation of the former Chief Executive Officer and the related investigation undertaken by the Board, and the impact of this on the Board's assessment of risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations.\n- \u00b7 the group's remuneration policies, key drivers for remuneration and bonus levels and\n\nThis page does not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

The engagement team includes audit partners and staff who have extensive experience of working with companies in the same sectors as bp operates, and this experience was relevant to the discussion about where fraud risks may arise. The discussions also involved fraud specialists who advised the engagement team of fraud schemes that had arisen in similar sectors and industries, and they participated in the initial fraud risk assessment discussions.\n\nIn common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.\n\nWe also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the group operates in, focusing on provisions of those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act, UK Corporate Governance Code, United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and IFRSs as issued by the IASB and as adopted by the EU, FRS 101, US Securities Exchange Act 1934 and relevant SEC regulations, as well as laws and regulations prevailing in each country in which we identified a full-scope component.\n\nIn addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the group's ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the group's operating licences and environmental regulations .\n\n## 11.2 Audit response to risks identified\n\nAs a result of performing the above, we did not identify any key audit matters related to the potential risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We did identify two key audit matters relating to fraud risks, as described above, being the valuation of commodity financial derivatives, and management override of controls. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matters in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we performed in response to those key audit matters.\n\nIn addition to the above, procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements\n- \u00b7 enquiring of management, the audit committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims\n- \u00b7 obtaining confirmations from external legal counsel concerning open litigation and claims\n- \u00b7 performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud and\n- \u00b7 reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence with HMRC and the IRS.\n\nWe also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including internal specialists and significant component audit teams and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.\n\n## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements\n\n## 12.Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 The information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 The strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\n\n## 13.Corporate Governance Statement\n\nThe Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the group's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 the directors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified set out on page 135\n- \u00b7 the directors' explanation as to its assessment of the group's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out on page 135\n- \u00b7 the directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 135\n- \u00b7 the board's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 134\n- \u00b7 the section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on page 134 and\n- \u00b7 the section describing the work of the audit committee set out on pages 98-102.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as at 31 December 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2023, in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and as adopted by the European Union (EU).\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), bp's internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2023, based on criteria established in the UK Financial Reporting Council's Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business reporting relating to internal control over financial reporting and our report dated 8 March 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on bp's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of bp's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on bp's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to bp in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## 1.Impairment of upstream oil and gas property, plant and equipment (PP&E) assets - Notes 1, 4 and 12 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe group balance sheet as at 31 December 2023 includes PP&E, of which $62 billion is oil and gas properties.\n\nManagement's best estimate of oil and gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment tests were revised in 2023 as set out in Note 1 on page 177. Brent oil price and Henry Hub assumption revisions during 2023 were not significant. Management has also revised bp's 'best estimate' discount rate assumptions for value-in-use impairment tests in 2023, as set out in Note 1 on page 177. bp's post-tax nominal weighted average cost of capital, being the starting point for setting discount rates used for impairment testing for oil and gas assets, has increased to 8%, reflecting the impact of observable increases in risk free rates on bp's weighted average cost of capital.\n\nGiven the significance of the discount rate assumption revisions during 2023, alongside certain CGU specific new indicators, management has tested all oil and gas CGUs for impairment and/or impairment reversal during the year. Management recorded $3.6 billion of pre-tax oil and gas CGU impairment charges, principally due to the discount rate revisions detailed above, price revisions, increase in certain capital expenditure forecasts, operating expenditure forecasts and certain reserves write downs. Further information has been provided in Note 1 on page 177 and Note 4 on page 191.\n\nWe identified three key management estimates in management's determination of the level of impairment charge and/or impairment reversal. These are:\n\nOil and gas prices -  bp's  oil  and  gas price assumptions have a significant impact on many CGU impairment assessments performed across the OP&O and G&LCE segments and are inherently uncertain. The estimation of future prices is subject to increased uncertainty given climate change, the  global  energy  transition,  macro-economic  factors  and  disruption  in  global  supply  due  to  ongoing  geo-political  conflicts.  There  is  a  risk  that management do not forecast reasonable 'best estimate' oil and gas price forecasts when assessing CGUs for impairment charge and/or impairment reversal,  leading  to  material  misstatements.  These  price  assumptions  are  highly  judgmental  and  are  pervasive  inputs  to  bp's  oil  and  gas  CGU valuations. There is also a risk that management's oil and gas price related disclosures are not reasonable.\n\nDiscount rates - Given the long timeframes involved, certain CGU impairment assessments are sensitive to the discount rate applied. Discount rates should reflect the return required by the market and the risks inherent in the cash flows being discounted. There is a risk that management does not assume reasonable discount rates, adjusted as applicable for country risks and relevant tax rates, leading to material misstatements. Determining a reasonable discount rate is highly judgmental and, consistent with price assumptions above, the discount rate assumption is also a pervasive input across bp's oil and gas CGU valuations, before adjustments for asset specific risks and tax rates.",

        "page_content": "Reserves and resources estimates - A key input to certain CGU impairment assessments is the oil and gas production forecast, which is based on underlying reserves estimates and field specific development assumptions. Certain CGU production forecasts include specific risk adjusted resource volumes, in addition to proven and/or probable reserves estimates, that are inherently less certain than reserves; and assumptions related to these volumes can be particularly judgemental. There is a risk that material misstatements could arise from unreasonable production forecasts for individually material CGUs and/or from the aggregation of systematic flaws in bp's reserves and resources estimation policies across the OP&O and G&LCE segments.\n\nWe identified certain individual CGUs which we determined would be most at risk of material impairment charges as a result of a reasonably possible change in the oil and gas price assumptions. This population includes previously impaired assets which are also at risk of material impairment reversal resulting from potential oil and gas price assumption changes. We identified that a subset of these CGUs was also individually materially sensitive to the discount rate assumption.\n\nWe also identified CGUs which were less sensitive as they would be potentially at risk, in aggregate, to a material impairment by a reasonably possible change in some or all of the key assumptions. No impairment reversals are available for these CGUs. Further information regarding these sensitivities is given in Note 1 on page 178.\n\nImpairment charge and/or impairment reversal assessments of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets remain a critical audit matter because recoverable values are reliant on forecasts that are inherently judgemental and complex for management to estimate, and the magnitude of the potential misstatement risk is material to the group .\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit\n\nWe tested relevant internal controls over the estimation of oil and gas prices, discount rates, and reserve and resources estimates, as well as key internal controls over the performance of the impairment charge and/or impairment reversal assessments where we identified audit risks. In addition, we conducted the following substantive procedures.\n\n## Oil and gas prices\n\n- \u00b7 We independently developed a reasonable range of forecasts based on external data obtained, against which we compared management's oil and gas price assumptions in order to challenge whether they are reasonable.\n- \u00b7 In developing this range, we obtained a variety of reputable and reliable third party forecasts, peer information and other relevant market data.\n- \u00b7 In challenging management's price assumptions, we considered the extent to which they and each of the forecast pricing scenarios obtained from third parties reflect the impact of lower oil and gas demand due to climate change and the energy transition.\n- \u00b7 The 2015 Conference of the Parties (CoP) 21 Paris Agreement goals of 'holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels' was reaffirmed at CoP 28 in Dubai during December 2023. We specifically analysed third party forecasts stated, or interpreted by us, as being consistent with scenarios achieving the Paris 'well below 2\u00b0C goal' and/or '1.5\u00b0C ambition' and evaluated whether they presented contradictory audit evidence.\n- \u00b7 We assessed management's disclosures in Notes 1, including the sensitivity of forecast revenue cash inflows to lower oil and gas prices and how climate change and the energy transition, potential future emissions costs and/or reduced demand scenarios may impact bp to a greater extent than currently anticipated in bp's value-in-use estimates for oil and gas CGUs.\n\n## Discount rates\n\n- \u00b7 We independently evaluated bp's discount rates used in impairment tests with input from our valuation specialists, against relevant third party market and peer data.\n- \u00b7 When performing procedures over specific assets, we assessed whether specific country risks and tax adjustments were reasonably reflected in bp's discount rates.\n- \u00b7 We challenged and evaluated management's disclosures in Notes 1, including in relation to the sensitivity of discount rate assumptions.\n\n## Reserves and resources estimates\n\nWith the assistance of our oil and gas reserves specialists we:\n\n- \u00b7 assessed bp's reserves and resources estimation methods and policies for reasonableness\n- \u00b7 assessed how these policies had been applied to a sample of bp's reserves and resources estimates\n- \u00b7 read and evaluated a sample of reports provided by management's external reserves experts and assessed the scope of work and findings of these third parties\n- \u00b7 assessed the competence, capabilities and objectivity of bp's internal and external reserve experts, through understanding their relevant professional qualifications and experience\n- \u00b7 assessed whether management's production forecasts are consistent overall with bp's strategy, including the group's expectation to reduce its hydrocarbon production (by around 25% by 2030 relative to 2019 - see page 171)\n- \u00b7 compared the production forecasts used in the impairment tests with management's approved reserves and resources estimates and\n- \u00b7 performed a retrospective assessment in order to assess management's ability to accurately estimate reserves and resources and to check for indications of estimation bias over time.\n\n## 2.Decommissioning provisions - Notes 1 and 23\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nA decommissioning provision of $12.4 billion is recorded in the financial statements as at 31 December 2023. The estimation of decommissioning provisions is a highly judgemental area as it involves a number of key estimates related to the cost and timing of decommissioning, in particular inflation and discount rate assumptions. Given management expects upstream hydrocarbon production to be around 25% lower by 2030 relative to 2019 as stated on page 171, consistency of that expectation with the timing of decommissioning expenditure and underlying cost assumptions remains a key consideration.\n\nConsistent with prior years, management estimates that the average rate of forecast inflation applicable to the substantial majority of bp's decommissioning cost estimates is 1.5%, which is 0.5% lower than its estimated long term general inflation rate of 2%.",

Economic factors, future activities and the legislative environments that bp operates in are used to inform cost estimates, whereas the timing of decommissioning activities is dependent on cessation of production (CoP) dates, which are sensitive to changes in bp's price forecasts as price estimates determine economic cut off of oil and gas reserve estimates.\n\nbp increased its discount rate used in calculating its decommissioning provisions from 3.5% as at 31 December 2022 to 4.0% as at 31 December 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the increased US treasury bond rates.\n\nProvisions for decommissioning refining assets, not generally recognised on the basis that the potential obligations cannot be measured given their indeterminate settlement dates, might need to be recognised if reductions in demand due to climate change curtail their operational lives. As disclosed in Note 1 on page 184 management concluded that, although obligations may arise if refineries cease manufacturing operations, they would only be recognised at the point when sufficient information became available to determine potential settlement dates. Accordingly, other than where a decision has been made to cease refining operations, no triggers for assessing the need to record a decommissioning provision have been identified.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit\n\n## Long term Inflation rate\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the control related to the determination of the decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption.\n- \u00b7 We tested how management derived the decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption of 1.5%, and the evidence on which it is based, by gaining an understanding of the process used by management, testing management's calculations of the assumption, and evaluating the evidence relevant to management's assumption, both supporting and contradictory.\n- \u00b7 As the 1.5% decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption is determined by making an adjustment to management's 2.0% general long term inflation rate assumption, we evaluated the general long term inflation rate assumption used of 2.0%, comparing it against latest external market data.\n- \u00b7 We made inquiries and evaluated the competence, capabilities and objectivity, of management's decommissioning experts who derived the decommissioning specific inflation rate.\n- \u00b7 We inspected analyst forecasts and reports in respect of the future decommissioning market and related costs for evidence of supporting and contradictory evidence, with particular focus on the future rig market.\n- \u00b7 We particularly considered the expectation that demand for oil and gas products and related activities will decrease, primarily in response to climate change and energy transition effects pivoting future energy industry investment and development activity towards renewable sources. We challenged and evaluated management's assessment of the impact this will have on the decommissioning market and related inflation assumption.\n- \u00b7 We analysed historical trends of rig market rates against oil prices and historical inflation to challenge management's assumption that the decommissioning inflation assumption does not inflate at the same rate as general inflation.\n\n## Cost and timing estimates\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the controls over the year end decommissioning cost and timing assumptions used within management's decommissioning provision estimate.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the completeness and accuracy of the assets subject to decommissioning, including understanding the process to establish whether a legal or constructive obligation existed.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated changes in key cost assumptions including rig rates, vessel rates, well plug and abandonment duration and non-productive time assumptions.\n- \u00b7 We challenged whether the impact of inflation experienced in 2023 was appropriately considered and reflected where relevant within bp's cost assumptions.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the reasonableness of key cost assumptions with reference to internal and appropriate third party data.\n- \u00b7 We assessed changes in assumptions for the estimated date of decommissioning and evaluated whether CoP dates used for decommissioning estimation are aligned with CoP assumptions in other areas, including PP&E impairment testing and oil and gas reserve estimation.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the accuracy of bp's disclosure of the estimated undiscounted cost of its obligations and the timing of future decommissioning payments.\n\n## Discount rates\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the control related to the determination of the discount rate assumption.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the reasonableness of management's methodology for determining the discount rate and recalculated the discount rate with reference to independent third party data, most notably US treasury bond yields.\n\n## Potential decommissioning of refinery assets\n\n- \u00b7 We challenged and evaluated management's analysis which supported the judgement that no decommissioning provisions should be recognised in respect of refineries where there is ongoing activity and management has no current intention to cease these activities.\n- \u00b7 We have reviewed analysis undertaken by management, as well as third party studies, of forecast demand for refined products in regions served by bp's refineries. Furthermore, we read external profitability benchmarking which supported a conclusion that the group's remaining refineries would likely remain operational for longer than many of their regional competitors, in the event of refining capacity reductions.\n- \u00b7 We also met with refinery management to understand the potential plans under consideration for refineries in the future and obtained evidence that management is developing plans for the existing refinery sites remaining in the portfolio which would be compatible with net zero emissions, for instance through the production of alternative low carbon and sustainable fuels.",

Accounting for complex transactions executed to deliver against the wider group strategy - Notes 1, 20, 22, 29 and 30 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nTo support the overall group strategy, which includes achieving bp's 'net zero' target, bp is increasingly entering into long term arrangements that include gas and renewable power offtake/supply contracts in existing and new markets whilst providing solutions to bp's customers through offering lower carbon hydrocarbons. Given the nature of these transactions, we direct significant audit effort towards challenging management's adopted accounting treatment and/or valuation estimates.\n\nIn previous years, such activity was primarily carried out within the trading and shipping (T&S) function. However, such activity can also originate outside of T&S, across segments, functions and/or geographies but in close collaboration with T&S.\n\nThese transactions may be complex and have sustainability, legal, tax or financial reporting outcomes which are new for the group and may be executed in reference to, or in conjunction with, existing arrangements. Determining the appropriate accounting treatment for these transactions can require a high degree of management judgement.\n\n## Determining the appropriate accounting treatment for these complex transactions:\n\nBased on our risk assessment and understanding of the underlying business rationale of such transactions, we generally consider that complexity arises where the arrangements exhibit one or more of the following indicators:\n\n- \u00b7 Offtake/sale-purchase agreements where the group is the only key customer/supplier;\n- \u00b7 The counterparty or the arrangement depends on the group to provide a significant level of financing;\n- \u00b7 The group controls exclusive rights, licenses, technology, know-how etc. without which the counterparty cannot conduct its operations or the arrangement cannot be fulfilled;\n- \u00b7 The arrangement exposes the group to returns/losses which are disproportionate to those which its economic interest would suggest;\n- \u00b7 Contractual arrangements entered into in contemplation of each other; or\n- \u00b7 The transaction or arrangement directly impacts key performance indicators, in particular, finance debt.\n\nThe presence of any one or a combination of these indicators does not make a transaction or arrangement inherently complex but are factors we consider in our assessment of the risk arising from the transaction.\n\nAccounting for such transactions can be complex and can involve significant judgement, as a feature of these transactions is that they often include multiple elements that will have a material impact on the presentation and disclosure in the financial statements, including in particular the classification of liabilities as finance debt.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit\n\nFor complex accounting transactions identified during the year, we:\n\n- \u00b7 Tested controls related to the accounting for complex transactions.\n- \u00b7 Developed an understanding of the commercial rationale of the transactions through discussions with management and reading transaction documents and executed agreements.\n- \u00b7 For transactions exhibiting certain of the above indicators, performed a detailed accounting analysis leveraging the expertise of technical accounting specialists with experience in commodities markets.",

Valuation of commodity financial derivatives, where fraud risks may arise in revenue recognition - Notes 1, 29 and 30 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nbp's trading and shipping (T&S) function is responsible for globally trading and risk managing the group's owned as well as third party production. To discharge this responsibility, T&S regularly executes commodity contracts, physically settled or otherwise, which are accounted for as a derivative and fair valued under IFRS 9. These contracts, therefore, result in unrealised gains/losses that are recognised on account of fair value movements in the associated derivative assets and liabilities.\n\nDetermining the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities can be complex and subjective, particularly where the valuation is dependent on significant inputs which are not observable and are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy set out in IFRS 13. This degree of subjectivity also makes such fair value estimates prone to potential fraud by management incorporating bias in the inputs used in determining fair values. Given the significant judgements, sensitivity to management assumptions, and the absolute value associated with these positions, we have identified a risk in respect of certain financial instruments where the valuation is dependent on significant unobservable inputs.\n\nFair value measurements associated with unrealised commodity contracts are also impacted by the macroeconomic sentiment and outlook. In 2023, commodity markets remained relatively volatile due to continuing uncertainty resulting from the planned energy transition, macro-economic factors such as inflation and interest rates, and disruptions in global supply due to geopolitical conflicts. In response to the volatility observed, we focused our audit efforts on the valuation of all commodity derivatives and designed procedures specifically to test for management bias.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the group's total level 3 derivative financial assets were $9.2 billion and level 3 derivative financial liabilities were $7.1 billion.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit\n\nIn response to the above, we analysed the population of these instruments to assess the level of unobservability of the inputs used in their valuation and then further disaggregated the population into different risk populations which in turn drove the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nTo address the complexities associated with auditing the valuation of instruments dependent on significant unobservable inputs, we included valuation specialists with significant quantitative and modelling expertise to assist in performing our audit procedures. Our valuation audit included the following control and substantive procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the group's valuation controls including:\n- - the model certification control, which is designed to review a model's theoretical soundness and the appropriateness of its valuation methodology; and\n- - the independent price verification control, which is designed to review the appropriateness of valuation inputs that are not observable and are significant to the financial instrument's valuation.\n- \u00b7 We performed valuation testing procedures at interim and year-end balance sheet dates, including:\n- - comparing management's input assumptions against the expected assumptions of other market participants and observable market data;\n- - evaluating management's valuation methodologies against standard valuation practice and analysing whether a consistent framework is applied across the business period over period; and\n- - engaging our valuation specialists to challenge models, develop fair value estimates and evaluate consistency in management's modelling and input assumptions throughout the year.",

Impairment of E&A assets, investments in joint ventures and refinery PP&E as a consequence, among other things, of climate change and the energy transition - Notes 1, 4, 15 and 16\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nThe recoverability of certain of the group's $4.3 billion total exploration and appraisal (E&A) assets capitalised as at 31 December 2023 is potentially exposed to climate change and the global energy transition risk factors (see Note 15). This is because a greater number of E&A projects may not proceed as a consequence of the energy transition leading to lower forecast future oil and gas prices, and bp's intention to reduce its hydrocarbon production (by around 25% by 2030 relative to 2019 - see page 171). The determination of whether and when E&A costs should be written off, impaired, or retained on the balance sheet as E&A assets, remains complex and continues to require significant management judgement.\n\n## PP&E and Investment in joint ventures\n\nThe carrying value of bp's refining assets within PP&E may no longer be recoverable, due to changes in supply and demand which arise as a consequence of climate change and the energy transition. Management identified impairment indicators in respect of the Gelsenkirchen refinery during the year and as a result, an impairment test was performed to assess the recoverability of the refinery carrying value. As disclosed in Note 4 to the accounts on page 192, management has recorded an impairment charge of $1.3 billion in respect of the Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany, primarily driven by changes in economic assumptions.\n\nThere is also a risk that the carrying value of the group's investments in low carbon energy assets may no longer be recoverable due to an increase in the low carbon energy discount rate (the renewable power assets discount rate) as well as increased project development costs, which have been impacted by higher inflation and activity levels within the sector (as a result of the energy transition). These factors are adversely impacting the value of low carbon energy projects, impacting investment decisions. As a result, impairment tests(which include judgements in relation to the fair value of land and sea bed leases, capital and operating cost assumptions and forecast yield and power price assumptions) were performed to assess the recoverability of the group's low carbon energy assets, resulting in an impairment recognised by equity accounted entities of $1.3 billion, as disclosed in Note 16 to the accounts on page 208.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nA climate change steering committee comprising a group of senior partners and specialists with specific climate change and technical audit and accounting expertise within Deloitte was utilised to provide an independent challenge to our key decisions and conclusions with respect to this area.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nIn respect of the recoverability of E&A assets capitalised as at 31 December 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the relevant controls within the group's E&A write-off and impairment assessment processes.\n- \u00b7 We challenged and evaluated management's key E&A judgements with regards to the impairment criteria of IFRS 6. Where impairment indicators were identified we corroborated key judgements with internal and external evidence for assets that remained on the balance sheet. This included analysing evidence of future E&A plans, budgets and capital allocation decisions, assessing management's key accounting judgement papers, reading meeting minutes and assessing licence documentation and evidence of active dialogue with partners and regulators including negotiations to renew licences or modify key terms.\n\n## PP&E and Investment in joint ventures\n\nWe considered the impact of potential changes in supply and demand on the group's refining portfolio and assessed internal and external market studies of future supply and demand. In relation to the Gelsenkirchen refinery impairment test, we assessed the valuation methodology, tested the integrity and mechanical accuracy of the impairment model and assessed the appropriateness of key assumptions and inputs, notably forecast refining margins and energy input costs, challenging and evaluating management's assumptions by reference to third party data where available. We also evaluated management's ability to forecast future cash flows and margins by comparing actual results to historical forecasts and tested management's internal controls over the impairment test and related inputs.\n\nIn respect of the impairment tests performed on certain offshore wind asset low carbon energy investments, we tested the result by:\n\n- \u00b7 Testing the relevant controls over these low carbon energy impairment tests including controls over key assumptions and the discount rate\n- \u00b7 Assessing the low carbon energy discount rate with input from our valuation specialists\n- \u00b7 Challenging and evaluating the key assumptions within the impairment tests. This included the fair value of land and sea bed leases, capital and operating cost assumptions and forecast yield and power price assumptions impacting the fair value of the development project, and\n- \u00b7 Testing the mechanical accuracy of the impairment models.\n\n/s/ Deloitte LLP\n\nLondon United Kingdom 8\u00a0March 2024\n\nWe have served as bp's auditor since 2018.",

In our opinion, the group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2023, based on the criteria established in the UK FRC Guidance.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2023, of the group and our report dated 8 March 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\nAs described in management's report on internal control over financial reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at 'TravelCenters of America Inc.' (TCA) which was acquired on 15 May 2023. TCA's financial statements constitute 2.1% and 1.5% of net and total assets, respectively, 2.8% of 'Sales and other operating revenues', and 4% of 'profit (loss) for the year' of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended 31 December 2023. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at TCA.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nThe Group's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the group's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the group in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in  all  material  respects.  Our  audit  included  obtaining  an understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  and  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considered  necessary  in  the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A  company's  internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or  that  the  degree  of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Deloitte LLP London, United Kingdom 8\u00a0March 2024\n\n- 1.

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\n## Authorization of financial statements and statement of compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of BP p.l.c and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as bp or the group) were approved and signed by the chief executive officer and chairman on 8 March 2024 having been duly authorized to do so by the board of directors. BP p.l.c. is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and as adopted by the European Union (EU) and in accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under international accounting standards. IFRS as adopted by the UK does not differ from IFRS as adopted by the EU. IFRS as adopted by the UK and EU differs in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB. The differences have no impact on the group's consolidated financial statements for the years presented. The material accounting policy information and accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions of the group are set out below.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with IFRS and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations issued and effective for the year ended 31 December 2023. The accounting policies that follow have been consistently applied to all years presented, except where otherwise indicated.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest million dollars ($ million), except where otherwise indicated.\n\n## Material accounting policy information: use of judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nInherent in the application of many of the accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements is the need for bp management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. The accounting judgements and estimates that have a significant impact on the results of the group are set out in boxed text below, and should be read in conjunction with the information provided in the Notes on financial statements.\n\nThe areas requiring the most significant judgement and estimation in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are: accounting for the investments in Rosneft and Aker BP; exploration and appraisal intangible assets; the recoverability of asset carrying values, including the estimation of reserves; supplier financing arrangements; derivative financial instruments; provisions and contingencies; pensions and other post-retirement benefits; and taxation. Judgements and estimates, not all of which are significant, made in assessing the impact of the current economic and geopolitical environment, and climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy on the consolidated financial statements are also set out in boxed text below. Where an estimate has a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year this is specifically noted within the boxed text.",

These may have significant impacts on the currently reported amounts of the group's assets and liabilities discussed below and on similar assets and liabilities that may be recognized in the future. The group's assumptions for investment appraisal (see page 30) form part of an investment decision-making framework for currently unsanctioned future capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment, and intangibles including exploration and appraisal assets, that is designed to support the effective and resilient implementation of bp's strategy. The price assumptions used for investment appraisal include oil and gas price assumptions, which are producer prices and are therefore net of any future carbon prices that the purchaser may be required to pay, and an assumption of a single carbon emissions cost imposed on the producer in respect of operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon dioxide and methane) in order to incentivize engineering solutions to mitigate GHG emissions on projects. The group's oil and gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment testing are aligned with those investment appraisal assumptions. The assumptions for future carbon emissions costs in value-in-use impairment testing differ from the investment appraisal assumptions and are described below.\n\nManagement has also not identified any off-balance sheet commodity purchase obligations to be onerous contracts as result of the transition to a lower carbon economy at 31 December 2023.\n\n## Impairment of property, plant and equipment and goodwill\n\nThe energy transition is likely to impact the future prices of commodities such as oil and natural gas which in turn may affect the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and goodwill in the oil and gas industry. Management's best estimate of oil and natural gas price assumptions for value-inuse impairment testing were revised during 2023. Prices are disclosed in real 2022 terms. The near term Brent oil assumption was held constant at $70 per barrel to reflect near-term supply constraints before declining after 2030 to $50 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy system decarbonizes, falling oil demand will cause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2050 were held constant at $4.00 per mmBtu reflecting an assumption that declining domestic demand in the US is offset by higher LNG exports. The revised assumptions for Brent oil and Henry Hub gas sit within the range of external scenarios considered by management and are in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nAs noted above, the group's investment appraisal process includes a carbon emissions price series for the investment economics which is applied to bp's anticipated share of bp's forecast of the investment assets' scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions where they exceed defined thresholds, and is assumed to apply whether or not bp is the asset operator. However, for value-in-use impairment testing on bp's existing cash generating units (CGUs), consistent with all other relevant cash flows estimated, bp is required to reflect management's best estimate of any expected applicable carbon emission costs payable by bp, including where bp is not the operator, in the future for each jurisdiction in which the group has interests. This requires management's best estimate of how future changes to relevant carbon emission cost policies and/or legislation are likely to affect the future cash flows of the group's applicable CGUs, whether currently enacted or not. Future potential carbon pricing and/or costs of carbon emissions allowances are included in the value-in-use calculations to the extent management has sufficient information to make such an estimate. Currently this results in limited application of carbon price assumptions in value-in-use impairment tests given that carbon pricing legislation in most impacted jurisdictions where the group has interests is not in place and there is not sufficient information available as to the relevant policy makers' future intentions regarding carbon pricing to support an estimate. A key input into the determination of impairment is the assumption, aligned with bp's aim to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner, that the current recognized portfolio of oil and gas properties and refining assets will have an immaterial carrying value by 2050.",

        "page_content": "## 1 . Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nWhere we consider that the outcome of a value-in-use impairment test could be significantly affected by a carbon price in place in any jurisdiction, this is incorporated into the value-in use impairment testing cash flows. The most significant instances where a carbon price has been incorporated in the 2023 value-in-use impairment tests is for the UK North Sea and the Gelsenkirchen refinery. The assumptions for UK North Sea were \u00a345/tCO2e in 2024 gradually increasing to \u00a3201/tCO2e in 2050. The assumption applied for the Gelsenkirchen refinery was an average of approximately \u20ac72/tCO2e.\n\nHowever, as bp's forecast future prices are producer prices, the group considers it reasonable to assume that if, in addition to the costs already in place, further scope 1 and 2 emission costs were partially to be borne directly by oil and gas producers including bp in future and the prevalence of such costs were to become widespread, the gross oil and gas prices realized by producers would be correspondingly higher over the long term, resulting in no expected overall materially negative impacts on the group's net cash flows. See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values for further information including sensitivity analysis in relation to reasonably possible changes in the price assumptions and carbon costs.\n\nProduction assumptions within upstream property, plant and equipment and goodwill value-in-use impairment tests reflect management's current best estimate of future production of the existing upstream portfolio. The group sees the expected reduction in upstream hydrocarbon production by around 25% by 2030 from its 2019 baseline (see page 13) being achieved through future active management, including divestments, and high-grading of the portfolio. Changes in upstream production since 2019 will be included in the best estimate to the extent the divestments have been announced or completed however, as the specific future changes to the remainder of the portfolio are not yet known, the current best estimate used for accounting purposes does not include the full extent of the expected upstream production reduction. See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and Note 14 for sensitivity analyses in relation to reasonably possible changes in production for upstream oil and gas properties and goodwill respectively.\n\nImpairment charges were recognized on certain upstream oil and gas properties partly as a result of price and discount rate changes. See Note 4 for further information.\n\nFor the customers & products segment, though the energy transition may impact demand for certain refined products in the future, management anticipates sufficiently robust demand for the remainder of each refinery's useful life.\n\nManagement will continue to review price assumptions as the energy transition progresses and this may result in impairment charges or reversals in the future.\n\n## Exploration and appraisal intangible assets\n\nThe energy transition may affect the future development or viability of exploration prospects. The recoverability of the group's exploration and appraisal intangible assets was considered during 2023. No significant write-offs were identified. These assets will continue to be assessed as the energy transition progresses. See significant judgement: exploration and appraisal intangible assets and Note 8 for further information.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment - depreciation and expected useful lives\n\nThe energy transition may curtail the expected useful lives of oil and gas industry assets thereby accelerating depreciation charges. However, a significant majority of bp's existing upstream oil and natural gas properties are likely to have immaterial carrying values within the next 12 years and, as outlined in bp's strategy, oil and natural gas production will remain an important part of bp's business activities over that period. The significant majority of refining assets, recognized on the group's balance sheet at 31 December 2023 that are subject to depreciation, will be depreciated within the next 12 years; demand for refined products is expected to remain sufficient to support the remaining useful lives of existing assets. Therefore, management does not expect the useful lives of bp's reported property, plant and equipment to change and do not consider this to be a significant accounting judgement or estimate. Significant capital expenditure is still required for ongoing projects as well as renewal and/or replacement of aged assets and therefore the useful lives of future capital expenditure may be different. See material accounting policy: property, plant and equipment for more information.\n\n## Provisions: decommissioning\n\nThe energy transition may bring forward the decommissioning of oil and gas industry assets thereby increasing the present value of associated decommissioning provisions. The majority of bp's existing upstream oil and gas properties are expected to start decommissioning within the next two decades. The group's expectation to reduce its upstream hydrocarbon production by around 25% by 2030 from its 2019 baseline (see page 13) is expected to be achieved through future active management, including divestments, and high-grading of the portfolio. Any resulting increases or decreases to the weighted average timing of decommissioning will be driven by the profile of assets held in the revised portfolio. Currently, the expected timing of decommissioning expenditures for the upstream oil and gas assets in the group's portfolio has not materially been brought forward. Management does not expect a reasonably possible change of two years in the expected timing of all decommissioning to have a material effect on the upstream decommissioning provisions, assuming cost assumptions remain unchanged.\n\nDecommissioning cost estimates are based on the known regulatory and external environment. These cost estimates may change in the future, including as a result of the transition to a lower carbon economy. For refineries, decommissioning provisions are generally not recognized as the associated obligations have indeterminate settlement dates, typically driven by the cessation of manufacturing. Management does not expect manufacturing to cease at refineries within a determinate period of time, as existing property, plant and equipment is expected to be renewed or replaced.  Management will continue to review facts and circumstances to assess if decommissioning provisions need to be recognized. Decommissioning provisions relating to refineries at 31 December 2023 are not material. See significant judgements and estimates: provisions for further information.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of the geopolitical and economic environment\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the following areas involving judgement and estimates were identified as most relevant with regards to the impact of the current geopolitical and economic environment.\n\n## Oil and gas price assumptions\n\nOil and gas price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing have been updated to reflect the current outlook on Brent oil supply constraints and an assumption that declining domestic natural gas demand in the US is offset by higher LNG exports. See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values for further information.\n\n## Discount rate assumptions\n\nThe discount rates used for impairment testing and provisions were reassessed during the year in light of changing economic and geopolitical outlooks. The nominal discount rate applied to provisions was increased during the year to reflect higher US Treasury yields. The principal impact of this rate increase was a $0.9 billion decrease in the decommissioning provision with an associated decrease in the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment of $0.7 billion and a pre-tax credit to the income statement of $0.2 billion. Impairment discount rates were also increased from those reported in 2022. See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and provisions for further information.\n\n## Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nThe volatility in the financial markets during 2023 impacted the assumptions used for determining the fair value of plan assets and the present value of defined benefit obligations in the group's defined benefit pension plans. See significant estimate: pensions and other post-retirement benefits and Note 24 for further information.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of BP p.l.c. and its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, including when control is obtained via potential voting rights, and continue to be consolidated until the date that control ceases.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. Intra-group balances and transactions, including unrealized profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated. Unrealized losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to bp shareholders. Included within noncontrolling interests are perpetual subordinated hybrid securities issued by subsidiaries and for which the group has the unconditional right to avoid transferring cash or another financial asset to the holders. Profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders is adjusted to reflect the coupon/interest related to these hybrid securities whether or not such distribution has been deferred.\n\n## Interests in other entities\n\n## Business combinations and goodwill\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair values at the acquisition date.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount recognized for any non-controlling interest and the acquisition-date fair values of any previously held interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The amount recognized for any non-controlling interest is measured at the present ownership's proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. At the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, expected to benefit from the combination's synergies. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill arising on business combinations prior to 1 January 2003 is stated at the previous carrying amount under UK generally accepted accounting practice, less subsequent impairments.\n\nGoodwill may arise upon investments in joint ventures and associates, being the surplus of the cost of investment over the group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities. Any such goodwill is recorded within the corresponding investment in joint ventures and associates.\n\nGoodwill may also arise upon acquisition of interests in joint operations that meet the definition of a business. The amount of goodwill separately recognized is the excess of the consideration transferred over the group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities.\n\n## Interests in joint arrangements\n\nThe results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting as described below.\n\nCertain of the group's activities, particularly in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments, are conducted through joint operations. bp recognizes, on a line-by-line basis in the consolidated financial statements, its share of the assets, liabilities and expenses of these joint operations incurred jointly with the other partners, along with the group's revenue from the sale of its share of the output and any liabilities and expenses that the group has incurred in relation to the joint operation.\n\nFor joint arrangements in a separate entity, judgement may be required as to whether the arrangement should be classified as a joint venture or if the legal form, contractual arrangements or other facts and circumstances indicate that the group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the arrangement, rather than rights to the net assets, and therefore should be classified as a joint operation. No such judgement made by the group is considered significant.\n\n## Interests in associates\n\nThe results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting as described below.",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\n## 1 . Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Significant judgement: investment in Aker BP\n\nJudgement is required in assessing the level of control or influence over another entity in which the group holds an interest. For bp, the judgement that the group has significant influence over Aker BP, a Norwegian oil and gas company, is significant.\n\nAs a consequence of this judgement, bp uses the equity method of accounting for its investment and bp's share of Aker BP's oil and natural gas reserves is included in the group's estimated net proved reserves of equity-accounted entities. If significant influence was not present, the investment would be accounted for as an investment in an equity instrument measured at fair value as described under 'Financial assets' below and no share of Aker BP's oil and natural gas reserves would be reported.\n\nSignificant influence is defined in IFRS as the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control of those decisions. Significant influence is presumed when an entity owns 20% or more of the voting power of the investee. Significant influence is presumed not to be present when an entity owns less than 20% of the voting power of the investee.\n\nbp owned 15.9% of the voting shares at 31 December 2023. bp's group chief executive officer, Murray Auchincloss, has been a member of the Aker BP board since 2017. bp's other nominated director, group chief financial officer, Kate Thomson, has been a member of the Aker BP board since formation of that company in 2016. She is also a member of the Aker BP board's Audit and Risk Committee. bp also holds the voting rights at general meetings of shareholders conferred by its stake in Aker BP. bp's management considers, therefore, that the group continues to have significant influence at 31 December 2023.\n\n## Significant judgements and estimate: investment in Rosneft\n\nSince the first quarter 2022, bp accounts for its interest in Rosneft and its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia, as financial assets measured at fair value within 'Other investments'. bp is not able to sell its Rosneft shares on the Moscow Stock Exchange and is unable to ascribe probabilities to possible outcomes of any exit process. It is considered by management that any measure of fair value, other than nil, would be subject to such high measurement uncertainty, considering the sanctions and restrictions implemented by Russia on Russian assets held by foreign investors, that no estimate would provide useful information even if it were accompanied by a description of the estimate made in producing it and an explanation of the uncertainties that affect the estimate. Accordingly, it is not currently possible to estimate any carrying value other than zero when determining the measurement of the interest in Rosneft and the other businesses with Rosneft within Russia as at 31 December 2023. Events or outcomes within the next financial year, that are different to those outlined above, could materially change the fair value of the investment.\n\nRussia has imposed restrictions on the payments of dividends to certain foreign shareholders, including those based in the UK, requiring such dividends to be paid in roubles into restricted bank accounts and a requirement for approval of the Russian government for transfers from any such bank accounts out of Russia. Given the restrictions applicable to such accounts, management has made the significant judgement that the criteria for recognizing any dividend income from Rosneft and its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia, for the years to 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2023 have not been met.\n\n## The equity method of accounting\n\nUnder the equity method, an investment is carried on the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the group's share of net assets of the entity, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of the investment. Loans advanced to equity-accounted entities that have the characteristics of equity financing are also included in the investment on the group balance sheet. The group income statement reflects the group's share of the results after tax of the equity-accounted entity, adjusted to account for depreciation, amortization and any impairment of the equity-accounted entity's assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. The group statement of comprehensive income includes the group's share of the equityaccounted entity's other comprehensive income. The group's share of amounts recognized directly in equity by an equity-accounted entity is recognized in the group's statement of changes in equity.\n\nFinancial statements of equity-accounted entities are typically prepared for the same reporting year as the group. Where material differences arise in the accounting policies used by the equity-accounted entity and those used by bp, adjustments are made to those financial statements to bring the accounting policies used into line with those of the group. Unrealized gains on transactions, apart from those that meet the definition of a derivative, between the group and its equity-accounted entities are eliminated to the extent of the group's interest in the equity-accounted entity. This includes unrealized gains arising on contribution of a business on formation of an equity-accounted entity.\n\n## Segmental reporting\n\nThe group's operating segments are established on the basis of those components of the group that are evaluated regularly by the chief executive officer, bp's chief operating decision maker, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\n\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the group's accounting policies described in this note, except that IFRS requires that the measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker. For bp, this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit before interest and tax which reflects the replacement cost of inventories sold in the period and is arrived at by excluding inventory holding gains and losses from profit before interest and tax. Replacement cost profit for the group is not a recognized measure under IFRS.\n\nFor further information see Note 5.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nIn individual subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of those entities at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Any resulting exchange differences are included in the income statement, unless hedge accounting is applied. Non-monetary items, other than those measured at fair value, are not retranslated subsequent to initial recognition.",

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates, and related goodwill, are translated into US dollars at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. The results and cash flows of non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into US dollars using average rates of exchange. In the consolidated financial statements, exchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into US dollars are recognized in a separate component of equity and reported in other comprehensive income. Exchange gains and losses arising on long-term intra-group foreign currency borrowings used to finance the group's non-US dollar investments are also reported in other comprehensive income if the borrowings form part of the net investment in the subsidiary, joint venture or associate. On disposal or for certain partial disposals of a non-US dollar functional currency subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the related accumulated exchange gains and losses recognized in equity are reclassified from equity to the income statement.\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\nSignificant non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification as held for sale, and actions required to complete the plan of sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortized, and equity accounting of associates and joint ventures is ceased once classified as held for sale.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets, other than goodwill, include expenditure on the exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural gas resources, biogas rights agreements, digital assets, patents, licences and trademarks and are stated at the amount initially recognized, less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nIntangible assets are carried initially at cost unless acquired as part of a business combination. Any such asset is measured at fair value at the date of the business combination and is recognized separately from goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights.\n\nIntangible assets with a finite life, other than capitalized exploration and appraisal costs as described below, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. For patents, licences and trademarks, expected useful life is the shorter of the duration of the legal agreement and economic useful life, and can range from three to fifteen years. The expected useful life of biogas rights agreements is the shorter of the duration of the legal agreement and economic useful life and can be up to 50 years. Digital asset costs generally have a useful life of three to five years.\n\nThe expected useful lives of assets and the amortization method are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives or the amortization method are accounted for prospectively.\n\n## Oil and natural gas exploration and appraisal expenditure\n\nOil and natural gas exploration and appraisal expenditure is accounted for using the principles of the successful efforts method of accounting as described below.\n\n## Licence and property acquisition costs\n\nExploration licence and leasehold property acquisition costs are capitalized within intangible assets and are reviewed at each reporting date to confirm that there is no indication that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. This review includes confirming that exploration drilling is still under way or planned or that it has been determined, or work is under way to determine, that the discovery is economically viable based on a range of technical and commercial considerations, and sufficient progress is being made on establishing development plans and timing. If no future activity is planned, the remaining balance of the licence and property acquisition costs is written off. Lower value licences are pooled and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of exploration. Upon internal approval for development and recognition of proved or sanctioned probable reserves of oil and natural gas, the relevant expenditure is transferred to property, plant and equipment.\n\n## Exploration and appraisal expenditure\n\nGeological and geophysical exploration costs are recognized as an expense as incurred. Costs directly associated with an exploration well are initially capitalized as an intangible asset until the drilling of the well is complete and the results have been evaluated. These costs include employee remuneration, materials and fuel used, rig costs and payments made to contractors. If potentially commercial quantities of hydrocarbons are not found, the exploration well costs are written off. If hydrocarbons are found and, subject to further appraisal activity, are likely to be capable of commercial development, the costs continue to be carried as an asset. If it is determined that development will not occur, that is, the efforts are not successful, then the costs are expensed.\n\nCosts directly associated with appraisal activity undertaken to determine the size, characteristics and commercial potential of a reservoir following the initial discovery of hydrocarbons, including the costs of appraisal wells where hydrocarbons were not found, are initially capitalized as an intangible asset. Upon internal approval for development and recognition of proved or sanctioned probable reserves, the relevant expenditure is transferred to property, plant and equipment. If development is not approved and no further activity is expected to occur, then the costs are expensed.\n\nThe determination of whether potentially economic oil and natural gas reserves have been discovered by an exploration well is usually made within one year of well completion, but can take longer, depending on the complexity of the geological structure. Exploration wells that discover potentially economic quantities of oil and natural gas and are in areas where major capital expenditure (e.g. an offshore platform or a pipeline) would be required before production could begin, and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends on the successful completion of further exploration or appraisal work in the area, remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as such work is under way or firmly planned.",

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Significant judgement: exploration and appraisal intangible assets\n\nJudgement is required to determine whether it is appropriate to continue to carry costs associated with exploration wells and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells on the balance sheet. This includes costs relating to exploration licences or leasehold property acquisitions. It is not unusual to have such costs remaining suspended on the balance sheet for several years while additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and natural gas field is performed or while the optimum development plans and timing are established. The costs are carried based on the current regulatory and political environment or any known changes to that environment. All such carried costs are subject to regular technical, commercial and management review on at least an annual basis to confirm the continued intent to develop, or otherwise extract value from, the discovery. Where this is no longer the case, the costs are immediately expensed.\n\nThe carrying amount of capitalized costs are included in Note 8.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment owned by the group is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the initial estimate of any decommissioning obligation, if applicable, and, for assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, directly attributable general or specific finance costs. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.\n\nExpenditure on major maintenance refits or repairs comprises the cost of replacement assets or parts of assets, inspection costs and overhaul costs. Where an asset or part of an asset that was separately depreciated is replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group, the expenditure is capitalized and the carrying amount of the replaced asset is derecognized. Inspection costs associated with major maintenance programmes are capitalized and amortized over the period to the next inspection. Overhaul costs for major maintenance programmes, and all other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nExpenditure on the construction, installation and completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of development wells, including service and unsuccessful development or delineation wells, is capitalized within property, plant and equipment and is depreciated from the commencement of production.\n\nOil and natural gas properties, including certain related pipelines, are depreciated using a unit-of-production method. The cost of producing wells is amortized over proved developed reserves. Licence acquisition, common facilities and future decommissioning costs are amortized over total proved reserves. The unit-of-production rate for the depreciation of common facilities takes into account expenditures incurred to date, together with estimated future capital expenditure expected to be incurred relating to as yet undeveloped reserves expected to be processed through these common facilities. Information on the carrying amounts of the group's oil and natural gas properties, together with the amounts recognized in the income statement as depreciation, depletion and amortization is contained in Note 12 and Note 5 respectively.\n\nEstimates of oil and natural gas reserves determined in accordance with US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, including the application of prices using 12-month historical price data in assessing the commerciality of technical volumes, are typically used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization charges for the group's oil and gas properties. Therefore, where this approach is adopted, charges are not dependent on management forecasts of future oil and gas prices.\n\nHowever, for certain oil and natural gas assets, the use of reserves determined in accordance with SEC regulations would result in a charge that is not reflective of the pattern in which the future economic benefits are expected to be consumed. In these limited instances other approaches are applied to determine the reserves base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization, including the use of management's best estimate of price assumptions as disclosed in Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values, to determine the commerciality of technical proved reserves.\n\nThe impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortizing the remaining carrying value of the asset over the expected future production.\n\nThe estimation of oil and natural gas reserves and bp's process to manage reserves bookings is described in Supplementary information on oil and natural gas on page 247, which is unaudited. Details on bp's proved reserves and production compliance and governance processes are provided on page 346. The 2023 movements in proved reserves are reflected in the tables showing movements in oil and natural gas reserves by region in Supplementary information on oil and natural gas (unaudited) on page 247.\n\nOther property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life. The typical useful lives of the group's other property, plant and equipment on initial recognition are as follows:\n\n| Land improvements     | 15 to 25 years   |\n|-----------------------|------------------|\n| Buildings             | 20 to 50 years   |\n| Refineries            | 20 to 30 years   |\n| Pipelines             | 10 to 50 years   |\n| Service stations      | 15 years         |\n| Office equipment      | 3 to 10 years    |\n| Fixtures and fittings | 5 to 15 years    |\n\nThe expected useful lives and depreciation method of property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives or the depreciation method are accounted for prospectively. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the income statement in the period in which the item is derecognized.",

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and equity-accounted entities\n\nThe group assesses assets or groups of assets, called cash-generating units (CGUs), for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or CGU may not be recoverable; for example, changes in the group's business plans, plans to dispose rather than retain assets, changes in the group's assumptions about discount rates, commodity prices, low plant utilization, evidence of physical damage or, for oil and gas assets, significant downward revisions of estimated reserves or increases in estimated future development expenditure or decommissioning costs. If any such indication of impairment exists, the group makes an estimate of the asset's or CGU's recoverable amount. Individual assets are grouped into CGUs for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other groups of assets. A CGU's recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If it is probable that the value of the CGU will be primarily recovered through a disposal transaction, the expected disposal proceeds are considered in determining the recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the CGU is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.\n\nThe business segment plans, which are approved on an annual basis by senior management, are the primary source of information for the determination of value in use. They contain forecasts for oil and natural gas production, power generation, refinery throughputs, sales volumes for various types of refined products (e.g. gasoline and lubricants), revenues, costs and capital expenditure. Carbon taxes and costs of emissions allowances are included in estimates of future cash flows, where applicable, based on the regulatory environment in each jurisdiction in which the group operates. As an initial step in the preparation of these plans, various assumptions regarding market conditions, such as oil prices, natural gas prices, power prices, refining margins, refined product margins and cost inflation rates are set by senior management. These assumptions take account of existing prices, global supply-demand equilibrium for oil and natural gas, other macroeconomic factors and historical trends and variability. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are adjusted for the risks specific to the asset group to the extent that they are not already reflected in the discount rate and are discounted to their present value typically using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.\n\nFair value less costs of disposal is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants and does not reflect the effects of factors that may be specific to the group and not applicable to entities in general. Fair value may be determined by reference to agreed or expected sales proceeds, recent market transactions for similar assets or using discounted cash flow analyses. Where discounted cash flow analyses are used to calculate fair value less costs of disposal, estimates are made about the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset, CGU or group of CGUs containing goodwill and the test is performed on a post-tax basis.\n\nAn assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's or CGU's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the lower of its recoverable amount and the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or CGU in prior years. Impairment reversals are recognized in profit or loss. After a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset's or CGU's revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.\n\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the recoverable amount of the group of CGUs to which the goodwill relates should be assessed. In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is compared with its recoverable amount. Where the recoverable amount of the group of CGUs is less than the carrying amount (including goodwill), an impairment loss is recognized. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.\n\nThe group assesses investments in equity-accounted entities for impairment whenever there is objective evidence that the investment is impaired, after recognizing its share of any losses of the equity-accounted entity itself. If any such objective evidence of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is compared with its recoverable amount, being the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the investment is written down to its recoverable amount.",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\n## 1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values\n\nDetermination as to whether, and by how much, an asset, CGU, or group of CGUs containing goodwill is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as the effects of inflation and deflation on operating expenses, discount rates, capital expenditure, carbon pricing (where applicable), production profiles, reserves and resources, and future commodity prices, including the outlook for global or regional market supply-anddemand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, power and refined products. Judgement is required when determining the appropriate grouping of assets into a CGU or the appropriate grouping of CGUs for impairment testing purposes. For example, individual oil and gas properties may form separate CGUs whilst certain oil and gas properties with shared infrastructure may be grouped together to form a single CGU. Alternative groupings of assets or CGUs may result in a different outcome from impairment testing. See Note 14 for details on how these groupings have been determined in relation to the impairment testing of goodwill.\n\nAs described above, the recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Fair value less costs of disposal may be determined based on expected sales proceeds or similar recent market transaction data.\n\nDetails of impairment charges and reversals recognized in the income statement are provided in Note 4 and details on the carrying amounts of assets are shown in Note 12, Note 14 and Note 15.\n\nThe estimates for assumptions made in impairment tests in 2023 relating to discount rates and oil and gas properties are discussed below. Changes in the economic environment including as a result of the energy transition or other facts and circumstances may necessitate revisions to these assumptions and could result in a material change to the carrying values of the group's assets within the next financial year.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nFor discounted cash flow calculations, future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the CGU. Value-in-use calculations are typically discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based upon the cost of funding the group derived from an established model, adjusted to a pre-tax basis and incorporating a market participant capital structure and country risk premiums. Fair value less costs of disposal discounted cash flow calculations use a post-tax discount rate.\n\nThe discount rates applied in impairment tests are reassessed each year and, in 2023, the post-tax discount rate was 8% (2022 7%) other than for renewable power assets. Where the CGU is located in a country that was judged to be higher risk, an additional premium of 1% to 4% was reflected in the post-tax discount rate (2022 1% to 2%). The judgement of classifying a country as higher risk and the applicable premium takes into account various economic and geopolitical factors. The pre-tax discount rate, other than for renewable power assets, typically ranged from 9% to 20% (2022 7% to 18%) depending on the risk premium and applicable tax rate in the geographic location of the CGU. For renewable power assets tested on a value-in-use basis in 2023 (including those in equity accounted entities), where the risk profile of expected cash flows supports a lower rate, tests were performed using a post-tax WACC-based discount rate of 6.5%. For assets tested in 2022, the tests  were performed on a fair value less costs of disposal basis using a post-tax cost of equity-based discount rate of 6%.\n\n## Oil and natural gas properties\n\nFor oil and natural gas properties in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments, expected future cash flows are estimated using management's best estimate of future oil and natural gas prices, production and reserves and certain resources volumes. Forecast cash flows include the impact of all approved emission reduction projects. The estimated future level of production in all impairment tests is based on assumptions about future commodity prices, production and development costs, field decline rates, current fiscal regimes and other factors.\n\nIn 2023, the group identified oil and gas properties in these segments with carrying amounts totalling $18,374 million (2022 $11,652 million) where the headroom, based on the most recent impairment test performed in the year on those assets, was less than or equal to 20% of the carrying value. A change in the discount rate, reserves, resources or the oil and gas price assumptions in the next financial year may result in a recoverable amount of one or more of these assets above or below the current carrying amount and therefore there is a risk of impairment reversals or charges in that period. Management considers that reasonably possible changes in the discount rate or forecast revenue, arising from a change in oil and natural gas prices and/or production could result in a material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year, see Sensitivity analyses, below.\n\nThe recoverability of intangible exploration and appraisal expenditure is covered under Oil and natural gas exploration, appraisal and development expenditure above.\n\n## Oil and natural gas prices\n\nThe price assumptions used for value-in-use impairment testing are based on those used for investment appraisal. bp's carbon emissions cost assumptions and their interrelationship with oil and gas prices are described in 'Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy' on page 170. The investment appraisal price assumptions are recommended by the senior vice president economic & energy insights after considering a range of external price sets, and supply and demand profiles associated with various energy transition scenarios. They are reviewed and approved by management. As a result of the current uncertainty over the pace of transition to lower-carbon supply and demand and the social, political and environmental actions that will be taken to meet the goals of the Paris climate change agreement, the scenarios considered include those where those goals are met as well as those where they are not met.\n\nDuring the year, bp's price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing (in real 2022 terms) for the near term Brent oil assumption was held constant at $70 per barrel to reflect near term supply constraints before declining after 2030 to $50 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy system decarbonizes, falling oil demand will cause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2050 were held constant at $4.00 per mmBtu reflecting an assumption that declining domestic demand in the US is offset by higher LNG exports. These price assumptions are derived from the central case investment appraisal assumptions, adjusted where applicable to reflect short-term market conditions (see page 30). A summary of the group's revised price assumptions for Brent oil and Henry Hub gas, applied in 2023 and 2022, in real 2022 terms, is provided below. The assumptions represent management's best estimate of future prices at the balance sheet date, which sit within the range of external scenarios considered as appropriate for the purpose. They are considered by bp to be in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. However, they do not correspond to any specific Paris-consistent scenario. An inflation rate of 2% (2022 2%) is applied to determine the price assumptions in nominal terms.\n\nThe majority of bp's reserves and resources that support the carrying value of the group's existing oil and gas properties are expected to be produced over the next 12 years.\n\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets is also affected by the group's oil and natural gas price assumptions as these could impact the estimate of future taxable profits.

Strong US tight oil supply and non-OPEC+ supply more than offset OPEC+ pledged additional output reductions. Global oil demand continued its recovery, increasing by 2.4% in 2023. Chinese demand growth was unexpectedly strong making up 75% of total oil demand growth, with the rest coming from other non-OECD countries. Brent dropped by nearly $20 per barrel in 2023 as oil markets recovered from the shocks in 2022 and supply/demand was balanced. bp's long term view is for a more stable market in 2024 as the price responsiveness of shale activity, OPEC+ discipline and ample spare capacity limits the scope for large movements, even with the political tensions in the Middle East. bp's longterm assumption for oil prices is lower than the 2023 price average, based on the judgement that, in the long term, oil demand is likely to fall so that the price levels needed to encourage sufficient investment to meet declining global oil demand is also lower.\n\nUS gas prices in 2023 decreased around 60% compared to 2022, to $2.5 per mmbtu. Prices fell as gas production growth outpaced demand. Milder than normal winter weather and an extended outage at Freeport LNG left US gas storage stocks well above historic average levels at the end of winter 2022/2023. Henry Hub prices fell during the summer which incentivized coal-to-gas switching in the power sector, and hot weather in the third-quarter helped the market avoid storage containment issues. Meanwhile gas production continued to grow, reaching record levels by the end of 2023 despite a 20% decrease in gas rigs over the first half of the year. Growth was supported by strong associated gas production as well as pipeline de-bottlenecking. Finally, mild weather in the fourth-quarter further loosened balances and storage stocks exited the year 13% above five-year average levels. The level of US gas prices in 2023 is below bp's long term price assumption based on the judgment of the price level required to incentivize new production.\n\n## Oil and natural gas reserves\n\nIn addition to oil and natural gas prices, significant technical and commercial assessments are required to determine the group's estimated oil and natural gas reserves. Reserves estimates are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity and drilling of new wells all impact on the determination of the group's estimates of its oil and natural gas reserves. bp bases its reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.\n\nReserves assumptions for value-in-use tests reflect the reserves and resources that management currently intend to develop. The recoverable amount of oil and gas properties is determined using a combination of inputs including reserves, resources and production volumes. Risk factors may be applied to reserves and resources which do not meet the criteria to be treated as proved or probable.\n\n## Sensitivity analyses\n\nManagement considers discount rates, oil and natural gas prices and production to be the key sources of estimation uncertainty in determining the recoverable amount of upstream oil and gas assets. The sensitivity analyses below, in addition to covering the key sources of estimation uncertainty, also indicate how the energy transition, potential future carbon emissions costs for operational GHG emissions and/or reduced demand for oil and gas may further impact forecast revenue cash inflows to a greater extent than currently anticipated in the group's value-in-use estimates for oil and gas CGUs, if carbon emissions costs were to be implemented as a deduction against revenue cash flows. The analyses therefore represent a net revenue sensitivity.\n\nA change in net revenue from upstream oil and gas properties can arise either due to changes in oil and natural gas prices, carbon emissions costs/ carbon prices, changes in oil and natural gas production, or a combination of these.\n\nManagement tested the impact of changes in net revenue cash flows in value-in-use impairment testing under the following sensitivity analyses: an increase in net revenues of 8% in all years up to 2040, and 25% in all remaining years to 2050; and a decrease in net revenues of 20% in all years up to 2030, 35% in all subsequent years to 2040 and 50% in all remaining years to 2050.\n\nNet revenue reductions of this magnitude in isolation could indicatively lead to a reduction in the carrying amount of bp's currently held upstream oil and gas properties in the range of $16-17 billion which is approximately 23-24% of the net book value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2023. If this net revenue reduction was due to reductions in prices in isolation, it reflects an indicative decrease in the carrying amount of using price assumptions for Brent oil trending broadly towards the bottom of the range of prices associated with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) 'family' of scenarios considered to be consistent with limiting global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. This 'family' of scenarios is also used in bp's TCFD scenario analysis (see page 55).\n\nNet revenue increases of this magnitude in isolation could indicatively lead to an increase in the carrying amount of bp's currently held upstream oil and gas properties in the range of $2-3 billion which is approximately 3-4% of the net book value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2023. This potential increase in the carrying amount would arise due to reversals of previously recognized impairments and represents approximately one third of the total impairment reversal capacity available at 31 December 2023. If this net revenue increase was due to increases in prices in isolation, it reflects an indicative increase in the carrying amount of using price assumptions for Brent oil trending broadly towards the top end until 2040, and then towards the mean average at 2050, of the range of prices associated with the WBCSD 'family' of scenarios considered to be consistent with limiting global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. This 'family' of scenarios is also used in bp's TCFD scenario analysis.",

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nThese sensitivity analyses do not, however, represent management's best estimate of any impairment charges or reversals that might be recognized as they do not fully incorporate consequential changes that may arise, such as changes in costs and business plans and phasing of development. For example, costs across the industry are more likely to decrease as oil and natural gas prices fall. The analyses also assume the impact of increases in carbon price on operational GHG emissions are fully absorbed as a decrease in net revenue (and vice versa) rather than reflecting how carbon prices or other carbon emissions costs may ultimately be incorporated by the market. The above sensitivity analyses therefore do not reflect a linear relationship between net revenue and value that can be extrapolated. The interdependency of these inputs and factors plus the diverse characteristics of the group's upstream oil and gas properties limits the practicability of estimating the probability or extent to which the overall recoverable amount is impacted by changes to the price assumptions or production volumes.\n\nManagement also tested the impact of a one percentage point change in the discount rate used for value-in-use impairment testing of upstream oil and gas properties. This level of change reflects past experience of a reasonable change in rate that could arise within the next financial year. If the discount rate was one percentage point higher across all tests performed, the net impairment loss recognized in 2023 would have been approximately $0.8 billion higher. If the discount rate was one percentage point lower, the net impairment loss recognized would have been approximately $0.9 billion lower.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nIrrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, bp is required to test annually for impairment of goodwill acquired in business combinations. The group carries goodwill of $12.5 billion on its balance sheet (2022 $12.0 billion), principally relating to the Atlantic Richfield, Burmah Castrol, Devon Energy and Reliance transactions. Of this, $7.0 billion relates to goodwill in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments (2022 $7.2 billion), for which oil and gas price and production assumptions are key sources of estimation uncertainty. Sensitivities and additional information relating to impairment testing of goodwill in these segments are provided in Note 14.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, other than inventories held for short-term trading purposes, are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is typically determined by the first-in first-out method and comprises direct purchase costs, cost of production, transportation and manufacturing expenses. Net realizable value is determined by reference to prices existing at the balance sheet date, adjusted where the sale of inventories after the reporting period gives evidence about their net realizable value at the end of the period.\n\nInventories held for short-term trading purposes are stated at fair value less costs to sell and any changes in fair value are recognized in the income statement.\n\nSupplies are valued at the lower of cost on a weighted-average basis and net realizable value.\n\n## Leases\n\nAgreements that convey the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration are accounted for as leases. The right to control is conveyed if bp has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from, and the right to direct the use of, the identified asset throughout the period of use. An asset is identified if it is explicitly or implicitly specified by the agreement and any substitution rights held by the lessor over the asset are not considered substantive.\n\nAgreements that convey the right to control the use of an intangible asset including rights to explore for or use hydrocarbons are not accounted for as leases. See material accounting policy information: intangible assets.\n\nA lease liability is recognized on the balance sheet on the lease commencement date at the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate applied is the rate implicit in the lease if readily determinable, otherwise an incremental borrowing rate is used. For the majority of the leases in the group, there is not sufficient information available to readily determine the rate implicit in the lease, and therefore the incremental borrowing rate is used . The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on factors such as the group's cost of borrowing, lessee legal entity credit risk, currency and lease term. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of a lease together with any periods covered by an extension option that bp is reasonably certain to exercise, or periods covered by a termination option that bp is reasonably certain not to exercise. The future lease payments included in the present value calculation are any fixed payments, payments that vary depending on an index or rate, payments due for the reasonably certain exercise of options and expected residual value guarantee payments. Repayments of principal are presented as financing cash flows and payments of interest are presented as operating cash flows.\n\nPayments that vary based on factors other than an index or a rate such as usage, sales volumes or revenues are not included in the present value calculation and are recognized in the income statement and presented as operating cash flows. The lease liability is recognized on an amortized cost basis with interest expense recognized in the income statement over the lease term, except for where capitalized as exploration, appraisal or development expenditure.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is recognized on the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment at a value equivalent to the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives, initial direct costs and any restoration obligations. The right-of-use asset is depreciated typically on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The depreciation charge is recognized in the income statement except for where capitalized as exploration, appraisal or development expenditure. Right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment in line with the accounting policy for impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill.\n\nAgreements may include both lease and non-lease components. Payments for lease and non-lease components are allocated on a relative stand-alone selling price basis except for leases of retail service stations where the group has elected not to separate non-lease payments from the calculation of the lease liability and right-of-use asset.\n\nIf the lease term at commencement of the agreement is less than 12 months, a lease liability and right-of-use asset are not recognized, and a lease expense is recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis.",

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nIf a significant event or change in circumstances, within the control of bp, arises that affects the reasonably certain lease term or there are changes to the lease payments, the present value of the lease liability is remeasured using the revised term and payments, with the right-of-use asset adjusted by an equivalent amount.\n\nModifications to a lease agreement beyond the original terms and conditions are accounted for as a re-measurement of the lease liability with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Any gain or loss on modification is recognized in the income statement. Modifications that increase the scope of the lease at a price commensurate with the stand-alone selling price are accounted for as a separate new lease.\n\nThe group recognizes the full lease liability, rather than its working interest share, for leases entered into on behalf of a joint operation if the group has the primary responsibility for making the lease payments. This may be the case if for example bp, as operator of the joint operation, is the sole signatory to the lease agreement. In such cases, bp's working interest share of the right-of-use asset is recognized if it is jointly controlled by the group and the other joint operators, and a receivable is recognized for the share of the asset transferred to the other joint operators. If bp is a non-operator, a payable to the operator is recognized if they have the primary responsibility for making the lease payments and bp has joint control over the right-of-use asset, otherwise no balances are recognized.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are recognized initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price. In the case of financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs are also included. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as set out below. The group derecognizes financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or the rights to receive cash flows have been transferred to a third party and either substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset have been transferred, or substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset have neither been retained nor transferred but control of the asset has been transferred. This includes the derecognition of receivables for which discounting arrangements are entered into.\n\nThe group classifies its financial asset debt instruments as measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. The classification depends on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.\n\n## Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at amortized cost when they are held in a business model the objective of which is to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Such assets are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the assets are derecognized or impaired and when interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. This category of financial assets includes trade and other receivables.\n\n## Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income when they are held in a business model the objective of which is both to collect contractual cash flows and sell the financial assets, and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.\n\n## Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss when the asset does not meet the criteria to be measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. Such assets are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the income statement. Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging instruments, are included in this category.\n\n## Investments in equity instruments\n\nInvestments in equity instruments are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss unless an election is made on an instrument-byinstrument basis to recognize fair value gains and losses in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge\n\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluation is described below in the accounting policy for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\n\n## Cash equivalents\n\nCash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and generally have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Cash equivalents are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost or, in the case of certain money market funds, fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nThe group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with financial assets measured at amortized cost at each balance sheet date. Expected credit losses are measured based on the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk. As lifetime expected credit losses are recognized for trade receivables and the tenor of substantially all other in-scope financial assets is less than 12 months there is no significant difference between the measurement of 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses for the group. The measurement of expected credit losses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. The expected credit loss is estimated as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of the future cash flows the group expects to receive discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is adjusted, with the amount of the impairment gain or loss recognized in the income statement.\n\nA financial asset or group of financial assets classified as measured at amortized cost is considered to be credit-impaired if there is reasonable and supportable evidence that one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset (or group of financial assets) have occurred. Financial assets are written off where the group has no reasonable expectation of recovering amounts due.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nInstruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements. Instruments that cannot be settled in the group's own equity instruments and that include no contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity that are potentially unfavourable are classified as equity. Equity instruments issued by the group are recognized at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable issue costs.",

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are recognized when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The group derecognizes financial liabilities when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as follows:\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial liabilities that meet the definition of held for trading are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the income statement. Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging instruments, are included in this category.\n\n## Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge\n\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluation is described below in the accounting policy for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost\n\nAll other financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. For interest-bearing loans and borrowings this is typically equivalent to the fair value of the proceeds received, net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.\n\nAfter initial recognition, other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.\n\nThis category of financial liabilities includes trade and other payables and finance debt.\n\n## Significant judgement: supplier financing arrangements\n\nThe group's trade payables include some supplier arrangements that utilize letter of credit facilities. Judgement is required to assess the payables subject to these arrangements to determine whether they should continue to be classified as trade payables and give rise to operating cash flows or finance debt and financing cash flows. The criteria used in making this assessment include the payment terms for the amount due relative to terms commonly seen in the markets in which bp operates and whether the arrangements significantly change the nature of the liability. Liabilities subject to these arrangements with payment terms of up to approximately 60 days are generally considered to be trade payables and give rise to operating cash flows. At 31 December 2023, trade payables subject to these arrangements and this significant judgement included $10 billion (2022 $9.5 billion) payable to the providers of the letters of credit. See Note 29 - Liquidity risk for further information.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nThe group issues financial guarantee contracts to make specified payments to reimburse holders for losses incurred if certain associates, joint ventures or third-party entities fail to make payments when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument such as a loan. The liability for a financial guarantee contract is initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of the contract's estimated expected credit loss and the amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, cumulative amortization.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities\n\nThe group uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, as well as for trading purposes. These derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.\n\nContracts to buy or sell a non-financial item (for example, oil, oil products, gas or power) that can be settled net in cash, with the exception of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the group's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements, are accounted for as financial instruments. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as effective hedging instruments are recognized in the income statement.\n\nIf, at inception of a contract, the valuation cannot be supported by observable market data, any gain or loss determined by the valuation methodology is not recognized in the income statement but is deferred on the balance sheet and is commonly known as a 'day-one gain or loss'. This deferred gain or loss is recognized in the income statement over the life of the contract until substantially all the remaining contractual cash flows can be valued using observable market data at which point any remaining deferred gain or loss is recognized in the income statement. Changes in valuation subsequent to the initial valuation at inception of a contract are recognized immediately in the income statement.\n\nFor the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:\n\n- \u00b7 Fair value hedges when hedging exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability.\n- \u00b7 Cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to either a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.\n\nHedge relationships are formally designated and documented at inception, together with the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, the existence at inception of an economic relationship and subsequent measurement of the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, the hedge ratio and sources of hedge ineffectiveness. Hedges meeting the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:",

        "page_content": "## 1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe change in fair value of a hedging derivative is recognized in profit or loss. The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognized in profit or loss, where it offsets. The group applies fair value hedge accounting when hedging interest rate risk and certain currency risks on fixed rate finance debt.\n\nFair value hedge accounting is discontinued only when the hedging relationship or a part thereof ceases to meet the qualifying criteria. This includes when the risk management objective changes or when the hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised. The accumulated adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item at such time is then amortized prospectively to profit or loss as finance interest expense over the hedged item's remaining period to maturity.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of the gain or loss on a cash flow hedging instrument is reported in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognized in profit or loss. Amounts reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.\n\nWhere the hedged item is a highly probable forecast transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, such as a forecast foreign currency transaction for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, the amounts recognized within other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. Where the hedged item is an equity investment, the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income remain in the separate component of equity until the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss or when accounting under the equity method is discontinued. Where the hedged item is recognized directly in profit or loss, the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to production and manufacturing expenses or sales and other operating revenues as appropriate.\n\nCash flow hedge accounting is discontinued only when the hedging relationship or a part thereof ceases to meet the qualifying criteria. This includes when the designated hedged forecast transaction or part thereof is no longer considered to be highly probable to occur, or when the hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover. When cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued amounts previously recognized within other comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognized within other comprehensive income will be immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## Costs of hedging\n\nThe foreign currency basis spread of cross-currency interest rate swaps are excluded from hedge designations and accounted for as costs of hedging. Changes in fair value of the foreign currency basis spread are recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent that they relate to the hedged item.\n\nFor time-period related hedged items, the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is amortized to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the term of the hedging relationship.\n\n## Fair value measurement\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The group categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three levels depending on the ability to observe inputs employed in their measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, other than quoted prices included within level 1 for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or bp's assumptions about pricing by market participants.\n\n## Significant estimate and judgement: derivative financial instruments\n\nIn some cases the fair values of derivatives are estimated using internal models due to the absence of quoted prices or other observable, marketcorroborated data. This primarily applies to the group's longer-term derivative contracts. The majority of these contracts are valued using models with inputs that include price curves for each of the different products that are built up from available active market pricing data (including volatility and correlation) and modelled using the maximum available external information. Additionally, where limited data exists for certain products, prices are determined using historical and long-term pricing relationships. The use of alternative assumptions or valuation methodologies may result in significantly different values for these derivatives. A reasonably possible change in the price assumptions used in the models relating to index price would not have a material impact on net assets and the Group income statement primarily as a result of offsetting movements between derivative assets and liabilities.\n\nIn some cases, judgement is required to determine whether contracts to buy or sell commodities meet the definition of a derivative or to determine appropriate presentation and classification of transactions in certain cases. In particular, contracts to buy and sell LNG are not considered to meet the definition as they are not considered capable of being net settled due to a lack of liquidity in the LNG market and the inability or lack of history of net settlement and are accounted for on an accruals basis, rather than as a derivative. Under IFRS, bp fair values the derivative financial instruments used to risk-manage the LNG contracts themselves, resulting in a measurement mismatch.\n\nFor more information, including the carrying amounts of level 3 derivatives, see Note 30.\n\n## Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are presented gross in the balance sheet unless both of the following criteria are met: the group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts; and the group intends to either settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. A right of set off is the group's legal right to settle an amount payable to a creditor by applying against it an amount receivable from the same counterparty. The relevant legal jurisdiction and laws applicable to the relationships between the parties are considered when assessing whether a current legally enforceable right to set off exists.",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\n## 1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Provisions and contingencies\n\nProvisions are recognized when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where appropriate, the future cash flow estimates are adjusted to reflect risks specific to the liability.\n\nIf the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized within finance costs. Provisions are discounted using a nominal discount rate of 4% (2022 3.5% ) .\n\nProvisions are split between amounts expected to be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date (current) and amounts expected to be settled later (non-current).\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will only be confirmed by future events not wholly within the control of the group, or present obligations where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements but are disclosed, if material, unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is considered remote.\n\n## Decommissioning\n\nLiabilities for decommissioning costs are recognized when the group has an obligation to plug and abandon a well, dismantle and remove a facility or an item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located, and when a reliable estimate of that liability can be made. Where an obligation exists for a new facility or item of plant, such as oil and natural gas production or transportation facilities, this liability will be recognized on construction or installation. Similarly, where an obligation exists for a well, this liability is recognized when it is drilled. An obligation for decommissioning may also crystallize during the period of operation of a well, facility or item of plant through a change in legislation or through a decision to terminate operations; an obligation may also arise in cases where an asset has been sold but the subsequent owner is no longer able to fulfil its decommissioning obligations, for example due to bankruptcy. The amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. The provision for the costs of decommissioning wells, production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives is estimated using existing technology, at future prices, depending on the expected timing of the activity, and discounted using a nominal discount rate.\n\nAn amount equivalent to the decommissioning provision is recognized as part of the corresponding intangible asset (in the case of an exploration or appraisal well) or property, plant and equipment. The decommissioning portion of the property, plant and equipment is subsequently depreciated at the same rate as the rest of the asset. Other than the unwinding of discount on or utilization of the provision, any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the corresponding asset where that asset is generating or is expected to generate future economic benefits.\n\n## Environmental expenditures and liabilities\n\nEnvironmental expenditures that are required in order for the group to obtain future economic benefits from its assets are capitalized as part of those assets. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future earnings are expensed.\n\nLiabilities for environmental costs are recognized when a clean-up is probable and the associated costs can be reliably estimated. Generally, the timing of recognition of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.\n\nThe amount recognized is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. Provisions for environmental liabilities have been estimated using existing technology, at future prices and discounted using a nominal discount rate.\n\n## Emissions\n\nLiabilities for emissions are recognized when the cumulative volumes of gases emitted by the group at the end of the reporting period exceed the allowances granted free of charge held for own use or a set baseline for emissions. The provision is measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. It is based on the excess of actual emissions over the free allowances held or set baseline in tonnes (or other appropriate quantity) and is valued at the actual cost of any allowances that have been purchased and held for own use on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis, and, if insufficient allowances are held, for the remaining requirement on the basis of the spot market price of allowances at the balance sheet date. The majority of these provisions are typically settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date however certain schemes may have longer compliance periods. The cost of allowances purchased to cover a shortfall is recognized separately on the balance sheet as an intangible asset unless the emission allowances acquired or generated by the group are risk-managed by the trading and shipping function, then they are recognized on the balance sheet as inventory.\n\n## Restructuring provisions\n\nRestructuring provisions are recognized where a detailed formal plan exists, and a valid expectation of risk of redundancy has been made to those affected but where the specific outcomes remain uncertain. Where formal redundancy offers have been made, the obligations for those amounts are reported as payables and, if not, as provisions if unpaid at the year-end.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Significant judgements and estimates: provisions\n\nThe group holds provisions for the future decommissioning of oil and natural gas production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives. The largest decommissioning obligations facing bp relate to the plugging and abandonment of wells and the removal and disposal of oil and natural gas platforms and pipelines around the world. Most of these decommissioning events are many years in the future and the precise requirements that will have to be met when the removal event occurs are uncertain. Decommissioning technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are political, environmental, safety and public expectations. The timing and amounts of future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainty and estimation is required in determining the amounts of provisions to be recognized. Any changes in the expected future costs are reflected in both the provision and, where still recognized, the asset.\n\nIf oil and natural gas production facilities and pipelines are sold to third parties, judgement is required to assess whether the new owner will be unable to meet their decommissioning obligations, whether bp would then be responsible for decommissioning, and if so the extent of that responsibility. This typically requires assessment of the local legal requirements and the financial standing of the owner. If the standing deteriorates significantly, for example, bankruptcy of the owner, a provision may be required. The group has assessed that $0.6 billion of decommissioning provisions should be recognized as at 31 December 2023 (2022 $0.8 billion) for assets previously sold to third parties where the sale transferred the decommissioning obligation to the new owner. See Note 33 for further information.\n\nDecommissioning provisions associated with downstream refineries are generally not recognized, as the potential obligations cannot be measured, given their indeterminate settlement dates. Obligations may arise if refineries cease manufacturing operations and any such obligations would be recognized in the period when sufficient information becomes available to determine potential settlement dates. See Note 33 for further information.\n\nThe group performs periodic reviews of its downstream refineries for any changes in facts and circumstances including those relating to the energy transition, that might require the recognition of a decommissioning provision. Portfolio strength and flexibility are such that the point of cessation of manufacturing at the group's operating refineries is not yet expected within a determinate time period, as existing property plant and equipment is expected to be renewed or replaced.\n\nThe provision for environmental liabilities is estimated based on current legal and constructive requirements, technology, price levels and expected plans for remediation. Actual costs and cash outflows can differ from current estimates because of changes in laws and regulations, public expectations, prices, discovery and analysis of site conditions and changes in clean-up technology.\n\nThe timing and amount of future expenditures relating to decommissioning and environmental liabilities are reviewed annually. The interest rate used in discounting the cash flows is reviewed quarterly. The nominal interest rate used to determine the balance sheet obligations at the end of 2023 was 4% (2022 3.5%), which was based on long-dated US government bonds. The weighted average period over which decommissioning and environmental costs are generally expected to be incurred is estimated to be approximately 17 years (2022 17 years) and 6 years (2022 6 years) respectively. Costs at future prices are typically determined by applying an inflation rate of 1.5% (2022 1.5%) to decommissioning costs and 2% (2022 2%) for all other provisions. A lower rate is typically applied to decommissioning as certain costs are expected to remain fixed at current or past prices.\n\nThe estimated phasing of undiscounted cash flows in real terms for upstream decommissioning is approximately $5.5 billion (2022 $5.6 billion) within the next 10 years, $5.8 billion (2022 $5.3 billion) in 10 to 20 years and the remainder of approximately $6.6 billion (2022 $6.0 billion) after 20 years. The timing and amount of decommissioning cash flows are inherently uncertain and therefore the phasing is management's current best estimate but may not be what will ultimately occur.\n\nFurther information about the group's provisions is provided in Note 23. Changes in assumptions in relation to the group's provisions could result in a material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year. A 1.0 percentage point increase in the nominal discount rate applied could decrease the group's provision balances by approximately $1.6 billion (2022 $1.8 billion). The pre-tax impact on the group income statement would be a credit of approximately $0.4 billion (2022 $0.5 billion). This level of change reflects past experience of a reasonable change in rate that could arise within the next financial year.\n\nThe discounting impact on the group's decommissioning provisions for oil and gas properties in the oil productions & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments of a two-year change in the timing of expected future decommissioning expenditures is approximately $0.6 billion (2022 $0.5 billion ). Management currently does not consider a change of greater than two years to be reasonably possible in the next financial year and therefore the timing of upstream decommissioning expenditure is not a key source of estimation uncertainty.\n\nIf all expected future decommissioning expenditures were 10% higher, then these decommissioning provisions would increase by approximately $1.1 billion (2022 $1.2 billion) and a pre-tax charge of approximately $0.2 billion (2022 $0.3 billion) would be recognized. A one percentage point increase in the inflation rate applied to upstream decommissioning costs to determine the nominal cash flows could increase the decommissioning provision by approximately $1.9 billion (2022 $2.0 billion) with a pre-tax charge of approximately $0.5 billion (2022 $0.5 billion).\n\nAs described in Note 33, the group is subject to claims and actions for which no provisions have been recognized. The facts and circumstances relating to particular cases are evaluated regularly in determining whether a provision relating to a specific litigation should be recognized or revised. Accordingly, significant management judgement relating to provisions and contingent liabilities is required, since the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nWages, salaries, bonuses, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the group. Deferred bonus arrangements that have a vesting date more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are valued on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period until the award vests. The material accounting policy information for pensions and other post-retirement benefits are described below.",

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nThe cost of providing benefits under the group's defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation. Past service costs, resulting from either a plan amendment or a curtailment (a reduction in future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the plan membership), are recognized immediately when the company becomes committed to a change.\n\nNet interest expense relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefits, which is recognized in the income statement, represents the net change in present value of plan obligations and the value of plan assets resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the present value of the benefit obligation at the start of the year, and to the fair value of plan assets at the start of the year, taking into account expected changes in the obligation or plan assets during the year.\n\nRemeasurements of the defined benefit liability and asset, comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest described above) are recognized within other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently reclassified to profit and loss.\n\nThe defined benefit pension plan surplus or deficit recognized on the balance sheet for each plan comprises the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds) and the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. Defined benefit pension plan surpluses are only recognized to the extent they are recoverable, either by way of a refund from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.\n\n## Significant estimate: pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nAccounting for defined benefit pensions and other post-retirement benefits involves making significant estimates when measuring the group's pension plan surpluses and deficits. These estimates require assumptions to be made about many uncertainties.\n\nPensions and other post-retirement benefit assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year. These assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation at the year end and hence the surpluses and deficits recorded on the group's balance sheet and pension and other post-retirement benefit expense for the following year.\n\nThe assumptions that are the most significant to the amounts reported are the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality levels. Assumptions about these variables are based on the environment in each country. The assumptions used vary from year to year, with resultant effects on future net income and net assets. Changes to some of these assumptions, in particular the discount rate and inflation rate, could result in material changes to the carrying amounts of the group's pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations within the next financial year, in particular for the UK, US and Eurozone plans. Any differences between these assumptions and the actual outcome will also affect future net income and net assets.\n\nThe values ascribed to these assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the assumptions on the benefit expense and obligation used are provided in Note 24.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.\n\nIncome tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the related tax is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\nCurrent tax is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it is determined in accordance with the rules established by the applicable taxation authorities. It therefore excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods as well as items that are never taxable or deductible. The group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences except:\n\n- \u00b7 Where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of goodwill.\n- \u00b7 Where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and, at the time of the transaction, does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.\n- \u00b7 In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint arrangements, where the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.",

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\nWhere tax treatments are uncertain, if it is considered probable that a taxation authority will accept the group's proposed tax treatment, income taxes are recognized consistent with the group's income tax filings. If it is not considered probable, the uncertainty is reflected within the carrying amount of the applicable tax asset or liability using either the most likely amount or an expected value, depending on which method better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty.\n\nThe computation of the group's income tax expense and liability involves the interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions throughout the world. The resolution of tax positions taken by the group, through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, can take several years to complete and in some cases it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome. Therefore, judgement is required to determine whether provisions for income taxes are required and, if so, estimation is required of the amounts that could be payable.\n\nIn addition, the group has carry-forward tax losses and tax credits in certain taxing jurisdictions that are available to offset against future taxable profit. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses or tax credits can be utilized. Management judgement is exercised in assessing whether this is the case and estimates are required to be made of the amount of future taxable profits that will be available. Such judgements are inherently impacted by estimates affecting future taxable profits such as oil and natural gas prices and decommissioning expenditure, see 'Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and provisions'.\n\nIn May 2023, the IASB issued International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules - Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes to clarify the application of IAS 12 to tax legislation enacted or substantively enacted to implement Pillar Two of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, which aims to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. The amendments include a mandatory temporary exception from accounting for deferred tax on such tax law. In July 2023, the UK government enacted legislation to implement the Pillar Two rules. The legislation is effective for bp from 1 January 2024 and includes an income inclusion rule and a domestic minimum tax, which together are designed to ensure a minimum effective tax rate of 15% in each country in which the group operates. Similar legislation is being enacted by other governments around the world. In line with the amendments to IAS 12, the exception from accounting for deferred tax for the Pillar Two rules has been applied and there are no impacts on the consolidated financial statements for 2023. Based on an assessment of historic data and forecasts for the year ending 31 December 2024, the Group does not expect a material exposure to Pillar Two income taxes for the year ending 31 December 2024.\n\n## Significant judgement and estimate: taxation\n\nThe value of deferred tax assets and liabilities is an area involving inherent uncertainty and estimation and balances are therefore subject to risk of material change as a result of underlying assumptions and judgements used, in particular the forecast of future profitability used to determine the recoverability of deferred tax, for example future oil and gas prices, see 'Significant judgement and estimates - Recoverability of asset carrying values'. It is impracticable to disclose the extent of the possible effects of profitability assumptions on the group's deferred tax assets. It is reasonably possible that to the extent that actual outcomes differ from management's estimates, material income tax charges or credits, and material changes in current and deferred tax assets or liabilities, may arise within the next financial year and in future periods.\n\nJudgement is required when determining whether a particular tax is an income tax or another type of tax (for example, a production tax). The attributes of the tax, including whether it is calculated on profits or another measure such as production or revenues, the extent of deductibility of costs and the interaction with existing income taxes, are considered in determining the classification of the tax. Accounting for deferred tax is applied to income taxes as described above but is not applied to other types of taxes; rather such taxes are recognized in the income statement in accordance with the applicable accounting policy such as Provisions and contingencies.\n\nThis judgement is considered significant only in relation to the group's taxes payable under the fiscal terms of bp's onshore concession in Abu Dhabi. These are principally reported as income taxes rather than as production taxes.\n\nFor more information see Note 9 and Note 33.\n\n## Customs duties and sales taxes\n\nCustoms duties and sales taxes that are passed on or charged to customers are excluded from revenues and expenses. Assets and liabilities are recognized net of the amount of customs duties or sales tax except:\n\n- \u00b7 Customs duties or sales taxes incurred on the purchase of goods and services which are not recoverable from the taxation authority are recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset.\n- \u00b7 Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of customs duty or sales tax included.\n\nThe net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included within receivables or payables in the balance sheet.",

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Own equity instruments - treasury shares\n\nThe group's holdings in its own equity instruments are shown as deductions from shareholders' equity. Treasury shares represent bp shares repurchased and available for specific and limited purposes. For accounting purposes, shares held in Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the consolidated financial statements as treasury shares. The cost of treasury shares subsequently sold or reissued is calculated on a weighted-average basis. Consideration, if any, received for the sale of such shares is also recognized in equity. No gain or loss is recognized in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares. Shares repurchased under the share buy-back programme which are immediately cancelled are not shown as treasury shares, but are shown as a deduction from the profit and loss account reserve in the group statement of changes in equity.\n\n## Revenue and other income\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized when or as the group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. The transfer of control of oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG, petroleum and chemical products, and other items usually coincides with title passing to the customer and the customer taking physical possession. The group principally satisfies its performance obligations at a point in time; the amounts of revenue recognized relating to performance obligations satisfied over time are not significant.\n\nWhen, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied, the group recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to that performance obligation. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the group expects to be entitled. The transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations in the contract based on standalone selling prices of the goods or services promised.\n\nContracts for the sale of commodities are typically priced by reference to quoted prices. Revenue from term commodity contracts is recognized based on the contractual pricing provisions for each delivery. Certain of these contracts have pricing terms based on prices at a point in time after delivery has been made. Revenue from such contracts is initially recognized based on relevant prices at the time of delivery and subsequently adjusted as appropriate. All revenue from these contracts, both that recognized at the time of delivery and that from post-delivery price adjustments, is disclosed as revenue from contracts with customers.\n\nSales and purchase of commodities accounted for under IFRS 15 are presented on a gross basis in Revenue from contracts with customers and Purchases respectively. Physically settled derivatives which represent trading or optimization activities are presented net alongside financially settled derivative contracts in Other operating revenues within Sales and other operating income. Certain physically settled sale and purchase derivative contracts which are not part of trading and optimization activities are presented gross within Other operating revenues and Purchases respectively. Changes in the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities prior to physical delivery are also classified as other operating revenues.\n\nPhysical exchanges with counterparties in the same line of business in order to facilitate sales to customers are reported net, as are sales and purchases made with a common counterparty, as part of an arrangement similar to a physical exchange.\n\nWhere the group acts as agent on behalf of a third party to procure or market energy commodities, any associated fee income is recognized but no purchase or sale is recorded.\n\nInterest income is recognized as the interest accrues (using the effective interest rate, that is, the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset).\n\nDividend income from investments is recognized when the shareholders' right to receive the payment is established.\n\nContract asset and contract liability balances are included within amounts presented for trade receivables and other payables respectively.\n\n## Finance costs\n\nFinance costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use. All other finance costs are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## Updates to material accounting policy information\n\n## Impact of new International Financial Reporting Standards\n\nThere are no new or amended standards or interpretations adopted from 1 January 2023 onwards, including the amendments to IAS 12 'Income Taxes' as described on page 186 and IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts,' that have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements for 2023. Further, there are no new or amended standards not yet adopted that are expected to have a material impact.",

Total consideration paid in cash amounted to $1,282 million (2022 $3,671 million), offset by cash acquired of $484 million (2022 $141 million).\n\nThe fair value of the net assets (including goodwill) recognized from business combinations in the full year, inclusive of measurement period adjustments for business combinations in previous periods, was $1,228 million (2022 $4,121 million). This principally related to the acquisition of TravelCenters of America.\n\n## 2022\n\n## Archaea Energy\n\nOn 28 December 2022, bp acquired 100% of the issued common stock of Archaea Energy Inc. a leading producer of renewable natural gas (RNG) in the US, that was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe total cash consideration for the transaction, all paid at completion, was $3,137 million.\n\nThe transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method. As the transaction completed shortly prior to the end of the reporting period, the acquisition-date fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired reported in 2022 were provisional. The final and provisional fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, as at the date of acquisition are shown in the table below. The measurement period adjustments between the provisional and final values were recognized in 2023 as the impact on the comparative period was not material. The intangible assets recognized are primarily the biogas rights agreements Archaea Energy has with landfill owners. The goodwill recognized reflects the part of the project development pipeline that did not qualify for separate recognition at the acquisition date and goodwill arising from recognition of deferred tax liabilities on fair value uplifts. The goodwill balance is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\n\nThe transaction included a step acquisition of the Mavrix LLC joint venture, which bp and Archaea Energy each held a 50% interest in prior to this transaction. The final fair value of bp's interest in Mavrix LLC immediately before the acquisition date was $303 million and the gain recognized in 'Interest and other income', initially in 2022 and revised in 2023, as a result of remeasuring this interest to fair value was $196 million.\n\n|                                                      | Provisional   | $ million Final   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Assets                                               |               |                   |\n| Property plant and equipment                         | 885           | 929               |\n| Goodwill                                             | 409           | 707               |\n| Intangible assets                                    | 3,475         | 3,178             |\n| Investments in equity-accounted entities             | 917           | 883               |\n| Inventory                                            | 42            | 31                |\n| Trade and other receivables                          | 67            | 47                |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                            | 107           | 96                |\n| Liabilities                                          |               |                   |\n| Trade and other payables                             | (1,032)       | (1,145)           |\n| Finance debt                                         | (1,044)       | (1,044)           |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                             | (293)         | (214)             |\n| Provisions                                           | (16)          | (21)              |\n| Non-controlling interest                             | (7)           | (7)               |\n| Total consideration                                  | 3,510         | 3,440             |\n| Of which:                                            |               |                   |\n| Cash                                                 | 3,137         | 3,137             |\n| Fair value of previously held interest in Mavrix LLC | 373           | 303               |",

At 31 December 2023, deferred consideration relating to disposals amounted to $141 million receivable within one year (2022 $191 million and 2021 $205 million) and $217 million receivable after one year (2022 $194 million and 2021 $823 million). The amounts of deferred consideration are reported within Trade and other receivables in Other receivables in the group balance sheet. In addition, contingent consideration receivable relating to disposals amounted to $1,694 million at 31 December 2023 (2022 $1,896 million and 2021 $1,917 million). The contingent consideration at 31 December 2023 relates to the prior period disposals of our Alaskan business and certain assets in the North Sea and the disposal of our 50% interest in the Sunrise oil sands project in Canada. These amounts of contingent consideration are reported within Other investments on the group balance sheet - see Note 18 for further information.\n\n## Gains and losses on sale of businesses and fixed assets, and closures\n\n## gas & low carbon energy\n\nIn 2021 gains on disposal of businesses and fixed assets were principally related to a $1,031 million gain on disposal of a 20% participating interest in Block 61 in Oman.",

Segmental analysis\n\nThe group's organizational structure reflects the various activities in which bp is engaged as well as how performance and resource allocation is evaluated by the chief operating decision maker. At 31 December 2023, bp has three reportable segments: Gas & low carbon energy, Oil production & operations, and Customers & products. Each are managed separately, with decisions taken for the segment as a whole, and represent a single operating segment that does not result from aggregating two or more segments.\n\nGas & low carbon energy comprises regions with upstream businesses that predominantly produce natural gas, gas marketing and trading activities and the group's solar, wind and hydrogen businesses.\n\nOil production & operations comprises regions with upstream activities that predominantly produce crude oil.\n\nCustomers & products comprises the group's customer-focused businesses, which includes convenience and retail fuels, EV charging, as well as Castrol, aviation and B2B and midstream. It also includes our products businesses, refining & oil trading, as well as our bioenergy businesses.\n\nOther businesses and corporate also comprises the group's shipping and treasury functions, and corporate activities worldwide.\n\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the group's accounting policies described in Note 1. However, IFRS requires that the measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker for the purposes of performance assessment and resource allocation. For bp, this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit or loss before interest and tax which reflects the replacement cost of supplies by excluding from profit or loss before interest and tax inventory holding gains and losses a . Replacement cost profit or loss before interest and tax for the group is not a recognized measure under IFRS.\n\nSales between segments are made at prices that approximate market prices, taking into account the volumes involved. Segment revenues and segment results include transactions between business segments. These transactions and any unrealized profits and losses are eliminated on consolidation, unless unrealized losses provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Sales to external customers by region are based on the location of the group subsidiary which made the sale. The UK region includes the UK-based international activities of customers & products.\n\nAll surpluses and deficits recognized on the group balance sheet in respect of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are allocated to Other businesses and corporate. However, the periodic expense relating to these plans is allocated to the operating segments based upon the business in which the employees work.\n\nCertain financial information is provided separately for the US as this is an individually material country for bp, and for the UK as this is bp's country of domicile.\n\n- \u00b7 the difference between the cost of sales calculated using the replacement cost of inventory and the cost of sales calculated on the first-in first-out (FIFO) method after adjusting for any changes in provisions where the net realizable value of the inventory is lower than its cost. Under the FIFO method, which we use for IFRS reporting of inventories other than for trading inventories, the cost of inventory charged to the income statement is based on its historical cost of purchase or manufacture, rather than its replacement cost. In volatile energy markets, this can have a significant distorting effect on reported income. The amounts disclosed as inventory holding gains and losses represent the difference between the charge to the income statement for inventory on a FIFO basis (after adjusting for any related movements in net realizable value provisions) and the charge that would have arisen based on the replacement cost of inventory. For this purpose, the replacement cost of inventory is calculated using data from each operation's production and manufacturing system, either on a monthly basis, or separately for each transaction where the system allows this approach.\n- \u00b7 an adjustment relating to certain trading inventories that are not price risk managed which relate to a minimum inventory volume that is required to be held to maintain underlying business activities. This adjustment represents the movement in fair value of the inventories due to prices, on a grade-by-grade basis, during the period. This is calculated from each operation's inventory management system on a monthly basis using the discrete monthly movement in market prices for these inventories.\n\nThe amounts disclosed are not separately reflected in the financial statements as a gain or loss. No adjustment is made in respect of the cost of inventories held as part of a trading position and certain other temporary inventory positions that are price risk-managed.",

Earnings per share - continued\n\nThe number of ordinary shares outstanding at 31 December 2023, excluding treasury shares, and including certain shares that will be issuable in the future under employee share-based payment plans was 16,824,651,796 (2022 17,974,112,648). Between 31 December 2023 and 16 February 2024, the latest practicable date before the completion of these financial statements, there was a net decrease of 21,406,501 of ordinary shares primarily as a result of share issues in relation to employee share-based payment plans partially offset by share buy backs. For additional information on share buy backs see Note 31.\n\n## Employee share-based payment plans\n\nThe group operates share and share option plans for directors and certain employees to obtain ordinary shares and ADSs in the company. Information on these plans for directors is shown in the Directors remuneration report on pages 105-132.\n\nThe following table shows the number of shares potentially issuable under equity-settled employee share option plans, including the number of options outstanding, the number of options exercisable at the end of each year, and the corresponding weighted average exercise prices. The dilutive effect of these plans at 31 December is also shown.\n\n| Share options   |                                | 2023                               |                                | 2022                               |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                 | Number of options a b thousand | Weighted average  exercise price $ | Number of options a b thousand | Weighted average  exercise price $ |\n| Outstanding     | 545,044                        | 4.04                               | 564,079                        | 4.00                               |\n| Exercisable     | 905                            | 3.31                               | 342                            | 4.99                               |\n| Dilutive effect | 166,581                        | n/a                                | 83,204                         | n/a                                |\n\nIn addition, the group operates a number of equity-settled employee share plans under which share units are granted to the group's senior leaders and certain other employees. These plans typically have a three-year performance or restricted period during which the units accrue net notional dividends which are treated as having been reinvested. Leaving employment will normally preclude the conversion of units into shares, but special arrangements apply for participants that leave for qualifying reasons. The number of shares that are expected to vest each year under employee share plans are shown in the table below. The dilutive effect of the employee share plans at 31 December is also shown.\n\n| Share plans Vesting   | 2023 Number of shares a thousand   | 2022 Number of shares a thousand   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Within one year       | 226,190                            | 167,672                            |\n| 1 to 2 years          | 257,511                            | 192,734                            |\n| 2 to 3 years          | 114,500                            | 226,027                            |\n| 3 to 4 years          | 1,176                              | 2,595                              |\n| Over 4 years          | 308                                | 173                                |\n|                       | 599,685                            | 589,201                            |\n| Dilutive effect       | 284,908                            | 244,886                            |\n\nThere has been a net decrease of 109,230,677 in the number of potential ordinary shares relating to employee share-based payment plans between 31 December 2023 and 16 February 2024.",

        "page_content": "## 14. Goodwill and impairment review of goodwill - continued\n\nThe value in use for relevant CGUs in both gas & low carbon energy and oil production & operations is based on the cash flows expected to be generated by the projected production profiles up to the expected dates of cessation of production of each field, based on appropriately risked estimates of reserves and resources. Midstream and supply and trading activities and equity-accounted entities are generally not included in the impairment reviews of goodwill, as they do not represent part of the grouping of CGUs to which the goodwill balances relate and which are used to monitor the goodwill balances for internal management purposes. Where such activities form part of wider CGUs to which goodwill relates they are reflected in the test. As the production profile and related cash flows can be estimated from bp's past experience, management believes that the cash flows generated over the estimated life of field is the appropriate basis upon which to assess goodwill and individual assets for impairment in both gas & low carbon energy and oil & production operations. The estimated date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, the production profile of the hydrocarbons, the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary to recover the hydrocarbons, production costs, the contractual duration of the production concession and the selling price of the hydrocarbons produced. As each field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the cash flows of each field are computed using appropriate individual economic models and key assumptions agreed by bp management.\n\nEstimated production volumes and cash flows up to the date of cessation of production on a field-by-field basis, including operating and capital expenditure, are derived from the business segment plans. The production profiles used are consistent with the reserve and resource volumes approved as part of bp's centrally controlled process for the estimation of proved and probable reserves and total resources.\n\nThe average production for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing in the gas & low carbon energy segment over the next 15 years is 185 mmboe per year (2022 191 mmboe per year) and in the oil production and operations segment is 402 mmboe per year (2022 346 mmboe per year). Production assumptions used for the goodwill impairment tests in both gas & low carbon energy and oil production & operations reflect management's best estimate of future production of the existing portfolio at the time of the calculation. The group's expectation to reduce upstream hydrocarbon production by around 25% by 2030 from its 2019 baseline is expected to be achieved through future active management, including divestments, and high-grading of the portfolio. Changes in upstream production since 2019 will be included in the best estimates however as the specific future changes to the portfolio are not yet known, these best estimates do not include the full extent of the expected upstream production reductions.\n\nThe weighted average pre-tax discount rate used in the review for the oil production & operations segment is 17%, and 11% for the gas & low carbon energy segment (2022 16% for the oil production & operations segment and 10% for the gas & low carbon energy segment).\n\nThe most recent reviews for impairment for the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments were carried out in the fourth quarter. The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are oil and natural gas prices, production volumes and the discount rate. The value-in-use calculations have been prepared for the purposes of determining whether the goodwill balances were impaired. Estimated future cash flows were prepared on the basis of certain assumptions prevailing at the time of the tests. The actual outcomes may differ from the assumptions made. For example, reserves and resources estimates and production forecasts are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available and economic conditions change. Due to economic developments, regulatory change and emissions reduction activity arising from climate concern and other factors, future commodity prices and other assumptions may differ from the forecasts used in the calculations.\n\nSensitivities to different variables have been estimated using certain simplifying assumptions. For example, lower oil and gas price or production sensitivities do not fully reflect the specific impacts for each contractual arrangement and will not capture all favourable impacts that may arise from cost deflation or savings. A detailed calculation in either segment at any given price or production profile may, therefore, produce a different result.\n\nIt is estimated that a 22% (2022 27%) reduction in revenue throughout each year of the remaining life of those assets, either as a result of adverse price or production conditions or a combination of each, would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net noncurrent assets of the oil production and operations segment. For gas & low carbon energy an 15% (2022 18%) reduction would have the same result.\n\nIt is estimated that no reasonably possible change in the discount rate would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets of either segment.\n\n## customers & products\n\n|          | $ million   | $ million   | $ million       | $ million   | $ million   | $ million   | $ million   | $ million   | $ million       | $ million   | $ million   | $ million   |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|          | Castrol     | US Fuels    | European  Fuels | Archaea     | Other       | Total       | Castrol     | US Fuels    | European  Fuels | Archaea     | Other       | Total       |\n| Goodwill | 2,672       | 792         | 839             | 707         | 421         | 5,431       | 2,524       | 606         | 815             | 409         | 386         | 4,740       |\n\nCash flows for each CGU are derived from the business segment plans, which cover a period of up to five years, except for Archaea where a business plan to 2035 is in place following the recent acquisition. To determine the value in use for each of the cash-generating units, cash flows for a period of 10 years (12 years for Archaea), are discounted and aggregated with a terminal value. It is estimated that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used in the US Fuels, European Fuels and Archaea goodwill impairment assessments would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets.\n\n## Castrol\n\nThe key assumptions to which the calculation of value in use for the Castrol unit is most sensitive are operating unit margins, sales volumes, and discount rate. Operating margin and sales volumes assumptions used in the detailed impairment review of goodwill calculation are consistent with the assumptions used in the Castrol unit's business plan. A pre-tax discount rate of 9% (2022 8%) is applied in the test. No reasonably possible change in any of these key assumptions would cause the unit's recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets. Cash flows beyond the plan period are extrapolated using a nominal 3.4% (2022 3.4%) growth rate.",

The balances are unsecured and will be settled in cash. There are no significant provisions for doubtful debts relating to these balances and no significant expense recognized in the income statement in respect of bad or doubtful debts. Dividends receivable are not included in the table above.\n\nThe majority of sales to joint ventures in 2023 relate to heating oil, gasoline, diesel and lubricant product transactions with Mobene and Ocwen Energy. The majority of purchases from joint ventures in 2023 relate to crude oil and oil products transactions with Azule Energy.\n\nThe bp investment in Pan American Energy Group S.L. joint venture had an impairment charge in 2022 of $2,900 million as a result of expected portfolio changes.\n\nbp's share of net impairment charges recognized by joint ventures in 2023 was $1,285 million (2022 $256 million charge and 2021 reversals of $214 million) of which $1,152 million charge (2022 $276 million and 2021 $nil) was in the gas and low carbon energy segment and $133 million charge (2022 $20 million reversals and 2021 reversals of $214 million) was in the oil production & operations segment. The 2023 charges in the gas and low carbon energy segment principally relate to the group's US offshore wind investments. The project assets were measured at fair value less costs of disposal following the rejection in October 2023 of requests to renegotiate the power purchase agreements associated with three wind farms off the coast of New York (Empire Wind 1 and 2, Beacon Wind 1) and the announcement in January 2024 that bp and Equinor will restructure those investments. Subject to approvals, bp will assume full ownership of the Beacon projects and Equinor the Empire projects.\n\n## 17. Investments in associates\n\nThe following table provides aggregated summarized financial information for the group's associates as it relates to the amounts recognized in the group income statement and on the group balance sheet. There were no individually material associates to the Group at 31 December 2023. The associate which was material to the Group at 31 December 2021 was Rosneft. At 31 December 2021 bp classified its investment in Rosneft as an associate because, in management's judgement, bp had significant influence over Rosneft. On 27 February 2022, bp announced it would exit its shareholding in Rosneft and bp's two nominated Rosneft directors both stepped down from Rosneft's board. As a result, the significant judgement on significant influence over Rosneft was reassessed. Since the first quarter 2022, bp accounts for its interest in Rosneft and its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia, as financial assets measured at fair value within 'Other investments'.

The fair value is determined using an estimate of discounted future cash flows that are expected to be received and is considered a level 3 valuation under the fair value hierarchy. Future cash flows are estimated based on inputs including oil and natural gas prices, production volumes and operating costs related to the disposed operations. The discount rate used is based on a risk-free rate adjusted for asset-specific risks. The contingent consideration principally relates to the disposal of our Alaskan business.\n\n## 19.

        "page_content": "## 24. Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nMost group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned. Pension benefits may be provided through defined contribution plans (money purchase schemes) or defined benefit plans (final salary and other types of schemes with committed pension benefit payments). For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee. For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on such factors as an employee's pensionable salary and length of service. Defined benefit plans may be funded or unfunded. The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.\n\nFor information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to accounting for these plans see Pensions and other post-retirement benefits in Note 1.\n\nThe pension obligation in the UK consists primarily of a funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity. This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four companynominated directors, one independent director and one independent chair nominated by the company. The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan. This plan was closed to new joiners in 2010 and was closed to future accrual on 30 June 2021.\n\nEmployees in the UK are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.\n\nIn the US, all pension benefits now accrue under a cash balance formula. Benefits previously accrued under final salary formulas are legally protected. Retiring US employees typically take their pension benefit in the form of a lump sum payment upon retirement. The plan is funded and its assets are overseen by a fiduciary Investment Committee. During 2023 the committee was composed of six bp employees appointed by the president of bp Corporation North America Inc. (the appointing officer). The Investment Committee is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as the investment policies of the plan. US employees are also eligible to participate in a defined contribution (401k) plan in which employee contributions are matched with company contributions.\n\nIn the US, group companies also provide post-retirement healthcare to eligible retired employees and their dependants (and, in certain legacy cases, life insurance coverage); the entitlement to these benefits is based on the date of hire, the employee remaining in service until a specified age and completion of a minimum period of service.\n\nIn the Eurozone, there are defined benefit pension plans in Germany, France, the Netherlands and other countries. In Germany and France, the majority of the pensions are unfunded. In Germany, the group's largest Eurozone plan, employees receive a pension and also have a choice to supplement their core pension through salary sacrifice. For employees who joined since 2002, the core pension benefit is a career average plan with retirement benefits based on such factors as an employee's pensionable salary and length of service. The returns on the notional contributions made by both the company and employees are based on the interest rate which is set out in German tax law. Retired German employees take their pension benefit typically in the form of an annuity. The German plans are governed by legal agreements between bp and the works council or between bp and the trade union.\n\nThe level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due. During 2023 the aggregate level of contributions was $42 million (2022 $74 million and 2021 $274 million). The aggregate level of contributions in 2024 is expected to be approximately $150 million and includes contributions in all countries that we expect to be required to make contributions by law or under contractual agreements, as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.\n\nFor the primary UK plan there is a funding agreement between the group and the trustee. On a three year cycle a schedule of contributions is agreed covering the next five years. The schedule of contributions is next scheduled to be updated after the 31 December 2023 formal actuarial valuation. No contractually committed funding was due at 31 December 2023. The closure of the defined benefit plan to future accrual reduces the need for funding and the plan's expected future funding volatility.\n\nThe surplus relating to the primary UK pension plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund of any remaining assets once all members have left the plan.\n\nMinimum pension funding in the US is determined by legislation and is supplemented by discretionary contributions. No contributions were made into the US pension plan in 2023 and no statutory funding requirement is expected in the next 12 months.\n\nThe surplus relating to the US pension fund is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that economic benefit can be gained from the surplus through a reduction in future contributions.\n\nThere was no minimum funding requirement for the US plan, and no significant minimum funding requirements in other countries at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe obligation and cost of providing pensions and other post-retirement benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method. The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2023. The UK plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years; valuations are required more frequently in many other countries. The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the primary UK pension plan was as at 31 December 2020; the 31 December 2023 valuation is currently underway. A valuation of the US plan and largest Eurozone plans are carried out annually.",

The inflation rate assumptions for our UK and US plans are based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds. In other countries, including the Eurozone, we use this approach, or advice from the local actuary depending on the information available. The inflation assumptions are used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an increase.\n\nIn addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions. The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the countries in which we provide pensions and have been chosen with regard to applicable published tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the experience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future. bp's most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK, the US and the Eurozone where our mortality assumptions are as follows:\n\n| Mortality assumptions                                     | Years   | Years   | UK   | Years   | Years   | Years   | Years   | Years   | Eurozone   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|------------|\n|                                                           |         |         |      | US      | US      | US      | US      |         |            |\n|                                                           | 2023    | 2022    | 2021 | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    | 2023    | 2022    | 2021       |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently  aged 60   | 27.4    | 26.9    | 26.9 | 25.0    | 25.0    | 24.9    | 26.1    | 26.0    | 25.8       |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently  aged 40   | 29.2    | 28.5    | 28.4 | 26.7    | 26.6    | 26.6    | 28.6    | 28.5    | 28.3       |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently  aged 60 | 29.2    | 28.8    | 28.9 | 28.1    | 28.0    | 27.9    | 29.3    | 29.3    | 29.1       |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently  aged 40 | 30.6    | 30.6    | 30.5 | 29.6    | 29.5    | 29.4    | 31.6    | 31.4    | 31.2       |\n\nPension plan assets are generally held in trusts, the primary objective of which is to accumulate assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the plans. The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.\n\nA proportion of the assets are held in equities, which are expected to generate a higher level of return over the long term, with an acceptable level of risk. In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversified.\n\nThe trustee's long-term investment objective for the primary UK plan as it matures is to invest in assets whose value changes in the same way as the plan liabilities, in order to reduce the level of funding risk. To move towards this objective, the UK plan uses a liability driven investment (LDI) approach for part of the portfolio, investing primarily in government bonds to achieve this matching effect for the most significant plan liability assumptions of interest rate and inflation rate. This is partly funded by short-term sale and repurchase agreements, whereby the plan borrows money using existing bonds as security and which will be bought back at a specified price at an agreed future date. The funds raised are used to invest in further bonds to increase the proportion of assets which match the plan liabilities. The borrowings are shown separately in the analysis of pension plan assets in the table below.\n\nFor the primary UK pension plan there is an agreement with the trustee to increase the proportion of assets with liability matching characteristics over time primarily by reducing the proportion of plan assets held as equities and increasing the proportion held as bonds. There is a similar agreement in place for the primary US plan. During 2023, the asset allocation policy of the UK plan switched 2% of plan assets from equities to bonds (2022 2%). The US asset allocation policy remained consistent.\n\nThe current asset allocation policy for the major plans at 31 December 2023 was as follows:\n\n|                                         | UK   | US   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Asset category                          | %    | %    |\n| Total equity (including private equity) | 8    | 19   |\n| Bonds/cash (including LDI)              | 85   | 81   |\n| Property/real estate                    | 7    | -    |",

The effects shown for the expense in 2024 comprise the total of current service cost and net finance income or expense.\n\n|                                          | $ million   | $ million        | $ million   | $ million   | $ million                     | $ million                     |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                          | UK          | UK               | US          | US          | One percentage point Eurozone | One percentage point Eurozone |\n|                                          | Increase    | Decrease         | Increase    | Decrease    | Increase                      | Decrease                      |\n| Discount rate a                          |             |                  |             |             |                               |                               |\n| Effect on expense in 2024                | (197)       | 173              | (40)        | 46          | (8)                           | 4                             |\n| Effect on obligation at 31 December 2023 | (2,259)     | 2,811            | (449)       | 651         | (608)                         | 737                           |\n| Inflation rate b                         |             |                  |             |             |                               |                               |\n| Effect on expense in 2024                | 89          | (83)             | 7           | (6)         | 34                            | (29)                          |\n| Effect on obligation at 31 December 2023 |             | 1,872    (1,738) | 41          | (35)        | 582                           | (503)                         |\n\n- b The amounts presented reflect the total impact of an inflation rate change on the assumptions for rate of increase in salaries, pensions in payment and deferred pensions.\n\n|                                          | $ million One year increase   | $ million One year increase   | $ million One year increase   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                          | UK                            | US                            | Eurozone                      |\n| Longevity                                |                               |                               |                               |\n| Effect on expense in 2024                | 28                            | 4                             | 10                            |\n| Effect on obligation at 31 December 2023 | 577                           | 64                            | 216                           |\n\n## Estimated future benefit payments and the weighted average duration of defined benefit obligations\n\nThe expected benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, but exclude plan expenses, and the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2023 are as follows:\n\n| Estimated future benefit payments   | UK    | US    | Eurozone   | Other   | $ million Total   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------|-------|------------|---------|-------------------|\n| 2024                                | 1,169 | 474   | 332        | 88      | 2,063             |\n| 2025                                | 1,113 | 469   | 326        | 84      | 1,992             |\n| 2026                                | 1,126 | 456   | 318        | 85      | 1,985             |\n| 2027                                | 1,146 | 458   | 313        | 86      | 2,003             |\n| 2028                                | 1,159 | 441   | 308        | 86      | 1,994             |\n| 2029 - 2033                         | 5,958 | 2,204 | 1,454      | 440     | 10,056            |\n|                                     |       |       |            |         | Years             |\n| Weighted average duration           | 12.9  | 9.3   | 12.9       | 11.4    |                   |",

As part of actively managing its debt portfolio, during the year the group bought back $1.7 billion equivalent of finance debt consisting entirely of euro bonds (2022 $7.4 billion US dollar bonds). Derivatives associated with non-US dollar debt bought back were also terminated. These transactions have no significant impact on net debt or gearing.\n\nThe following table shows the weighted-average interest rates achieved through a combination of borrowings and derivative financial instruments entered into to manage interest rate and currency exposures.\n\n|                  | Fixed rate debt                  | Fixed rate debt                                     | Fixed rate debt   | Floating rate debt Total         | Floating rate debt Total   | Floating rate debt Total   |\n|------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                  | Weighted average interest rate % | Weighted average time for which rate is fixed Years | Amount $ million  | Weighted average interest rate % | Amount $ million           | Amount $ million           |\n|                  |                                  |                                                     |                   |                                  |                            | 2023                       |\n| US dollar        | 4                                | 13                                                  | 33,511            | 8                                | 18,134                     | 51,645                     |\n| Other currencies | 6                                | 7                                                   | 205               | 10                               | 104                        | 309                        |\n|                  |                                  |                                                     | 33,716            |                                  | 18,238                     | 51,954                     |\n|                  |                                  |                                                     |                   |                                  |                            | 2022                       |\n| US dollar        | 3                                | 14                                                  | 28,651            | 6                                | 18,105                     | 46,756                     |\n| Other currencies | 6                                | 8                                                   | 188               | -                                | -                          | 188                        |\n|                  |                                  |                                                     | 28,839            |                                  | 18,105                     | 46,944                     |\n\n## Fair values\n\nThe estimated fair value of finance debt is shown in the table below together with the carrying amount as reflected in the balance sheet.\n\nLong-term borrowings in the table below include the portion of debt that matures in the 12 months from 31 December 2023, whereas in the group balance sheet the amount is reported within current finance debt.\n\nThe carrying amount of the group's short-term borrowings, comprising mainly of commercial paper, approximates their fair value. The fair values of the significant majority of the group's long-term borrowings are determined using quoted prices in active markets, and so fall within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Where quoted prices are not available, quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets are used and such measurements are therefore categorized in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n|                       |            | 2023            |            | $ million 2022   |\n|-----------------------|------------|-----------------|------------|------------------|\n|                       | Fair value | Carrying amount | Fair value | Carrying amount  |\n| Short-term borrowings | 596        | 596             | 901        | 901              |\n| Long-term borrowings  | 48,199     | 51,358          | 41,689     | 46,043           |\n| Total finance debt    | 48,795     | 51,954          | 42,590     | 46,944           |",

Our financial framework seeks to support the pursuit of value growth for shareholders while maintaining a secure financial base.\n\nThe group monitors capital on the basis of gearing, that is, the ratio of net debt to the total of net debt plus total equity. Net debt is calculated as finance debt, as shown in the balance sheet, plus the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risks relating to finance debt for which hedge accounting is applied, less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt and gearing are non-IFRS measures. bp believes these measures provide useful information to investors. Net debt enables investors to see the economic effect of finance debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total. Gearing enables investors to see how significant net debt is relative to total equity. The derivatives are reported on the balance sheet within the headings 'Derivative financial instruments'. All components of equity are included in the denominator of the calculation.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, gearing was 19.7% (2022 20.5%).\n\n| At 31 December                                                         | 2023    | $ million 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|------------------|\n| Finance debt                                                           | 51,954  | 46,944           |\n| Less: fair value asset (liability) of hedges related to finance debt a | (1,988) | (3,673)          |\n|                                                                        | 53,942  | 50,617           |\n| Less: cash and cash equivalents                                        | 33,030  | 29,195           |\n| Net debt                                                               | 20,912  | 21,422           |\n| Total equity                                                           | 85,493  | 82,990           |\n| Gearing                                                                | 19.7 %  | 20.5 %           |\n\nCertain subsidiaries in the group have externally imposed capital requirements and have been in compliance with these requirements throughout the year.\n\nAn analysis of changes in liabilities arising from financing activities is provided below.\n\n|                                                     | $ million    | $ million         | $ million         | $ million                                                                     | $ million                                              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                     | Finance debt | Currency  swaps a | Lease liabilities | Net partner  payable for  leases entered  into on behalf of  joint operations | Total liabilities  arising from  financing  activities |\n| At 1 January 2023                                   | 46,944       | 5,312             | 8,549             | 42                                                                            | 60,847                                                 |\n| Exchange adjustments                                | 33           | -

This primarily includes drilling rigs in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments and retail service stations, oil depots and storage tanks in the customer & products segment as well as office accommodation and vessel charters across the group. The weighted-average remaining lease term for the total lease portfolio is around 7 years (2022 7 years). Some leases have payments that vary with market interest or inflation rates. Certain leases contain residual value guarantees, which may be triggered in certain circumstances such as if market values have significantly declined at the conclusion of the lease.\n\nThe table below shows the timing of the undiscounted cash outflows for the lease liabilities included on the balance sheet.\n\n|                                              | $ million   | $ million   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                              | 2023        | 2022        |\n| Undiscounted lease liability cash flows due: |             |             |\n| Within 1 year                                | 3,038       | 2,348       |\n| 1 to 2 years                                 | 2,177       | 1,728       |\n| 2 to 3 years                                 | 1,386       | 1,232       |\n| 3 to 4 years                                 | 1,139       | 740         |\n| 4 to 5 years                                 | 947         | 632         |\n| 5 to 10 years                                | 3,045       | 1,909       |\n| Over 10 years                                | 1,348       | 1,275       |\n|                                              |             | (1,315)     |\n| Impact of discounting                        | (1,959)     |             |\n| Lease liabilities at 31 December             | 11,121      | 8,549       |\n| Of which - current                           | 2,650       | 2,102       |\n| - non-current                                | 8,471       | 6,447       |\n\nThe group may enter into lease arrangements a number of years before taking control of the underlying asset due to construction lead times or to secure future operational requirements.

For all other financial instruments within the scope of IFRS 9, the carrying amount is either the fair value, or approximates the fair value.\n\nInformation on gains and losses on derivative financial assets and financial liabilities classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss is provided in the derivative gains and losses section of Note 30. Fair value gains and losses related to other assets and liabilities classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss totalled a net loss of $11 million (2022 net loss of $238 million and 2021 net gain of $627 million). Dividend income of $18 million (2022 $14 million and 2021 $11 million) from investments in equity instruments classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss is presented within other income.\n\nInterest income and expenses arising on financial instruments are disclosed in Note 7.\n\n## Financial risk factors\n\nThe group is exposed to a number of different financial risks arising from ordinary business exposures as well as its use of financial instruments including market risks relating to commodity prices; foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; credit risk; and liquidity risk.\n\nThe group financial risk committee (GFRC) advises the chief financial officer (CFO) who oversees the management of these risks. The GFRC is chaired by the CFO and consists of a group of senior managers including the EVP trading and shipping and SVPs treasury, tax, accounting reporting control and planning & performance management. The purpose of the committee is to advise on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the group. The committee provides assurance to the CFO and the chief executive officer (CEO), and via the CEO to the board, that the group's financial risk-taking activity is governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with group policies and group risk appetite.\n\nThe group's trading activities in the oil, natural gas, LNG and power markets are managed within the trading and shipping business. Treasury holds foreign exchange and interest-rate products in the financial markets to hedge group exposures related to debt and hybrid bond issuance; the compliance, control and risk management processes for these activities are managed within the treasury business. All other foreign exchange and interest rate activities within financial markets are performed within the trading and shipping business and are also underpinned by the compliance, control and risk management infrastructure common to the activities of bp's trading and shipping business. All derivative activity is carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. These teams are subject to close financial and management control.\n\nThe trading and shipping business maintains formal governance processes that provide oversight of market risk, credit risk and operational risk associated with trading activity. A policy and risk committee approves value-at-risk delegations, reviews incidents and validates risk-related policies, methodologies and procedures. A commitments committee approves the trading of new products, instruments and strategies and material commitments.\n\nIn addition, the trading and shipping business undertakes derivative activity for risk management purposes under a control framework as described more fully below.\n\n## (a) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from possible market price movements and their impact on the future performance of a business. The primary commodity price risks that the group is exposed to include oil, natural gas and power prices that could adversely affect the value of the group's financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. The group has developed a control framework aimed at managing the volatility inherent in certain of its ordinary business exposures. In accordance with the control framework the group enters into various transactions using derivatives for risk management purposes.\n\nThe major components of market risk are commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk, each of which is discussed below.\n\n## (i) Commodity price risk\n\nThe group's trading and shipping business is responsible for delivering value across the overall crude, oil products, gas, LNG and power supply chains. As such, it routinely enters into spot and term physical commodity contracts in addition to optimising physical storage, pipeline and transportation capacity. These activities expose the group to commodity price risk which is managed by entering into oil, natural gas and power swaps, options and futures.\n\nThe group measures market risk exposure arising from its trading positions in liquid periods using value-at-risk techniques based on Monte Carlo simulation models. These techniques make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market prices over a oneday holding period within a 95% confidence level. Trading activity occurring in liquid periods is subject to value-at-risk and other limits for each trading",

The calculation of potential changes in value within the liquid period considers positions, historical price movements and the correlation of these price movements. Models are regularly reviewed against actual fair value movements to ensure integrity is maintained. The value-at-risk measure is supplemented by stress testing and scenario analysis through simulating the financial impact of certain physical, economic and geo-political scenarios. The value-at-risk measure in respect of the aggregated trading positions in liquid periods at 31 December 2023 was $26 million (2022 $63 million) whereas the average value-at-risk measure for the period was $49 million (2022 $89 million). This measure incorporates the effect of diversification reflecting the offsetting risks across the trading portfolio. Alternative measures are used to monitor exposures which are outside of liquid periods and for which value-at-risk techniques are not appropriate.\n\n## (ii) Foreign currency exchange risk\n\nSince bp has global operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on the group's reported results and future expenditure commitments. The effects of most exchange rate fluctuations are absorbed in business operating results through changing cost competitiveness, lags in market adjustment to movements in rates and translation differences accounted for on specific transactions. For this reason, the total effect of exchange rate fluctuations is not identifiable separately in the group's reported results. The main underlying economic currency of the group's cash flows is the US dollar. This is because bp's major product, oil, is priced internationally in US dollars. bp's foreign currency exchange management policy is to limit economic and material transactional exposures arising from currency movements against the US dollar. The group coordinates the handling of foreign currency exchange risks centrally, by netting off naturally-occurring opposite exposures wherever possible and then managing any material residual foreign currency exchange risks.\n\nMost of the group's borrowings are in US dollars or are hedged with respect to the US dollar. At 31 December 2023, the total foreign currency borrowings not swapped into US dollars amounted to $309 million (2022 $188 million). The group also has in issue perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds in euro, sterling and US dollars. Whilst the contractual terms of these instruments allow the group to defer coupon payments and the repayment of principal indefinitely, the group has chosen to manage the foreign currency exposure relating to the non-US dollar hybrid bonds to their respective first call periods.\n\nThe group manages the net residual foreign currency exposures by constantly reviewing the foreign currency economic value at risk and aims to manage such risk to keep the 12-month foreign currency value at risk below $400 million. At no point over the past three years did the value at risk exceed the maximum risk limit. A continuous assessment is made in respect of the group's foreign currency exposures to capture hedging requirements.\n\nDuring the year, hedge accounting was applied to foreign currency exposure to highly probable forecast capital expenditure commitments. The group fixes the US dollar cost of non-US dollar supplies by using currency forwards for the highly probable forecast capital expenditure. At 31 December 2023 the most significant open contracts in place were for USD equivalent amounts of $296 million sterling and $22 million Euro (2022 $5 million sterling).\n\nWhere the group enters into foreign currency exchange contracts for entrepreneurial trading purposes the activity is controlled using trading value-at-risk techniques as explained in (i) commodity price risk above.\n\n## (iii) Interest rate risk\n\nbp is also exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments, principally finance debt. While the group issues debt and hybrid bonds in a variety of currencies based on market opportunities, it uses derivatives to swap the economic exposure to a floating rate basis, mainly to US dollar floating, but in certain defined circumstances maintains a US dollar fixed rate exposure for a proportion of debt. The proportion of floating rate debt net of interest rate swaps at 31 December 2023 was 35% of total finance debt outstanding (2022 39%). The weighted average interest rate on finance debt at 31 December 2023 was 5% (2022 4%) and the weighted average maturity of fixed rate debt was thirteen years (2022 fourteen years).\n\nThe group's earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the element of the group's finance debt that is contractually floating rate or has been swapped to floating rates (see Note 26). If the interest rates applicable to these floating rate instruments were to have changed by one percentage point on 1 January 2024, it is estimated that the group's finance costs for 2024 would change by approximately $182 million (2022 $181 million).\n\nPrior to June 2023, the main benchmark interest rate to which bp was exposed was 3 month USD LIBOR, primarily in relation to finance debt and derivative contracts. During 2023, bp's internal working group for IBOR reform continued to monitor market developments and managed the transition to alternative benchmark rates. Publication of USD LIBOR tenors, including 3 month USD LIBOR, ceased from 30 June 2023.\n\nFinance debt exposed to IBOR benchmark rates was renegotiated with relevant counterparties and transitioned to reference alternative risk free benchmarks. Amendments to finance debt terms arising were limited only to changes necessary to ensure economic equivalence with the former interest benchmarks, for example credit spread adjustments to the contractual interest rates.\n\nDerivatives that previously referenced USD LIBOR also transitioned to referencing the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) via the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) fallback protocol. The derivatives comprise relevant derivative contracts hedging finance debt and hybrid bonds. In October 2020 the ISDA published its fallback protocol containing clauses to amend derivative contracts on the cessation of LIBOR should an entity and its counterparties adhere to the protocol. The protocol's pricing mechanism is at fair market value and bp has signed up to the protocol as this removes transition uncertainty for any interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts of the group. New contracts are being executed based on the new risk free rates. As at 31 December 2023, bp has no remaining contractual exposure to interest rate benchmark reform.\n\n## (b) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due causing financial loss to the group and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with financial institutions and principally from credit exposures to customers relating to outstanding receivables. Credit exposure also exists in relation to guarantees issued by group companies under which the outstanding exposure incremental to that recognized on the balance sheet at 31 December 2023 was $1,655 million (2022 $1,704 million) in respect of liabilities of joint ventures and associates and $598 million (2022 $680 million) in respect of liabilities of other third parties. An amount of $201 million (2022 $267 million) is recorded as a liability at 31 December 2023 in relation to these guarantees. For all guarantees, maturity dates vary, and the guarantees will terminate on payment and/or cancellation of the obligation. In general, a payment under the guarantee contract would be triggered by failure of the guaranteed party to fulfil its obligation covered by the guarantee.",

        "page_content": "## 29. Financial instruments and financial risk factors - continued\n\nThe group has a credit policy, approved by the CFO, that is designed to ensure that consistent processes are in place throughout the group to measure and control credit risk. Credit risk is considered as part of the risk-reward balance of doing business. On entering into any business contract the extent to which the arrangement exposes the group to credit risk is considered. Key requirements of the policy include segregation of credit approval authorities from any sales, marketing or trading teams authorized to incur credit risk; the establishment of credit systems and processes to ensure that all counterparty exposure is rated and that all counterparty exposure and limits can be monitored and reported; and the timely identification and reporting of any nonapproved credit exposures and credit losses. While each segment is responsible for its own credit risk management and reporting consistent with group policy, treasury holds group-wide credit risk authority and oversight responsibility for exposure to banks and financial institutions.\n\nFor the purposes of financial reporting the group calculates expected loss allowances based on the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk. Lifetime expected credit losses are recognized for trade receivables and the credit risk associated with the significant majority of financial assets measured at amortized cost is considered to be low. Since the tenor of substantially all of the group's in-scope financial assets is less than 12 months there is no significant difference between the measurement of 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses. Expected loss allowances for financial guarantee contracts are typically lower than their initial fair value less, where appropriate, amortization. Financial assets are considered to be credit-impaired when there is reasonable and supportable evidence that one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. This includes observable data concerning significant financial difficulty of the counterparty; a breach of contract; concession being granted to the counterparty for economic or contractual reasons relating to the counterparty's financial difficulty, that would not otherwise be considered; it becoming probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or other financial re-organization or an active market for the financial asset disappearing because of financial difficulties. The group also applies a rebuttable presumption that an asset is credit-impaired when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. Where the group has no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof, for example where all legal avenues for collection of amounts due have been exhausted, the financial asset (or relevant portion) is written off.\n\nThe measurement of expected credit losses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss after recovery if there is a default) and the exposure at default (i.e. the asset's carrying amount). The group allocates a credit risk rating to exposures based on data that is determined to be predictive of the risk of loss, including but not limited to external ratings. Probabilities of default derived from historical, current and future-looking market data are assigned by credit risk rating with a loss given default based on historical experience and relevant market and academic research applied by exposure type. Experienced credit judgement is applied to ensure probabilities of default are reflective of the credit risk associated with the group's exposures. Credit enhancements that would reduce the group's credit losses in the event of default are reflected in the calculation when they are considered integral to the related asset.\n\nThe maximum credit exposure associated with financial assets is equal to the carrying amount. The group does not aim to remove credit risk entirely but expects to experience a certain level of credit losses. As at 31 December 2023, the group had in place credit enhancements designed to mitigate approximately $12.0 billion (2022 $12.6 billion) of credit risk of which approximately $10.7 billion (2022 $10.3 billion) related to assets in the scope of IFRS 9's impairment requirements. Credit enhancements include standby and documentary letters of credit, bank guarantees, insurance and liens which are typically taken out with financial institutions who have investment grade credit ratings, or are liens over assets held by the counterparty of the related receivables. Reports are regularly prepared and presented to the GFRC that cover the group's overall credit exposure and expected loss trends, exposure by segment, and overall quality of the portfolio.\n\nManagement information used to monitor credit risk, which reflects the impact of credit enhancements, indicates that the risk profile of financial assets which are subject to review for impairment under IFRS 9 is as set out in the table below.\n\n| As at 31 December   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|\n| AAA to AA-          | 7 %    | 9 %    |\n| A+ to A-            | 59 %   | 49 %   |\n| BBB+ to BBB-        | 15 %   | 15 %   |\n| BB+ to BB-          | 7 %    | 11 %   |\n| B+ to B-            | 4 %    | 12 %   |\n| CCC+ and below      | 8 %    | 4 %    |\n\nMovements in the impairment provision for trade and other receivables are shown in Note 21.",

The group's liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and currency requirements to the central treasury function. Unless restricted by local regulations, generally subsidiaries pool their cash surpluses to the treasury function, which will then arrange to fund other subsidiaries' requirements, or invest any net surplus in the market or arrange for necessary external borrowings, while managing the group's overall net currency positions. While there is the potential for concerns about the energy transition to impact banks' or debt investors' appetite to finance hydrocarbon activity, we do not anticipate any material change to the group's funding or liquidity in the short to medium term as a result of such concerns.\n\nThe group benefits from open credit provided by suppliers who generally sell on five to 60-day payment terms in accordance with industry norms. bp utilizes various arrangements in order to manage its working capital and reduce volatility in cash flow. This includes discounting of receivables and, in the supply and trading businesses, managing inventory, collateral and supplier payment terms within a maximum of 60 days.\n\nIt is normal practice in the oil and gas supply and trading business for customers and suppliers to utilize letter of credit (LC) facilities to mitigate credit and non-performance risk. Consequently, LCs facilitate active trading in a global market where credit and performance risk can be significant. In common with the industry, bp routinely provides LCs to some of its suppliers.\n\nThe group has committed LC facilities totalling $13,180 million (2022 $12,730 million), allowing LCs to be issued for a maximum 24-month duration. There were also uncommitted secured LC facilities in place at 31 December 2023 for $3,515 million (2022 $3,800 million), which are secured against inventories or receivables when utilized. The facilities are held with over 28 international banks. The uncommitted LC facilities can only be terminated by either party giving a stipulated termination notice to the other.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the supplier has the option to request accelerated payment from the LC provider in order to further reduce their exposure. bp's payments are made to the provider of the LC rather than the supplier according to the original contractual payment terms. At 31 December 2023, $9,955 million (2022 $9,520 million) of the group's trade payables subject to these arrangements were payable to LC providers, with no material exposure to any individual provider. If these facilities were not available, this could result in renegotiation of payment terms with suppliers such that settlement periods were shorter.\n\nStandard & Poor's Ratings long-term credit rating for bp is A- (positive) and Moody's Investors Service rating is A2 (positive) and the Fitch Ratings' longterm credit rating is A+ (stable).\n\nDuring 2023, $6 billion (2022 $2 billion) of long-term taxable bonds were issued with terms ranging from seven to 15 years. In addition the group drew down on perpetual hybrid capital instruments with a US dollar equivalent value of $0.2 billion (2022 $0.4 billion). Commercial paper is issued at competitive rates to meet short-term borrowing requirements as and when needed.\n\nAs a further liquidity measure, the group continues to maintain suitable levels of cash and cash equivalents, amounting to $33.0 billion at 31 December 2023 (2022 $29.2 billion), primarily invested with highly rated banks or money market funds and readily accessible at immediate and short notice. At 31 December 2023, the group had substantial amounts of undrawn borrowing facilities available, consisting of an undrawn committed $8.0 billion (2022 $8.0 billion) credit facility and $4.0 billion (2022 $4.0 billion) of standby facilities. As at 31 December 2023 $0.2 billion of the credit facility was available for one year and $7.8 billion was available for 2 years. As at 31 December 2023 $0.1 billion of the standby facilities were available for three years and $3.9 billion were available for four years. The facilities are with 27 international banks and borrowings under them would be at pre-agreed rates.\n\nFor further information on the group's sources and uses of cash see Liquidity and capital resources on page 340.\n\nThe group manages liquidity risk associated with derivative contracts, other than derivative hedging instruments, based on the expected maturities of both derivative assets and liabilities as indicated in Note 30. Management does not currently anticipate any cash flows, other than noted below, that could be of a significantly different amount or could occur earlier than the expected maturity analysis provided.",

As part of actively managing the group's debt portfolio it is possible that cash flows in relation to associated derivatives could be accelerated from the profile provided. The amounts reflect the gross settlement amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately from the receive leg, as in the case of cross-currency swaps hedging non-US dollar finance debt or hybrid bonds. The swaps are with high investment-grade counterparties and therefore the settlement-day risk exposure is considered to be negligible. Not shown in the table are the gross settlement amounts (inflows) for the receive leg of derivatives that are settled separately from the pay leg, which amount to $24,120 million at 31 December 2023 (2022 $23,970 million) to be received on the same day as the related cash outflows.\n\n| Cash outflows for derivative financial instruments at 31 December   | 2023   | $ million 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------|\n| Within one year                                                     | 2,071  | 1,492            |\n| 1 to 2 years                                                        | 1,718  | 2,531            |\n| 2 to 3 years                                                        | 5,136  | 2,053            |\n| 3 to 4 years                                                        | 3,077  | 5,575            |\n| 4 to 5 years                                                        | 1,743  | 3,584            |\n| 5 to 10 years                                                       | 6,708  | 7,627            |\n| Over 10 years                                                       | 4,092  | 2,772            |\n|                                                                     | 24,545 | 25,634           |\n\nFor further information on our derivative financial instruments, see Note 30.\n\n## 30. Derivative financial instruments\n\nIn the normal course of business the group enters into derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to manage its normal business exposures in relation to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt, consistent with risk management policies and objectives. An outline of the group's financial risks and the objectives and policies pursued in relation to those risks is set out in Note 29. Additionally, the group has a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation that is undertaken in conjunction with these activities using a similar range of contracts.\n\nFor information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to the valuation of derivatives see Derivative financial instruments within Note 1.\n\nThe fair values of derivative financial instruments at 31 December are set out below.\n\nExchange traded derivatives are valued using closing prices provided by the exchange as at the balance sheet date. These derivatives are categorized within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Exchange traded derivatives are typically considered settled through the (normally daily) payment or receipt of variation margin.\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) financial swaps, forwards and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are generally valued using readily available information in the public markets and quotations provided by brokers and price index developers. These quotes are corroborated with market data and are categorized within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nIn certain less liquid markets, or for longer-term contracts, forward prices are not as readily available. In these circumstances, OTC financial swaps and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are valued using internally developed methodologies that consider historical relationships between various commodities, and that result in management's best estimate of fair value. These contracts are categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.",

Derivative financial instruments - continued\n\nFinancial OTC and physical commodity options are valued using industry standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic factors. The degree to which these inputs are observable in the forward markets determines whether the option is categorized within level 2 or level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n|                                | $ million        | $ million            | $ million        | $ million            |\n|--------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n|                                | 2023             | 2023                 | 2023             | 2022                 |\n|                                | Fair value asset | Fair value liability | Fair value asset | Fair value liability |\n| Derivatives held for trading a |                  |                      |                  |                      |\n| Currency derivatives           | 478              | (1,511)              | 634              | (2,346)              |\n| Oil price derivatives          | 1,859            | (1,139)              | 2,753            | (1,961)              |\n| Natural gas price derivatives  | 14,750           | (6,708)              | 15,437           | (12,129)             |\n| Power price derivatives        | 5,355            | (4,187)              | 5,527            | (6,004)              |\n| Other derivatives              | 2                | -                    | 44               | -                    |\n|                                | 22,444           | (13,545)             | 24,395           | (22,440)             |\n| Embedded derivatives           |                  |                      |                  |                      |\n| Other embedded derivatives     | -                | -                    | -                | (41)                 |\n|                                | -                | -                    | -                | (41)                 |\n| Cash flow hedges               |                  |                      |                  |                      |\n| Currency forwards              | -                | (1)                  | -                | -                    |\n|                                | -                | (1)                  | -                | -                    |\n| Fair value hedges              |                  |                      |                  |                      |\n| Currency swaps                 | 119              | (2,102)              | -                | (3,670)              |\n| Interest rate swaps            | -                | (4)                  | -                | (4)                  |\n|                                | 119              | (2,106)              | -                | (3,674)              |\n|                                | 22,563           | (15,652)             | 24,395           | (26,155)             |\n| Of which - current             | 12,583           | (5,250)              | 11,554           | (12,618)             |\n| - non-current                  | 9,980            | (10,402)             | 12,841           | (13,537)             |\n\n## Derivatives held for trading\n\nThe group maintains active trading positions in a variety of derivatives. The contracts may be entered into for risk management purposes, to satisfy supply requirements or for entrepreneurial trading. Certain contracts are classified as held for trading, regardless of their original business objective, and are recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. Trading activities are undertaken by using a range of contract types in combination to create incremental gains by arbitraging prices between markets, locations and time periods. The net of these exposures is monitored using market value-at-risk techniques as described in Note 29.\n\nThe following tables show further information on the fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments held for trading purposes.\n\nDerivative assets held for trading have the following fair values and maturities.\n\n|                               | $ million 2023   | $ million 2023   | $ million 2023   | $ million 2023   | $ million 2023   | $ million 2023   | $ million 2023   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                               | Less than 1 year | 1-2 years        | 2-3 years        | 3-4 years        | 4-5 years        | Over 5 years     | Total            |\n| Currency derivatives          | 95               | 31               | 38               | 33               | 28               | 253              | 478              |\n| Oil price derivatives         | 1,423            | 206              | 81               | 52               | 41               | 56               | 1,859            |\n| Natural gas price derivatives | 8,705            | 1,412            | 625              | 458              | 426              | 3,124            | 14,750           |\n| Power price derivatives       | 2,339            | 961              | 513              | 360              | 250              | 932              | 5,355            |\n| Other derivatives             | -                | -                | -                | -                | -                | 2                | 2                |\n|                               | 12,562           | 2,610            | 1,257            | 903              | 745              | 4,367            | 22,444           |\n\n|                               | $ million        | $ million   | $ million   | $ million   | $ million   | $ million    | $ million   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|\n|                               | Less than 1 year | 1-2 years   | 2-3 years   | 3-4 years   | 4-5 years   | Over 5 years | Total       |\n| Currency derivatives          | 536              | 14          | 10          | 10          | 9           | 55           | 634         |\n| Oil price derivatives         | 1,971            | 445         | 150         | 63          | 35          | 89           | 2,753       |\n| Natural gas price derivatives | 7,157            | 3,740       | 749         | 442         | 316         | 3,033        | 15,437      |\n| Power price derivatives       | 1,848            | 1,317       | 623         | 376         | 291         | 1,072        | 5,527       |\n| Other derivatives             | 42               | -           | -           | -           | -           | 2            | 44          |\n|                               | 11,554           | 5,516       | 1,532       | 891         | 651         | 4,251        | 24,395      |",

Gains or losses arise on contracts entered into for risk management purposes, optimization activity and entrepreneurial trading. They also arise on certain contracts that are for normal procurement or sales activity for the group but that are required to be fair valued under accounting standards. These gains and losses are included within sales and other operating revenues in the income statement. Also included within this line item are gains and losses on inventory held for trading purposes. The total amount relating to all these items was a net gain of $19,786 million (2022 $7,829 million net gain). This number does not include gains and losses on the change in value of contracts which are not recognized under IFRS such as transportation and storage contracts, but does include the associated financially settled contracts. The net amounts for actual gains and losses relating to these derivative contracts and all related items therefore differ significantly from the amounts disclosed above.\n\nAs outlined in Note 1 - Significant estimate and judgement: derivative financial instruments, LNG contracts are only recognised in the financial statements when associated cargoes are lifted. The embedded value in these contracts is not recognised and is subject to underlying commodity price volatility, as observed during 2022 and 2023. bp realised significant profits in 2023 as LNG cargoes were delivered. bp generally price risk manages the exposure to LNG cargoes due for delivery in the near term where there is a liquid market. It does so on a portfolio basis using derivative instruments amongst other price risk management strategies. Under IFRS, these derivative instruments, which are subject to similar price volatility, are recorded at fair value through profit and loss at each reporting period, which creates an accounting mismatch in the financial statements between the accounting for LNG contracts and the derivatives used for risk management. For the year ended 31 December 2023, there were material gains recognized on the associated derivative positions due to the movement in the underlying commodity prices. For the year ended 31 December 2022, there were no material gains or losses recorded on the associated derivative positions. For additional information, details of management's internal measure of performance are given in the Group Performance Report on page 35 and on page 338.\n\nThe group also enters into derivative contracts relating to foreign currency risk management activities including contracts that the group has entered into to manage the foreign currency exposure relating to the non-US dollar hybrid bonds to their respective first call periods. The change in the unrealized value of these contracts was a net gain of $632 million (2022 $1,280 million net loss and 2021 $775 million net loss). Where the derivative is economically hedging finance debt, gains and losses on such derivative contracts are included within finance costs. Where the derivative is managing non-US hybrid bond exposure gains and loss are included within production and manufacturing expenses. Where these gains and losses arise on derivatives hedging finance debt they are largely offset by opposing net foreign exchange differences on retranslation of the associated non-US dollar debt. The net amounts for actual gains and losses relating to these derivative contracts and all related items therefore differ significantly from the amounts disclosed above.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\n## (i) Foreign currency risk of highly probable forecast capital expenditure\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the group held currency forwards designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships of highly probable forecast non-US dollar capital expenditure. Note 29 outlines the group's approach to foreign currency exchange risk management. When the highly probable forecast capital expenditure designated as a hedged item occurs, a non-financial asset is recognized and is presented within the fixed asset section of the balance sheet.\n\nThe group claims hedge accounting only for the spot value of the currency exposure in line with the strategy to fix the volatility in the spot exchange rate element. The fair value on the instrument attributable to forward points and foreign currency basis spreads is taken immediately to the income statement.",

        "page_content": "## 30. Derivative financial instruments - continued\n\nThe group applies hedge accounting where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship is determined at inception and prospectively by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item. The group enters into hedging derivatives that match the currency and notional of the hedged items on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional designated on the forecast transaction. The group determines the extent to which it hedges highly probable forecast capital expenditures on a project by project basis.\n\nThe group has identified the following sources of ineffectiveness, which are not expected to be material:\n\n- \u00b7 counterparty's credit risk, the group mitigates counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative transactions with high credit quality counterparties; and\n- \u00b7 differences in settlement timing between the derivative and hedged items. The latter impacts the discount factor used in the calculation of the hedge ineffectiveness. The group mitigates differences in timing between the derivatives and hedged items by applying a rolling strategy and by hedging currency pairs from stable economies. The group's cash flow hedge designations are highly effective as the sources of ineffectiveness identified are expected to result in minimal hedge ineffectiveness.\n\nThe group has not designated any net positions as hedged items in cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk.\n\n## (ii) Commodity price risk of highly probable forecast sales\n\nDuring the period the group held Henry Hub NYMEX futures designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships of certain highly probable forecast future sales. Henry Hub NYMEX futures are subject to daily settlement, where their fair value at the end of each day is required to be cash settled, such that the carrying amount of these hedging instruments within continuing hedge relationships is always zero at the end of each day.\n\nThe group is exposed to the variability in the gas price, but only applied hedge accounting to the risk of Henry Hub price movements for a percentage of future gas sales from its BPX Energy business.\n\nThe group applied hedge accounting in relation to these highly probable future sales where there was an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship was determined at inception and prospectively by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item. The group entered into hedging derivatives that matched the notional amounts of the hedged items on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio was determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional amount designated on the forecast transaction.\n\nThe hedge was highly effective due to the price index of the hedging instruments matching the price index of the hedged item. The group did not designate any net positions as hedged items in cash flow hedges of commodity price risk.\n\nThe tables below summarize the change in the fair value of hedging instruments and the hedged item used to calculate ineffectiveness in the period.\n\n|                                                                    | Change in fair  value of hedging  instrument used  to calculate  ineffectiveness   | Change in fair  value of hedged  item used to  calculate  ineffectiveness   | Hedge  ineffectiveness  recognized in  profit or (loss)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| At 31 December 2023                                                |                                                                                    |                                                                             |                                                           |\n| Cash flow hedges                                                   |                                                                                    |                                                                             |                                                           |\n| Foreign exchange risk                                              |                                                                                    |                                                                             |                                                           |\n| Highly probable forecast capital expenditure                       | 1                                                                                  | (1)                                                                         | -                                                         |\n| Commodity price risk                                               |                                                                                    |                                                                             |                                                           |\n| Highly probable forecast sales                                     | 1,065                                                                              | (1,065)                                                                     | -                                                         |\n| At 31 December 2022                                                |                                                                                    |                                                                             |                                                           |\n| Cash flow hedges                                                   |                                                                                    |                                                                             |                                                           |\n| Foreign exchange risk Highly probable forecast capital expenditure | -                                                                                  | -                                                                           | -                                                         |\n| Commodity price risk                                               |                                                                                    |                                                                             |                                                           |\n| Highly probable forecast sales                                     | (825)                                                                              | 825                                                                         | -                                                         |",

Note 29 outlines the group's approach to interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk management. The interest rate swaps are used to convert US dollar denominated fixed rate borrowings into floating rate debt. The cross-currency interest rate swaps are used to convert sterling, euro, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone denominated fixed rate borrowings into US dollar floating rate debt. The group manages all risks derived from debt issuance, such as credit risk, however, the group applies hedge accounting only to certain components of interest rate and foreign currency risk in order to minimize hedge ineffectiveness. The interest rate and foreign currency exposures are identified and hedged on an instrument-by-instrument basis. For interest rate exposures, the group designates as a fair value hedge the benchmark interest rate component only. This is an observable and reliably measurable component of interest rate risk.\n\nbp's fair value hedge accounting relationships have been directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform. Prior to 2023, the group's swaps which reference interest rates were primarily exposed to 3 month USD LIBOR. During 2023, all the swaps that previously referenced USD LIBOR transitioned to referencing SOFR through activation of the ISDA fallback clauses. The transition was enacted on an 'economically equivalent' basis. No other changes were made to the terms of swap contracts upon transition to SOFR. The hedge relationships were not discontinued and SOFR is now assessed as the hedged interest rate benchmark risk. The interest rate benchmark reform did not change the risk management strategy for fair value hedges. New derivative hedging instruments are being executed based on the new risk free rates.\n\nFor foreign currency exposures, the group excludes from the designation the foreign currency basis spread component implicit in the cross-currency interest rate swaps. This is separately calculated at hedge designation, is recognized in other comprehensive income over the life of the hedge and amortized to the income statement on a straight-line basis, in accordance with the group's policy on costs of hedging.",

        "page_content": "## 30. Derivative financial instruments - continued\n\nThe group applies hedge accounting where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship is determined initially by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item and it is prospectively assessed using linear regression analysis. The group issues fixed rate debt and enters into interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps with critical terms that match those of the debt and on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional amount of the debt. The hedge relationship is designated for the full term and notional value of the debt. Both the hedging instrument and the hedged item are expected to be held to maturity.\n\nThe group has identified the following sources of ineffectiveness, which are not expected to be material:\n\n- \u00b7 derivative counterparty's credit risk which is not offset by the hedged item. This risk is mitigated by entering into derivative transactions only with high credit quality counterparties; and\n- \u00b7 sensitivity to interest rate between the hedged item and the derivatives. This is driven by differences in payment frequencies between the instrument and the bond.\n\nThe tables below summarize the change in the fair value of hedging instruments and the hedged item used to calculate ineffectiveness in the period.

On a poll, shareholders present in person or by proxy have two votes for every \u00a35 in nominal amount of the first and second preference shares held and one vote for every ordinary share held. On a show-of-hands vote on other resolutions (procedural matters) at a general meeting, shareholders present in person or by proxy have one vote each.\n\nIn the event of the winding up of the company, preference shareholders would be entitled to a sum equal to the capital paid up on the preference shares, plus an amount in respect of accrued and unpaid dividends and a premium equal to the higher of (i) 10% of the capital paid up on the preference shares and (ii) the excess of the average market price of such shares on the London Stock Exchange during the previous six months over par value.\n\nDuring 2023 the company repurchased 1,263 million ordinary shares for a total consideration of $7,918 million, including transaction costs of $43 million. All shares purchased were for cancellation. The repurchased shares represented 7.1% of ordinary share capital. A further 156 million ordinary shares were repurchased between the end of the reporting period and 16 February 2024, the latest practicable date before the completion of these financial statements, for a total cost of $922 million of which $746 million has been accrued at 31 December 2023. The number of shares in issue is reduced when shares are repurchased.\n\n## Treasury shares a\n\n|                                                            | 2023            | 2023                    | 2022            | 2022                    | 2021            | 2021                    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|\n|                                                            | Shares thousand | Nominal value $ million | Shares thousand | Nominal value $ million | Shares thousand | Nominal value $ million |\n| At 1 January                                               | 1,124,927       | 281                     | 1,137,457       | 283                     | 1,187,650       | 296                     |\n| Purchases for settlement of employee share plans           | 24,688          | 6                       | 14,150          | 4                       | 1,432           | -                       |\n| Issue of new shares for employee share-based payment plans | 71,039          | 19                      | 55,000          | 14                      | 35,096          | 9                       |\n| Shares re-issued for employee share-based payment plans    | (143,575)       | (35)                    | (81,680)        | (20)                    | (86,721)        | (22)                    |\n| At 31 December                                             | 1,077,079       | 271                     | 1,124,927       | 281                     | 1,137,457       | 283                     |\n| Of which - shares held in treasury by bp                   | 726,339         | 183                     | 940,571         | 235                     | 1,037,201       | 259                     |\n| - shares held in ESOP trusts                               | 350,704         | 88                      | 184,356         | 46                      | 100,256         | 24                      |\n| - shares held by bp's US share plan administrator b        | 36              | -                       | -               | -                       | -               | -                       |\n\nFor each year presented, the balance of shares held in treasury by bp at 1 January represents 4.9% (2022 5.0% and 2021 5.2%) of the called-up ordinary share capital of the company.\n\nDuring 2023, the movement in shares held in treasury by bp represented 1.1% (2022 less than 0.5% and 2021 less than 0.3%) of the ordinary share capital of the company.",

        "page_content": "## 32. Capital and reserves - continued\n\n## Share capital\n\nThe balance on the share capital account represents the aggregate nominal value of all ordinary and preference shares in issue, including treasury shares.\n\n## Share premium account\n\nThe balance on the share premium account represents the amounts received in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary and preference shares.\n\n## Capital redemption reserve\n\nThe balance on the capital redemption reserve represents the aggregate nominal value of all the ordinary shares repurchased and cancelled.\n\n## Merger reserve\n\nThe balance on the merger reserve represents the fair value of the consideration given in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary shares issued in an acquisition made by the issue of shares.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares represent bp shares repurchased and available for specific and limited purposes. For accounting purposes shares held in Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) and bp's US share plan administrator to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the financial statements as treasury shares. The ESOPs are funded by the group and have waived their rights to dividends in respect of such shares held for future awards. Until such time as the shares held by the ESOPs vest unconditionally to employees, the amount paid for those shares is shown as a reduction in shareholders' equity. Assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as assets and liabilities of the group.\n\n## Investments in equity instruments\n\nThis reserve records the change in fair value of investments in equity instruments for which the group has elected to recognize fair value gains and losses in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Foreign currency translation reserve\n\nThe foreign currency translation reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations. Upon disposal of foreign operations, the related accumulated exchange differences are reclassified to the income statement.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThis reserve records the portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge. For further information on the accounting for cash flow hedges see Note 1 - Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\n\n## Costs of hedging\n\nThis reserve records the change in fair value of the foreign currency basis spread of financial instruments to which cost of hedge accounting has been applied. The accumulated amount relates to time-period related hedged items and is amortized to profit or loss over the term of the hedging relationship. For further information on the accounting for costs of hedging see Note 1 - Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\n\n## Profit and loss account\n\nThe balance held on this reserve is the accumulated retained profits of the group.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to bp shareholders. Included within noncontrolling interests are perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds issued by BP Capital Markets p.l.c., a group subsidiary, on 17 June 2020 in euro, sterling and US dollars for a US dollar equivalent amount of $11.9 billion. The hybrid bonds include redemption options exercisable at the group's discretion from June 2025 to March 2030 (the first 'call date'), on specified dates thereafter, or in the event of specific circumstances (such as a change in IFRS or tax regime) as set out in the individual terms of each issue. Coupons are fixed for an initial period up to dates from September 2025 to June 2030 at rates of 3.25% to 4.875% and reset to rates determined by the contractual terms of each instrument on certain dates thereafter. The contractual terms of the hybrid bonds allow the group to defer coupon payments and the repayment of principal indefinitely, however their terms and conditions stipulate that any deferred payments must be made in the event of an announcement of an ordinary share or parity equity dividend distribution or certain share repurchases or redemptions. Payments made to and profit attributed to these hybrid bond holders in the year totalled $477 million (2022 $468 million and 2021 $499 million) and $473 million (2022 $468 million and 2021 $497 million) respectively. The accumulated non-controlling interest at the end of the year was $12,066 million (2022 $12,066 million). On 26 February BP Capital Markets p.l.c. issued a further $1.3 billion of US dollar perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds with a coupon fixed for an initial period up to 2034 of 6.45%. On 26 February BP Capital Markets p.l.c. announced its intent to voluntarily buy back up to $1.3 billion of the non-call 2025 4.375% US dollar hybrid bonds issued in 2020. Taken together these transactions are not expected to have a significant impact on net debt or gearing.\n\nNon-controlling interests also includes perpetual subordinated hybrid securities issued during 2023, 2022 and 2021 by a group subsidiary. The proceeds from these issuances were specifically earmarked to fund the forward purchase and leaseback of an under-construction floating, production, storage, and offloading vessel (FPSO) to be used on one of the group's major projects. The contractual terms of these instruments allow the group to defer interest payments and repayment of principal indefinitely however their terms and conditions stipulate that the group must purchase them on the occurrence of certain events, all within the group's control, including the declaration or payment of a BP p.l.c. distribution after mid-May 2026. Payments made to and profit attributed to these hybrid security holders in the year totalled $114 million (2022 $61 million) and $113 million (2022 $51 million) respectively. The accumulated non-controlling interest at the end of the year was $1,500 million (2022 $1,324 million).\n\nAs the group has the unconditional right to avoid transferring cash or another financial asset in relation to these hybrid bonds and securities, they are classified as equity instruments and reported within non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements.",

Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nThere were contingent liabilities at 31 December 2023 in respect of guarantees and indemnities entered into as part of the ordinary course of the group's business. No material losses are likely to arise from such contingent liabilities. Further information on financial guarantees is included in Note 29.\n\nIn the normal course of the group's business, bp group entities are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings arising out of current and past operations, including matters related to commercial disputes, product liability, antitrust, commodities trading, premises-liability claims, consumer protection, general health, safety, climate change and environmental claims and allegations of exposures of third parties to toxic substances, such as lead pigment in paint, asbestos and other chemicals. The amounts claimed could be significant and could be material to the group's results of operations, financial position or liquidity. While it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in some cases, bp expects that the impact of current legal and regulatory proceedings on the group's results of operations, liquidity or financial position will not be material.\n\nThe group files tax returns in many jurisdictions across the world. Various tax authorities are currently examining these returns, which contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. The resolution of tax positions through negotiations with relevant tax authorities, or through litigation, can take several years to complete and the amounts could be significant and could, in aggregate, be material to the group's results of operations, financial position or liquidity. While it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in some cases, bp does not expect there to be any material impact upon the group's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.",

Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings - continued\n\nThe group is subject to numerous national and local health, safety and environmental laws and regulations concerning its products, operations and other activities. These laws and regulations may require the group to take future action to remediate the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of chemicals or petroleum substances by the group or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites including refineries, chemical plants, oil fields, commodities extraction sites, service stations, terminals and waste disposal sites. In addition, the group may have obligations relating to prior asset sales or closed facilities. The ultimate requirement for remediation and its costs are inherently difficult to estimate. However, the estimated cost of environmental obligations has been provided in these accounts in accordance with the group's accounting policies. While the amounts of future possible costs that are not provided for could be significant and material to the group's results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, it is not possible to estimate the amounts involved. bp does not expect these costs to have a material impact on the group's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\n\nIf production and manufacturing facilities and pipelines are sold to third parties and the subsequent owner is unable to meet their decommissioning obligations it is possible that, in certain circumstances, bp could be partially or wholly responsible for decommissioning. The group estimates that for production facilities, approximately $16 billion (2022 $16 billion) of associated decommissioning obligations were previously transferred to third parties. While the amounts associated with decommissioning provisions reverting to the group could be material, bp is not currently aware of any such material cases that have a greater than remote chance of reverting to the group. Furthermore, as described in Provisions and contingencies within Note 1, decommissioning provisions associated with customers & products facilities are not generally recognized as the potential obligations cannot be measured given their indeterminate settlement dates.\n\nBy their nature, it is not practicable to estimate the potential financial impact or possible timing of the above contingencies as there are significant uncertainties that are dependent on various factors that are not within the group's control.\n\n## Contingent liabilities related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill\n\nFor information on legal proceedings relating to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, see Legal proceedings below. Any outstanding Deepwater Horizon related claims are not expected to have a material impact on the group's financial performance.\n\n## Legal proceedings\n\n## Proceedings relating to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill\n\n## Introduction\n\nBP Exploration & Production Inc. (BPXP) was lease operator of Mississippi Canyon, Block 252 in the Gulf of Mexico, where the semi-submersible rig Deepwater Horizon was deployed at the time of the 20 April 2010 explosion and fire and resulting oil spill (the Incident). Lawsuits and claims arising from the Incident were brought principally in US federal and state courts. The remaining proceedings arising from the Incident are discussed below.\n\n## Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement\n\nIn 2012 the Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement (Medical Settlement) was entered into with the plaintiffs steering committee. It includes an exclusive remedy provision regarding class members pursuing exposure-based personal injury claims for later-manifested physical conditions (LMPCs). As of 31 December 2023, there were 60 pending lawsuits brought by class members claiming LMPCs.\n\n## Other civil complaints - personal injury\n\nThe vast majority of post-explosion clean-up, medical monitoring and personal injury claims from individuals that either opted out of the Medical Settlement and/or were excluded from that settlement have been dismissed (including more than 600 cases in which the courts granted BPXP's motions for summary judgment). As of 31 December 2023, 88 cases remained pending in the district courts and around 100 appeals filed to the Fifth Circuit in cases where the district courts have granted summary judgment in favour of bp also remain pending.\n\n## Non-US government lawsuits\n\nTwo class actions are pending in Mexican Federal District Courts against various bp group entities including BPXP and BP America Production Company by separate plaintiff classes. Although the two actions are separate, both broadly seek penalties, damages and compensation for alleged environmental, health and economic harm in Mexico as a result of the Incident. One of the actions also seeks an order requiring the bp defendants to repair alleged damage to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nbp has answered the complaints in both actions by seeking dismissal on various grounds including that no oil reached Mexican waters or land and there was no economic or environmental harm in Mexico.\n\nThese legal actions remain at a relatively early stage and while it is not possible to predict the outcome, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends to defend such actions vigorously.",

        "page_content": "## 33 . Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings - continued\n\n## Other legal proceedings\n\nFERC and CFTC matters\n\nFollowing an investigation by the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of several bp entities, the Administrative Law Judge of the FERC ruled on 13 August 2015 that bp manipulated the market by selling next-day, fixed price natural gas at Houston Ship Channel in 2008 in order to suppress the Gas Daily index and benefit its financial position. In 2016, the FERC issued an Order affirming that decision and directing bp to pay a civil penalty of $20.16 million and to disgorge $207,169 in unjust profits. Following an appeal by bp to the US Court of Appeals, the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion upholding the FERC's manipulation finding on a few trades. The Fifth Circuit also found that the FERC did not have jurisdiction over most of the transactions identified as being violations. In July 2023, bp and FERC reached a settlement agreement that reduced the civil penalty to $10.75 million and fully resolved all claims by the FERC related to the matter.\n\n## Climate change\n\nBP p.l.c., BP America Inc. and BP Products North America Inc. are co-defendants with other oil and gas companies in over 20 lawsuits brought in various state and federal courts on behalf of various governmental and private parties. The lawsuits generally assert claims under a variety of legal theories seeking to hold the defendant companies responsible for impacts allegedly caused by and/or relating to climate change. Underlying many of the legal theories are allegations regarding deceptive communication and disinformation to the public. The lawsuits seek remedies including payment of money and other forms of equitable relief. If such suits were successful, the cost of the remedies sought in the various cases could be substantial. Over the last several years, defendants removed each lawsuit to federal court and the removals were contested by plaintiffs, eventually resulting in multiple decisions by several Circuit Court of Appeals rejecting defendants' attempts to have the cases moved to federal court. In 2023, the US Supreme Court declined to review the various Circuit Court of Appeals decisions. Accordingly, the cases will proceed in the various state courts. Due to these jurisdictional challenges, the lawsuits all remain at relatively early stages. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends to defend such actions vigorously.\n\n## Louisiana Coastal restoration\n\nSix coastal parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed over 40 separate lawsuits in state courts in Louisiana against various oil and gas companies seeking damages for coastal erosion. bp entities were named defendants in 17 of these cases. The lawsuits allege that the defendants' historical operations in oil and gas fields within the Louisiana onshore coastal zone failed to comply with state permits and/or were conducted without the required coastal use permits. The scope and scale of plaintiffs' damages demands are significant and unprecedented, including substantial remediation costs and the claimed costs for restoring coastal wetlands allegedly impacted by oil and gas field operations.\n\nDefendants removed all of these lawsuits to federal court and the removals were contested by plaintiffs, eventually resulting in a decision from the US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejecting defendants' 'federal officer' jurisdiction removal grounds in one of two lead cases - Plaquemines Parish v. Riverwood, et al. Defendants' petition for writ of certiorari to the US Supreme Court seeking review of the US Fifth Circuit's Riverwood decision was denied in early 2023. There is a small subset of the removed cases in which the defendants continue to contest jurisdiction and await a final ruling from the Fifth Circuit on a related 'federal officer' removal jurisdiction theory.\n\nFollowing remand, the state court in the other lead case of Cameron Parish v. Auster et al., in which bp was the principal defendant, had established a November 2023 trial date. Before trial commenced during the fourth quarter 2023, bp entered into a settlement agreement and release with the plaintiffs in respect of all claims arising within Cameron Parish. The terms of the settlement agreement and release are confidential and bp does not expect those terms to have a significant effect on the company's financial position or profitability.\n\nIn addition, four private landowners have filed separate claims in the state courts in Jefferson and Plaquemines Parishes of Louisiana for restoration damages related to alleged impacts to their marshlands associated with historic oil field operations. bp entities are defendants in two of these private landowner cases.\n\nAll of the other remanded cases remain at early stages in the litigation. While it is not possible to predict the outcomes of these novel legal actions, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends to defend such actions vigorously.",

The audit fees payable to Deloitte were considered as part of the audit tender process in 2016 and challenged by the audit committee through comparison with the audit pricing proposals of the other bidding firms. Changes in audit fees subsequent to the audit tender, including matters relevant to the 2023 audit, have been reviewed and challenged by the Audit Committee, before being approved. Deloitte performed further assurance services that were not prohibited by regulatory or other professional requirements and were pre-approved by the Committee. Deloitte is engaged for these services when its expertise and experience of bp are important. Most of this work is of an audit-related or assurance nature.\n\nUnder SEC regulations, the remuneration of the auditor of $61 million (2022 $56 million and 2021 $58 million) is required to be presented as follows: audit $53 million (2022 $51 million and 2021 $52 million); other audit-related $4 million (2022 $4 million and 2021 $5 million); tax $nil (2022 $nil and 2021 $nil); and all other fees $4 million (2022 $1 million and 2021 $1 million).",

Events after the reporting period\n\nOn 14 February 2024 bp announced that it had agreed to form a new joint venture in Egypt with ADNOC (bp 51%, ADNOC 49%). As part of the agreement bp will contribute its interests in three non-operated development concessions as well as exploration agreements in Egypt, and ADNOC will make a proportionate cash contribution. Formation of the joint venture and completion of these transactions is subject to regulatory approval. From 14 February 2024 the associated carrying values of these interests have been determined to meet the criteria to be classified as assets held for sale under IFRS 5 Noncurrent Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. The carrying value of fixed assets associated with these interests at 31 December 2023 was $1.4 billion. The impacts are expected to be reflected in the group's first quarter 2024 interim financial statements.",

The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.\n\n- (i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:\n- (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any; and\n- (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.\n- (ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.\n- (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.\n- (iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when:\n- (A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favourable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed programme in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or programme was based; and\n- (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.\n- (v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.\n\n## Undeveloped oil and gas reserves\n\nUndeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\n- (i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.\n- (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.\n- (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.\n\n## Developed oil and gas reserves\n\nDeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:\n\n- (i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and\n- (ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.\n\nFor details on bp's proved reserves and production compliance and governance processes, see pages 342-350.\n\n- a See Note 1 - Investment in Rosneft.",

This information is prepared in compliance with FASB Oil and Gas Disclosures requirements.\n\nFuture net cash flows have been prepared on the basis of certain assumptions which may or may not be realized. These include the timing of future production, the estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves and the application of average crude oil and natural gas prices and exchange rates from the previous 12 months. Furthermore, both proved reserves estimates and production forecasts are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available and economic conditions change. bp cautions against relying on the information presented because of the highly arbitrary nature of the assumptions on which it is based and its lack of comparability with the historical cost information presented in the financial statements.\n\n|                                                             | Europe   | Europe         | North  America   | North  America        | South  America Africa   | Asia                                         | 2023 Australasia Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------|------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                                             | UK       | Rest of Europe | US               | Rest of North America |                         |                                              |                          |\n| At 31 December                                              |          |                |                  |                       |                         |                                              |                          |\n| Subsidiaries                                                |          |                |                  |                       |                         |                                              |                          |\n| Future cash inflows a                                       | 19,400   |                | -

A 'gross' well or acre is one in which a whole or fractional working interest is owned, while the number of 'net' wells or acres is the sum of the whole or fractional working interests in gross wells or acres. Productive wells are producing wells and wells capable of production. Developed acreage is the acreage within the boundary of a field, on which development wells have been drilled, which could produce the reserves; while undeveloped acres are those on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities, whether or not such acres contain proved reserves.\n\n|                                                 |                                                 | Europe   | Europe         | North  America   | North  America        | South  America   | Africa   | Asia   | Australasia        | Total a   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------|----------|--------|--------------------|-----------|\n|                                                 |                                                 | UK       | Rest of Europe | US               | Rest of North America |                  |          |        |                    |           |\n| Number of productive wells at 31 December 2023  | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2023  |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |                    |           |\n| Oil wells b                                     | - gross                                         | 114      | 123            | 1,390            | 8                     | 5,367            | 864      | 2,979  | -                  | 10,845    |\n|                                                 | - net                                           | 65       | 20             | 736              | 2                     | 2,644            | 79       | 619    | -                  | 4,166     |\n| Gas wells c                                     | - gross                                         | 36       | 10             | 4,681            | -                     | 1,184            | 91       | 172    | 100                | 6,274     |\n|                                                 | - net                                           | 8        | 2              | 2,520            | -                     | 413              | 42       | 65     | 23                 | 3,073     |\n| Oil and natural gas acreage at 31 December 2023 | Oil and natural gas acreage at 31 December 2023 |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        | thousands of acres |           |\n| Developed                                       | - gross                                         | 71       | 82             | 1,903            | 8                     | 1,330            | 690      | 1,334  | 838                | 6,255     |\n|                                                 | - net                                           | 41       | 13             | 1,024            | 1                     | 381              | 120      | 277    | 157                | 2,014     |\n| Undeveloped d                                   | - gross                                         | 561      | 333            | 3,900            | 11,011                | 9,402            | 18,538   | 5,604  | 9,660              | 59,010    |\n|                                                 | - net                                           | 410      | 53             | 3,320            | 6,966                 | 4,193            | 8,631    | 1,743  | 6,676              | 31,991    |\n\n- a Because of rounding, some totals may not exactly agree with the sum of their component parts.\n- b Includes approximately 166 gross (32 net) multiple completion wells (more than one formation producing into the same well bore).\n- c Includes approximately 116 gross (94 net) multiple completion wells.

Productive wells include wells in which hydrocarbons were encountered and the drilling or completion of which, in the case of exploratory wells, has been suspended pending further drilling or evaluation. A dry well is one found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to justify completion.\n\n|             | Europe   | Europe         | North  America   | North  America        | South  America   | Africa   | Asia   | Asia         | Australasia   | Total a   |\n|-------------|----------|----------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------|----------|--------|--------------|---------------|-----------|\n|             | UK       | Rest of Europe | US               | Rest of North America |                  |          | Russia | Rest of Asia |               |           |\n| 2023        |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |              |               |           |\n| Exploratory |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |              |               |           |\n| Productive  | -        | -              | 2.0              | -                     | -                | -        | -      | 0.8          | 0.4           | 3.2       |\n| Dry         | 0.5      | -              | 0.8              | 0.5                   | -                | -        | -      | 0.2          | -             | 2.0       |\n| Development |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |              |               |           |\n| Productive  | 2.6      | 0.6            | 141.9            | 0.1                   | 6.2              | 4.2      | -      | 39.7         | 0.4           | 195.6     |\n| Dry         | -        | -              | -                | -                     | -                | -        | -      | 0.4          | -             | 0.4       |\n| 2022        |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |              |               |           |\n| Exploratory |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |              |               |           |\n| Productive  | -        | -              | 0.5              | 1.0                   | 1.0              | 0.6      | -      | 0.5          | 0.3           | 4.0       |\n| Dry         | -        | -              | -                | 1.2                   | 0.3              | 0.1      | -      | 0.8          | -             | 2.3       |\n| Development |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |              |               |           |\n| Productive  | 0.9      | 1.5            | 137.2            | 0.3                   | 71.4             | 2.8      | -      | 39.0         | 1.4           | 254.5     |\n| Dry         | -        | -              | 1.1              | -                     | 0.5              | 0.1      | -      | 1.1          | -             | 2.8       |\n| 2021        |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |              |               |           |\n| Exploratory |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |              |               |           |\n| Productive  | -        | -              | 0.2              | -                     | 1.1              | 1.4      | 16.3   | 1.2          | -             | 20.2      |\n| Dry         | -        | -              | 0.6              | -                     | -                | 1.4      | -      | 0.3          | 0.4           | 2.7       |\n| Development |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |              |               |           |\n| Productive  | 2.4      | 0.6            | 107.2            | 0.8                   | 69.4             | 2.5      | 285.2  | 27.3         | 1.3           | 496.6     |\n| Dry         | -        | 0.1            | 7.3              | -                     | 0.7              | -        | -      | 0.1          | -             | 8.2       |\n\n- a Because of rounding, some totals may not exactly agree with the sum of their component parts.",

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\n## Authorization of financial statements and statement of compliance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework' (FRS 101)\n\nThe financial statements of BP p.l.c. for the year ended 31 December 2023 were approved and signed by the chief executive officer on 8 March 2024 having been duly authorized to do so by the board of directors. The company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 'Application of Financial Reporting Requirements' (FRS 100) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly, these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 and in accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK accounting standards.\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.\n\nAs permitted by FRS 101, the company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available in relation to:\n\n- (a) the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D, 111 and 134 to 136 of IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements';\n- (b) the requirements in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements' to present comparative information in respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1.\n- (c) the requirements of IAS 7 'Statement of Cash Flows';\n- (d) the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors' in relation to standards not yet effective;\n- (e) the requirements of paragraphs 17 and 18A of IAS 24 'Related Party Disclosures';\n- (f) the requirements of IAS 24 'Related Party Disclosures' to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member;\n- (g) the requirements of paragraphs 130(f)(ii), 130(f)(iii), 134(d) to 134(f) and 135(c)-135(e) of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets;\n- (h) the requirements of paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2 'Share-based Payment';\n- (i) the requirements of IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'; and\n- (j) the requirement of the second sentence of paragraph 110 and paragraphs 113(a), 114,115, 118, 119(a) to (c), 120 to 127 and 129 of IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'.\n\nWhere required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements of BP p.l.c.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest million dollars ($ million), except where otherwise indicated.\n\nIn May 2023, the IASB issued International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules - Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes to clarify the application of IAS 12 to tax legislation enacted or substantively enacted to implement Pillar Two of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, which aims to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. The amendments include a mandatory temporary exception from accounting for deferred tax on such tax law. In July 2023, the UK government enacted legislation to implement the Pillar Two rules. The legislation is effective for bp from 1 January 2024 and includes an income inclusion rule and a domestic minimum tax, which together are designed to ensure a minimum effective tax rate of 15%. Similar legislation is being enacted by other governments around the world. In line with the amendments to IAS 12, the exception from accounting for deferred tax for the Pillar Two rules has been applied and there are no impacts on the financial statements for 2023. Based on an assessment of historic data and forecasts for the year ending 31 December 2024, the company does not expect a material exposure to Pillar Two income taxes for the year ending 31 December 2024.\n\nThere are no new IFRS standards or amended standards or interpretations adopted from 1 January 2023 onwards, including the amendments to IAS 12 'Income Taxes' described above and IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts,' that have a significant impact on the financial statements.  Further, there are no new or amended standards not yet adopted that are expected to have a material impact.\n\n## Material accounting policy information: use of judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nInherent in the application of many of the accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements is the need for bp management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. The accounting judgements and estimates that have a significant impact on the results of the group are set out in boxed text below, and should be read in conjunction with the information provided in the Notes on financial statements.\n\nThe areas requiring the most significant judgement and estimation in the preparation of the financial statements are the recoverability of investment carrying values and pensions. Judgements and estimates, not all of which are significant, made in assessing the impact of the current economic and geopolitical environment, and climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy on the financial statements are also set out in boxed text below. Where an estimate has a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year this is specifically noted within the boxed text.\n\nThe parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. on pages 275-334 do not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy\n\nClimate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy were considered in preparing the financial statements. These may have significant impacts on the currently reported amounts of the company''s assets and liabilities discussed below .\n\n## Impairment of investments\n\nThe recoverable amounts of the company's investments in subsidiaries are closely linked to the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and goodwill in the individual subsidiaries. The energy transition is likely to impact the future prices of commodities such as oil and natural gas which in turn may affect the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and goodwill in the oil and gas industry. Management's best estimate of oil and natural gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment testing for all subsidiaries were revised during 2023. Prices disclosed are in real 2022 terms. The near term Brent oil assumption was held constant at $70 per barrel to reflect near-term supply constraints before declining after 2030 to $50 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy system decarbonizes, falling oil demand will cause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2050 were held constant at $4.00 per mmBtu reflecting an assumption that declining domestic demand in the US is offset by higher LNG exports. The revised assumptions for Brent oil and Henry Hub gas sit within the range of external scenarios considered by management and are in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n\n## Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of the geopolitical and economic environment\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the following areas involving judgement and estimates were identified as most relevant with regards to the impact of the current geopolitical and economic environment.\n\n## Going concern\n\nLiquidity and financing is managed within bp under pooled group-wide arrangements which include the company. As part of assuring the going concern basis of preparation for the company, the ability and intent of the bp group to support the company has been taken into consideration. The most recent bp group financial statements (see pages 137 to 246) continue to be prepared on a going concern basis. Forecast liquidity has been assessed under a number of stressed scenarios, including a significant decline in oil prices over the 12-month period. Reverse stress tests performed indicated that the group will continue to operate as a going concern for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements even if the Brent price fell to zero. In addition, group management of bp have confirmed that the existing intra-group funding and liquidity arrangements as currently constituted are expected to continue for the foreseeable future, being no less than twelve months from the approval of these financial statements. No material uncertainties over going concern or significant judgements or estimates in the assessment were identified. Accordingly, the company will be able to draw on support from the bp group for the foreseeable future and these financial statements have therefore been prepared on the going concern basis.\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe volatility in the financial markets during 2023 impacted the assumptions used for determining the fair value of plan assets and the present value of defined benefit obligations in the company's defined benefit pension plans. See significant estimate: pensions and Note 4 for further information.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost. The company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Where these circumstances have reversed, the impairment previously made is reversed to the extent of the original cost of the investment.\n\n## Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values\n\nDetermination as to whether, and by how much, an investment holding company chain (defined as each direct subsidiary and its own investments), is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as the effects of inflation and deflation on operating expenses, discount rates, capital expenditure, carbon pricing (where applicable), production profiles, reserves and resources, and future commodity prices, including the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. Determination as to whether, and by how much, an asset or CGU is impaired involves similar estimates.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Fair value less costs of disposal may be determined based on expected sales proceeds or similar recent market transaction data. Details of impairment charges recognized in the profit and loss account and the carrying amounts of investments are shown in Note 2. The estimates for assumptions made in impairment tests in 2023 relating to discount rates and oil and gas properties are discussed below. It is impracticable to reliably determine the extent of any impacts of changes in the assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts of the company's investments given the diverse characteristics of the underlying assets and the interdependency of the various inputs. Changes in the economic environment including as a result of the energy transition or other facts and circumstances may necessitate revisions to these assumptions and could result in a material change to the carrying values of the group's assets within the next financial year.",

Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Discount rates\n\nFor discounted cash flow calculations, future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the CGU. Value-in-use calculations are typically discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based upon the cost of funding the Company derived from an established model, adjusted to a pre-tax basis and incorporating a market participant capital structure and country risk premiums. Fair value less costs of disposal discounted cash flow calculations use a post-tax discount rate.\n\nThe discount rates applied in impairment tests are reassessed each year and, in 2023, the post-tax discount rate was 8% (2022 7%) other than for renewable power assets. Where the CGU is located in a country that was judged to be higher risk, an additional premium of 1% to 4% was reflected in the post-tax discount rate (2022 1% to 2%). The judgement of classifying a country as higher risk and the applicable premium takes into account various economic and geopolitical factors. The pre-tax discount rate, other than for renewable power assets, typically ranged from 9% to 20% (2022 7% to 18%) depending on the risk premium and applicable tax rate in the geographic location of the CGU. For renewable power assets tested on a value-in-use basis in 2023 (including those in equity accounted entities), where the risk profile of expected cash flows supports a lower rate, tests were performed using a post-tax WACC-based discount rate of 6.5%. For assets tested in 2022, the tests  were performed on a fair value less costs of disposal basis using a post-tax cost of equity-based discount rate of 6%.\n\n## Oil and natural gas properties\n\nFor upstream oil and natural gas properties in subsidiaries, expected future cash flows are estimated using management's best estimate of future oil and natural gas prices, and production and reserves and certain resources volumes. The estimated future level of production in all impairment tests is based on assumptions about future commodity prices, production and development costs, field decline rates, current fiscal regimes and other factors. A change in the discount rate, reserves, resources or the oil and gas price assumptions in the next financial year may result in a recoverable amount of one or more of these assets above or below the current carrying amount and therefore there is a risk of impairment reversals or charges in that period. Management consider that reasonably possible changes in the discount rate or forecast revenue, arising from a change in oil and natural gas prices and/ or production could result in a material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year.\n\n## Oil and natural gas prices\n\nThe price assumptions used for value in use impairment testing are based on those used for investment appraisal. bp's carbon emissions cost assumptions and their interrelationship with oil and gas prices are described in 'Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy' on page 170. The investment appraisal price assumptions are recommended by the senior vice president economic & energy insights after considering a range of external price sets and supply and demand profiles associated with various energy transition scenarios. They are reviewed and approved by management. As a result of the current uncertainty over the pace of transition to lower-carbon supply and demand and the social, political and environmental actions that will be taken to meet the goals of the Paris climate change agreement, the scenarios considered include those where those goals are met as well as those where they are not met.\n\nDuring the year, bp's price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing (in real 2022 terms) for the near term Brent oil assumption was held constant at $70 per barrel to reflect near term supply constraints before declining after 2030 to $50 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy system decarbonises, falling oil demand will cause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2050 were held constant at $4.00 per mmBtu reflecting an assumption that declining domestic demand in the US is offset by higher LNG exports. These price assumptions are derived from the central case investment appraisal assumptions, adjusted where applicable to reflect short-term market conditions (see page 30). A summary of the group's revised price assumptions for Brent oil and Henry Hub gas, applied in 2023 and 2022, in real 2022 terms, is provided below. The assumptions represent management's best estimate of future prices at the balance sheet date, which sit within the range of external scenarios considered as appropriate for the purpose. They are considered by bp to be in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. However, they do not correspond to any specific Paris-consistent scenario. An inflation rate of 2% (2022 2%) is applied to determine the price assumptions in nominal terms.\n\n| 2023 price assumptions   |    2024 |    2025 |    2030 |    2040 |    2050 |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Brent oil ($/bbl)        |   70    |   70    |   70    |   63    |   50    |\n| Henry Hub gas ($/mmBtu)  |    4    |    4    |    4    |    4    |    4    |\n| 2022 price assumptions   | 2023    | 2025    | 2030    | 2040    | 2050    |\n| Brent oil ($/bbl)        |   78    |   71    |   71    |   59    |   46    |\n| Henry Hub gas ($/mmBtu)  |    4.08 |    4.08 |    4.08 |    3.57 |    3.57 |\n\n## Oil and natural gas reserves\n\nThe majority of bp's reserves and resources that support the carrying value of the company's subsidiaries holding upstream oil and gas properties are expected to be produced over the next 12 years.\n\nIn addition to oil and natural gas prices, significant technical and commercial assessments are required to determine the Company's estimated oil and natural gas reserves. Reserves estimates are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity and drilling of new wells all impact on the determination of the Company's estimates of its oil and natural gas reserves. bp bases its reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.\n\nReserves assumptions for value-in-use tests reflect the reserves and resources that management currently intend to develop. The recoverable amount of oil and gas properties is determined using a combination of inputs including reserves, resources and production volumes. Risk factors may be applied to reserves and resources which do not meet the criteria to be treated as proved or probable.\n\nThe parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. on pages 275-334 do not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\n## 1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nThe functional and presentation currency of the financial statements is US dollars. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of those entities at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Any resulting exchange differences are included in the income statement. Non-monetary items, other than those measured at fair value, are not retranslated subsequent to initial recognition.\n\nExchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by a non-US dollar functional currency branch are translated into US dollars and are recognized in a separate component of equity and reported in other comprehensive income. Income statement transactions are translated into US dollars using the average exchange rate for the reporting period.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nThe company enters into financial guarantee contracts with its subsidiaries. The liability for a financial guarantee contract is initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of the contract's estimated expected credit loss and the amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, cumulative amortization.\n\n## Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nThe defined benefit pension plans are plans that share risks between entities under common control. In each instance BP p.l.c. is the principal employer and carries the whole plan surplus or deficit on its balance sheet.The cost of providing benefits under the company's defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation. Past service costs, resulting from either a plan amendment or a curtailment (a reduction in future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the plan membership), are recognized immediately when the company becomes committed to a change.\n\nNet interest expense relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefits, which is recognized in the income statement, represents the net change in present value of plan obligations and the value of plan assets resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the present value of the benefit obligation at the start of the year, and to the fair value of plan assets at the start of the year, taking into account expected changes in the obligation or plan assets during the year.\n\nRemeasurements of the defined benefit liability and asset, comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest described above) are recognized within other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently reclassified to profit and loss.\n\nThe defined benefit pension plan surplus or deficit recognized on the balance sheet for each plan comprises the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds) and the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. Defined benefit pension plan surpluses are only recognized to the extent they are recoverable, either by way of a refund from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.\n\n## Significant estimate: pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nAccounting for defined benefit pensions involves making significant estimates when measuring the company's pension plan surpluses and deficits. These estimates require assumptions to be made about many uncertainties.\n\nPension assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year. These assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation at the year end and hence the surpluses and deficits recorded on the company's balance sheet, and pension expense for the following year. The assumptions used are provided in Note 4.\n\nThe assumptions that are the most significant to the amounts reported are the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality levels. Assumptions about these variables are based on the environment in each country. The assumptions used vary from year to year, with resultant effects on future net income and net assets. Changes to some of these assumptions, in particular the discount rate and inflation rate, could result in material changes to the carrying amounts of the company's pension obligations within the next financial year for the UK plan. Any differences between these assumptions and the actual outcome will also affect future net income and net assets.\n\nThe values ascribed to these assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the assumptions on the benefit expense and obligation used are provided in Note 4.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.\n\nIncome tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the related tax is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\nCurrent tax is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it is determined in accordance with the rules established by the applicable taxation authorities. It therefore excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods as well as items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.\n\nDeferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that they will be realized in the future.\n\nThe parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. on pages 275-334 do not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Material accounting policy information, significant judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. See Note 6 for further details.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are recognized initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price. In the case of financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs are also included. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as set out below. The company derecognizes financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or the rights to receive cash flows have been transferred to a third party and either substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset have been transferred, or substantially all the risks and rewards  of  the  asset  have  neither  been  retained  nor  transferred  but  control  of  the  asset  has  been  transferred.  This  includes  the  derecognition  of receivables for which discounting arrangements are entered into.\n\n## Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at amortized cost when they are held in a business model the objective of which is to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Such assets are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the assets are derecognized or impaired and when interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. This category of financial assets includes trade and other receivables.\n\n## Cash equivalents\n\nCash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and generally have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Cash equivalents are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost or, in the case of certain money market funds, fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nAll financial liabilities held by the company are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities include other payables, accruals, and amounts payable to subsidiaries. The company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost\n\nAll financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. For interest-bearing loans and borrowings this is typically equivalent to the fair value of the proceeds received, net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.\n\nAfter initial recognition, financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.",

As a result, management performed an impairment test of the company's major investments in line with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Management considered the performance of investments and impairment tests performed by the company's subsidiaries.

        "page_content": "## 4 . Pensions\n\nThe pension obligation consists primarily of a funded final salary pension plan in the UK under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity. This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four companynominated directors, an independent director, and an independent chair nominated by the company. The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan. The plan was closed to new joiners in 2010 and was closed to future accrual on 30 June 2021. Employees in the UK are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.\n\nThe level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.\n\nFor the primary UK plan there is a funding agreement between the company and the trustee. On a three year cycle a schedule of contributions is agreed covering the next five years. The schedule of contributions is next scheduled to be updated after the 31 December 2023 formal actuarial valuation. No contractually committed funding was due at 31 December 2023. The closure of the defined benefit plan to future accrual reduces the need for funding and the plan's expected future funding volatility.\n\nThe surplus relating to the primary UK pension plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund of any remaining assets once all members have left the plan.\n\nThe obligation and cost of providing the pension benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method. The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2023. The UK plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every 3 years. The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the main pension plan was as at 31 December 2020; the 31 December 2023 valuation is currently underway.\n\nThe material financial assumptions used for estimating the benefit obligations of the plans are set out below. The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year and are used to evaluate the accrued benefit obligation at 31 December and pension expense for the following year.\n\n| Financial assumptions used to determine benefit obligation   | %        | %        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n|                                                              | 2023     | 2022     |\n| Discount rate for plan liabilities                           | 4.8      | 5.0      |\n| Rate of increase for pensions in payment                     | 2.8      | 2.9      |\n| Rate of increase in deferred pensions                        | 2.8      | 2.9      |\n| Inflation for plan liabilities                               | 3.0      | 3.1      |\n| Financial assumptions used to determine benefit expense      |          | %        |\n| Discount rate for plan other finance expense                 | 2023 5.0 | 2022 1.8 |\n\nThe discount rate assumption is based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and we use yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments. The inflation rate assumption is based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds. The inflation assumption is used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an increase.\n\nIn addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions. The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the UK and have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted to reflect the experience of the plans and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future. For the main pension plan the mortality assumptions are as follows:\n\n| Mortality assumptions                                    |   Years |   Years |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                                                          |  2023   |  2022   |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60   |    27.4 |    26.9 |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40   |    29.2 |    28.5 |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 |    29.2 |    28.8 |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 |    30.6 |    30.6 |\n\nThe assets of the primary plan are held in a trust, the primary objective of which is to accumulate assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the plan. The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.\n\nA proportion of the assets are held in equities, which are expected to generate a higher level of return over the long term, with an acceptable level of risk. In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversified.\n\nThe trustee's long-term investment objective for the primary UK plan as it matures is to invest in assets whose value changes in the same way as the plan liabilities, in order to reduce the level of funding risk. To move towards this objective, the UK plan uses a liability driven investment (LDI) approach for part of the portfolio, investing primarily in government bonds to achieve this matching effect for the most significant plan liability assumptions of interest rate and inflation rate. This is partly funded by short-term sale and repurchase agreements, whereby the plan borrows money using existing bonds as security and which will be bought back at a specified price at an agreed future date. The funds raised are used to invest in further bonds to increase the proportion of assets which match the plan liabilities. The borrowings are shown separately in the analysis of pension plan assets in the table below.\n\nFor the primary UK pension plan there is an agreement with the trustee to increase the proportion of assets with liability matching characteristics over time primarily by reducing the proportion of plan assets held as equities and increasing the proportion held as bonds. During 2023, the asset allocation policy switched 2% of plan assets from equities to bonds (2022 2%).\n\nThe parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. on pages 275-334 do not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

Prior to 2023, the company's interest bearing payables with BP Finance p.l.c. and BP International Limited  were  exposed to 3 month USD LIBOR. Publication of 3 month USD LIBOR ceased from 30 June 2023 however a synthetic LIBOR continues to be published. The interest-bearing payable of $5,079 million (2022 $5,069 million) with BP Finance p.l.c. has interest charged based on a 3-month USD synthetic LIBOR rate minus 0.14% with a maturity date of April 2030. Though the loan with BP Finance p.l.c. is due in 2030, the loan is repayable at one business day's notice. It is disclosed as a non-current receivable in the financial statements of BP Finance p.l.c., given the counterparty has no intent to call the loan at short notice. The interest-bearing payable of $5,500 million (2022 Nil) with BP Gamma Holdings Limited has interest charged based on a SOFR plus 23 basis points with a maturity date of December 2024 and repayable at two business day's notice. Though the loan with BP Gamma Holdings Limited is due in 2024, the loan is auto-renewal. It is disclosed as a non-current receivable in the financial statements of BP Gamma Holdings Limited, given the counterparty has no intent to withdraw the loan within the next year.\n\nNon-current amounts payable to subsidiaries includes an interest-bearing payable of $52,585 million with BP International Limited issued in December 2021 (2022 $52,585 million), with interest being charged based on a 3-month USD synthetic LIBOR rate plus 75 basis points and a maturity date of December 2028. The loan includes a prepayment clause for BP p.l.c. to repay part or all of the loan before maturity whilst the lender has no right to call the loan other than in the event of the company being in default. As such it is disclosed as non-current in both the company and BP International Limited's financial statements.\n\nThe maturity profile of the non-current financial liabilities included in the balance sheet at 31 December is shown in the table below.

On a poll, shareholders present in person or by proxy have two votes for every \u00a35 in nominal amount of the first and second preference shares held and one vote for every ordinary share held. On a show-of-hands vote on other resolutions (procedural matters) at a general meeting, shareholders present in person or by proxy have one vote each.\n\nIn the event of the winding up of the company, preference shareholders would be entitled to a sum equal to the capital paid up on the preference shares, plus an amount in respect of accrued and unpaid dividends and a premium equal to the higher of (i) 10% of the capital paid up on the preference shares and (ii) the excess of the average market price of such shares on the London Stock Exchange during the previous six months over par value.\n\nDuring 2023 the company repurchased 1,263 million ordinary shares for a total consideration of $7,918 million, including transaction costs of $43 million. All shares purchased were for cancellation. The repurchased shares represented 7.1% of ordinary share capital. A further 156 million ordinary shares were repurchased between the end of the reporting period and 16 February 2024, the latest practicable date before the completion of these financial statements, for a total cost of $922 million of which $746 million has been accrued at 31 December 2023. The number of shares in issue is reduced when shares are repurchased.\n\nThe parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. on pages 275-334 do not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

Capital and reserves\n\nSee statement of changes in equity for details of all reserves balances.\n\n## Share capital\n\nThe balance on the share capital account represents the aggregate nominal value of all ordinary and preference shares in issue, including treasury shares.\n\n## Share premium account\n\nThe balance on the share premium account represents the amounts received in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary and preference shares.\n\n## Capital redemption reserve\n\nThe balance on the capital redemption reserve represents the aggregate nominal value of all the ordinary shares repurchased and cancelled.\n\n## Merger reserve\n\nThe balance on the merger reserve represents the fair value of the consideration given in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary shares issued in an acquisition made by the issue of shares.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares represent bp shares repurchased and available for specific and limited purposes. For accounting purposes, shares held in Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) and by bp's US share plan administrator to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the financial statements as treasury shares. The ESOPs are funded by the company and have waived their rights to dividends in respect of such shares held for future awards. Until such time as the shares held by the ESOPs vest unconditionally to employees, the amount paid for those shares is shown as a reduction in shareholders' equity. Assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as assets and liabilities of the company.\n\n## Foreign currency translation reserve\n\nThe foreign currency translation reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial information of the foreign currency branch. Upon disposal of foreign operations, the related accumulated exchange differences are recycled to the income statement.\n\n## Profit and loss account\n\nThe balance held on this reserve is the accumulated retained profits of the company.\n\nThe profit and loss account reserve includes $23,858 million (2022 $23,610 million), the distribution of which is limited by statutory or other restrictions.\n\nThe financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 do not reflect the dividend announced on 6 February 2024 and which is expected to be paid on 28 March 2024; this will be treated as an appropriation of profit in the year ended 31 December 2024.\n\n## 9. Financial guarantees and other contingencies\n\nThe company has issued guarantees to third parties and other bp subsidiaries in case of the failure, on the part of certain bp subsidiaries, to pay current liabilities and obligations pertaining to business operations. The amounts guaranteed by the company, at 31 December 2023, for these arrangements is $649 million (2022 a $595 million). The company guarantees finance debt and lease obligations of certain bp group subsidiaries. Maturity dates vary and guarantees will terminate on full payment and/or cancellation of the obligation. As of 31 December 2023, maximum guaranteed amounts pertaining to debt and lease arrangements were $61,900 million (2022 $57,265 million). These maximum amounts are more than the actual guaranteed exposure due at the balance sheet date as well as more than remaining obligations under the guaranteed contracts.\n\nPerformance under all the above guarantees would be triggered by a financial default of the guaranteed entity and, as such, are currently not expected to have any material effect.\n\nThe parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. on pages 275-334 do not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

Financial guarantees and other contingencies - continued\n\nAs part of normal ongoing business operations and consistent with generally accepted industry practices, the company also executes contracts involving standard indemnities and guarantees for the respective businesses in which bp operates as well as indemnities specific to transactions, including the sale of businesses. This includes a guarantee of subsidiaries' liabilities under the Consent Decree between the United States, the Gulf states and bp and under the settlement agreement with the Gulf states in relation to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The company has also issued uncapped guarantees for certain subsidiaries' liabilities under the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee agreement relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. See Note 33 in the consolidated group financial statements of BP p.l.c. for further information. The company regularly evaluates the probability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnities and does not believe such matters will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and cash flow.\n\nThe company believes that guarantees and other off-balance sheet commitments do not currently, nor could reasonably have in the future, a material effect on its financial position, income and expenses, liquidity, investments or financial resources.\n\n- a An amendment has been made to prior year comparatives for the financial guarantee maximum exposure (previously reported as $107 million).\n\n## 10.

Events after the reporting period\n\nOn 14 February 2024 bp announced that it had agreed to form a new joint venture in Egypt with ADNOC (bp 51%, ADNOC 49%). As part of the agreement bp will contribute its interests in three non-operated development concessions as well as exploration agreements in Egypt, and ADNOC will make a proportionate cash contribution. Formation of the joint venture and completion of these transactions is subject to regulatory approval. From 14 February 2024 the associated carrying values of these interests have been determined to meet the criteria to be classified as assets held for sale under IFRS 5 Noncurrent Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. The carrying value of fixed assets associated with these interests at 31 December 2023 was $1.4 billion. The impacts are expected to be reflected in the group's first quarter 2024 interim financial statements .\n\nThe parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. on pages 275-334 do not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity and capital resources\n\n## Financial framework\n\nbp has a resilient financial framework that, taken together with our strategy, creates a compelling investor proposition offering committed distributions, profitable growth and sustainable value. The framework comprises a coherent approach to capital allocation, a resilient balance sheet, a disciplined approach to investment allocation and a relentless focus on executing bp's business plan.\n\nbp's approach to capital allocation leads to a clear set of priorities funding our resilient dividend as the first priority, maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating, disciplined investment in our transition growth \u00ab engines to advance our energy transition strategy and investment in oil, gas, refining and other businesses, and then returning surplus cash flow \u00ab as share buybacks. In a period of low prices, the group has the flexibility to reduce cash costs and to reduce or defer capital investment, as appropriate.\n\nOur shareholder distribution policy reflects these priorities for the uses of cash alongside an ongoing consideration of factors, including changes in the environment, the underlying performance of the business, the outlook for the group financial framework, and other market factors which may vary quarter to quarter.\n\nNet debt \u00ab at 31 December 2023 was $20.9 billion and is expected to reduce in line with the growth in operating cash flow \u00ab . As at 31 December 2023 our target of $25 billion of divestment and other proceeds between the second half of 2020 and 2025 was underpinned by agreed or completed transactions of around $18.5 billion with $17.8 billion of proceeds received.\n\nWe expect operating cash flow to cover capital expenditure \u00ab and the dividend. Capital expenditure in 2023 was $16.3 billion, including $1.3 billion of inorganic capital expenditure \u00ab . bp expects capital expenditure of around $16 billion through 2024 and 2025 and expects a range of $14-18 billion per annum through 2030 including inorganic expenditure. bp's cash balancing point is expected to average around $40 per barrel Brent (assuming an average refining marker margin of around $11 per barrel and Henry Hub gas price at $3 per mmBtu) in 2021 real terms.\n\nIn 2023, the return on average capital employed \u00ab was 18.1% a at an average of $83 per barrel. The return on average capital employed is targeted to be over 18% by 2025 at $70 per barrel in 2021 real terms, and assuming bp planning assumptions, as we continue to execute our strategy. This is supported by an expected growth on adjusted EBIDA per share compound annual growth rate \u00ab from the second half 2019/first half 2020 b to 2025 and subject to the same price and planning assumptions.\n\n- a Nearest equivalent IFRS measures of numerator and denominator are profit for the year attributable to bp shareholders and total equity respectively: Profit for the year attributable to bp shareholders divided by total equity at the end of 2023 17.8%.\n- b Adjusted to exclude Rosneft.\n\n## Dividends and other distributions to shareholders\n\nThe dividend is determined in US dollars, the economic currency of bp, and the dividend level is reviewed by the board each quarter. The quarterly dividend was increased from 6.610 to 7.270 cents per ordinary share per quarter in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe total dividend distributed to bp shareholders in 2023 was $4.8 billion (2022 $4.4 billion). This dividend was all paid in cash as shareholders no longer have the option to receive a scrip dividend in place of receiving cash.\n\nIncluded in the distribution policy is a commitment that, subject to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating, at least 80% of surplus cash flow on a point forward basis will be distributed to shareholders through share buybacks. In 2023 bp executed $7.9 billion of share buybacks (2022 $10.0 billion), including fees and stamp duty. Since 1 January 2024 an additional $0.9 billion shares have been repurchased up to 16 February 2024, including fees and stamp duty. Based on bp's current forecasts, at around $60 per barrel Brent and subject to the board's discretion each quarter, bp expects to have capacity for an annual increase in the dividend per ordinary share of around 4%. Based on current market conditions bp plans share buybacks of at least $14 billion through 2025. In setting the dividend and share buybacks each quarter, the board will continue to take into account factors including the cumulative level of and\n\noutlook for surplus cash flow, the cash balance point \u00ab and the maintenance of a strong investment grade credit rating.\n\n## Financing the group's activities\n\nThe group's principal commodities, oil and gas, are priced internationally in US dollars. Group policy has generally been to minimize economic exposure to currency movements by financing operations with US dollar debt. Where debt and hybrid bonds are issued in other currencies, they are generally swapped back to US dollars using derivative contracts, or else hedged by maintaining offsetting cash positions in the same currency. Cash balances of the group are mainly held in US dollars or swapped to US dollars and holdings are well diversified to reduce concentration risk. The group is not, therefore, exposed to significant currency risk regarding its cash or borrowings. Also see Risk factors on page 77 for further information on risks associated with prices and markets and Financial statements - Note 29.\n\nThe group's finance debt at 31 December 2023 amounted to $52.0 billion (2022 $46.9 billion). Of the total finance debt, $3.3 billion is classified as short term at the end of 2023 (2022 $3.2 billion). See Financial statements - Note 26 for more information on the short-term balance. Net debt \u00ab was $20.9 billion at the end of 2023, a decrease of $0.5 billion from the 2022 year-end position of $21.4 billion. BP p.l.c. fully and unconditionally guarantees securities issued by BP Capital Markets p.l.c. and BP Capital Markets America Inc. which are 100%-owned finance subsidiaries of BP p.l.c.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 the group held a balance of $13.6 billion (2022 $13.4 billion) issued perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds, of which $1.5 billion (2022 $1.3 billion) were issued to fund one of the group's major projects. As the group has the unconditional right to avoid transfer of cash or another financial asset in relation to these hybrid bonds, which were issued by group subsidiaries, they are classified as equity instruments and reported within non-controlling interest.\n\nThe ratio of finance debt to finance debt plus total equity at 31 December 2023 was 37.8% (2022 36.1%). Gearing was 19.7% at the end of 2023 (2022 20.5%). See Financial statements - Note 27 for finance debt, which is the nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis, and for further information on net debt.\n\nCash and cash equivalents of $33.0 billion at 31 December 2023 (2022 $29.2 billion) are included in net debt. We manage our cash position so that the group has adequate cover to respond to potential short-term market liquidity, short-term price environment volatility and expect to maintain a robust cash position.\n\nThe group also has an undrawn committed $8 billion credit facility and undrawn committed bank facilities of $4 billion (see Financial statements Note 29 for more information).\n\nWe believe that the group's resilient balance sheet and strong investment grade credit rating will allow the group to meet its known contractual and other obligations in both the short and long term with the group having sufficient working capital, taking into account the amounts of undrawn borrowings facilities, access to capital markets, levels of cash and cash equivalents and its ongoing ability to generate cash through operations. This belief is subject to a degree of uncertainty that can be expected to increase looking out over time and, accordingly, that future outcomes cannot be guaranteed or predicted with certainty.\n\nbp utilizes various arrangements in order to manage its working capital including discounting of receivables and, in the supply and trading business, the active management of supplier payment terms, inventory and collateral.\n\nStandard & Poor's Ratings' long-term credit rating for BP p.l.c. is A(positive), the Moody's Investors Service rating is A2 (positive) and the Fitch Ratings' long-term credit rating is A+ (stable).\n\nThe group's sources of funding, its access to capital markets and maintaining a strong cash position are described in Financial statements Note 25 and Note 29. Further information on the management of liquidity risk and credit risk, and the maturity profile and fixed/floating rate characteristics of the group's debt are also provided in Financial statements - Note 26 and Note 29.\n\nThe information above contains forward-looking statements, which by their nature involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will or may occur in the future and are outside the control of bp.",

These amounts are not reflected in the group's debt on the balance sheet. The group has issued third-party guarantees under which amounts outstanding, incremental to amounts recognized on the balance sheet, at 31 December 2023 were $1,655 million (2022 $1,704 million) in respect of liabilities of joint ventures \u00ab and associates \u00ab and $598 million (2022 $680 million) in respect of liabilities of other third parties. Of these amounts, $1,609 million (2022 $1,701 million) of the joint ventures and associates guarantees relate to borrowings and, for other third-party guarantees, $527 million (2022 $557 million) relate to guarantees of borrowings.\n\n## Contractual obligations\n\nThe following table summarizes the group's capital expenditure commitments for property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2023 and the proportion of that expenditure for which contracts have been placed.\n\n|                        | $ million         | $ million         | $ million   |\n|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| Capital expenditure    | Less than 1  year | More than 1  year | Total       |\n| Committed              | 12,890            | 9,648             | 22,538      |\n| of which is contracted | 6,962             | 3,392             | 10,354      |\n\nCapital expenditure is considered to be committed when the project has received the appropriate level of internal management approval. For joint operations \u00ab , the net bp share is included in the amounts above.\n\nIn addition, at 31 December 2023, the group had committed to capital expenditure relating to investments in equity-accounted entities amounting to $3,120 million. Contracts were in place for $1,685 million of this total.\n\nThe following table summarizes the group's principal contractual obligations at 31 December 2023, distinguishing between those for which a liability is recognized on the balance sheet and those for which no liability is recognized.

See Financial statements Note 22 for further information.\n- e Represents the expected future contributions to funded pension plans and payments by the group for unfunded pension plans and the expected future payments for other post-retirement benefits.\n- f Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms (such as fixed or minimum purchase volumes, timing of purchase and pricing provisions). Agreements that do not specify all significant terms, or that are not enforceable, are excluded. The amounts shown include arrangements to secure long-term access to supplies of crude oil, natural gas, feedstocks and pipeline systems. In addition, the amounts shown for 2024 include purchase commitments existing at 31 December 2023 entered into principally to meet the group's short-term manufacturing and marketing requirements. The price risk associated with these crude oil, natural gas and power contracts is discussed in Financial statements - Note 29.\n\n## Commitments for the delivery of oil and gas\n\nWe sell crude oil, natural gas and liquefied natural gas under a variety of contractual obligations. Some of these contracts specify the delivery of fixed and determinable quantities. For the period from 2024 to 2026 worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 291 million barrels of oil, 7,586 billion cubic feet of natural gas, and 73 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas. The commitments principally relate to group subsidiaries \u00ab based in Egypt, Singapore, Trinidad and Tobago, the UK and the US. We expect to fulfil these delivery commitments with production from our proved developed reserves and supplies from existing contracts, supplemented by market purchases as necessary.",

        "page_content": "## Oil and gas disclosures for the group\n\n## Analysis by region\n\nOur oil and gas operations are set out below by geographical area, with associated significant events for 2023. bp's percentage working interest in oil and gas assets is shown in brackets. Working interest is the cost-bearing ownership share of an oil or gas lease. Consequently, the percentages disclosed for certain agreements do not necessarily reflect the percentage interests in proved reserves, production or revenue.\n\nIn addition to exploration, development and production activities, our oil production & operations (OP&O) and gas businesses also include certain midstream and liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply activities. Midstream activities involve the management of crude oil and natural gas pipelines, processing facilities and export terminals, LNG processing facilities and transportation, and our natural gas liquids (NGLs) processing business.\n\nOur upstream LNG activities are located in Abu Dhabi, Angola, Australia, Indonesia, and Trinidad. In 2023 our production was 8.5 million tonnes of LNG from these assets, of which 2 million tonnes were marketed through trading and shipping (T&S), which supplements equity production with merchant third party volumes leading to a global long-term strategic LNG portfolio of 23mtpa. In addition to the long-term equity and merchant supply portfolio, bp has delivered 10mtpa in 2023 of incremental merchant volumes through short and mid-term cargos managed through the T&S LNG business. These supplement the long-term portfolio and allow generation of short-term value when opportunities exist.\n\nThe LNG is marketed through contractual rights to access import terminal capacity into the liquid gas markets of Europe, and the UK, and relationships to market directly to end-user customers or trading entities. LNG is supplied to all major LNG demand centres, for example Argentina, Brazil, the Caribbean, China, Croatia, Mediterranean, Iberia and North West Europe, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, T\u00fcrkiye and the UK.\n\n## Europe\n\nbp is active in offshore oil and gas in the UK and Norway. In 2023 bp's UK production came from two key areas: the Shetland area comprising the Clair and Schiehallion fields; and the central area comprising the Andrew area, Culzean, Vorlich and ETAP fields. In Norway, production was through our equity-accounted 15.9% interest in Aker BP.\n\n- \u00b7 On 28 June the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy approved a total of nine plans for development and operation to Aker BP (bp 15.9%), with estimated recoverable reserves to be above 700 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe). As per the public announcement the Norwegian government's approval of two of the developments remain subject to legal challenge in Norway.\n- \u00b7 In September bp and its co-venturers in the Clair joint venture made the final investment decision to proceed with the construction and operation of the Shetland Crossover Pipeline, reinforcing the gas export network and supporting UK security of supply (bp 45% operator).\n- \u00b7 In October the first of two wells for the Murlach oil and gas field in the UK North Sea were spudded, following regulatory approval of the field development plan in September (bp 80% operator).\n- \u00b7 In October bp successfully started production from the Seagull oil and gas field in the UK North Sea. This is the first tieback to the ETAP hub in 20 years. The new field is expected to produce around 50 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (mboe) gross per day at peak production.\n- \u00b7 During the year an impairment charge of $0.9 billion was recognized in respect of certain assets in the North Sea as a result of changes to the group's oil and gas price and discount rate assumptions and activity phasing.\n\n## North America\n\nOur oil and gas activities in North America are located in four areas: deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Lower 48 states, Canada and Mexico.\n\nbp has around 280 lease blocks in the Gulf of Mexico and operates four production hubs.\n\n- \u00b7 During the year bp has been awarded 36 lease blocks in the Gulf of Mexico lease sale 259, which includes 22 leases that may provide options to further enhance our resource positions at Kaskida and Tiber. bp also moved forward with progression of the Kaskida project, bp's first\n\n- 20K development in the Paleogene, and progresses on concept selection for bp-operated Tiber development project in the Gulf of Mexico.\n- \u00b7 In April bp announced start-up of the Mad Dog Phase 2 Argos platform (bp 60.5% operator). With a gross production capacity of up to 140mboe/d, Argos is bp's fifth platform in the Gulf of Mexico.\n- \u00b7 Following a successful appraisal well in the southwest part of the Mad Dog field, bp sanctioned the Argos Southwest Expansion project to tie back into the Argos facility.\n- \u00b7 bp was the apparent high bidder on 24 leases in the Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 261 that took place on 20 December 2023.\n- \u00b7 In December partners approved the expansion of the Shell-operated Great White development in the Gulf of Mexico through a phased threewell campaign (bp 33.33%).\n\nbpx energy, bp's onshore oil and gas business in the Lower 48 states, has significant operated and non-operated activities across Louisiana and Texas producing natural gas, oil, NGLs and condensate, with primary focus on developing unconventional resources. It had a 1.6 billion boe proved reserve base at 31 December 2023, predominantly in unconventional reservoirs (tight gas \u00ab , shale gas and shale oil). bpx energy's core assets span 0.9 million net developed acres with nearly 2,000 operated gross wells at 31 December 2023. Daily net production averaged 366mboe/d in 2023.\n\nbpx energy continues to operate as a separate business while remaining part of the OP&O segment. With its own governance, systems, and processes, it is structured to increase competitive performance through swift decision making and innovation, while maintaining bp's commitment to safe, reliable and compliant operations.\n\n- \u00b7 MiQ, the non-profit global leader in methane certification, announced that it has independently audited and certified bp as the first energy major in the US to verify the methane intensity of its entire US onshore portfolio of natural gas.\n- \u00b7 In August bpx energy successfully brought online 'Bingo', its second central processing facility in the Permian Basin. It is a low-emission, electrified facility that will enable further production growth for bpx energy in the basin (bp 100% operator).\n- \u00b7 During the year an impairment charge of $0.8 billion was recognized as a result of changes to the group's oil and gas price and discount rate assumptions and disposal decisions.\n\nbp's onshore US crude oil and product pipelines and related transportation assets were included in the customers & products segment in 2023.\n\nIn Canada, bp is focused on pursuing offshore exploration and development opportunities and conducts trading and marketing activities across various energy commodities. We hold exploration and significant discovery licences offshore Newfoundland and Labrador, including an interest in the Equinor-operated Bay du Nord project. bp also holds offshore exploration licences in the Arctic where the moratorium has been extended until 31 December 2028.\n\nIn Mexico, bp held interests in two exploration blocks in the Salina Basin with Equinor and Total, Block 1 (bp 33% operator) and Block 3 (bp 33%), and one exploration block in the Sureste Basin, Block 34 (bp 42.5% operator), with Total, QPI Mexico and Hokchi Energy. Hokchi Energy is a subsidiary of Pan American Energy Group (PAEG, see below) in which bp owns 50%. Separate to the above holdings in Mexico, Hokchi Energy also holds an interest in two other blocks.\n\n- \u00b7 Contract termination for Block 3 was executed in April 2023.\n- \u00b7 Formal relinquishment of Block 1 and Block 34 licences are still pending regulatory approval.\n\n## South America\n\nbp has oil and gas activities in Argentina, Brazil and Trinidad and Tobago and, through PAEG, in Argentina and Bolivia.\n\nIn Argentina, bp and Total (operator) are partners on a 50:50 basis in two offshore exploration concessions. Total as the operator issued a relinquishment note to the regulator, which is still pending approval.\n\nIn Brazil bp has interests in seven exploration areas across three basins.\n\n- \u00b7 During 2023 bp and Petrobras received an approval from the regulatory authorities for relinquishments submitted for Dois Irm\u00e3os, C-M-755, CM-793, BC-2, BM-POT-16, S-M-1500, and Peroba blocks.",

(50%), has activities mainly in Argentina and as noted above Mexico, and is also present in Bolivia.\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago bp holds interests in exploration and production licences and production-sharing contracts (PSCs) \u00ab covering 2.5 million acres offshore of the east and north-east coast. Facilities include 16 offshore platforms and two onshore processing facilities. Production comprises gas and associated liquids.\n\nbp also holds interests in the Atlantic LNG facility. The total gross capacity of the four LNG trains making up the facility is approximately 12 million tonnes per annum. bp's shareholding averages 40% across the three companies which own the LNG trains comprising the LNG facility. During 2023 bp sold gas to trains 2 and 3 and processed gas in train 4. Most of the LNG produced from bp gas supplied to Trains 2, 3 and 4 is sold under longterm contracts.\n\n- \u00b7 Cypre, bp's third subsea gas development in Trinidad and Tobago, is expected to start drilling in 2024 with first gas expected in 2025. The project is expected to have seven wells and be tied back to the Juniper platform.\n- \u00b7 The Joe Douglas rig continued drilling in 2023 with Mango and is progressing to Savonette and Angelin. This development will leverage existing infrastructure and contribute to sustained delivery.\n- \u00b7 Trinidad Offshore Pipeline Replacement (TOPR) project for a 12-inch liquids pipeline that connects Mahogany B to terminal was safely integrated into the production system in 2023. Additionally, construction of the Ocelot project, which is a 6-inch liquids pipeline connecting Beachfield to terminal, is under way.\n- \u00b7 bp was awarded three deepwater blocks off Trinidad's east coast in a bp/Shell partnership (50:50). bp is the operator of Blocks 25a & 25b and Shell is the operator of Block 27. Activity in the coming years will include seismic acquisition and interpretation and exploration wells.\n- \u00b7 bp is operator of the Manakin block which was discovered in 1998 and is a cross-border reservoir field with the Venezuelan reservoir, Cocuina. Manakin declared commerciality in January 2018, however cross-border discussions have not progressed due to the impact of US sanctions. In October 2023 the US government eased sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector for six months.\n- \u00b7 Since the conclusion of short-term gas supply agreements, the Atlantic Train 1 plant has not been operational. The Atlantic shareholders, bp, Shell and the National Gas Company of Trinidad & Tobago (NGC), agreed to decouple the Train from the rest of the Atlantic facility with a view to decommissioning it. The Train has been made safe and decoupling and decommissioning work scopes are being planned. On 5 December 2023 bp, Shell and NGC agreed and executed the agreements for the restructuring of the ownership and commercial framework of the Atlantic LNG.\n- \u00b7 During the year an impairment charge of $0.6 billion was recognized as a result of changes to the group's oil and gas price and discount rate assumptions and activity phasing.\n\n## Africa\n\nbp's oil and gas activities in Africa are located in Angola, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania and Senegal.\n\nIn Angola, bp and Eni each own 50% interest in the Azule Energy joint venture. Azule Energy is Angola's largest independent equity producer of oil and gas, holding stakes in 20 licences, as well as an interest in the Angola LNG plant.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00ab\n\n## Additional disclosures\n\n- \u00b7 During the year, Azule Energy has taken the final investment decision for the Agogo Integrated West Hub Development oil project.\n- \u00b7 In August Azule Energy signed a production-sharing agreement (PSA) \u00ab for Block 31/21. The agreement results from the 2021/2022 Limited Offshore Licensing Round and is a significant stride towards advancing exploration in the Lower Congo Basin.\n- \u00b7 In December Azule Energy made progress on sustaining resilient hydrocarbon production with four new exploration agreements in blocks adjacent to existing operations (46, 47, 14/23 and 18/15).\n\nIn Egypt, bp's investments in the country include West Nile Delta, Atoll and Zohr. Through its joint ventures with Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS), Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), International Egyptian Oil Company (IEOC), Eni, the Pharaonic Petroleum Company (PhPC) and through collaboration with Belayim Petroleum Company (Petrobel), bp and its partners now produce more than 70% of Egypt's total gas supply. In addition, bp owns interest in other exploration projects.\n\n- \u00b7 In October bp secured an exploration block located offshore Egypt as part of the EGAS 2022 International Bid Round. The EGY-MED-E8 (East Port Said) block (bp 33%) is located in the Mediterranean Sea, approximately 50-90km from Post Said city and covering an area of approximately 2,620km 2 . In addition to farming into the existing North East Hap'y Offshore Concession the block is currently in the second exploration phase with an exploration well spudded in October 2023.\n- \u00b7 On 14 February 2024 bp announced the formation of a new joint venture in Egypt (bp 51%, ADNOC 49%) under which, subject to regulatory approvals, bp will contribute its interests in three non-operated development concessions as well as exploration agreements in Egypt, and ADNOC will make a proportionate cash contribution.\n\nIn Libya, bp partners with the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) and Eni in an exploration and production-sharing agreement (EPSA) to explore acreage in the onshore Ghadames and offshore Sirt basins (bp 42.5%). bp wrote off all balances associated with the Libya EPSA in 2015.\n\n- \u00b7 Eni's acquisition of a 42.5% interest in the bp-operated EPSA in Libya has been ratified by the Libyan authorities effective November 2022, upon which Eni became exploration operator under the EPSA. bp, LIA and Eni continue to work with the Libyan NOC towards finalizing the transfer of operatorship from bp to Eni, recommencement of petroleum operations and completion of the programme of exploration and drilling activities included in the EPSA.\n\nIn Mauritania and Senegal, bp retains the exploitation licences in the respective C8 and Saint Louis Offshore Profond blocks pertinent to the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim (GTA) Unit cross-border development. In addition, bp holds a 62% participating interest in the BirAllah gas resource exploration licence.\n\n- \u00b7 The GTA project (bp 56%) continues to progress with phase 1 critical milestones including the completion of the offshore hub terminal construction and sailaway of the gas processing FPSO from China in January 2023. The floating LNG vessel reached its destination in February 2024.\n- \u00b7 In February 2023 bp and its partners on the GTA project announced their agreement to evaluate viability of a gravity-based structure (GBS) as the basis for the GTA Phase 2 expansion project.\n- \u00b7 In Senegal, we have exited the Cayar Offshore Profond PSA and transferred operatorship of Yakaar-Teranga gas resource to Kosmos Energy. As a result of the exit, an exploration write-off of $0.3 billion was recognized.\n- \u00b7 In 2023 an impairment charge of $1.4 billion was recognized in respect of certain assets in the region due to increased future forecast expenditure.\n\n## Asia\n\nbp has activities in Abu Dhabi, Azerbaijan, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman.\n\nIn China, we have a 30% equity stake in the Guangdong LNG regasification terminal and trunkline project (GDLNG) with a total storage capacity of 640,000 cubic metres. bp also has 0.6 million tons per annum of regasification capacity at GDLNG for up to 12 years starting from the beginning of 2021. bp imports LNG from our global portfolio and delivers",

The joint operating agreement was terminated on 27 December 2023.\n\nNaftiran Intertrade Co Ltd (NICO), a subsidiary of the National Iranian Oil Company, holds a 10% interest in the Shah Deniz joint venture. For information on the exclusion of this project from EU and US trade sanctions, see International trade sanctions on page 357.\n\nbp holds a 30.1% interest in and operates the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline. The 1,768-kilometre pipeline transports oil from the ACG oilfield and condensate from the Shah Deniz gas and condensate field in the Caspian Sea, along with other third-party oil, to the eastern Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. The pipeline has a capacity of 1mmboe/d, with an average throughput in 2023 of 626mboe/d.\n\nbp (as operator of Azerbaijan International Operating Company and the Georgian Pipeline Company for the Georgian section) also operates the Western Route Export Pipeline (WREP) that transports ACG oil to Supsa on the Black Sea coast of Georgia, with an average throughput of 3mboe/d in 2023. Exports through the pipeline have been suspended since May 2022 due to a lack of nominations from the shipper group. In current market conditions WREP serves as a contingency export route for ACG crude product. In February 2023 WREP was restarted for two weeks following a temporary suspension of liftings from BTC in the wake of the Turkish earthquake on 6 February 2023.\n\n- \u00b7 The Azeri Central East (ACE) project is the next stage of development of the giant ACG field in the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea. During the third quarter the ACE platform topsides unit was safely installed in the field and the first pre-drill well was spudded. This is the seventh and most automated platform installed in the giant ACG field with approximately 100mboe/d installed capacity.\n\nbp holds a 29.99% interest in and operates certain parts of the 693kilometre South Caucasus Pipeline. The pipeline takes gas from the Shah Deniz field in Azerbaijan through Georgia to the Turkish border and has a capacity of 440mboe/d (including expansion), with average throughput in 2023 of 370mboe/d.\n\nbp also holds a 12% interest in the Trans Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP). The pipeline takes Shah Deniz gas from the Turkish border and transports it to Eskisehir in T\u00fcrkiye and to the Greek border where it connects with the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP). The current capacity of TANAP is 275mboe/d and the average throughput in 2023 was 285mboe/d. bp has a 20% interest in TAP, which takes gas through Greece and Albania into Italy. The current capacity of TAP is 167mboe/d and the total average throughout in 2023 was 191mboe/d. TAP and TANAP throughputs exceeded capacity during 2023 due to high flow tests taking place during the year.\n\n- \u00b7 In 2023 bp and our co-venturers in the Shah Deniz Consortium have secured additional capacity in the SNAM RETE GAS, and TANAP pipelines for 2026-2028 period, which will allow the export of more Shah Deniz gas to Europe.\n\nIn Oman, bp operates Block 61, the largest tight gas development in the Middle East (bp 40%). bp also has a 50% interest in Block 77 with Eni (operator) in which an exploration well was spudded in October 2023, scheduled for completion in 2024.\n\nIn Abu Dhabi, bp holds a 10% interest in the ADNOC Onshore concession. We also have a 10% equity shareholding in ADNOC LNG and a 10% shareholding in the shipping company NGSCO. ADNOC LNG supplied approximately 5.09 million tonnes of LNG (0.7bcfe/d regasified) in 2023. Our interest in the ADNOC Onshore concession expires at the end of 2054.\n\n- \u00b7 On 28 March bp, together with ADNOC, made a non-binding offer to take NewMed Energy private through an acquisition of the free float and a partial acquisition of Delek's stake, which would result in bp and ADNOC holding 50% of NewMed Energy.\n\nA consortium of Azerbaijan's national oil company SOCAR along with bp and Israel's NewMed was awarded two licence blocks.\n\nIn 2016 bp signed an enhanced technical service agreement for south and east Kuwait conventional oilfields, which includes the Burgan field, with Kuwait Oil Company.\n\nIn India, we have a participating interest in two oil and gas PSAs (KG D6 33.33% and NEC25 33.33%), and two oil and gas blocks under a revenue sharing contract (KG-UDWHP-2018/1 40% and KG-UDWHP-2022/1 40%), all operated by Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). We also have a 50% stake in India Gas Solutions Private Limited, a joint venture with RIL, for the sourcing and marketing of gas in India.\n\n- \u00b7 On 30 June bp and RIL (operator) announced commencement of production from MJ, the last of three new deepwater developments in the KG D6 block off the east coast of India. With this development, production from the three fields in KG D6 block is expected to account for around one third of India's current domestic gas production and meet approximately 15% of India's gas demand.\n- \u00b7 In December 2023 bp and RIL were awarded the ultra deepwater block KG-UDWHP-2022/1 (RIL operator 60%, bp 40%), adjacent to block KGUDWHP-2018/1, in India's Open Acreage Licensing Policy bid round VIII and both RIL and bp have entered into a revenue sharing contract with the government of India.\n\nIn Indonesia, bp holds an interest in the Andaman II PSC exploration block (operated by Harbour Energy), located offshore North Sumatra and in Agung I and Agung II exploration blocks offshore Indonesia.

Tangguh supplies LNG to customers in Indonesia, Mexico, China, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan through a combination of long, medium and spot contracts.\n\n## Oil and natural gas\n\n## Resource progression\n\nbp manages its hydrocarbon resources in three major categories: prospect inventory, contingent resources and reserves. When a discovery is made, volumes usually transfer from the prospect inventory to the contingent resources category. The contingent resources move through various subcategories as their technical and commercial maturity increases through appraisal activity.\n\nAt the point of final investment decision, most proved reserves will be categorized as proved undeveloped (PUD). Volumes will subsequently be recategorized from PUD to proved developed (PD) as a consequence of development activity. When part of a well's proved reserves depends on a later phase of activity, only that portion of proved reserves associated with existing, available facilities and infrastructure moves to PD. The first PD bookings will typically occur at the point of first oil or gas production. Major development projects typically take one to five years from the time of initial booking of PUD to the start of production. Changes to proved reserves bookings may be made due to analysis of new or existing data concerning production, reservoir performance, commercial factors and additional reservoir development activity.\n\nVolumes can also be added or removed from our portfolio through acquisition or divestment of properties and projects. When we dispose of an interest in a property or project, the volumes associated with our adopted plan of development for which we have a final investment decision will be removed from our proved reserves upon completion of the transaction. When we acquire an interest in a property or project, the volumes associated with the existing development and any committed projects will be added to our proved reserves if bp has made a final investment decision and they satisfy the SEC's criteria for attribution of proved status. Following the acquisition, additional volumes may be progressed to proved reserves from non-proved reserves or contingent resources.\n\nNon-proved reserves and contingent resources in a field will only be recategorized as proved reserves when all the criteria for attribution of proved status have been met and the volumes are included in the business plan and scheduled for development, typically within five years. bp will only book proved reserves where development is scheduled to commence after more than five years, if these proved reserves satisfy the SEC's criteria for attribution of proved status and bp management has reasonable certainty that these proved reserves will be produced.\n\nAt the end of 2023 bp had material volumes of proved undeveloped reserves held for more than five years in Azerbaijan. These are part of ongoing infrastructure-led development activities for which bp has a historical track record of completing comparable projects. We have no proved undeveloped reserves held for more than five years in our onshore US developments.\n\nOver the past five years, bp has annually progressed a weighted average 17% (18% for 2022 five-year average) of our group proved undeveloped reserves (including the impact of disposals and price acceleration effects in PSAs) to proved developed reserves. This equates to a turnover time of six years.\n\nProved reserves as estimated at the end of 2023 meet bp's criteria for project sanctioning and SEC tests for proved reserves. We have not halted or changed our commitment to proceed with any material project to which proved undeveloped reserves have been attributed.\n\nIn 2023 we progressed 624mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves (542mmboe for our subsidiaries \u00ab alone) to proved developed reserves through ongoing investment in our subsidiaries' and equity-accounted entities' development activities. Total development expenditure, excluding midstream activities, was $11,263 million in 2023 ($8,206 million for subsidiaries and $3,057 million for equity-accounted entities). Of the $8,206 million of total development expenditure for our subsidiaries, approximately $2,800 million was used for development activity to progress proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed. Of the $3,057 million development expenditure for our equity-accounted entities, approximately\n\n## Additional disclosures\n\n$1,200 million was used for development activity to progress proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed. The major areas with progressed volumes in 2023 were the US, Asia Pacific, Trinidad and Tobago and the Middle East.\n\nRevisions of previous estimates for proved undeveloped reserves are due to changes relating to field performance, well results, revisions to future activity plans (including alignment with our investment criteria and changes to the macroeconomic climate) or changes in commercial conditions including price impacts. The net revisions to previous estimates across both our subsidiaries and our equity-accounted entities include net positive revisions driven by price and revisions to activity plans, and net negative revisions driven by field performance and well results. The net revisions to previous estimates across only our subsidiaries include net positive revisions driven by price and revisions to activity plans and net negative revisions driven by field performance and well results. In each case, none of these factors resulted in revisions that were material to the group as a whole. The following tables describe the changes to our proved undeveloped reserves position through the year for our subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities and for our subsidiaries alone.\n\n| Subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities                                                    | volumes in mmboe a Group   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Proved undeveloped reserves at 1 January 2023                                                 | 2,877                      |\n| Revisions of previous estimates                                                               | (12)                       |\n| Price                                                                                         | 24                         |\n| Revision of future activity plans                                                             | 69                         |\n| Field performance                                                                             | (88)                       |\n| Well results                                                                                  | (17)                       |\n| Improved recovery                                                                             | 108                        |\n| Discoveries and extensions                                                                    | 107                        |\n| Purchases                                                                                     | 74                         |\n| Sales                                                                                         | (10)                       |\n| Total in year proved undeveloped reserves changes                                             | 267                        |\n| Proved developed reserves reclassified as undeveloped                                         | 39                         |\n| Progressed to proved developed reserves by  development activities (e.g. drilling/completion) | (624)                      |\n| Proved undeveloped reserves at 31 December 2023                                               | 2,558                      |\n\n| Subsidiaries only                                                                             | volumes in mmboe a   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Proved undeveloped reserves at 1 January 2023                                                 | 2,392                |\n| Revisions of previous estimates                                                               | (22)                 |\n| Price                                                                                         | 16                   |\n| Revision of future activity plans                                                             | 51                   |\n| Field performance                                                                             | (87)                 |\n| Well results                                                                                  | -                    |\n| Improved recovery                                                                             | 75                   |\n| Discoveries and extensions                                                                    | 27                   |\n| Purchases                                                                                     | 61                   |\n| Sales                                                                                         | (2)                  |\n| Total in year proved undeveloped reserves changes                                             | 139                  |\n| Proved developed reserves reclassified as undeveloped                                         | 17                   |\n| Progressed to proved developed reserves by  development activities (e.g. drilling/completion) | (542)                |\n| Proved undeveloped reserves at 31 December 2023                                               | 2,006                |\n\nbp bases its proved reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements. bp only applies technologies that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. bp applies highresolution seismic data for the identification of reservoir extent and fluid contacts only where there is an overwhelming track record of success in its local application.

        "page_content": "formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In certain deepwater fields bp has booked proved reserves before production flow tests are conducted, in part because of the significant safety, cost and environmental implications of conducting these tests. The industry has made substantial technological improvements in understanding, measuring and delineating reservoir properties without the need for flow tests. To determine reasonable certainty of commercial recovery, bp employs a general method of reserves assessment that relies on the integration of three types of data:\n\n- \u00b7 Well data used to assess the local characteristics and conditions of reservoirs and fluids.\n- \u00b7 Field scale seismic data to allow the interpolation and extrapolation of these characteristics outside the immediate area of the local well control.\n- \u00b7 Data from relevant analogous fields.\n\nWell data includes appraisal wells or sidetrack holes, full logging suites, core data and fluid samples. bp considers the integration of this data in certain cases to be superior to a flow test in providing understanding of overall reservoir performance. The collection of data from logs, cores, wireline formation testers, pressures and fluid samples calibrated to each other and to the seismic data can allow reservoir properties to be determined over a greater volume than the localized volume of investigation associated with a short-term flow test. There is a strong track record of proved reserves recorded using these methods, validated by actual production levels.\n\n## Governance\n\nbp's centrally controlled process for proved reserves estimation approval forms part of a holistic and integrated system of internal control. It consists of the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 Accountabilities of certain officers of the group to ensure that there is review and approval of proved reserves bookings independent of the operating business and that there are effective controls in the approval process and verification that the proved reserves estimates and the related financial impacts are reported in a timely manner.\n- \u00b7 Capital allocation processes, whereby delegated authority is exercised to commit to capital projects that are consistent with the delivery of the group's business plan. A formal review process exists to ensure that both technical and commercial criteria are met prior to the commitment of capital to projects.\n- \u00b7 Internal audit, whose role is to consider whether the group's system of internal control is adequately designed and operating effectively to respond appropriately to the risks that are significant to bp.\n- \u00b7 Approval hierarchy, whereby proved reserves changes above certain threshold volumes require immediate review and all proved reserves require annual central authorization and have scheduled periodic reviews. The frequency of periodic review ensures that 100% of the bp proved reserves base undergoes central review every three years.\n\nbp's vice president of reserves is the individual primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimate. He has more than 30 years of diversified industry experience in reserves estimation with the past four years managing the governance and compliance. He is a past Chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (Russia & Caspian) and a member of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Expert Group on Resource Management.\n\nNo specific portion of compensation bonuses for senior management is directly related to proved reserves targets. Additions to proved reserves is one of several indicators by which the performance of the gas & low carbon and oil production & operations segments is assessed by the remuneration committee for the purposes of determining compensation bonuses for the executive directors. Other indicators include a number of financial and operational measures.\n\nbp's variable pay programme for the other senior managers in the gas & low carbon and oil production & operations segments is based on individual performance contracts. Individual performance contracts are based on agreed items from the business performance plan, one of which, if chosen, could relate to proved reserves.\n\n## Compliance\n\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) do not provide specific guidance on reserves disclosures. bp estimates proved reserves in\n\naccordance with SEC Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X and relevant Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (C&DI) and Staff Accounting Bulletins as issued by the SEC staff.\n\nBy their nature, there is always risk involved in the ultimate development and production of proved reserves including, but not limited to: final regulatory approval; the installation of new or additional infrastructure, as well as changes in oil and gas prices; changes in operating and development costs; and the continued availability of additional development capital. All the group's proved reserves held in subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities are estimated by the group's petroleum engineers or by independent petroleum engineering consulting firms and then assured by the group's petroleum engineers.\n\nNetherland, Sewell & Associates (NSAI), an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm, has estimated the net proved crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas reserves, as of 31 December 2023, of certain properties owned by bp in the US Lower 48. The properties evaluated by NSAI account for 100% of bp's net proved reserves in the US Lower 48 as of 31 December 2023. The net proved reserves estimates prepared by NSAI were prepared in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rule 4-10(a)(1)-(32) of Regulation S-X. All reserves estimates involve some degree of uncertainty. bp has filed NSAI's independent report on its reserves estimates as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC.\n\nOur proved reserves are associated with both concessions (tax and royalty arrangements) and agreements where the group is exposed to the upstream risks and rewards of ownership, but where our entitlement to the hydrocarbons is calculated using a more complex formula, such as with PSAs. In a concession, the consortium of which we are a part is entitled to the proved reserves that can be produced over the licence period, which may be the life of the field. In a PSA, we are entitled to recover volumes that equate to costs incurred to develop and produce the proved reserves and an agreed share of the remaining volumes or the economic equivalent. As part of our entitlement is driven by the monetary amount of costs to be recovered, price fluctuations will have an impact on both production volumes and reserves.\n\nWe disclose our share of proved reserves held in equity-accounted entities (joint ventures \u00ab and associates \u00ab ), although we do not control these entities or the assets held by such entities.\n\n## bp's estimated net proved reserves and proved reserves replacement\n\n94% of our total proved reserves of subsidiaries at 31 December 2023 were held through joint operations \u00ab (94% in 2022), and 31% of the proved reserves were held through such joint operations where we were not the operator (34% in 2022).\n\n## Estimated net proved reserves of crude oil at 31 December 2023 abc\n\n|                           | Developed   | Undeveloped   | million barrels Total   |\n|---------------------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|\n| UK                        | 129         | 74            | 203                     |\n| US                        | 713         | 352           | 1,065                   |\n| Rest of North America     | -           | -             | -                       |\n| South America d           | 3           | 5             | 7                       |\n| Africa                    | 5           | -             | 6                       |\n| Rest of Asia              | 729         | 323           | 1,052                   |\n| Australasia               | 11          | 1             | 12                      |\n| Subsidiaries              | 1,590       | 755           | 2,345                   |\n| Equity-accounted entities | 588         | 387           | 976                     |\n| Total                     | 2,179       | 1,142         | 3,321                   |",

Natural gas decreased by 5% (7% decrease for subsidiaries and 6% increase for equity-accounted entities).\n\nThere was a net increase from acquisitions and disposals of 31mmboe within our US and North Africa subsidiaries.\n\n## Additional disclosures\n\nThe proved reserves replacement ratio \u00ab is the extent to which production is replaced by proved reserves additions. This ratio is expressed in oil equivalent terms and includes changes resulting from revisions to previous estimates, improved recovery, and extensions and discoveries. For 2023, the proved reserves replacement ratio excluding acquisitions and disposals was 47% (20% in 2022 and 50% in 2021) for subsidiaries and equityaccounted entities, 31% for subsidiaries alone and 136% for equityaccounted entities alone. There was a net increase (80mmboe) of reserves in some of our PSAs in Azerbaijan and the Middle East due to lower gas and oil prices, partially offset by a decrease in the US due to price.\n\nIn 2023 net additions to the group's proved reserves (excluding production, sales and purchases of reserves-in-place) amounted to 406mmboe (227mmboe for subsidiaries and 179mmboe for equity-accounted entities), through revisions to previous estimates including price, improved recovery from, and extensions to, existing fields and discoveries of new fields. The majority of subsidiary additions were through improved recovery from, and extensions to, existing fields and discoveries of new fields where they represented a mixture of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves. The principal proved reserves additions in our subsidiaries by region were in the US and the Middle East. The principal reserves additions in our equity-accounted entities were in Aker BP and PAEG.\n\nIn January 2024 it was reported that the Oslo District Court had determined that certain development permits granted by the Norwegian government during 2023 were invalid. This includes development permits for two fields in which Aker bp has an interest. The court's decision is not final and could be appealed. If bp's equity-accounted share of the reserves attributable to these two fields is removed from the calculation of bp's 2023 proved reserves ratio, that ratio would decrease from 47% to 44%. Removal of the same reserves from bp's 2023 reporting would also impact proved hydrocarbon reserves for the group, proved undeveloped reserves and estimated net proved reserves on an oil equivalent basis amongst other reported measures both for equity-accounted entities and group.\n\n26% of our proved reserves are associated with PSAs. The countries in which we produced under PSAs in 2023 were Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico and Oman. In addition, the technical service contract (TSC) \u00ab governing our investment in the Rumaila field in Iraq functions as a PSA.\n\nThe group holds no licences in our PSAs or TSCs due to expire within the next three years that would have a significant impact on bp's reserves or production, including undeveloped acreage.\n\nFor further information on our reserves see page 254.",

Instead, it forms part of a larger transaction that includes, for example, normal operations and maintenance expenditure. The figures for environmental operating and capital expenditure in the table are therefore estimates, based on the definitions and guidelines of the American Petroleum Institute.\n\nEnvironmental operating expenditure of $524 million in 2023 (2022 $416 million) showed an overall increase of 26%, largely due to increased expenditure in BP Rotterdam and BP North America Gas.\n\nEnvironmental capital expenditure of $329 million in 2023 (2022 $224 million) showed an overall increase of 47% largely due to increased expenditure for BP Products North America and BP North America Gas.\n\nClean-up costs were $23 million in 2023 (2022 $16 million), representing oil spill clean-up costs and other associated remediation and disposal costs.\n\nIn addition to operating and capital expenditure, we also establish provisions for future environmental remediation work. Expenditure against such provisions normally occurs in subsequent periods and is not included in environmental operating expenditure reported for such periods.\n\nProvisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Generally, this coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.\n\nThe extent and cost of future environmental restoration, remediation and abatement programmes are inherently difficult to estimate. They often depend on the extent of contamination, and the associated impact and timing of the corrective actions required, technological feasibility and bp's share of liability. Though the costs of future programmes could be significant and may be material to the results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, it is not expected that such costs will be material to the group's overall results of operations or financial position.\n\nAdditions to our environmental remediation provision reflect new liabilities and scope/cost reassessments of the remediation plans of a number of our sites, primarily in the US. The charge for environmental remediation provisions in 2023 arising from new and acquired sites was $37 million (2022 $67 million and 2021 $33 million).\n\nIn addition, we make provisions on installation of our oil and gas producing assets and related pipelines to meet the cost of eventual decommissioning. On installation of an oil or natural gas production facility, a provision is established that represents the discounted value of the expected future cost of decommissioning the asset.\n\nIn 2023, the net increase in the decommissioning provision was primarily due to recognition of additional provisions and changes in cost estimate assumptions.\n\nWe undertake periodic reviews of existing provisions. These reviews take account of revised cost assumptions, changes in decommissioning requirements and any technological developments.\n\nProvisions for environmental remediation and decommissioning are usually established on a discounted basis, as required by IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets'.\n\nFurther details of decommissioning and environmental provisions appear in Financial statements - Note 23.\n\n## Additional disclosures\n\n## Regulation of the group's business\n\nOur businesses and operations are subject to the laws and regulations applicable in each country, state or other regional or local area in which they occur. These cover virtually all aspects of bp's activities and include matters such as the acquisition of rights to develop and operate projects, production rates, royalties, environmental, health and safety protection, fuel specifications and transportation, trading, pricing, anti-trust, export, taxes, and foreign exchange.\n\n## Oil and gas contractual and regulatory framework\n\nThe terms and conditions of the leases, licences and contracts under which our upstream oil and gas interests are held vary from country to country. These leases, licences and contracts are generally granted by or entered into with a government entity or state-owned or controlled company and are sometimes entered into with private property owners. Arrangements with governmental or state entities usually take the form of licences or production-sharing agreements \u00ab (PSAs), although arrangements with private entities and the US government entities are usually by lease.\n\nLicences (or concessions) give the holder the right to explore for, develop and produce a commercial discovery. Under a licence, the holder bears the risk of exploration, development and production activities and provides the financing for these operations. In principle, the licence holder is entitled to all production, minus any royalties that are payable in kind. A licence holder is generally required to pay production taxes or royalties, which may be in cash or in kind.\n\nIn certain countries, separate licences are required for exploration and production activities, and in some cases production licences are limited to only a portion of the area covered by the original exploration licence.\n\nPSAs entered into with a government entity or state-owned or statecontrolled company generally require bp (alone or with other contracting companies) to provide all the financing and bear the risk of exploration and production activities in exchange for a share of the production remaining after royalties, if any. Less typically, bp may explore for, develop and produce hydrocarbons under a service agreement with the host entity in exchange for reimbursement of costs and/or a fee paid in cash rather than production.\n\nbp frequently conducts its exploration and production activities in joint arrangements or co-ownership arrangements with other international oil companies, state-owned or -controlled companies and/or private companies. Conventionally, all costs, benefits, rights, obligations, liabilities and risks incurred in carrying out joint arrangement or co-ownership operations under a lease, licence or PSA are shared among the joint arrangement or co-owning parties according to agreed ownership interests which are set out in a joint operating agreement. To the extent that any liabilities arise, whether to governments or third parties, or as between the joint arrangement parties or co-owners themselves, each joint arrangement party or co-owner will generally be liable under the terms of a joint operating agreement to meet these in proportion to its ownership interest. Any agreed allocation of liability amongst the joint arrangement parties is, however, often different to the position under the relevant licence, lease or PSA which may provide for joint and several liability of the joint arrangement parties including for decommissioning obligations. In many upstream operations, a party (known as the operator) will be appointed (pursuant to a joint operating agreement) to carry out day to-day operations on behalf of the joint arrangement or co-ownership. The operator is typically one of the joint arrangement parties or a co-owner and will carry out its duties either through its own staff, or by contracting out various elements to third-party contractors or service providers. bp acts as operator on behalf of joint arrangements and co-ownerships in a number of countries.\n\nFrequently, work (including drilling and related activities) will be contracted out to third-party service providers. The relevant contract will specify the work, the remuneration, and typically the risk allocation between the parties. Depending on the service to be provided, the contract may also contain provisions allocating risks and liabilities associated with pollution and environmental damage, damage to a well or hydrocarbon reservoirs and for claims from third parties or other losses. The allocation of those risks",

        "page_content": "varies among contracts and is determined through negotiation between the parties.\n\nIn general, bp incurs income tax on income generated from production activities (whether under a licence or PSA). In addition, depending on the area, bp's production activities may be subject to a range of other taxes, levies and assessments, including special petroleum taxes and revenue taxes. The taxes imposed on oil and gas production profits and activities may be substantially higher than those imposed on other activities, for example in Egypt, the UK, the US and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n## Low carbon energy - renewables contractual and regulatory framework\n\nThe majority of our renewable assets are held indirectly through interests in incorporated joint ventures or special purpose entities (in either case, a Project Company). The renewables contractual and regulatory framework and the rights granted in relation to a renewable asset significantly vary from country to country. In some countries, the regulatory framework is still under development or subject to significant change as the renewables industry evolves.\n\nIn general terms the rights to a renewable asset are usually held by a Project Company through a package of assets that together form the renewable project owned by such Project Company, including:\n\n- \u00b7 one or more leases, easements, or licences over land or seabed granted by a public or private individual or entity that grant the Project Company rights to develop, build and operate the renewable asset in such areas of land or seabed;\n- \u00b7 one or more generation licences that grant the Project Company the right to produce and sell the electricity to the market;\n- \u00b7 an interconnection agreement that grants the Project Company the right to connect the power project into the grid;\n- \u00b7 an offtake agreement which, depending on the country's electricity market, is entered into with a utility company, a corporate buyer or a public entity; and\n- \u00b7 potentially, a subsidy mechanism in the form of a feed in tariff, contract for difference, hedging mechanism or renewable energy certificate to support the development of the project.\n\nThe risk allocation between the developer/generator and the host government or private entity has not been standardized in the industry. However, in general terms the Project Company bears the risk of the development, construction and operation of the renewable energy project and secures the financing for these operations and receives any profit from the revenue generated through the offtake agreement and/or subsidy mechanism (if available).\n\n## US Inflation Reduction Act\n\nThe US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was signed into law in August 2022, includes a significant package of largely supply-side measures supporting low carbon energy sources and decarbonization technologies in the US. The impact of the IRA both on bp's businesses and more widely on the US economy is likely to depend on various factors which are currently uncertain, including the implementation of the incentive programmes by the US authorities through the Department of Energy (DOE) and other agencies, as well as regulatory initiatives at the local and federal level.\n\nIn 2023, bp participated in applications for and was subsequently notified that it will be awarded various DOE grants related to certain of bp's low carbon energy and decarbonization projects. bp and its co-applicants are currently negotiating the applicable award agreements with the DOE and we anticipate finalizing these agreements in 2024.\n\n## Greenhouse gas regulation\n\nIn December 2015, nearly 200 nations at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris (COP21) agreed to the Paris Agreement which aims to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Signatories aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as soon as possible and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter, so as to achieve a balance between human caused emissions and removals by sinks of GHGs in the second half of this century. The Paris Agreement commits all signatories to submit Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) (i.e. pledges or plans of\n\nclimate action) and pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving the objectives of their NDCs. Signatories are required to submit revised NDCs every five years, and the revised NDCs are expected to be more ambitious with each revision. The first global stocktake of progress was published by the United Nations in September 2023 and further assessments will occur every five years. The UAE conference (COP28) in Dubai, which took place in November and December 2023, marked the conclusion and outcome of this first stocktake and reached a 'consensus' which includes calls for an acceleration of efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power and to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems.\n\nMore stringent national and regional measures relating to the transition to a lower carbon economy, such as the UK's 2050 net zero carbon emissions commitment, can be expected in the future. These measures could increase bp's production costs for certain products, increase compliance and litigation costs, increase demand for competing energy alternatives or products with lower-carbon intensity, and affect the sales and specifications of many of bp's products. Further, such measures could lead to constraints on production and supply and access to new reserves, particularly due to the long-term nature of many of bp's projects.\n\nCertain current and announced GHG measures and developments potentially affecting bp's businesses in various markets in which bp operates are summarized below. For information on steps that bp is taking in relation to climate change issues and for details of bp's GHG reporting, see Sustainability - Net zero aims on page 48.\n\n## United States\n\nIn the US, bp's operations are affected by GHG regulation in a number of ways. The federal Clean Air Act (CAA) regulates air emissions, permitting, fuel specifications and other aspects of our production, refining, distribution and marketing activities.\n\nIn November, 2023, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated the 'Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas Sector Climate Review.' These regulations are focused on methane emissions from oil and gas production at new and existing facilities and include significant requirements in the areas of fugitive emissions monitoring and repair, flaring, emission event reporting, process controller and pump emissions, and storage vessels.\n\nThe IRA requires EPA to collect an annual Waste Emissions Charge (WEC) on methane emissions from oil and natural gas facilities that exceed specific levels of emissions and methane intensity. The WEC is $900/ metric ton of methane emissions occurring in 2024, $1,200/metric ton for emissions occurring in 2025, and $1,500/metric ton for emissions occurring in 2026 and years thereafter. In January 2024, EPA proposed regulations to implement the WEC provisions of the IRA. The date and details of those final regulations to be issued are uncertain.\n\nOther EPA GHG and environmental regulations affect electricity generation practices and prices and have an impact on the market for fuels used to generate electricity and on renewable energy installations. These regulations are in flux due to changes in approach between presidential administrations, as well as lawsuits challenging those regulations.\n\nIn June 2022, the Supreme Court decision in West Virginia v. EPA limited EPA's regulatory authority to require electricity 'generation shifting' (e.g., from coal to natural gas or renewable sources). In May 2023, EPA proposed new carbon pollution standards for coal and gas-fired power plants. The proposed regulations would tighten emissions limits for those plants and require some plants to install carbon capture technology. The date and requirements of any final regulations issued are uncertain.\n\nIn April 2023, EPA proposed regulations to significantly tighten emissions standards for light- and medium-duty vehicles for model year (MY) 2027 and beyond. The proposed regulations are intended to spur emissions reductions technology on hydrocarbon-powered vehicles and to encourage the transition to electric vehicles. The date and requirements of any final regulations issued are uncertain.\n\nThe Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 impose the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), requiring transportation fuel sold in the United States to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels. On June 21, 2023, EPA announced a final rule establishing biofuel volume requirements and associated percentage",

In addition, certain state initiatives impose carbon-intensity reduction requirements on transportation fuels sold in those states (e.g. in California, Oregon and Washington).\n\nThe federal GHG Mandatory Reporting Rule requires operators of certain facilities and producers and importers/exporters of petroleum products to file annual GHG emissions reports with EPA quantifying direct emissions from affected facilities, as well as the emissions that would result from the release or combustion of the petroleum products imported, exported or produced.\n\nA number of states, municipalities and regional organizations continue to advance climate initiatives that affect our US operations. For example, certain state initiatives impose carbon-intensity reduction requirements on transportation fuels sold in those states (e.g. in California, Oregon, and Washington). Recently, California proposed to increase the stringency of its Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) to achieve a 30% reduction in carbon intensity required by 2030 (up from 20%). The State of Washington enacted state-wide carbon cap and invest legislation and a Clean Fuel Program (similar to California's LCFS) in 2021. In 2022, the State of Washington finalized rules implementing both of those programmes.\n\nOur US businesses are subject to increased GHG and other environmental requirements and regulatory uncertainty, including that the current or any future US administration could revise or revoke current or prior administration programmes, as well as the possibility of increased expenditures in having to comply with numerous diverse and non-uniform regulatory initiatives at the state and local level.\n\nUS fuel markets are affected by EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regulation of light, medium and heavy-duty vehicle emissions (both fuel economy and tailpipe standards) as well as for nonroad engines and vehicles and certain large GHG stationary emission sources. California also imposes Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) and Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) standards on vehicle manufacturers, and a number of other states, as allowed by CAA authority, have adopted California's standards. In August 2022, California finalized the next generation of its GHG and ZEV standards (referred to as 'ACC II'). California filed a waiver application with EPA in December 2023. Fifteen other states have adopted ACC II although EPA has not yet acted upon the application. These regulations may impact bp's product mix and demand for particular products in those states. In August 2020, California also entered into agreements with several carmakers to meet more demanding emissions standards in California. In March 2023, EPA granted California's request for a waiver of pre-emption covering, in part, its Advanced Clean Trucks Program, which mandates increasing quantities of ZEV sales for mediumand heavy-duty vehicles in the state. A legal challenge to that decision is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, the Biden administration revised the fuel economy and tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions standards for passenger cars and light trucks covering model years (MY) 2023 through 2026. The revised standards are more stringent through MY 2026 than the August 2020 agreements California reached with several carmakers. EPA's new tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions standards were challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals with a decision still pending. EPA has also restored California's Clean Air Act waiver allowing it to set its own GHG automotive tailpipe standards and for other states to adopt those standards. That decision has also been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n\nIn December 2022, EPA promulgated regulations establishing new emission standards for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and other pollutants for highway heavy-duty engines. California has also adopted a 'Heavy-Duty Low NOx Omnibus Regulation' which will require manufacturers to comply with stricter emissions standards and a number of other states have opted or are planning to opt into those California standards. The rule is being phased in, with the first phase effective in 2024. bp continues to monitor these rules for implications for fuels. These and other EPA initiatives to reduce GHG emissions may have a significant effect on the production, sale and profitability of many of bp's products in the US.\n\n## European Union\n\nThe EU has adopted a goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 as part of the European Green Deal and, subsequently, a 55% GHG reduction target\n\n\u00ab\n\n## Additional disclosures\n\nby 2030 compared to 1990 levels. To achieve this target, EU member states and Parliament adopted most measures proposed as part of the so-called 'Fit for 55' package. These include revisions of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and a newly created Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM); the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) - including an obligation on transport fuel suppliers to increase the share of renewables of their fuel supply; a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending mandate from 2025; and CO 2 targets for the sales of new vehicles which are expected to accelerate the decarbonisation of the transport sector and impact fuel demand.\n\nOnce fully adopted and implemented, this would inter alia lead to higher shares of renewables across all sectors (including transport), a reduced number of GHG emission allowances under the EU ETS, and a target of zero gramme of CO 2 per km for new passenger cars by 2035. The EU also adopted measures to reduce methane emissions.\n\nSome EU member states have adopted national targets above and beyond current EU climate goals, such as Germany, with a climate neutrality target by 2045.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nIn April 2021, the UK government announced a target of a 78% reduction in emissions by 2035 compared to 1990 levels.\n\nThe UK Emissions Trading System (UK ETS) launched on 1 January 2021 following the end of the Brexit transition period and the UK's participation in the EU ETS. It seeks to provide a carbon pricing mechanism as a tool for helping achieve the UK's net zero target and covers the same GHGs and sectors as the EU ETS. bp's North Sea operations are subject to the UK ETS.\n\nIn July 2023, the UK government published a response to a 2022 consultation on proposed changes to the UK ETS rules. That response included decisions to expand the scope of the scheme to include domestic maritime transport from 2026, waste incineration and energy from waste from 2028 and process emissions from carbon dioxide venting from the upstream oil and gas sector from 2025.\n\nIn December 2023, the UK ETS Authority published two consultations. One covers a review of the UK ETS markets policy and the other relates to a review of free allocation methodology for the stationary sectors under the UK ETS to better target those most at risk of carbon leakage.\n\n## Other countries and regions\n\nChina is operating emission trading pilot programmes in a number of cities and provinces. One of bp's subsidiaries in China is participating in these programmes. In February 2021 China introduced a national emissions trading market (National ETS). The National ETS is intended to be an essential tool for China to fulfil its commitment to reach peak emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. For now, the National ETS participants are limited to the key emission entities identified by each provincial-level government authority and approved by Ministry for Ecology and Environment of China. bp is not participating in the National ETS.\n\nIn October 2021, as part of its '1+N' climate policy framework, China issued working guidance setting out specific targets and measures for achieving peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality, and an action plan which sets out the main objectives for the next decade to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030. The working guidance is the '1' (i.e., a long-term approach to combating climate change), while 'N' are various policies starting with the action plan. In June 2022, 17 government authorities jointly released the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy 2035 making overall plans to prepare the country to adapt to climate change from the present to 2035.\n\nChina's domestic voluntary carbon mechanism called the China Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) programme has been suspended since 2017. In 2023, significant progress toward relaunching the CCER has been made by relevant authorities, including the promulgation of a regulation on CCER trading for trial implementation and the publication of methodologies that will be used to quantify net emission reductions or removals for four types of projects (forestation, solar thermal power, offshore wind power generation and mangrove revegetation).\n\nOn 5 January 2024, China's State Council approved an interim regulation for the national emissions trading scheme. The final version was issued on 4 February 2024 which has provisions on defining the scale of the national",

These laws may apply to sites that bp currently owns or operates, sites that it previously owned or operated, or sites used for the disposal of its and other parties' waste. See Financial statements - Note 23 for information on provisions for environmental restoration and remediation.\n\nA number of pending or anticipated governmental proceedings against certain bp group companies under environmental laws could result in monetary or other sanctions. Group companies are also subject to environmental claims for personal injury and property damage alleging the release of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. The costs associated with future environmental remediation obligations, governmental proceedings and claims could be significant and may be material to the results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. We cannot accurately predict the effects of future developments, such as stricter environmental laws and regulations or enforcement policies, or future events at our facilities on the group, and there can be no assurance that material liabilities and costs will not be incurred in the future. For a discussion of the group's environmental expenditure, see page 353 and for a discussion of legal proceedings, see page 242.\n\nSignificant health, safety and environmental legislation and regulation affecting our businesses and profitability, in addition to those referred to above, include the following:\n\n## United States\n\n- \u00b7 The Clean Water Act regulates wastewater and other effluent discharges from bp's facilities, and bp is required to obtain discharge permits, install control equipment and implement operational controls and preventative measures.\n- \u00b7 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulates the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of wastes associated with our operations and can require corrective action at locations where such wastes have been disposed of or released. bp has incurred, or is likely to incur, liability under RCRA or similar state laws in connection with sites bp operates or previously operated.\n- \u00b7 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) can, in certain circumstances, impose the entire cost of investigation and remediation on a party who owned or operated a site contaminated with a hazardous substance, or who arranged for disposal of a hazardous substance at a site. bp has incurred, or is likely to incur, liability under CERCLA or similar state laws, including costs attributed to insolvent or unidentified parties. bp is also subject to claims for remediation costs and natural resource damages under CERCLA and other federal and state laws. CERCLA also requires the reporting on the releases of certain quantities of listed hazardous substances to designated government agencies.\n- \u00b7 The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act requires reporting on the storage, use and releases of certain quantities of listed extremely hazardous substances to designated government agencies.\n- \u00b7 The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) regulates bp's manufacture, import, export, sale and use of chemical substances and products. In addition, EPA has revised processes and procedures for prioritisation of existing chemicals for risk evaluation, assessment and management. Agency actions and announcements are monitored regularly to identify developments with potential impacts on chemical substances important to bp products and operations.\n- \u00b7 The Occupational Safety and Health Act imposes workplace safety and health requirements on bp operations along with significant process safety management obligations, requiring continuous evaluation and improvement of operational practices to enhance safety and reduce\n\n- workplace emissions at gas processing, refining and other regulated facilities.\n- \u00b7 The Oil Pollution Act 1990 (OPA) imposes operational requirements, liability standards and other obligations governing the transportation of petroleum products in US waters. States may impose additional obligations. Alaska, West Coast and certain East Coast states impose additional requirements and stricter liability standards.\n- \u00b7 The Outer Continental Shelf Land Act, the Mineral Leasing Act and other statutes give the Department of Interior (DOI) and the BLM authority to regulate operations and air emissions, including equipment and testing, on offshore and onshore operations on federal lands subject to DOI authority.\n- \u00b7 The Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Marine Mammal Protection Act protect certain species' habitats from adverse human impacts by restricting operations or development at certain times and in certain places. In 2020, the US Fish and Wildlife Service published regulatory definitions impacting habitat designations under the ESA, but in June 2022, the Biden administration rescinded those definitions. The Biden administration rescission of those definitions could expand the geographic areas subject to habitat protections.\n\n## European Union\n\n- \u00b7 The Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) 2010 provides the framework for granting permits for major industrial sites. A recently agreed revision of the IED could, once formally adopted and implemented, potentially set more stringent permitting requirements, and lead to a further tightening of emission limit values.\n- \u00b7 The EU Registration, Evaluation Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation 2006 requires registration of chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the EU, together with the submission of relevant hazard and risk data. REACH affects our manufacturing or trading/import operations in the EU. bp maintains compliance by checking whether imports are covered by the registrations of non-EU suppliers' representatives, preparing and submitting registration dossiers to cover new manufactured and imported substances, and updating previously submitted registrations as required.\n- \u00b7 The Water Framework Directive (WFD) published in 2000 aims to protect the quantity and quality of ground and surface waters of the EU member states. The implementation in the EU member states is still ongoing, planned to be finalised by 2027. Future proceedings on the determination of pollutants/priority substances as well as environmental quality standards in line with the WFD may require additional compliance efforts and increased costs for managing freshwater withdrawals and discharges from bp's EU operations.\n- \u00b7 The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) entered into force on 5 January 2023 introducing new requirements for companies with securities listed on an EU regulated market or which exceed a threshold for turnover derived in the EU, to include disclosures related to climate, the environment and wider sustainability issues. The CSRD also expands to in-scope entities the requirements introduced by the EU Taxonomy Regulation, to identify environmentally sustainable activities and then disclose metrics related to capital and operating expenditure and turnover associated with those activities. Disclosure requirements will be phased in from 2025, in respect of the 2024 financial year.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\n- \u00b7 Following the UK's exit from the European Union, operative EU laws were retained in UK law by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (EUWA). In June 2023, the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023 received Royal Assent. That Act allows for significant changes to the status, operation and content of retained EU law, including through amendments to the EUWA. However, the UK government has not issued a policy statement on how it intends to use these powers and therefore future amendments to and deviations from retained EU law including in respect of environmental matters are uncertain.\n- \u00b7 Since the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, there has been a parallel UK REACH regime which applies in Great Britain only, with EU REACH continuing to apply in Northern Ireland.

The governance parts include a comprehensive framework for legally binding environmental improvement targets; to establish a framework for future policy statements on environmental principles to protect the environment by making environmental considerations a key part of policy development process across government; and to establish the Office for Environmental Protection, an independent public body to have oversight of environmental matters. The UK government's first suite of environmental targets became law in January 2023, but these are not expected to have a material impact on bp.\n\n## Other countries and regions\n\nRegulations governing the discharge of treated water have also been developed in countries outside of the US and EU including in Trinidad where bp commissioned a new wastewater treatment plant in 2020 to meet consent levels agreed with the regulators to apply relevant water discharge rules.\n\nThe Abidjan Convention, along with the Additional Protocol published in 2012, sets environmental quality standards for the discharge of chemicals to the marine environment. Mauritania and Senegal are both signatories to the Abidjan Convention. bp is currently constructing the offshore facilities to include produced water management systems to meet the environmental quality standards for our future gas operations in Mauritania and Senegal.\n\n## Environmental maritime regulations\n\nbp's shipping operations are subject to extensive national and international regulations governing operations, training, pollution prevention, liability, and insurance. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Liability and spill prevention and planning requirements governing, among others, tankers, barges, and offshore facilities are imposed by OPA in US waters. OPA also mandates a levy on imported and domestically produced oil to fund oil spill responses. Some states, including Alaska, Washington, Oregon and California, impose additional liability for oil spills. Outside US territorial waters, bp shipping tankers are subject to international pollution prevention, liability, spill response and preparedness regulations developed through the UN's International Maritime Organization (IMO), including the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), the International Convention on Oil Pollution, Preparedness, Response and Co-operation, and the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage. In April 2010, the Hazardous and Noxious Substance (HNS) Protocol 2010 was adopted to address issues that have inhibited ratification of the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea 1996. As at 31 December 2023, the HNS Convention had not entered into force.\n- \u00b7 A global sulphur cap of 0.5% applies to marine fuel under MARPOL with a stricter 0.1% cap in environmentally sensitive areas. In order to comply, ships either need to consume low sulphur marine fuels, operate on alternative low sulphur fuels such as LNG or implement approved abatement technology to enable them to meet the low sulphur emissions requirements while continuing to use higher sulphur fuel. This global cap does not alter the lower 0.1% limits that apply in the sulphur oxides Emissions Control Areas established by the IMO.\n- \u00b7 From 2023 all vessels over 400 gross tonnage became subject to IMO requirements as to energy efficiency design (EEXI) and the carbon intensity of operations (CII).\n- \u00b7 Under EU legislation, maritime transport will be gradually brought into the scope of the EU ETS from 2024, applicable to all vessels over 5000 gross tonnage calling at EU ports regardless of a vessel's flag.\n- \u00b7 Under the proposed Fuel EU Maritime Regulation, from 2025 ship owners will need to reduce the GHG intensity of their fuel use gradually over time, initially by 2% by 2030 and 80% by 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00ab\n\n## Additional disclosures\n\n- \u00b7 The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR), aims to protect the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic. The OSPAR 2012 recommendation and guideline for the implementation of a risk-based approach to the management of produced water discharges from offshore installations in the North Sea supports a key goal of working towards eliminating harmful discharges. In 2020 the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers issued a report 'Oil And Gas Risk Based Assessment of Offshore Produced Water Discharges' which presents industry good practice and aims to broaden the understanding and acceptance of Risk Based Assessment (RBA) techniques internationally and improve consistency in the application of assumptions, levels of conservatism, and selection of risk endpoints.\n\nTo meet its financial responsibility requirements, bp shipping maintains marine oil pollution liability insurance in respect of its operated ships to a maximum limit of $1 billion for each occurrence through mutual insurance associations (P&I Clubs), although there can be no assurance that a spill would necessarily be adequately covered by insurance or that liabilities would not exceed insurance recoveries.\n\n## International trade sanctions\n\nDuring the period covered by this report, non-US subsidiaries, or other nonUS entities of bp, conducted limited activities in, or with persons from, certain countries identified by the US Department of State as State Sponsors of Terrorism or otherwise subject to US, EU and UK sanctions (Sanctioned Countries). In 2023, sanctions restrictions were insignificant to the group's financial condition and results of operations. bp monitors its activities with Sanctioned Countries, persons from Sanctioned Countries and individuals and companies subject to US, EU and UK sanctions and seeks to comply with applicable sanctions laws and regulations.\n\nbp has a 29.99% interest in and operates the Shah Deniz field in Azerbaijan (Shah Deniz), has a 29.99% interest in and performs some operations for a related gas pipeline entity, South Caucasus Pipeline Company Limited (SCPC), and has a 23.99% non-operating interest in a related gas marketing entity, Azerbaijan Gas Supply Company Limited (AGSC). Naftiran Intertrade Co. Limited and NICO SPV Limited (collectively, NICO) have a 10% nonoperating interest in each of Shah Deniz and SCPC and an 8% nonoperating interest in AGSC. Shah Deniz, SCPC and AGSC continue in operation as they were excluded from the application of US sanctions and fall within the exception for certain natural gas projects under Section 603 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (ITRA).\n\nOn 3 December 2018 bp entered into an agreement with, among others, SOCAR and NICO pursuant to which SOCAR pays to BP Exploration (Shah Deniz) Limited (BPXSD), as the Shah Deniz operator, compensation for NICO's waiver of its right to lift its share of Shah Deniz condensate. Such amounts are used to cover cash calls to NICO in respect of operating costs due from NICO to BPXSD. On 12 February 2022, OFAC issued a renewed licence in relation to these arrangements which expires on 15 April 2024. An application for a further renewal has been submitted and is subject to OFAC's approval.\n\nFollowing the imposition in 2011 of further US and EU sanctions against Syria, bp terminated all sales of crude oil and petroleum products into Syria, though bp continues to supply aviation fuel to non-governmental Syrian resellers outside of Syria.\n\nbp has a joint arrangement in Cuba which imports, manufactures, markets and sells lubricants.\n\nDuring 2014, the US and the EU imposed sanctions on certain sectors of the Russian economy (energy, finance and defence/military) and on certain individuals and entities, including Rosneft. These sectoral sanctions include restrictions on the provision of financial assistance, technical assistance, and services in relation to exploration and production activity in deepwater, shale, and offshore Arctic.\n\nAdditional US sanctions have been imposed since 2014, broadening the scope of US sanctions on Russia-related activity to include certain international deepwater, shale, and offshore Arctic projects as well as the provision of goods and services for Russian energy export pipelines.\n\nIn response to Russia's military action in Ukraine in 2022, the US, EU, UK and many other countries have imposed broad economic and trade",

        "page_content": "sanctions. The scope of these sanctions includes restrictions on dealing with designated individuals and entities; restrictions on the Russian financial sector; blocking economic activity in certain areas of Ukraine not controlled by the Ukrainian government; prohibitions in relation to investment in Russia; prohibitions and restrictions relating to Russian origin oil and oil products; prohibitions and restrictions relating to Russian origin iron and steel products, prohibitions and restrictions relating to Russian origin metals, prohibitions and restrictions on the provision of certain legal advisory services, prohibitions and restrictions in relation to transportation, including shipping and aircraft; trade controls limiting the purchase and import of a wide range of goods from Russia, and export controls limiting the export of a wide range of goods and technical assistance to Russia.\n\nIn response, Russia has implemented counter-sanctions including restrictions on the divestment from Russian assets by foreign investors and restrictions on the payments of dividends to certain foreign shareholders, including those based in the UK, requiring such dividends to be paid in roubles into restricted bank accounts and a requirement for approval of the Russian government for transfers from any such bank accounts out of Russia.\n\nThe bp group does not source any materials directly from Russia, except deliveries of LNG from Russian sources under a small number of contracts predating the Russia and Ukraine conflict in compliance with all applicable sanctions. bp has also discontinued sales of our products to customers in Russia. Such sales were not material to the bp group. As a result, outside of our shareholding in Rosneft and related businesses in Russia, direct impacts due to exposure to Russia have not been material and are not expected to be material in the future. bp continues to monitor Russia related sanctions and other international restrictions for any impacts on our businesses and the exit of our shareholding in Rosneft. See page 173 for further information in relation to bp's shareholding in Rosneft.\n\nbp maintains bank accounts and has registered and paid required fees to maintain registrations of patents and trademarks in certain Sanctioned Countries.\n\nbp has equity interests in non-operated joint arrangements with air fuel sellers, resellers, and fuel delivery services around the world. From time to time, the joint arrangement operator or other partners may sell or deliver fuel to airlines from Sanctioned Countries or flights to Sanctioned Countries, without bp's involvement.\n\nbp has no control over the activities non-controlled associates may undertake in Sanctioned Countries or with persons from Sanctioned Countries.\n\n## Disclosure pursuant to ITRA Section 219\n\nTo our knowledge, none of bp's activities, transactions or dealings are required to be disclosed pursuant to ITRA Section 219, with the following possible exceptions.\n\nIn 2023, payments in relation to tax with an aggregate US dollar equivalent value of approximately $27,000 were paid from a bp trust account held with Tadvin Co. to Iranian public entities on behalf of BP Iran. No gross revenues or net profits are attributable to BP Iran's activities.\n\nIn February 2023, we identified that our European Fleet Business had issued 10 fuel cards to the embassy and consulate of Iran in both Germany and Austria. Fuel cards enable holders to acquire goods and services at bp retail sites and at retail sites operated by acceptance partners in Europe without payment in cash. Goods and services purchased with fuel cards are invoiced on a monthly or bi-monthly basis. As disclosed in the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2022 , in 2023 the total aggregate invoiced amount was approximately $2,700. bp has terminated the cards and related accounts.\n\n## Material contracts\n\nOn 4 April 2016 the district court approved the Consent Decree among BP Exploration & Production Inc., BP Corporation North America Inc., BP p.l.c., the United States and the states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas (the Gulf states) which fully and finally resolved any and all natural resource damages (NRD) claims of the United States, the Gulf states, and their respective natural resource trustees and all Clean Water\n\nAct (CWA) penalty claims, and certain other claims of the United States and the Gulf states.\n\nConcurrently, the definitive Settlement Agreement that bp entered into with the Gulf states (Settlement Agreement) with respect to State claims for economic, property and other losses became effective.\n\nbp has filed the Consent Decree and the Settlement Agreement as exhibits to its Annual Report and Form 20-F 2020 filed with the SEC. For further details of the Consent Decree and the Settlement Agreement, see Legal proceedings in bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2015 .\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nbp has freehold and leasehold interests in real estate and other tangible assets in numerous countries, but no individual property is significant to the group as a whole. For more on the significant subsidiaries \u00ab of the group at 31 December 2023 and the group percentage of ordinary share capital see Financial statements - Note 37. For information on significant joint ventures \u00ab and associates \u00ab of the group see Financial statements - Notes 16 and 17.\n\n## Related party transactions\n\nTransactions between the group and its significant joint ventures and associates are summarized in Financial statements - Note 16 and Note 17. In the ordinary course of its business, the group enters into transactions with various organizations with which some of its directors or executive officers are associated. Except as described in this report, the group did not have any material transactions or transactions of an unusual nature with, and did not make loans to, related parties in the period commencing 1 January 2023 to 16 February 2024.\n\n## Corporate governance practices\n\nIn the US, bp ADSs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The significant differences between bp's corporate governance practices as a UK company and those required by NYSE listing standards for US companies are listed as follows:\n\n## Independence\n\nAs set out on page 88, bp has adopted separate terms of reference for the board and each of its committees as part of its corporate governance framework. The terms of reference for the board and each of its committees are reviewed annually and were last updated with effect from 1 December 2021, excluding the audit committee terms of reference which were updated on 22 July 2022. The terms of reference reflect the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 approach to corporate governance. As such, the way in which bp makes determinations of directors' independence differs from the NYSE approach.\n\nbp's corporate governance framework requires that all non-executive directors be determined by the board to be 'independent in character and judgement and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their judgement'. The bp board has determined that, in its judgement, all of the non-executive directors are independent. In doing so, however, the board did not explicitly take into consideration the independence requirements outlined in the NYSE's listing standards.\n\n## Committees\n\nbp has a number of board committees that are broadly comparable in purpose and composition to those required by NYSE rules for domestic US companies. For instance, bp has a remuneration (rather than a compensation) committee. bp also has an audit committee, which NYSE rules require for both US companies and foreign private issuers. These committees are composed solely of non-executive directors whom the board has determined to be independent, in the manner described above.\n\nEach committee operates under its own terms of reference together with a set of terms applicable to all the committees (see the board committee reports on pages 94-132and bp.com/governance).\n\nUnder US securities law and the listing standards of the NYSE, bp is required to have an audit committee that satisfies the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and Section 303A.06 of the NYSE Listed",

        "page_content": "Company Manual. bp's audit committee complies with these requirements. The bp audit committee does not have direct responsibility for the appointment, reappointment or removal of the independent auditors. Instead, it follows the UK Companies Act 2006 and the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 by making recommendations to the board on these matters for it to put forward for shareholder approval at the AGM.\n\nOne of the NYSE's additional requirements for the audit committee states that at least one member of the audit committee is to have 'accounting or related financial management expertise'. The board determined that Tushar Morzaria possesses such expertise and also possesses the financial and audit committee experiences set forth in both the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 and SEC rules (see Audit committee report on page 98). Mr Morzaria is the audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 16A of Form 20-F.\n\n## Summary of terms of reference for audit committee and remuneration committee\n\nThe audit committee's full terms of reference are available on our website at bp.com/governance. A summary of the committee's key responsibilities is provided below:\n\n- \u00b7 Monitor and critically assess bp's financial statements and financial information, including the integrity of the financial reporting and related processes, context in which statements are made, compliance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and financial reporting standards, including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n- \u00b7 Assess the going concern assumption and the longer-term viability statement as to bp's ability to continue to operate and meet its liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Review and challenge the application and appropriateness of significant accounting policies and financial reporting judgements.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the risk to quality and effectiveness of the financial reporting process and, where requested by the board, advise whether the annual report and accounts are fair, balanced and understandable.\n- \u00b7 Review the affordability of distributions to shareholders.\n- \u00b7 Oversee the appointment, remuneration, independence and performance of the external auditor and the integrity of the audit process as a whole, including the engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit services to bp.\n- \u00b7 Review the effectiveness of the internal audit function, bp's internal financial controls and its systems of internal control and risk management.\n- \u00b7 Monitor the principal risks allocated to the committee by the board and review the mitigations proposed by management in respect of risks associated with bp internal financial controls and reporting responsibilities and such emerging risks that may fall within scope.\n- \u00b7 Review the systems in place to enable those who work for bp to raise concerns about improprieties in financial reporting or other issues, and for those matters to be investigated.\n\nThe remuneration committee's full terms of reference are available on our website at bp.com/governance. A summary of the committee's key responsibilities is provided below:\n\n- \u00b7 Recommend to the board the remuneration principles and policies for the executive directors and leadership team while considering remuneration and related policies for the employees below the board and leadership team.\n- \u00b7 Set and approve the terms of engagement, remuneration, benefits and termination of employment for the executive directors, leadership team, chief internal auditor and the company secretary in accordance with the policy.\n- \u00b7 Prepare the annual remuneration report to shareholders to outline policy implementation.\n- \u00b7 Approve the principles of any equity plan that requires shareholder approval.\n- \u00b7 Ensure termination terms and payments to executive directors and the leadership team are appropriate and fair.\n- \u00b7 Receive and consider regular updates on workforce views and engagement initiatives related to remuneration, insights and data from pay ratios and potential pay gaps as appropriate.\n- \u00b7 Maintain appropriate dialogue with shareholders on remuneration matters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00ab\n\n## Additional disclosures\n\n## Shareholder approval of equity compensation plans\n\nThe NYSE rules for US companies require that shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on all equity-compensation plans and material revisions to those plans. bp complies with UK requirements that are similar to the NYSE rules. The board, however, does not explicitly take into consideration the NYSE's detailed definition of what are considered 'material revisions'.\n\n## Code of ethics\n\nThe company has adopted a code of ethics for its chief executive officer, chief financial officer, SVP accounting, reporting and control and SVP internal audit whose roles are equivalent to the SEC roles as required by the provisions of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules issued by the SEC. There have been no waivers from the code of ethics relating to any officers. A copy of the code of ethics can be found at bp.com/codeofethics.\n\nThe NYSE rules require that US companies adopt and disclose a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers and employees. bp has adopted a code of conduct, which applies to all employees, officers and members of the board. This was updated and published in January 2023. In addition, bp has adopted a code of ethics as described above for the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, SVP accounting, reporting and control and SVP internal audit as required by the SEC. bp considers that these codes and policies address the matters specified in the NYSE rules for US companies. During 2021, the board adopted a diversity policy, which requires it to encourage a diverse and inclusive working environment in the boardroom, where everyone is accepted, valued and receives fair treatment according to their different needs and situations without discrimination or prejudice. The policy was reviewed by the board in 2022, and amendments were made to reflect regulatory changes and market practice. The updated policy was then approved and published in February 2023.\n\n## Controls and procedures\n\n## Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\n\nThe company maintains 'disclosure controls and procedures', as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports the company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the company's group chief executive and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management, including the group chief executive and chief financial officer, recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud within the company, if any, have been detected. Further, in the design and evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures our management necessarily was required to apply its judgement in evaluating the costs and benefits of possible control and procedure design options. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. As we do not control these entities, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries \u00ab . Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. The company's disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet, and management believes that they meet, reasonable assurance standards.\n\nThe company's management, with the participation of the company's group chief executive and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation, the group chief executive and chief financial officer have concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.",

        "page_content": "## Management's report on internal control over financial reporting\n\nManagement of bp is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. bp's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the principal executive and financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of bp's financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with IFRS.\n\nAs of the end of the 2023 fiscal year, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the criteria in the UK Financial Reporting Council's Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting relating to internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment, management has determined that bp's internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2023 was effective.\n\nManagement's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting excluded TravelCenters of America Inc. (TCA), which was acquired on 15 May 2023. TCA's financial statements constitute 2.1% and 1.5% of net and total assets respectively, 2.8% of revenues, and 4% of net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended 31 December 2023. This exclusion is in accordance with the general guidance issued by the SEC that an assessment of a recent business combination may be omitted from management's report on internal control over financial reporting in the first year of consolidation.\n\nThe company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of bp; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of bp's assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. bp's internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2023 has been audited by Deloitte LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 163 of bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023 .\n\n## Changes in internal control over financial reporting\n\nThere were no changes in the group's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by the Form 20-F that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Cyber security\n\n## Governance\n\nThe board oversees bp's internal control and risk management framework. The board is supported by the safety and sustainability committee which oversees cyber security risk and received reports from bp's chief information security officer (CISO) on cyber security incidents at every committee meeting in 2023, including information on bp's response to incidents. This allows an ongoing assessment by the committee of the effectiveness of bp's overall cyber security programme. A session is held once a year to review bp's roadmap and progress for addressing cyber security risk. Read more in the safety and sustainability committee report on page 103.\n\nAt management level, assessment and management of material risks from cyber security threats is led by bp's executive vice president of innovation & engineering (I&E), a member of bp's leadership team with deep experience in bp's engineering and operations functions, with support from bp's CISO, who has over 20 years of experience in the information technology industry. bp's digital safety operational risk committee brings together additional senior members of bp's digital leadership team to assist in ensuring that cyber security risks across bp are identified, understood, accurately quantified and are managed in accordance with bp's internal controls framework.\n\n## Risk management and strategy\n\nbp has implemented a threat-focused strategy to assess cyber security risks and protect against, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber attacks. bp maintains internal teams focused on cyber security intelligence and emergency response to monitor the external threat landscape and the threats to bp's IT and operational technology infrastructure. bp partners with third-party specialists to augment its in-house capabilities as necessary. bp has a defined protocol for cyber incident notification based on severity and bp's internal cyber security teams brief the CISO, I&E EVP, other senior leadership and relevant board and management committees about incidents on an as needed basis.\n\nCyber security risk management is integrated into bp's overall risk management process. bp's entities are required to identify, assess and report key risks, including cyber security risks, to relevant members of senior leadership. bp maintains additional procedures to manage cyber security risks related to third-party service providers, including conducting information security assessments for certain providers, providing relevant trainings for bp employees, and maintaining information security requirements for suppliers.\n\nOur business strategy, results of operations and financial condition have not been materially affected by risks from cyber security threats, including as a result of previously identified cyber security incidents. For more information on our cyber security related risks, see Risk Factors (pages 77-79).\n\n## Principal accountant's fees and services\n\nThe audit committee has established policies and procedures for the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte LLP, to render audit and certain assurance services. The policy provides for pre-approval by the audit committee of specifically defined audit, audit related, non-audit and other services that are not prohibited by regulatory or other professional requirements. Deloitte is engaged for these services when its expertise and experience of bp are important. Most of this work is of an audit nature. The committee regularly reviews the policy, including in 2022, when it was updated to remove restrictions on EY following bp's announcement on 27 February 2022 of its intention to exit its interests in Rosneft and capture additional detail for the processes applicable to separately listed bp entities.\n\nUnder the policy, pre-approval is given for specific services within the following categories: i) audit-related services, such as those required by law or where the auditor is best placed to undertake such work on similar terms, ii) non-audit services required by law, such as reporting required by a regulatory authority, and iii) other services, such as additional assurance or updates on applicable law and accounting standards. bp operates a twotier system for audit and non-audit services. For audit-related services, the audit committee has a pre-approved aggregate level, within which specific work may be approved by management. Non-audit services are preapproved for management to authorize per individual engagement, but above a defined level must be approved by the chair of the audit committee or the full committee. The audit committee has delegated to the chair of the audit committee authority to approve permitted services provided that any decisions are reported to the committee at its next scheduled meeting. Any proposed service not included in the approved service list must be approved in advance of commencing the engagement by the audit committee chair or the full audit committee depending on the level of fee payable.\n\nThe audit committee evaluates the performance of the auditor each year. The audit fees payable to Deloitte are reviewed by the committee in the context of other global companies for cost effectiveness. The committee keeps under review the scope and results of audit work and the independence and objectivity of the auditor. External regulation and bp policy requires the auditor to rotate its lead audit partner every five years. See Financial statements - Note 36 and Audit committee report on page 98 for details of fees for services provided by the auditor.",

Certain information has been included in the Strategic report that would otherwise be required to be disclosed in the Directors' report, as noted below.\n\n## Indemnity provisions\n\nIn accordance with bp's Articles of Association, on appointment each director is granted an indemnity from the company in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their office, to the extent permitted by law. These indemnities were in force throughout the financial year and at the date of this report. In respect of those liabilities for which directors may not be indemnified, the company maintained a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy throughout 2023. During the year, a review of the terms and scope of the policy was undertaken as part of the annual renewal. Although their defence costs may be met, neither the company's indemnity nor insurance provides cover in the event that the director is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly. Certain subsidiaries \u00ab are trustees of the group's pension schemes. Each director of these subsidiaries is granted an indemnity from the company in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of such a subsidiary's activities as a trustee of the pension scheme, to the extent permitted by law. These indemnities were in force throughout the financial year and at the date of this report.\n\n## Financial risk management objectives and policies\n\nThe disclosures in relation to financial risk management objectives and policies, including the policy for hedging, are included in How we manage risk on pages 73-76, Liquidity and capital resources on page 340 and Financial statements - Notes 29 and 30.\n\n## Exposure to price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk\n\nThe disclosures in relation to exposure to price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk are included in Financial statements - Notes 29 and 30.\n\n## Important events since the end of the financial year\n\nDisclosures of the particulars of the important events affecting bp which have occurred since the end of the financial year are included in the Strategic report as well as in other places in the Directors' report.\n\n## Likely future developments in the business\n\nAn indication of the likely future developments in the business of the company is included in the Strategic report.\n\n## Research and development\n\nIndications of our activities in the field of research and development are provided throughout the Strategic report and the Directors' report.

Voting rights in respect of such shares are exercisable via a nominee. Dividend waivers are in place in respect of unallocated shares held in employee share plan trusts.\n\n## Suppliers, customers and others\n\nDisclosures in respect of how the directors have engaged with suppliers, customers and others in business relationships with the company are included in Stakeholder engagement on pages 92-93.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00ab\n\n## Additional disclosures\n\n## Change of control provisions\n\nOn 5 October 2015, the United States lodged with the district court in MDL 2179 a proposed Consent Decree between the United States, the Gulf states, BP Exploration & Production Inc., BP Corporation North America Inc. and BP p.l.c., to fully and finally resolve any and all natural resource damages claims of the United States, the Gulf states and their respective natural resource trustees and all Clean Water Act penalty claims, and certain other claims of the United States and the Gulf states. Concurrently, bp entered into a definitive Settlement Agreement with the five Gulf states (Settlement Agreement) with respect to state claims for economic, property and other losses.

        "page_content": "## Share prices and listings\n\n## Markets and market prices\n\nThe primary market for the company's ordinary shares (trading symbol 'BP'), 8% cumulative first preference shares (trading symbol 'BP.A') and 9% cumulative second preference shares (trading symbol 'BP.B') is the London Stock Exchange (LSE). The company's ordinary shares are a constituent element of the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index.\n\nIn the US, the company's securities are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the form of ADSs (trading symbol 'BP'), for which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is the depositary (the Depositary) and transfer agent. The Depositary's principal office is 383 Madison Avenue, Floor 11, New York, NY, 10179, US. Each ADS represents six ordinary shares. ADSs are evidenced by American depositary receipts (ADRs), which may be issued in either certificated or book entry form.\n\nThe company's ordinary shares are also traded in the form of a global depositary certificate representing the company's ordinary shares on the Frankfurt, Hamburg and D\u00fcsseldorf Stock Exchanges.\n\nOn 16 February 2024, 731,514,905 ADSs (equivalent to approximately 4,389,089,430 ordinary shares or some 25.79% of the total issued share capital, excluding shares held in treasury) were outstanding and were held by approximately 62,639 ADS holders. Of these, about 61,911 had registered addresses in the US at that date. One of the registered holders of ADSs represents approximately 1,369,679 underlying holders.\n\nOn 16 February 2024, there were approximately 200,279 ordinary shareholders. Of these shareholders, around 1,499 had registered addresses in the US and held a total of some 3,870,988 ordinary shares. On 16 February 2024, there were approximately 1,103 preference shareholders. Of these shareholders, around 14 had registered addresses in the US and held a total of some 2,773 preference shares.\n\nSince a number of the ordinary shares and ADSs were held by brokers and other nominees, the number of holders in the US may not be representative of the number of beneficial holders or their respective country of residence.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe company's current policy is to pay interim dividends on a quarterly basis on its ordinary shares.\n\nOur policy is also to announce dividends for ordinary shares in US dollars and state an equivalent sterling dividend. Dividends on the company's ordinary shares will be paid in sterling and on the company's ADSs in US dollars. The rate of exchange used to determine the sterling amount equivalent is the average of the market exchange rates in London over the three business days prior to the sterling equivalent announcement date. The directors may choose to declare dividends in any currency provided that a sterling equivalent is announced. It is not the company's intention to change its current policy of announcing dividends on ordinary shares in US dollars.\n\nInformation regarding dividends announced and paid by the company on ordinary shares and preference shares is provided in the consolidated Financial statements - Note 10.\n\nA Scrip Dividend Programme (Scrip Programme) was approved by shareholders in 2010 and was renewed for a further three years at the 2021 AGM. It enabled the company's ordinary shareholders and ADS holders to elect to receive dividends by way of new fully paid ordinary shares (or ADSs in the case of ADS holders) instead of cash. The operation of the Scrip Programme is always subject to the directors' decision to make the Scrip Programme offer available in respect of any particular dividend.\n\nThe company announced on 29 October 2019 and as part of all subsequent quarterly results announcements made since, that the board had suspended the Scrip Programme in respect of those quarterly dividends. The company does not expect to offer a scrip election for the foreseeable future. Ordinary shareholders and ADS holders (subject to certain exceptions) may be able to participate in dividend reinvestment plans. Any decisions with respect to future dividends will be made by the board of BP p.l.c. following the end of each quarter.\n\nFuture dividends will be dependent on future earnings, the financial condition of the group, the Risk factors set out on page 77 and other matters that may affect the business of the group set out in Our strategy on page 12 and in Liquidity and capital resources on page 340.\n\nThe quarterly dividend which is expected to be paid on 28 March 2024 in respect of the fourth quarter 2023 is 7.270 cents per ordinary share ($0.43620 per American Depositary Share (ADS)). The corresponding amount in sterling will be announced on 12 March 2024.\n\nThe following table shows dividends announced and paid by the company per ADS for the past five years.\n\n| Dividends per ADS a   | Dividends per ADS a   |   March |   June |   September | December Total   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------|--------|-------------|------------------|\n| 2019                  | UK pence              |   46.43 |  48.39 |       50.09 | 46.95    191.86  |\n|                       | US cents              |   61.5  |  61.5  |       61.5  | 61.50    246.00  |\n| 2020                  | UK pence              |   48.94 |  50.05 |       24.26 | 23.50    146.75  |\n|                       | US cents              |   63    |  63    |       31.5  | 31.50    189.00  |\n| 2021                  | UK pence              |   22.61 |  22.27 |       23.72 | 24.63    92.23   |\n|                       | US cents              |   31.5  |  31.5  |       32.76 | 32.76    128.52  |\n| 2022                  | UK pence              |   24.96 |  26.13 |       31.01 | 29.64    111.74  |\n|                       | US cents              |   32.76 |  32.76 |       36.04 | 36.04    137.60  |\n| 2023                  | UK pence              |   33.3  |  31.85 |       34.39 | 34.42    133.97  |\n|                       | US cents              |   39.66 |  39.66 |       43.62 | 43.62    166.56  |\n\nThere are no UK foreign exchange controls or other restrictions on the import or export of capital by, or on the payment of dividends to, nonresident holders of BP p.l.c. shares, or that materially affect the conduct of BP p.l.c's operations, other than restrictions applicable to certain countries and persons subject to UN, US, UK, or EU economic sanctions, to the extent these restrictions can be complied with in law.\n\n## Shareholder taxation information\n\nThis section describes the material US federal income tax and UK taxation consequences of owning ordinary shares or ADSs to a US holder who holds the ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets for tax purposes. This section does not discuss tax consequences arising under the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax. It also does not apply inter alia to members of special classes of holders some of which may be subject to other rules, including: tax-exempt entities, life insurance companies, dealers in securities, traders in securities that elect a mark-tomarket method of accounting for securities holdings, holders that, actually or constructively, hold 10% or more of the company's shares (as measured by voting power or value), holders that hold the shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction, holders that purchase or sell the shares or ADSs as part of a wash sale for US federal income tax purposes, or holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar. In addition, if a partnership holds the shares or ADSs, the US federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership and may not be described fully below.\n\nA US holder is any beneficial owner of ordinary shares or ADSs that is for US federal income tax purposes (1) a citizen or resident of the US, (2) a US domestic corporation, (3) an estate whose income is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source, or (4) a trust if a US court can exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one or more US persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust.\n\nThis section is based on the tax laws of the United States, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed US Treasury regulations thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, and the taxation laws of the UK, all as currently in effect, as well as the income tax convention between the US and the UK that entered into force on 31 March 2003 (the Treaty). These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. This section further assumes that each obligation under the terms of the deposit agreement relating to bp ADSs and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.",

        "page_content": "For purposes of the Treaty and the estate and gift tax convention (the Estate Tax Convention) and for US federal income tax and UK taxation purposes, a holder of ADRs evidencing ADSs will be treated as the owner of the company's ordinary shares represented by those ADRs. Exchanges of ordinary shares for ADRs and ADRs for ordinary shares generally will not be subject to US federal income tax or to UK taxation other than stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax, as described below.\n\nInvestors should consult their own tax advisor regarding the US federal, state and local, UK and other tax consequences of owning and disposing of ordinary shares and ADSs in their particular circumstances, and in particular whether they are eligible for the benefits of the Treaty in respect of their investment in the shares or ADSs.\n\n## Taxation of dividends\n\n## UK taxation\n\nUnder current UK taxation law, no withholding tax will be deducted from dividends paid by the company, including dividends paid to US holders. A shareholder that is a company resident for tax purposes in the UK or trading in the UK through a permanent establishment generally will not be taxable in the UK on a dividend it receives from the company. A shareholder who is an individual resident for tax purposes in the UK is subject to UK tax on dividends received from the company, including dividends received under the dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) for ordinary shareholders, that are in excess of the annual dividend allowance.\n\nFor 2023/24 the dividend allowance is \u00a31,000 which means there is no UK tax due on the first \u00a31,000 of dividends received. Dividends above this level are subject to tax at 8.75% for basic tax payers, 33.75% for higher rate tax payers and 39.35% for additional rate tax payers.\n\nAlthough the first \u00a31,000 of dividend income is not subject to UK income tax, it does not reduce the total income for tax purposes. Dividends within the dividend allowance still count towards basic or higher rate bands, and may therefore affect the rate of tax paid on dividends received in excess of the \u00a31,000 allowance. For instance, if an individual has an annual gross salary of \u00a350,000 and also receives a dividend of \u00a312,000 they will be subject to the following scenario. The individual's personal allowance and the basic rate tax band will be used up by the gross salary. The remaining part of the salary and the whole of the dividend will be subject to tax at the higher rate, although the dividend allowance will reduce the amount of dividend subject to tax. The dividend of \u00a312,000 will be reduced by the dividend allowance of \u00a31,000 leaving taxable dividend income of \u00a311,000. The dividend will be taxed at 33.75% so that the total tax payable on the dividends is \u00a33,712.\n\nHow the shareholder pays the tax arising on the dividend income depends on the amount of dividend income and salary they receive in the tax year. If less than \u00a31,000 they will not need to report anything or pay any tax. If between \u00a31,000 and \u00a310,000, the shareholder can pay what they owe by: contacting the HMRC helpline; asking HMRC to change their tax code - the tax will be taken from their wages or pension or through completion of the 'Dividends' section of their self-assessment tax return, where one is already being filed. If over \u00a310,000 they will be required to file a self-assessment tax return and should complete the 'Dividends' section with details of the amounts received.\n\n## US federal income taxation\n\nA US holder is subject to US federal income taxation on the gross amount of any dividend paid by the company (including dividends paid but reinvested under the Global Invest Direct (GID) Dividend Reinvestment Plan for ADS holders) out of its current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for US federal income tax purposes). Dividends paid to a noncorporate US holder that constitute qualified dividend income will be taxable to the holder at a preferential rate, provided that the holder has a holding period in the ordinary shares or ADSs of more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date and meets other holding period requirements. Dividends paid by the company with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs will generally be qualified dividend income.\n\nFor US federal income tax purposes, a dividend must be included in income when the US holder, in the case of ordinary shares, or the Depositary, in the case of ADSs, actually or constructively receives the dividend and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to US corporations in respect of dividends received from other US corporations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00ab\n\n## Shareholder information\n\nUS ADS holders should consult their own tax advisor regarding the US tax treatment of the dividend fee in respect of dividends. Dividends will generally be income from sources outside the US and generally will be 'passive category income' for purposes of computing a US holder's foreign tax credit limitation.\n\nAs noted above in UK taxation, a US holder will not be subject to UK withholding tax. Accordingly, the receipt of a dividend will not entitle the US holder to a foreign tax credit.\n\nThe amount of the dividend distribution on the ordinary shares that is paid in pounds sterling will be the US dollar value of the pounds sterling payments made, determined at the spot pounds sterling/US dollar rate on the date the dividend is distributed, regardless of whether the payment is, in fact, converted into US dollars. Generally, any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the date the pounds sterling dividend payment is distributed to the date the payment is converted into US dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the preferential tax rate on qualified dividend income. The gain or loss generally will be income or loss from sources within the US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.\n\nDistributions in excess of the company's earnings and profits, as determined for US federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of the US holder's basis in the ordinary shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain, subject to taxation as described in 'Taxation of capital gains - US federal income taxation' section below.\n\nIn addition, the taxation of dividends may be subject to the rules for passive foreign investment companies (PFIC), described below under 'Taxation of capital gains - US federal income taxation'. Distributions made by a PFIC do not constitute qualified dividend income and are not eligible for the preferential tax rate applicable to such income.\n\n## Taxation of capital gains\n\n## UK taxation\n\nA US holder may be liable for both UK and US tax in respect of a gain on the disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs if the US holder is (1) resident for tax purposes in the UK at the date of disposal, (2) if he or she has left the UK for a period not exceeding five complete tax years between the year of departure from and the year of return to the UK and acquired the shares before leaving the UK and was resident in the UK in the previous four out of seven tax years before the year of departure, (3) a US domestic corporation resident in the UK by reason of its business being managed or controlled in the UK or (4) a citizen of the US that carries on a trade or profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency or a corporation that carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK, through a permanent establishment, and that has used, held, or acquired the ordinary shares or ADSs for the purposes of such trade, profession or vocation of such branch, agency or permanent establishment. However, such persons may be entitled to a tax credit against their US federal income tax liability for the amount of UK capital gains tax or UK corporation tax on chargeable gains (as the case may be) that is paid in respect of such gain.\n\nUnder the Treaty, capital gains on dispositions of ordinary shares or ADSs generally will be subject to tax only in the jurisdiction of residence of the relevant holder as determined under both the laws of the UK and the US and as required by the terms of the Treaty.\n\nUnder the Treaty, individuals who are residents of either the UK or the US and who have been residents of the other jurisdiction (the US or the UK, as the case may be) at any time during the six years immediately preceding the relevant disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs may be subject to tax with respect to capital gains arising from a disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs of the company not only in the jurisdiction of which the holder is resident at the time of the disposition but also in the other jurisdiction.\n\nFor gains on or after 23 June 2010, the UK Capital Gains Tax rate will be dependent on the level of an individual's taxable income. Where total taxable income and gains after all allowable deductions are less than the upper limit of the basic rate income tax band of \u00a337,700 (for 2023/24), the rate of Capital Gains Tax will be 10%. For gains (and any parts of gains) above that limit the rate will be 20%.\n\nFrom 6 April 2008, entitlement to the annual exemption is based on an individual's circumstances (taking into account domicile status, remittance basis of taxation and number of years in the UK).

        "page_content": "entitled to the exemption for 2023/24, this has been set at \u00a36,000. Corporation tax on chargeable gains is levied at 25% for companies from 1 April 2023.\n\n## US federal income taxation\n\nA US holder who sells or otherwise disposes of ordinary shares or ADSs will recognize a capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the amount realized on the disposition and the US holder's tax basis, determined in US dollars, in the ordinary shares or ADSs. Any such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term gain or loss, subject to tax at a preferential rate for a noncorporate US holder, if the US holder's holding period for such ordinary shares or ADSs exceeds one year. The tax basis of shares acquired through reinvested dividends under the GID Dividend Reinvestment Plan for ADS holders is equal to the fair market value of the stock on the investment date. The holding period for shares acquired under the plan begins the day after the applicable investment date.\n\nGain or loss from the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs will generally be income or loss from sources within the US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n\nWe do not believe that ordinary shares or ADSs will be treated as stock of a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) for US federal income tax purposes, but this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus is subject to change. If we are treated as a PFIC, unless a US holder elects to be taxed annually on a mark-to-market basis with respect to ordinary shares or ADSs, any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs would in general not be treated as capital gain. Instead, a US holder would be treated as if he or she had realized such gain rateably over the holding period for ordinary shares or ADSs and would be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for each such year to which the gain was allocated, in addition to which an interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such year would apply. Certain 'excess distributions' would be similarly treated if we were treated as a PFIC.\n\n## Additional tax considerations\n\n## Scrip Programme\n\nUntil the publication of the 2019 third quarter results, the company had an optional Scrip Programme, wherein holders of bp ordinary shares or ADSs could elect to receive any dividends in the form of new fully paid ordinary shares or ADSs of the company instead of cash. Please consult your tax advisor for the consequences to you.\n\n## UK inheritance tax\n\nThe Estate Tax Convention applies to inheritance tax. ADSs held by an individual who is domiciled for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention in the US and is not for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention a national of the UK will not be subject to UK inheritance tax on the individual's death or on transfer during the individual's lifetime unless, among other things, the ADSs are part of the business property of a permanent establishment situated in the UK used for the performance of independent personal services. In the exceptional case where ADSs are subject to both inheritance tax and US federal gift or estate tax, the Estate Tax Convention generally provides for tax payable in the US to be credited against tax payable in the UK or for tax paid in the UK to be credited against tax payable in the US, based on priority rules set forth in the Estate Tax Convention.\n\n## UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax\n\nThe statements below relate to what is understood to be the current practice of HM Revenue & Customs in the UK under existing law.\n\nProvided that any instrument of transfer is not executed in the UK and remains at all times outside the UK and the transfer does not relate to any matter or thing done or to be done in the UK, no UK stamp duty is payable on the acquisition or transfer of ADSs. Neither will an agreement to transfer ADSs in the form of ADRs give rise to a liability to stamp duty reserve tax.\n\nPurchases of ordinary shares, as opposed to ADSs, through the CREST system of paperless share transfers will be subject to stamp duty reserve tax at 0.5%. The charge will arise as soon as there is an agreement for the transfer of the shares (or, in the case of a conditional agreement, when the condition is fulfilled). The stamp duty reserve tax will apply to agreements\n\nto transfer ordinary shares even if the agreement is made outside the UK between two non-residents. Purchases of ordinary shares outside the CREST system are subject either to stamp duty at a rate of \u00a35 per \u00a31,000 (or part, unless the stamp duty is less than \u00a35, when no stamp duty is charged), or stamp duty reserve tax at 0.5%. Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax are generally the liability of the purchaser.\n\nA subsequent transfer of ordinary shares to the Depositary's nominee will give rise to further stamp duty at the rate of \u00a31.50 per \u00a3100 (or part) or stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 1.5% of the value of the ordinary shares at the time of the transfer. For ADR holders electing to receive ADSs instead of cash, after the 2012 first quarter dividend payment, HM Revenue & Customs no longer seeks to impose 1.5% stamp duty reserve tax on issues of UK shares and securities to non-EU clearance services and depositary receipt systems.\n\n## Major shareholders\n\nThe disclosure of certain major and significant shareholdings in the share capital of the company is governed by the Companies Act 2006, the UK Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR) and the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\n## Register of members holding bp ordinary shares as at 31 December 2023\n\n| Range of holdings   | Number of  ordinary shareholders   |   Percentage of  total ordinary  shareholders |   Percentage of  total ordinary  share capital excluding shares held in treasury |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1-200               | 51,421                             |                                         25.55 |                                                                             0.01 |\n| 201-1,000           | 65,819                             |                                         32.7  |                                                                             0.21 |\n| 1,001-10,000        | 73,508                             |                                         36.52 |                                                                             1.35 |\n| 10,001-100,000      | 9,162                              |                                          4.55 |                                                                             1.12 |\n| 100,001-1,000,000   | 767                                |                                          0.38 |                                                                             1.61 |\n| Over 1,000,000 a    | 598                                |                                          0.3  |                                                                            95.7  |\n| Totals              | 201,275                            |                                        100    |                                                                           100    |\n\n## Register of holders of American depositary shares (ADSs) as at 31 December 2023 a\n\n| Range of holdings   | Number of ADS holders   |   Percentage of  total ADS holders |   Percentage of  total ADSs |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 1-200               | 38,097                  |                              59.62 |                        0.27 |\n| 201-1,000           | 16,827                  |                              26.34 |                        1.07 |\n| 1,001-10,000        | 8,640                   |                              13.52 |                        2.95 |\n| 10,001-100,000      | 324                     |                               0.51 |                        0.71 |\n| 100,001-1,000,000   | 5                       |                               0.01 |                        0.11 |\n| Over 1,000,000 b    | 2                       |                               0    |                       94.88 |\n| Totals              | 63,895                  |                             100    |                      100    |\n\nAs at 31 December 2023 there were also 1,106 preference shareholders.

The Act abolished the need to have object provisions and so at the AGM held on 15 April 2010 shareholders approved the removal of its objects clause together with all other provisions of its Memorandum that, by virtue of the Act, are treated as forming part of the company's Articles of Association.\n\n## Directors and secretary\n\nThe business and affairs of the company shall be managed by the directors. The company's Articles of Association provide that any person may be appointed by the existing directors or by the shareholders in a general meeting either as a replacement for another director or as an additional director. Any person appointed by the directors will hold office only until the next general meeting, notice of which is first given after their appointment and will then be eligible for re-election by the shareholders. A director may be removed by the company as provided for by applicable law and shall vacate office in certain circumstances as set out in the Articles of Association. In addition, the company may, by special resolution, remove a director before the expiration of his/her period of office and, subject to the Articles of Association, may by ordinary resolution appoint another person to be a director instead. There is no requirement for a director to retire on reaching any age.\n\nThe Articles of Association place a general prohibition on a director voting in respect of any contract or arrangement in which the director has a material interest other than by virtue of such director's interest in shares in the company. However, in the absence of some other material interest not indicated below, a director is entitled to vote and to be counted in a quorum for the purpose of any vote relating to a resolution concerning the following matters:\n\n- \u00b7 The giving of security or indemnity with respect to any money lent or obligation taken by the director at the request or benefit of the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings.\n- \u00b7 The giving of security or indemnity to a third party with respect to any debt or obligation of the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings for which the director has assumed responsibility.\n- \u00b7 Any proposal in which the director is interested, concerning the underwriting of company securities or debentures or the giving of any security to a third party for a debt or obligation of the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings.\n- \u00b7 Any proposal concerning any other company in which the director is interested, directly or indirectly (whether as an officer or shareholder or otherwise) provided that the director and persons connected with such director are not the holder or holders of 1% or more of the voting interest in the shares of such company.\n- \u00b7 Any proposal concerning the purchase or maintenance of any insurance policy under which the director may benefit.\n- \u00b7 Any proposal concerning the giving to the director of any other indemnity which is on substantially the same terms as indemnities given or to be given to all of the other directors or to the funding by the company of his expenditure on defending proceedings or the doing by the company of anything to enable the director to avoid incurring such expenditure where all other directors have been given or are to be given substantially the same arrangements.\n- \u00b7 Any proposal concerning an arrangement for the benefit of the employees and directors or former employees and former directors of",

        "page_content": "the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, including but without being limited to a retirement benefits scheme and an employees' share scheme, which does not accord to any director any privilege or advantage not generally accorded to the employees or former employees to whom the arrangement relates.\n\nThe Act requires a director of a company who is in any way interested in a contract or proposed contract with the company to declare the nature of the director's interest at a meeting of the directors of the company. The definition of 'interest' includes the interests of spouses, children, companies and trusts. The Act also requires that a director must avoid a situation where a director has, or could have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the company's interests. The Act allows directors of public companies to authorize such conflicts where appropriate, if a company's Articles of Association so permit. The company's Articles of Association permit the authorization of such conflicts. The directors may exercise all the powers of the company to borrow money, except that the amount remaining undischarged of all moneys borrowed by the company shall not, without approval of the shareholders, exceed two times the amount paid up on the share capital plus the aggregate of the amount of the capital and revenue reserves of the company and its subsidiary undertakings incorporated in the UK. Variation of the borrowing power of the board may only be affected by amending the Articles of Association.\n\nRemuneration of non-executive directors shall be determined in the aggregate by resolution of the shareholders. Remuneration of executive directors is determined by the remuneration committee. This committee is made up of non-executive directors only. There is no requirement of share ownership for a director's qualification.\n\nThe Articles of Association provide entitlement to the directors' pensions and death and disability benefits to the directors' relations and dependants respectively.\n\nThe circumstances in which a director's office will automatically terminate include, amongst others: when a director ceases to hold an executive office of the company and the directors resolve that they should cease to be a director; if a medical practitioner provides an opinion that a director has become incapable of acting as a director and may remain so incapable for more than a further three months and the directors resolve that they should cease to be a director; and if all of the other directors vote in favour of a resolution stating that the person should cease to be a director.\n\nThe company secretary has express powers to delegate any of the powers or discretions conferred on him or her.\n\n## Dividend rights; other rights to share in company profits; capital calls\n\nShareholders of the company may, by resolution, declare dividends but no such dividend may be declared in excess of the amount recommended by the directors. The directors may also pay interim dividends without obtaining shareholder approval. No dividend may be paid other than out of profits available for distribution, as determined under IFRS and the Act. Dividends on ordinary shares are payable only after payment of dividends on bp preference shares. Any dividend unclaimed after a period of 10 years from the date of declaration of such dividend shall be forfeited and reverts to bp. If the company exercises its right to forfeit shares and sells shares belonging to an untraced shareholder then any entitlement to claim dividends or other monies unclaimed in respect of those shares will be for a period of 12 months after the sale. The company may take such steps as the directors decide are appropriate in the circumstances to trace the member entitled and the sale may be made at such time and on such terms as the directors may decide.\n\nThe directors have the power to declare and pay dividends in any currency provided that a sterling equivalent is announced. It is not the company's intention to change its current policy of paying dividends in US dollars. At the company's AGM held on 15 April 2010, shareholders approved the introduction of a Scrip Dividend Programme (Scrip Programme) and to include provisions in the Articles of Association to enable the company to operate the Scrip Programme. The Scrip Programme was renewed at the company's AGM held on 12 May 2021 for a further three years. The Scrip Programme enables ordinary shareholders and bp ADS holders to elect to receive new fully paid ordinary shares (or bp ADSs in the case of bp ADS holders) instead of cash. The operation of the Scrip Programme is always\n\nsubject to the directors' decision to make the scrip offer available in respect of any particular dividend. Should the directors decide not to offer the scrip in respect of any particular dividend, cash will automatically be paid instead. The directors may determine in relation to any scrip dividend plan or programme how the costs of the programme will be met, the minimum number of ordinary shares required in order to be able to participate in the programme and any arrangements to deal with legal and practical difficulties in any particular territory.\n\nApart from shareholders' rights to share in bp's profits by dividend (if any is declared or announced), the Articles of Association provide that the directors may set aside:\n\n- \u00b7 A special reserve fund out of the balance of profits each year to make up any deficit of cumulative dividend on the bp preference shares.\n- \u00b7 A general reserve out of the balance of profits each year, which shall be applicable for any purpose to which the profits of the company may properly be applied. This may include capitalization of such sum, pursuant to an ordinary shareholders' resolution, and distribution to shareholders as if it were distributed by way of a dividend on the ordinary shares or in paying up in full unissued ordinary shares for allotment and distribution as bonus shares.\n\nAny such sums so deposited may be distributed in accordance with the manner of distribution of dividends as described above.\n\nHolders of shares are not subject to calls on capital by the company, provided that the amounts required to be paid on issue have been paid off. All shares are fully paid.\n\n## Share transfers and share certificates\n\nThe directors may permit transfers to be effected other than by an instrument in writing. Share certificates will not be required to be issued by the company if they are not required by law.\n\nThe company may charge an administrative fee in the event that a shareholder wishes to replace two or more certificates representing shares with a single certificate or wishes to surrender a single certificate and replace it with two or more certificates. All certificates are sent at the member's risk.\n\n## Voting rights\n\nThe Articles of Association of the company provide that voting on resolutions at a shareholders' meeting will be decided on a poll other than resolutions of a procedural nature, which may be decided on a show of hands. If voting is on a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy has one vote for every ordinary share held and two votes for every \u00a35 in nominal amount of bp preference shares held. If voting is on a show of hands, each shareholder who is present at the meeting in person or whose duly appointed proxy is present in person will have one vote, regardless of the number of shares held, unless a poll is requested.\n\nShareholders do not have cumulative voting rights.\n\nFor the purposes of determining which persons are entitled to attend or vote at a shareholders' meeting and how many votes such persons may cast, the company may specify in the notice of the meeting a time, not more than 48 hours before the time of the meeting, by which a person who holds shares in registered form must be entered on the company's register of members in order to have the right to attend or vote at the meeting or to appoint a proxy to do so.\n\nHolders on record of ordinary shares may appoint a proxy, including a beneficial owner of those shares, to attend, speak and vote on their behalf at any shareholders' meeting, provided that a duly completed proxy form is received not less than 48 hours (or such shorter time as the directors may determine) before the time of the meeting or adjourned meeting or, where the poll is to be taken after the date of the meeting, not less than 24 hours (or such shorter time as the directors may determine) before the time of the poll.\n\nRecord holders of bp ADSs are also entitled to attend, speak and vote at any shareholders' meeting of the company by the appointment by the approved depositary, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., of them as proxies in respect of the ordinary shares represented by their ADSs. Each such proxy may also appoint a proxy. Alternatively, holders of bp ADSs are entitled to vote by supplying their voting instructions to the Depositary, who will vote",

        "page_content": "the ordinary shares represented by their ADSs in accordance with their instructions.\n\nProxies may be delivered electronically.\n\nCorporations who are members of the company may appoint one or more persons to act as their representative or representatives at any shareholders' meeting provided that the company may require a corporate representative to produce a certified copy of the resolution appointing them before they are permitted to exercise their powers.\n\nMatters are transacted at shareholders' meetings by the proposing and passing of resolutions, of which there are two types: ordinary or special.\n\nAn ordinary resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting at which there is a quorum. A special resolution requires the affirmative vote of not less than three quarters of the votes cast at a meeting at which there is a quorum. Any AGM requires 21 clear days' notice. The notice period for any other general meeting is 14 clear days subject to the company obtaining annual shareholder approval, failing which, a 21 clear day notice period will apply.\n\n## Liquidation rights; redemption provisions\n\nIn the event of a liquidation of bp, after payment of all liabilities and applicable deductions under UK laws and subject to the payment of secured creditors, the holders of bp preference shares would be entitled to the sum of (1) the capital paid up on such shares plus, (2) accrued and unpaid dividends and (3) a premium equal to the higher of (a) 10% of the capital paid up on the bp preference shares and (b) the excess of the average market price over par value of such shares on the LSE during the previous six months. The remaining assets (if any) would be divided pro rata among the holders of ordinary shares.\n\nWithout prejudice to any special rights previously conferred on the holders of any class of shares, bp may issue any share with such preferred, deferred or other special rights, or subject to such restrictions as the shareholders by resolution determine (or, in the absence of any such resolutions, by determination of the directors), and may issue shares that are to be or may be redeemed.\n\n## Variation of rights\n\nThe rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the consent in writing of holders of 75% of the shares of that class or on the adoption of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. At every such separate meeting, all of the provisions of the Articles of Association relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that the quorum with respect to a meeting to change the rights attached to the preference shares is 10% or more of the shares of that class, and the quorum to change the rights attached to the ordinary shares is one third or more of the shares of that class.\n\n## Shareholders' meetings and notices\n\nShareholders must provide bp with a postal or electronic address in the UK to be entitled to receive notice of shareholders' meetings. Holders of bp ADSs are entitled to receive notices under the terms of the deposit agreement relating to bp ADSs. The substance and timing of notices are described above under the heading Voting rights.\n\nUnder the Act, the AGM of shareholders must be held once every year, within each six-month period beginning with the day following the company's accounting reference date. All general meetings shall be held at a time and place determined by the directors. If any shareholders' meeting is adjourned for lack of quorum, notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting may be given in any lawful manner, including electronically. Powers exist for action to be taken either before or at the meeting by authorized officers to ensure its orderly conduct and safety of those attending.\n\nThe directors have power to convene a general meeting which is a hybrid meeting, that is to provide facilities for shareholders to attend a meeting which is being held at a physical place by electronic means as well (but not to convene a purely electronic meeting).\n\nThe provisions of the Articles of Association in relation to satellite meetings permit facilities being provided by electronic means to allow those persons at each place to participate in the meeting.\n\n\u00ab\n\n## Shareholder information\n\n## Limitations on voting and shareholding\n\nThere are no limitations, either under the laws of the UK or under the company's Articles of Association, restricting the right of non-resident or foreign owners to hold or vote bp ordinary or preference shares in the company other than limitations that would generally apply to all of the shareholders and limitations applicable to certain countries and persons subject to EU economic sanctions or those sanctions adopted by the UK government which implement resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.\n\n## Disclosure of interests in shares\n\nThe Act permits a public company to give notice to any person whom the company believes to be or, at any time during the three years prior to the issue of the notice, to have been interested in its voting shares requiring them to disclose certain information with respect to those interests. Failure to supply the information required may lead to disenfranchisement of the relevant shares and a prohibition on their transfer and receipt of dividends and other payments in respect of those shares and any new shares in the company issued in respect of those shares. In this context the term 'interest' is widely defined and will generally include an interest of any kind whatsoever in voting shares, including any interest of a holder of bp ADSs.\n\n## Called-up share capital\n\nDetails of the allotted, called-up and fully-paid share capital at 31 December 2023 are set out in Financial statements - Note 31. In accordance with institutional investor guidelines, the company deems it appropriate to grant authority to the directors to allot shares and other securities and to disapply pre-emption rights by way of shareholders' resolutions at each AGM in place of authority granted by virtue of the company's Articles of Association. At the AGM on 27 April 2023, authorization was given to the directors to allot shares in the company and to grant rights to subscribe for, or to convert any security into, shares in the company up to an aggregate nominal amount as set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting 2023 . These authorities were given for the period until the next AGM in 2024 or 27 July 2024, whichever is the earlier. These authorities are renewed annually at the AGM.\n\n## Company records and service of notice\n\nIn relation to notices not covered by the Act, the reference to notice by advertisement in a national newspaper also includes advertisements via other means such as a public announcement.",

The shares repurchased in 2023 represented 7.35% of the company's issued share capital, excluding shares held in treasury, on 31 December 2023. Of the shares repurchased in 2023, shares purchased under the 2022 AGM authority represented 3.57%, and shares purchased under the 2023 AGM authority represented 3.78%, of bp's issued share capital, excluding shares held in treasury, on 31 December 2023. A further 155,997,926 ordinary shares were repurchased between the end of the financial year and 16 February 2024 at a cost of $921,854,905 (including transaction costs) representing 0.91% of the company's issued share capital, excluding shares held in treasury, on 31 December 2023. All ordinary shares repurchased in 2023 and in 2024 up to 16 February under the share buyback programmes were cancelled.\n\nAuthorization for the company to make market purchases (as defined in section 693(4) of the Companies Act 2006) of ordinary shares with a nominal value of $0.25 each in the company was renewed at the company's 2023 AGM covering the period until the date of the company's 2024 AGM or 27 July 2024, whichever is earlier.

        "page_content": "## Special resolution: Climate Action 100+ shareholder resolution on climate change disclosures\n\nThat in order to promote the long-term success of the company, given the recognized risks and opportunities associated with climate change, we as shareholders direct the company to include in its strategic report and/or other corporate reports, as appropriate, for the year ending 2019 onwards, a description of its strategy which the board considers, in good faith, to be consistent with the goals of Articles 2.1(a)(1) and 4.1(2) of the Paris Agreement (3) (the Paris goals), as well as:\n\n- (1) Capital expenditure: how the company evaluates the consistency of each new material capex investment, including in the exploration, acquisition or development of oil and gas resources and reserves and other energy sources and technologies, with (a) the Paris goals and separately (b) a range of other outcomes relevant to its strategy.\n- (2) Metrics and targets: the company's principal metrics and relevant targets or goals over the short, medium and/or long term, consistent with the Paris goals, together with disclosure of:\n- a. The anticipated levels of investment in (i) oil and gas resources and reserves; and (ii) other energy sources and technologies.\n- b. The company's targets to promote reductions in its operational greenhouse gas emissions, to be reviewed in line with changing protocols and other relevant factors.\n- c.  The estimated carbon intensity of the company's energy products and progress on carbon intensity over time.\n- d. Any linkage between the above targets and executive remuneration.\n- (3) Progress reporting: an annual review of progress against (1) and (2) above.\n\nSuch disclosure and reporting to include the criteria and summaries of the methodology and core assumptions used, and to omit commercially confidential or competitively sensitive information and be prepared at reasonable cost; and provided that nothing in this resolution shall limit the company's powers to set and vary its strategy, or associated targets or metrics, or to take any action which it believes in good faith, would best promote the long-term success of the company.\n\n## The Paris goals\n\n- (1) Article 2.1(a) of the Paris Agreement states the goal of 'Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well-below-2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change'.\n- (2) Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement: In order to achieve the long-term temperature goal set out in Article 2, parties aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.\n- (3) U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties, Twenty-First Session, Adoption of the Paris Agreement, U.N. Doc. FCCC/CP/2015/L.9/Rev.1 (Dec. 12, 2015).\n\n## New material capex investment\n\nFor the purposes of the 2023 evaluation discussed on pages 30-34, 'new material capex investment' means a decision taken by the resource commitment meeting (RCM) in 2023 to incur inorganic or organic investments greater than $250 million that relate to a new project or asset, extending an existing project or asset, or acquiring or increasing a share in a project, asset or entity.\n\nThere were nine investments that met the above criteria in 2023.\n\n## Material capex evaluation: Paris-consistency quantitative tests.\n\nFor the purposes of evaluating material capex investments for consistency with the Paris goals, two quantitative tests were applied, see page 33.\n\n## Operational carbon intensity (CI)\n\nThe annual average operational GHG emissions (TeCO2e/unit), divided by the relevant unit of output:\n\n- \u00b7 Per thousand barrels of oil equivalent in upstream.\n- \u00b7 Per utilized equivalent distillation capacity in refining.\n- \u00b7 per thousand tonnes of petrochemicals production.\n\n## Net zero aims and ambition glossary\n\n## Average carbon intensity of sold energy products\n\nThe rate of GHG emissions per unit of energy delivered (in grams CO2e/MJ) estimated in respect of sold energy products \u00ab . GHG emissions are estimated on a lifecycle basis covering use, production, and distribution of sold energy products.\n\n## Emissions from the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production\n\nEstimated CO2 emissions from the combustion of upstream production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) based on bp's net share of production, excluding bp's share of Rosneft production and assuming that all produced volumes undergo full stoichiometric combustion to CO2.\n\n## Energy product\n\nFor the purposes of our 2023 disclosures relating to our aim 3, we consider an energy product to be one that is generally used to satisfy an energy demand. In the case of fuels, to burn them to release their calorific content, and in the case of electricity to provide work or heat. For further information on products included in bp's 2023 aim 3 reporting see the basis of reporting bp.com/basisofreporting .\n\n## Methane intensity\n\nMethane intensity refers to the amount of methane emissions from bp's operated upstream oil and gas assets as a percentage of the total gas that goes to market from those operations. Our methodology is aligned with the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative's (OGCI).\n\n## Net zero\n\nReferences to global net zero in the phrase, 'to help the world get to net zero', means achieving '...a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases...on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty', as set out in Article 4(1) of the Paris Agreement.\n\nReferences to net zero for bp in the context of our ambition and aims 1, 2 and 3 mean achieving a balance between (a) the relevant Scope 1 and 2 emissions (for aim 1), Scope 3 emissions (for aim 2) or product lifecycle emissions (for aim 3) and (b) the aggregate of applicable deductions from qualifying activities such as sinks under our methodology at the applicable time.\n\n## Net zero \u00ab operations\n\nbp's aim to reach net zero operational greenhouse gas (CO2 and methane) emissions by 2050 or sooner, on a gross operational control basis, in accordance with bp's aim 1 which relates to our reported Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Any interim target or aim in respect of bp's aim 1 is defined in terms of absolute reductions relative to the baseline year of 2019.\n\n## Net zero \u00ab production\n\nbp's aim to reach net zero CO2 emissions, in accordance with bp's aim 2, from the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production, in respect of the estimated CO2 emissions from the combustion of upstream production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (based on bp's net share of production, excluding bp's share of Rosneft production and assuming that all produced volumes undergo full stoichiometric combustion to CO2). Aim 2 is bp's Scope 3 aim and relates to Scope 3 category 11 emissions within the selected boundary of bp's net share of upstream production of oil and gas. Any interim target or aim in respect of bp's aim 2 is defined in terms of absolute reductions relative to the baseline year of 2019.\n\n## Net zero \u00ab sales\n\nbp's aim to reach net zero for the carbon intensity of sold energy products \u00ab , in accordance with bp's aim 3. Any interim target or aim in respect of bp's aim 3 is defined in terms of reductions in the carbon",

        "page_content": "intensity of the energy products we sell (in grams CO2e/MJ) relative to the baseline year of 2019.\n\n## Physically traded energy products\n\nFor the purposes of aim 3, this includes trades in energy products \u00ab which are physically settled, with the exception of, for example, financial trades and certain other transactions where the purpose or effect is that the volumes traded or supplied net off against each other.\n\n## Sold energy products\n\nFor the purposes of aim 3, these represent the energy products \u00ab we sell to third parties including both marketed sales and physically traded energy products \u00ab . For these purposes, intercompany sales (sales between two group subsidiaries) are not included and equity-accounted entities are treated as third parties.\n\n## Sustainable emissions reductions (SER)\n\nSERs result from actions or interventions that have led to ongoing reductions in Scope 1 (direct) and/or Scope 2 (indirect) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon dioxide and methane) such that GHG emissions would have been higher in the reporting year if the intervention had not taken place. SERs must meet three criteria: a specific intervention that has reduced GHG emissions, the reduction must be quantifiable and the reduction is expected to be ongoing. Reductions are reportable for a 12-month period from the start of the intervention/action.\n\n## Adjusted EBIDA\n\nAdjusted EBIDA is a non-IFRS measure and is defined as profit or loss for the period, adjusting for finance costs and net finance (income) or expense relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefits and taxation, inventory holding gains or losses before tax, net adjusting items \u00ab before interest and tax, and taxation on an underlying RC basis, and adding back depreciation, depletion and amortization (pre-tax) and exploration expenditure written-off (net of adjusting items, pre-tax). bp believes that adjusted EBIDA is a useful measure for investors because it is a measure closely tracked by management to evaluate bp's operating performance and to make financial, strategic and operating decisions and because it may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same manner as management, the underlying trends in bp's operational performance on a comparable basis, period on period. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is profit or loss for the period. A reconciliation of profit or loss for the period to adjusted EBIDA is provided on page 383.\n\n## Adjusted EBIDA per share compound annual growth rate (CAGR)\n\nNon-IFRS measure. Adjusted EBIDA per share is calculated based on the shares in issue at period end.\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure presented for bp's operating segments and the group. Adjusted EBITDA for bp's operating segments is defined as replacement cost (RC) profit before interest and tax, excluding net adjusting items* before interest and tax, and adding back depreciation, depletion and amortization and exploration write-offs (net of adjusting items). Adjusted EBITDA by business is a further analysis of adjusted EBITDA for the customers & products businesses. bp believes it is helpful to disclose adjusted EBITDA by operating segment and by business because it reflects how the segments measure underlying business delivery. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis for the segment is RC profit or loss before interest and tax, which is bp's measure of profit or loss that is required to be disclosed for each operating segment under IFRS. A reconciliation to IFRS information is provided on pages 351 and 384.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the group is defined as profit or loss for the period, adjusting for finance costs and net finance (income) or expense relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefits and taxation, inventory holding gains or losses before tax, net adjusting items before interest and tax, and adding back depreciation, depletion and amortization (pre-tax) and exploration expenditure written-off (net of adjusting items, pre-tax). The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis for the group is profit or loss for the period. A reconciliation to IFRS information is provided on page 384.\n\nWe are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for adjusted EBITDA for the group, strategic themes or transition growth engine, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00ab\n\naccurately certain adjusting items required to calculate a meaningful comparable IFRS forward-looking financial measure. These items include inventory holding gains or losses, adjusting items and exploration expenditure written off that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in an IFRS estimate.\n\n## Adjusted free cash flow\n\nAdjusted free cash flow, as applicable to the directors' remuneration performance measure, is a non-IFRS measure and is defined as Operating cash flow less: (1) net cash used in investing activities as presented in the group cash flow statement; and (2) lease liability payments included in financing activities and adjusting for other proceeds reported within financing activities in the group cash flow statement and movements in lease creditor.\n\n## Adjusting items\n\nAdjusting items are items that bp discloses separately because it considers such disclosures to be meaningful and relevant to investors. They are items that management considers to be important to period-on-period analysis of the group's results and are disclosed in order to enable investors to better understand and evaluate the group's reported financial performance. Adjusting items include gains and losses on the sale of businesses and fixed assets, impairments, environmental and other provisions and charges, restructuring, integration and rationalization costs, fair value accounting effects, costs relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and other items. Adjusting items within equity-accounted earnings are reported net of incremental income tax reported by the equity-accounted entity. Adjusting items are used as a reconciling adjustment to derive underlying RC profit or loss and related underlying measures which are non-IFRS measures. An analysis of adjusting items by segment and type is shown on page 337.\n\n## Associate\n\nAn entity over which the group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement of the group. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\n## Biofuels production\n\nBiofuels production is average thousands of barrels of biofuel production per day during the period covered net to bp. This includes equivalent ethanol production, bp Bunge biopower for grid export, refining coprocessing and standalone hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO).\n\n## Biogas supply volumes\n\nBiogas supply volumes is the average thousands of barrels of oil equivalent per day of production and offtakes during the period covered net to bp.\n\n## Bio-refinery\n\nA facility that is dedicated to processing biological materials (including waste oil and crop waste) to produce biofuels such as biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel, which may be blended to customer specifications with other components such as hydrocarbons at co-located or adjacent terminals and tanks.\n\n## Blue hydrogen\n\nHydrogen made from natural gas in combination with carbon captured and stored (CCS).\n\n## Capital employed\n\nNon-IFRS measure. It is defined as total equity plus finance debt.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nTotal cash capital expenditure as stated in the group cash flow statement. Capital expenditure for the operating segments, gas & low carbon energy businesses and customers & products businesses is presented on the same basis.\n\n## Cash balance point\n\nCash balance point is defined as the implied Brent oil price 2021 real to balance bp's sources and uses of cash assuming an average bp refining marker margin around $11/bbl and Henry Hub at $3/mmBtu in 2021 real terms.\n\n## Commodity trading contracts\n\nbp participates in regional and global commodity trading markets in order to manage, transact and hedge the crude oil, refined products and natural",

        "page_content": "gas that the group either produces or consumes in its manufacturing operations. The range of contracts the group enters into in its commodity trading operations is described below. Using these contracts, in combination with rights to access storage and transportation capacity, allows the group to access advantageous pricing differences between locations, time periods and grades.\n\n## Exchange-traded commodity derivatives\n\nContracts that are typically in the form of futures and options traded on a recognized exchange, such as Nymex and ICE. Such contracts are traded in standard specifications for the main marker crude oils, such as Brent and West Texas Intermediate; the main product grades, such as gasoline and gasoil; and for natural gas and power. Gains and losses, otherwise referred to as variation margin, are generally settled on a daily basis with the relevant exchange. These contracts are used for the trading and risk management of crude oil, refined products, and natural gas and power. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on exchange-traded commodity derivatives are included in sales and other operating revenues for accounting purposes.\n\n## Over-the-counter (OTC) contracts\n\nContracts that are typically in the form of forwards, swaps and options. Some of these contracts are traded bilaterally between counterparties or through brokers, others may be cleared by a central clearing counterparty. These contracts can be used both for trading and risk management activities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on OTC contracts are included in sales and other operating revenues for accounting purposes. Many grades of crude oil bought and sold use standard contracts including US domestic light sweet crude oil, commonly referred to as West Texas Intermediate, and a standard North Sea crude blend - Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk (BFOE). Forward contracts are used in connection with the purchase of crude oil supplies for refineries and for marketing and sales of the group's oil production and refined products. The contracts typically contain standard delivery and settlement terms. These transactions call for physical delivery of oil with consequent operational and price risk. However, various means exist and are used from time to time, to settle obligations under the contracts in cash rather than through physical delivery. Physically settled BFOE contracts delivered by cargo additionally specify a standard volume and tolerance.\n\nGas and power OTC markets are highly developed in North America and the UK, where commodities can be bought and sold for delivery in future periods. These contracts are negotiated between two parties to purchase and sell gas and power at a specified price, with delivery and settlement at a future date. Typically, the contracts specify delivery terms for the underlying commodity. Some of these transactions are not settled physically as they can be net settled by transacting offsetting sale or purchase contracts for the same location and delivery period. The contracts contain standard terms such as delivery point, pricing mechanism, settlement terms and specification of the commodity. Typically, volume, price and term (e.g. daily, monthly and balance of month) are the main variable contract terms.\n\nSwaps are typically contractual obligations to exchange cash flows between two parties. A typical swap transaction usually references a floating price and a fixed price with the net difference of the cash flows being settled. Options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell crude, oil products, natural gas or power at a specified price on or before a specific future date. Amounts under these derivative financial instruments are settled at expiry. Typically, netting agreements are used to limit credit exposure and support liquidity.\n\n## Spot and term contracts\n\nSpot contracts are contracts to purchase or sell a commodity at the market price prevailing on or around the delivery date when title to the inventory is taken. Term contracts are contracts to purchase or sell a commodity at regular intervals over an agreed term. Though spot and term contracts may have a standard form, there is no offsetting mechanism in place. As such, these transactions result in physical delivery with operational and price risk. Spot and term contracts typically relate to purchases of crude for a refinery, products for marketing, or third-party natural gas, or sales of the group's oil production, oil products or gas production to third parties. For accounting purposes, spot and term sales are included in sales and other operating revenues when title passes. Similarly, spot and term purchases are included in purchases for accounting purposes.\n\n## Consolidation adjustment - UPII\n\nUnrealized profit in inventory arising on inter-segment transactions.\n\n## Convenience gross margin\n\nNon-IFRS measure. Convenience gross margin is calculated as RC profit before interest and tax for the customers & products segment, excluding RC profit before interest and tax for the refining & trading business (a nonIFRS measure), and adjusting items \u00ab (as defined above) for the convenience & mobility business to derive underlying RC profit before interest and tax for the convenience & mobility business; subtracting underlying RC profit before interest and tax for the Castrol business; adding back depreciation, depletion and amortization, production and manufacturing, distribution and administration expenses for convenience & mobility (excluding Castrol ); subtracting earnings from equity-accounted entities in the convenience & mobility business (excluding Castrol ) and gross margin for the retail fuels, EV charging, aviation, B2B and midstream businesses. bp believes it is helpful because this measure may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same way as management, our progress against our strategic objectives of convenience growth. The nearest IFRS measure is RC profit before interest and tax for the customers & products segment. A reconciliation of RC profit before interest and tax for the customers & products segment to convenience gross margin is provided on page 351.\n\n## Convenience gross margin growth\n\nNon-IFRS measure. See convenience gross margin definition above. Convenience gross margin growth at constant foreign exchange is a nonIFRS measure. This metric requires a calculation of the comparative convenience gross margin ($ million) at current period foreign exchange rates (constant foreign exchange) and compares the current period value with the restated comparative period value, which results in the growth % at constant foreign exchange rates. bp believes the convenience gross margin growth at constant foreign exchange are useful measures because these measures may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same way as management, our progress against our strategic objectives of redefining convenience. The nearest IFRS measure to convenience gross margin is RC profit before interest and tax for the customer & products segment.\n\n## Convenience & EV gross margin growth (%)\n\nNon-IFRS measure. See convenience gross margin and EV gross margin definitions. Convenience and EV gross margin growth at constant foreign exchange is a non-IFRS measure. This metric, as applicable to the directors' remuneration performance measure, requires a calculation of the comparative convenience and EV gross margin ($ million) at current period foreign exchange rates (constant foreign exchange) and compares the current period value with the restated comparative period value, which results in the growth % at constant foreign exchange rates. The nearest IFRS measure to convenience gross margin and EV gross margin is RC profit before interest and tax for the customer & products segment.\n\n## Cumulative cash costs reductions\n\nNon-IFRS measure. Cash costs is defined as production and manufacturing expenses plus distribution and administration expenses and excludes costs that are classified as adjusting items and costs that are variable, primarily with volumes (such as freight costs). It also includes exploration geological and geophysical costs, which are included in the exploration expenses line in the group income statement. Cumulative cash cost reductions by the end of 2022 compared to 2019 baseline, as applicable to the directors' remuneration performance measure, are defined as reinvent headcount savings, restructuring, location, agile, operational and other savings, less agreed portfolio changes and costs in direct support of growth.\n\n## Customer touchpoints\n\nCustomer touchpoints are the number of retail customer transactions per day on bp forecourts globally. These include transactions involving fuel and/or convenience across all channels of trade.\n\n## Developed renewables to final investment decision (FID)\n\nTotal generating capacity for assets developed to FID by all entities where bp has an equity share (proportionate to equity share). If asset is subsequently sold bp will continue to record capacity as developed to FID. If bp equity share increases developed capacity to FID will increase proportionately to share increase for any assets where bp held equity at the point of FID.",

It is commonly used as a benchmark hub for gas prices in Europe.\n\n## Effective tax rate (ETR) on replacement cost (RC) profit or loss\n\nNon-IFRS measure. The ETR on RC profit or loss is calculated by dividing taxation on a RC basis by RC profit or loss before tax. Taxation on a RC basis for the group is calculated as taxation as stated on the group income statement adjusted for taxation on inventory holding gains and losses. Information on RC profit or loss is provided below. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the ETR on RC profit or loss because this measure excludes the impact of price changes on the replacement of inventories and allows for more meaningful comparisons between reporting periods. Taxation on a RC basis and ETR on RC profit or loss are non-IFRS measures. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is the ETR on profit or loss for the period. A reconciliation to IFRS information is provided on page 382.\n\n## Electric vehicle charge points / EV charge points\n\nDefined as the number of connectors on a charging device, operated by either bp or a bp joint venture, as adjusted to be reflective of bp's accounting share of joint arrangements.\n\n## EV gross margin\n\nNon-IFRS measure. EV gross margin, as applicable to the directors' remuneration performance measure, is calculated as RC profit before interest and tax for the customers & products segment, excluding RC profit before interest and tax for the refining & trading business (a non-IFRS measure), and adjusting items \u00ab (as defined above) for the convenience & mobility business to derive underlying RC profit before interest and tax for the convenience & mobility business; subtracting underlying RC profit before interest and tax for the Castrol business; adding back depreciation, depletion and amortization, production and manufacturing, distribution and administration expenses for convenience & mobility (excluding Castrol); subtracting earnings from equity-accounted entities in the convenience & mobility business (excluding Castrol) and gross margin for the convenience and retail fuels, aviation, B2B and midstream businesses. The nearest IFRS measure to EV gross margin is RC profit before interest and tax for the customer & products segment.\n\n## Fair value accounting effects\n\nNon-IFRS adjustments to our IFRS profit (loss).They reflect the difference between the way bp manages the economic exposure and internally measures performance of certain activities and the way those activities are measured under IFRS. Fair value accounting effects are included within adjusting items. They relate to certain of the group's commodity, interest rate and currency risk exposures as detailed below. Other than as noted below, the fair value accounting effects described are reported in both the gas & low carbon energy and customer & products segments.\n\nbp uses derivative instruments to manage the economic exposure relating to inventories above normal operating requirements of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products. Under IFRS, these inventories are recorded at historical cost. The related derivative instruments, however, are required to be recorded at fair value with gains and losses recognized in the income statement. This is because hedge accounting is either not permitted or not followed, principally due to the impracticality of effectiveness-testing requirements. Therefore, measurement differences in relation to recognition of gains and losses occur. Gains and losses on these inventories, other than net realizable value provisions, are not recognized until the commodity is sold in a subsequent accounting period. Gains and losses on the related derivative commodity contracts are recognized in the income statement, from the time the derivative commodity contract is entered into, on a fair value basis using forward prices consistent with the contract maturity.\n\nbp enters into physical commodity contracts to meet certain business requirements, such as the purchase of crude for a refinery or the sale of\n\nbp's gas production. Under IFRS these physical contracts are treated as derivatives and are required to be fair valued when they are managed as part of a larger portfolio of similar transactions. Gains and losses arising are recognized in the income statement from the time the derivative commodity contract is entered into.\n\nIFRS require that inventory held for trading is recorded at its fair value using period-end spot prices, whereas any related derivative commodity instruments are required to be recorded at values based on forward prices consistent with the contract maturity. Depending on market conditions, these forward prices can be either higher or lower than spot prices, resulting in measurement differences.\n\nbp enters into contracts for pipelines and other transportation, storage capacity, oil and gas processing, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and certain gas and power contracts that, under IFRS, are recorded on an accruals basis. These contracts are risk-managed using a variety of derivative instruments that are fair valued under IFRS. This results in measurement differences in relation to recognition of gains and losses.\n\nThe way that bp manages the economic exposures described above, and measures performance internally, differs from the way these activities are measured under IFRS. bp calculates this difference for consolidated entities by comparing the IFRS result with management's internal measure of performance. We believe that disclosing management's estimate of this difference provides useful information for investors because it enables investors to see the economic effect of these activities as a whole.\n\nThese include:\n\n- \u00b7 Under management's internal measure of performance the inventory, transportation and capacity contracts in question are valued based on fair value using relevant forward prices prevailing at the end of the period.\n- \u00b7 Fair value accounting effects also include changes in the fair value of the near-term portions of LNG contracts that fall within bp's risk management framework. LNG contracts are not considered derivatives, because there is insufficient market liquidity, and they are therefore accrual accounted under IFRS. However, oil and natural gas derivative financial instruments used to risk manage the near-term portions of the LNG contracts are fair valued under IFRS. The fair value accounting effect, which is reported in the gas and low carbon energy segment, represents the change in value of LNG contracts that are being risk managed and which is reflected in the underlying result, but not in reported earnings. Management believes that this gives a better representation of performance in each period.\n\nFurthermore, the fair values of derivative instruments used to risk manage certain other oil, gas, power and other contracts, are deferred to match with the underlying exposure. The commodity contracts for business requirements are accounted for on an accruals basis.\n\nIn addition, fair value accounting effects include changes in the fair value of derivatives entered into by the group to manage currency exposure and interest rate risks relating to hybrid bonds to their respective first call periods. The hybrid bonds which were issued on 17 June 2020 are classified as equity instruments and were recorded in the balance sheet at that date at their USD equivalent issued value. Under IFRS these equity instruments are not remeasured from period to period, and do not qualify for application of hedge accounting. The derivative instruments relating to the hybrid bonds, however, are required to be recorded at fair value with mark to market gains and losses recognized in the income statement. Therefore, measurement differences in relation to the recognition of gains and losses occur. The fair value accounting effect, which is reported in the other businesses & corporate segment, eliminates the fair value gains and losses of these derivative financial instruments that are recognized in the income statement. We believe that this gives a better representation of performance, by more appropriately reflecting the economic effect of these risk management activities, in each period.\n\n## Fast / Fast charging\n\nFast charging comprises rapid charging \u00ab and ultra-fast charging \u00ab .\n\n## Finance debt ratio\n\nFinance debt ratio is defined as the ratio of finance debt to the total of finance debt plus total equity.",

        "page_content": "## Gearing and net debt\n\nNon-IFRS measures. Net debt is calculated as finance debt, as shown in the balance sheet, plus the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks relating to finance debt, for which hedge accounting is applied, less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt does not include accrued interest, which is reported within other receivables and other payables on the balance sheet and for which the associated cash flows are presented as operating cash flows in the group cash flow statement. Gearing is defined as the ratio of net debt to the total of net debt plus total equity. bp believes these measures provide useful information to investors. Net debt enables investors to see the economic effect of finance debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total. Gearing enables investors to see how significant net debt is relative to total equity. The derivatives are reported on the balance sheet within the headings 'Derivative financial instruments'. See Financial statements - Note 27 for information on finance debt, which is the nearest equivalent measure to net debt on an IFRS basis. The nearest equivalent IFRS measure to gearing on an IFRS basis is finance debt ratio.\n\nWe are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for net debt or gearing to finance debt and total equity, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately certain adjusting items required to present a meaningful comparable IFRS forward-looking financial measure. These items include fair value asset (liability) of hedges related to finance debt and cash and cash equivalents, that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in an IFRS estimate.\n\n## Gearing including leases and net debt including leases\n\nNon-IFRS measures. Net debt including leases is calculated as net debt plus lease liabilities, less the net amount of partner receivables and payables relating to leases entered into on behalf of joint operations. Gearing including leases is defined as the ratio of net debt including leases to the total of net debt including leases plus total equity. bp believes these measures provide useful information to investors as they enable investors to understand the impact of the group's lease portfolio on net debt and gearing. See Financial statements - Note 27 for information on finance debt, which is the nearest equivalent measure to net debt including leases on an IFRS basis. The nearest equivalent IFRS measure to gearing including leases on an IFRS basis is finance debt ratio. A reconciliation to IFRS information is provided on page 339.\n\n## Green hydrogen\n\nHydrogen produced by electrolysis of water using renewable power.\n\n## Grey hydrogen\n\nProduced via natural gas or coal without CCUS.\n\n## Hydrocarbons\n\nLiquids and natural gas. Natural gas is converted to oil equivalent at 5.8 billion cubic feet = 1 million barrels.\n\n## Hydrogen pipeline\n\nHydrogen projects which have not been developed to final investment decision (FID) but which have advanced to the concept development stage.\n\n## Inorganic capital expenditure\n\nA subset of capital expenditure on a cash basis and a non-IFRS measure. Inorganic capital expenditure comprises consideration in business combinations and certain other significant investments made by the group. It is reported on a cash basis. bp believes that this measure provides useful information as it allows investors to understand how bp's management invests funds in projects which expand the group's activities through acquisition. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is capital expenditure on a cash basis. Further information and a reconciliation to IFRS information is provided on page 336.\n\n## Installed renewables capacity\n\nInstalled renewables capacity is bp's share of capacity for operating assets owned by entities where bp has an equity share.\n\n## Inventory holding gains and losses\n\nInventory holding gains and losses are non-IFRS adjustments to our IFRS profit (loss) and represent:\n\n- \u00b7 The difference between the cost of sales calculated using the replacement cost of inventory and the cost of sales calculated on the\n\nfirst-in first-out (FIFO) method after adjusting for any changes in provisions where the net realizable value of the inventory is lower than its cost. Under the FIFO method, which we use for IFRS reporting of inventories other than for trading inventories, the cost of inventory charged to the income statement is based on its historical cost of purchase or manufacture, rather than its replacement cost. In volatile energy markets, this can have a significant distorting effect on reported income. The amounts disclosed as inventory holding gains and losses represent the difference between the charge to the income statement for inventory on a FIFO basis (after adjusting for any related movements in net realizable value provisions) and the charge that would have arisen based on the replacement cost of inventory. For this purpose, the replacement cost of inventory is calculated using data from each operation's production and manufacturing system, either on a monthly basis, or separately for each transaction where the system allows this approach.\n\n- \u00b7 An adjustment relating to certain trading inventories that are not price risk managed which relate to a minimum inventory volume that is required to be held to maintain underlying business activities. This adjustment represents the movement in fair value of the inventories due to prices, on a grade-by-grade basis, during the period. This is calculated from each operation's inventory management system on a monthly basis using the discrete monthly movement in market prices for these inventories.\n\nThe amounts disclosed are not separately reflected in the financial statements as a gain or loss. No adjustment is made in respect of the cost of inventories held as part of a trading position and certain other temporary inventory positions that are price risk-managed. See Replacement cost (RC) profit or loss definition below.\n\n## Joint arrangement\n\nAn arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control.\n\n## Joint control\n\nContractually agreed sharing of control over an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\n## Joint operation\n\nA joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.\n\n## Joint venture\n\nA joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\n\n## Liquids\n\nComprises crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. For the oil production & operations segment, it also includes bitumen.\n\n## LNG portfolio\n\nLNG portfolio refers to bp group's LNG equity production plus additional long-term merchant LNG volumes.\n\n## LNG train\n\nAn LNG train is a processing facility used to liquefy and purify natural gas in the formation of LNG.\n\n## Low carbon activity\n\nAn activity relating to low carbon including: renewable electricity; bioenergy; electric vehicles and other future mobility solutions; trading and marketing low carbon products; blue or green hydrogen \u00ab and carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS).\n\nNote that, while there is some overlap of activities, these terms do not mean the same as bp's strategic focus area of low carbon energy or our low carbon energy sub-segment, reported within the gas & low carbon energy segment.\n\n## Low carbon activity investment\n\nCapital investment in relation to low carbon activity \u00ab .\n\n## Major projects\n\nHave a bp net investment of at least $250 million, or are considered to be of",

When used in the context of a segment rather than the group, the terms refer to the segment's share thereof.\n\n## Operating management system (OMS)\n\nbp's OMS helps us manage risks in our operating activities by setting out bp's principles for good operating practice. It brings together bp requirements on health, safety, security, the environment, social responsibility and operational reliability, as well as related issues, such as maintenance, contractor relations and organizational learning, into a common management system.\n\n## Organic capital expenditure\n\nNon-IFRS measure. Organic capital expenditure comprises capital expenditure on a cash basis less inorganic capital expenditure. bp believes that this measure provides useful information as it allows investors to understand how bp's management invests funds in developing and maintaining the group's assets. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is capital expenditure on a cash basis. An analysis of organic capital expenditure by segment and region, and a reconciliation to IFRS information is provided on page 336.\n\nWe are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for organic capital expenditure to total cash capital expenditure, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately the adjusting item, inorganic capital expenditure, that is difficult to predict in advance in order to derive the nearest IFRS estimate.\n\n## Production-sharing agreement / contract (PSA / PSC)\n\nAn arrangement through which an oil and gas company bears the risks and costs of exploration, development and production. In return, if exploration is successful, the oil company receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the costs incurred and a stipulated share of the production remaining after such cost recovery.\n\n## Rapid / Rapid charging\n\nRapid charging includes electric vehicle charging of greater or equal to 50kW and less than 150kW.\n\n## Realizations\n\nRealizations are the result of dividing revenue generated from hydrocarbon sales, excluding revenue generated from purchases made for resale and royalty volumes, by revenue generating hydrocarbon production volumes. Revenue generating hydrocarbon production reflects the bp share of production as adjusted for any production which does not generate revenue. Adjustments may include losses due to shrinkage, amounts consumed during processing, and contractual or regulatory host committed volumes such as royalties. For the gas & low carbon energy and oil production & operations segments, realizations include transfers between businesses.\n\n## Refining availability\n\nRepresents Solomon Associates' operational availability for bp-operated refineries, which is defined as the percentage of the year that a unit is available for processing after subtracting the annualized time lost due to turnaround activity and all planned mechanical, process and regulatory downtime.\n\n## Refining marker margin (RMM)\n\nThe average of regional indicator margins weighted for bp's crude refining capacity in each region. Each regional marker margin is based on product yields and a marker crude oil deemed appropriate for the region. The regional indicator margins may not be representative of the margins achieved by bp in any period because of bp's particular refinery configurations and crude and product slate.\n\n## Replacement cost (RC) profit or loss / RC profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders\n\nReflects the replacement cost of inventories sold in the period and is calculated as profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders, adjusting for inventory holding gains and losses (net of tax). RC profit or loss for the group is not a recognized IFRS measure. bp believes this measure is useful to illustrate to investors the fact that crude oil and product prices can vary\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00ab\n\nsignificantly from period to period and that the impact on our reported result under IFRS can be significant. Inventory holding gains and losses vary from period to period due to changes in prices as well as changes in underlying inventory levels. In order for investors to understand the operating performance of the group excluding the impact of price changes on the replacement of inventories, and to make comparisons of operating performance between reporting periods, bp's management believes it is helpful to disclose this measure. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders. See Financial statements - Note 5. A reconciliation to IFRS information is provided on page 382.\n\n## Reported recordable injury frequency\n\nReported recordable injury frequency measures the number of reported work-related employee and contractor incidents that result in a fatality or injury per 200,000 hours worked. This represents reported incidents occurring within bp's operational HSSE reporting boundary. That boundary includes bp's own operated facilities and certain other locations or situations.\n\n## Renewables pipeline\n\nRenewable projects satisfying the criteria below until the point they can be considered developed to FID:\n\nSite based projects that have obtained land exclusivity rights, or for power purchase agreement based projects an offer has been made to the counterparty, or for auction projects pre-qualification criteria has been met, or for acquisition projects post a binding offer has been accepted.\n\n## Reserves replacement ratio\n\nThe extent to which the year's production has been replaced by proved reserves added to our reserve base. The ratio is expressed in oil-equivalent terms and includes changes resulting from discoveries, improved recovery and extensions and revisions to previous estimates, but excludes changes resulting from acquisitions and disposals.\n\n## Retail sites\n\nRetail sites include sites operated by dealers, jobbers, franchisees or brand licensees or joint venture (JV) partners, under the bp brand. These may move to and from the bp brand as their fuel supply agreement or brand licence agreement expires and are renegotiated in the normal course of business. Retail sites are primarily branded bp , ARCO , Amoco , Aral , Thorntons , and TravelCenters of America and also includes sites in India through our Jio-bp JV.\n\n## Return on average capital employed\n\nNon-IFRS measure. Return on average capital employed (ROACE) is defined as underlying replacement cost profit, which is defined as profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders adjusted for inventory holding gains and losses, adjusting items and related taxation on inventory holding gains and losses and adjusting items total taxation, after adding back non-controlling interest and interest expense net of tax, divided by the average of the beginning and ending balances of total equity plus finance debt, excluding cash and cash equivalents and goodwill as presented on the group balance sheet over the periods presented. Interest expense before tax is finance costs as presented on the group income statement, excluding lease interest, the unwinding of the discount on provisions and other payables and other adjusting items reported in finance costs. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the ROACE because this measure gives an indication of the company's capital efficiency. The nearest IFRS measures of the numerator and denominator are profit or loss for the period attributable to bp shareholders and total equity respectively. The reconciliation of the numerator and denominator is provided on page 383.\n\nWe are unable to present forward-looking information of the nearest IFRS measures of the numerator and denominator for ROACE, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately certain adjusting items required to calculate a meaningful comparable IFRS forward-looking financial measure. These items include inventory holding gains or losses and interest net of tax, that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in an IFRS estimate.\n\n## Strategic convenience sites\n\nStrategic convenience sites are retail sites, within the bp portfolio, which sell bp-supplied vehicle energy (e.g. bp , Aral , Arco , Amoco , Thorntons , bp pulse , TravelCenters of America and PETRO ) and either carry one of the",

To be considered a strategic convenience site, the convenience offer should have a demonstrable level of differentiation in the market in which it operates. Strategic convenience site count includes sites under a pilot phase.\n\n## Subsidiary\n\nAn entity that is controlled by the bp group. Control of an investee exists when an investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\n## Surplus cash flow\n\nSurplus cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. It is a non-IFRS financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net cash provided by operating activities, reported in accordance with IFRS. The surplus cash flow forms part of bp's financial frame.\n\nSurplus cash flow refers to the net surplus of sources of cash over uses of cash, after reaching the $35 billion net debt target. Sources of cash include net cash provided by operating activities, cash provided from investing activities and cash receipts relating to transactions involving noncontrolling interests. Uses of cash include lease liability payments, payments on perpetual hybrid bond, dividends paid, cash capital expenditure, the cash cost of share buybacks to offset the dilution from vesting of awards under employee share schemes, cash payments relating to transactions involving non-controlling interests and currency translation differences relating to cash and cash equivalents as presented on the condensed group cash flow statement.\n\nFor 2022, the sources of cash includes other proceeds related to the proceeds from the disposal of a loan note related to the Alaska divestment. The cash was received in the fourth quarter 2021, was reported as a financing cash flow and was not included in other proceeds at the time due to potential recourse from the counterparty. The proceeds are being recognized as the potential recourse reduces.\n\nThe components of our sources of cash and uses of cash are provided on page 339.\n\n## Technical service contract (TSC)\n\nTechnical service contract is an arrangement through which an oil and gas company bears the risks and costs of exploration, development and production. In return, the oil and gas company receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the costs incurred and a profit margin which reflects incremental production added to the oilfield.\n\n## Tier 1 and tier 2 process safety events\n\nTier 1 events are losses of primary containment from a process of greatest consequence - causing harm to a member of the workforce, damage to equipment from a fire or explosion, a community impact or exceeding defined quantities. Tier 2 events are those of lesser consequence. These represent reported incidents occurring within bp's operational HSSE reporting boundary. That boundary includes bp's own operated facilities and certain other locations or situations.\n\n## Tight oil and gas\n\nNatural oil and gas reservoirs locked in hard sandstone rocks with low permeability, making the underground formation extremely tight.\n\n## Transition growth\n\nActivities, represented by a set of transition growth engines, that transition bp toward its objective to be an integrated energy company, and that comprise our low carbon activity \u00ab alongside other businesses that support transition, such as our power trading and marketing business and convenience.\n\n## Transition growth investment\n\nCapital investment in relation to transition growth \u00ab , that is aligned to our aim 5 (to increase the proportion of investment we make into our non-oil and -gas businesses. For this purpose, we define 'oil and gas' activities as those primarily encompassing the production, refining and sale of fossil hydrocarbons and their products and those associated with the dedicated gas and oil trading businesses).\n\n## UK National Balancing Point\n\nA virtual trading location for sale, purchase and exchange of UK natural gas. It is the pricing and delivery point for the Intercontinental Exchange natural gas futures contract.\n\n## Ultra fast / Ultra-fast charging\n\nElectric vehicle charging of greater than or equal to 150kW.\n\n## Unconventionals\n\nResources found in geographic accumulations over a large area, that usually present additional challenges to development such as low permeability or high viscosity. Examples include shale gas and oil, coalbed methane, gas hydrates and natural bitumen deposits. These typically require specialized extraction technology such as hydraulic fracturing or steam injection.\n\n## Underlying effective tax rate (ETR)\n\nNon-IFRS measure. The underlying ETR is calculated by dividing taxation on an underlying replacement cost (RC) basis by underlying RC profit or loss before tax. Taxation on an underlying RC basis for the group is calculated as taxation as stated on the group income statement adjusted for taxation on inventory holding gains and losses and adjusting items total taxation. Information on underlying RC profit or loss is provided below. Taxation on an underlying RC basis presented for the operating segments is calculated through an allocation of taxation on an underlying RC basis to each segment. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the underlying ETR because this measure may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same manner as management, the underlying trends in bp's operational performance on a comparable basis, period on period. Taxation on an underlying RC basis and underlying ETR are non-IFRS measures. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is the ETR on profit or loss for the period.\n\nWe are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for underlying ETR to ETR on profit or loss for the period, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately certain adjusting items required to present a meaningful comparable IFRS forward-looking financial measure. These items include the taxation on inventory holding gains and losses and adjusting items, that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in an IFRS estimate. A reconciliation to IFRS information is provided on page 382.\n\n## Underlying production\n\nProduction after adjusting for acquisitions and divestments and entitlement impacts in our production-sharing agreements (PSAs). 2023 underlying production, when compared with 2022, is production after adjusting for acquisitions and divestments, curtailments, and entitlement impacts in our production-sharing agreements/contracts and technical service contract.\n\n## Underlying replacement cost (RC) profit or loss / underlying RC profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders\n\nNon-IFRS measure. RC profit or loss \u00ab (as defined above) after excluding net adjusting items and related taxation. See page 337 for additional information on the adjusting items that are used to arrive at underlying RC profit or loss in order to enable a full understanding of the items and their financial impact. Underlying RC profit or loss before interest and\n\ntax for the operating segments or customers & products businesses is calculated as RC profit or loss (as defined above) including profit or loss attributable to non-controlling interests before interest and tax for the operating segments and excluding net adjusting items for the respective operating segment or business.\n\nbp believes that underlying RC profit or loss is a useful measure for investors because it is a measure closely tracked by management to evaluate bp's operating performance and to make financial, strategic and operating decisions and because it may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same manner as management, the underlying trends in bp's operational performance on a comparable basis, period on period, by adjusting for the effects of these adjusting items. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis for the group is profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis for segments and businesses is RC profit or loss before interest and taxation. A reconciliation to IFRS information is provided on page 382 for the group and pages 39-47 for the segments.",

The numerator used is underlying RC profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders rather than profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders. Underlying RC profit or loss per ADS is calculated as outlined above for underlying RC profit or loss per share except the denominator is adjusted to reflect one ADS equivalent to six ordinary shares. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the underlying RC profit or loss per ordinary share and per ADS because these measures may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same manner as management, the underlying trends in bp's operational performance on a comparable basis, period on period.

A cross reference to Form 20-F requirements is included on page 386.\n\nThis document contains the Strategic report on the inside front cover and pages 1-80 and the Directors' report on pages 81-104, 105 (in part only), 133-135, 247-274 and 335-384. The Strategic report and the Directors' report together include the management report required by DTR 4.1 of the UK Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules. The Directors' remuneration report is on pages 105-132. The consolidated financial statements of the group are on pages 137-246 and the corresponding reports of the auditor are on pages 138-163. The parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. are on pages 275-334.\n\nThe Directors' statements (comprising the Statement of directors' responsibilities; Risk management and internal control; Longer-term viability; Going concern; and Fair, balanced and understandable), the independent auditor's report on the annual report and accounts to the members of BP p.l.c., the parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. and corresponding auditor's report do not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.\n\nbp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023 may be downloaded from bp.com/ annualreport . No material on the bp website, other than the items identified as bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2023 , forms any part of this document. References in this document to other documents on the bp website, such as bp Energy Outlook , bp Net Zero Ambition Progress Update and bp Sustainability Report are included as an aid to their location and are not incorporated by reference into this document.\n\nBP p.l.c. is the parent company of the bp group of companies. The company was incorporated in 1909 in England and Wales and changed its name to BP p.l.c. in 2001. Where we refer to the company, we mean BP p.l.c. The company and each of its subsidiaries \u00ab are separate legal entities. Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, the term 'BP' or \"bp\" and terms such as 'we', 'us' and 'our' are used in this report for convenience to refer to one or more of the members of the bp group instead of identifying a particular entity or entities. Information in this document reflects 100% of the assets and operations of the company and its subsidiaries that were consolidated at the date or for the periods indicated, including non-controlling interests.\n\nThe company's primary share listing is the London Stock Exchange. In the US, the company's securities are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the form of ADSs (see page 364 for more details) and in Germany in the form of a global depositary certificate representing bp ordinary shares traded on the Frankfurt, Hamburg and D\u00fcsseldorf Stock Exchanges.\n\nThe term 'shareholder' in this report means, unless the context otherwise requires, investors in the equity capital of BP p.l.c., both direct and indirect.
