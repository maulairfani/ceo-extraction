A never-ending cycle of technology disruption is having a dramatic effect on the world of work and business models everywhere. Ongoing conflicts across the globe and an increasingly volatile geopolitical landscape are dividing our society and eroding trust.\n\nAt the same time, our world is not moving fast enough to prepare humanity for the existential threat of climate change and its impact on every aspect of our lives.\n\nIn times like these, we need to remember that historic transitions can lead to extraordinary opportunities for meaningful and positive change for people and communities everywhere.\n\nI write this letter as the steward of a bank that has stood the test of time through periods of great change for over 150 years. Today, as our society navigates this changing world, RBC's role as a stabilizing force for our 17+ million clients and the thousands of communities they call home matters more than ever.\n\nAs a diverse collection of 94,000+ people in nearly 30 countries, RBC colleagues are guided and united by our Purpose, and we share an important responsibility to help enable short-term prosperity and long-term progress for those we serve. To do that, we will continue to build our bank in a way that lives up to our foundational role of keeping our economy moving and balancing the needs of our four key stakeholders - clients, employees, communities and shareholders - through all credit and economic cycles.\n\nIn these challenging times, Team RBC remains steadfast in our commitment to being a trusted advisor, helping clients navigate risks and opportunities and make the best decisions possible. Our incredible team will also continue to bring that same dedication to building and growing sustainable and inclusive communities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI am grateful to work alongside our employees around the globe. Together, we believe in the world-shaping power of ideas. This report showcases the deep commitment our people have to making our bank an anchor of stability and a beacon of hope for the people, places and projects we proudly support.\n\n## The story of 2023\n\nAs always, our year was defined by our focus on doing the right thing by our clients and putting them first. This is a principle that is core to our culture and something that we strive for each and every day. It means listening to the clients who put their trust in us, building products and services to meet their needs and creating meaningful value for today and tomorrow.\n\nRBC's ambition is to be among the world's most trusted and successful financial institutions. We ended the fiscal year as a top 15 bank globally by market capitalization, including top five in North America, and the highest valued bank on a Price-to-Book Ratio among global banks. (1) We were also honoured to once again be named the most valuable brand in Canada, and the fourth most valuable financial services brand in the world. (2)\n\nIn 2023, we generated earnings of nearly $15 billion and a Return on Equity of 14.2 per cent, while ending the year with a strong CET1 ratio of 14.5 per cent - the highest in history. We also returned nearly $7.4 billion in dividends, benefitting common shareholders including pensioners and retail investors across Canada, and outperformed our global peer average in 5-year Total Shareholder Return.\n\nOur financial performance backstops our Aa1 credit rating - among the highest of banks in the world - and is a testament to our diversified business model, scale, strong balance sheet and prudent risk management.\n\nWe are well-positioned as we enter 2024, and I'm confident that RBC can be a pillar of strength and stability for those we serve through challenging times.\n\n- (1)  Banks with over $850+ billion in loans\n- (2)  Kantar BrandZ",

        "page_content": "## The geography of a premium global bank\n\nOur Canadian franchises continue to be the bedrock of our long-term, premium growth story and our position as a global competitor.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have the number one or two market share in all key product categories across Canadian Banking - supported by the largest retail network - and we're proud of the deep and trusted client relationships that have helped us get there.\n\nWe also continue to invest in digital experiences and advice that clients truly value, earning industry recognition for it, such as ranking highest in customer satisfaction for retail banking advice by J.D. Power.\n\nOur Canadian Banking business had a strong year for client acquisition as we welcomed approximately 650,000 net new clients, up more than 60 per cent year-over-year. In our Canadian Wealth Management business, we hired 40 per cent more investment advisors than in 2022, resulting in a record year for recruited assets and an enhanced experience for our clients.\n\nThis year, we strengthened our commitment to our home market with the once-in-a-generation deal to acquire HSBC Canada. This is our largest proposed acquisition ever, and it gives us a chance to take our combined client experience to the next level by adding a complementary business in the market we know best. I'm incredibly excited about how this acquisition will further position RBC as the bank of choice for newcomers to Canada and internationally-connected Canadian clients.\n\nThis transaction will also be beneficial for Canadians and our country's economic success. Upon regulatory approval, more of Canada's financial sector will be in Canadian hands, more dividends and capital will go to our clients and shareholders in Canada, and as we are one of the largest taxpayers in Canada, more revenues will stay in our home country. As RBC donates a minimum of one per cent of our pre-tax profits each year in Canada, more money will go to the communities where we live and work.\n\nIn our second home market - the U.S. - we delivered solid organic growth as our reputation for strength, stability and trust continues to build with our corporate, institutional and high net worth clients.\n\nI'm proud of how we're executing on our differentiated strategy, which is underpinned by a set of strong client franchises built up over several decades. We have a top-10 investment banking business in the U.S. alongside the 6th largest wealth manager by assets under administration in the country. (3) At City National Bank, our client-focused commercial franchise continues to be a market leader in entertainment banking, and we're looking to keep reinventing our core client and operational platform to ensure long-term, sustainable success.\n\n(3)  U.S. wealth advisory firms quarterly earnings releases (10-Q)\n\nLooking ahead, we have a plan to integrate our U.S. businesses more deeply and effectively, while also broadening and enhancing our product capabilities to deliver a holistic experience for clients. Some of the ways we'll drive greater impact in the U.S. include the expansion of our wealth banking platform and a new corporate cash management offering in Capital Markets.\n\nFinally, in the U.K. and Europe, we aspire for market presence and scale, as well as greater value creation for our clients, and this ambition has grown with the addition of RBC Brewin Dolphin. Following that successful acquisition, we're a top five wealth manager by assets under administration in the U.K., Ireland and Channel Islands, and are focused on continuing to leverage our global capabilities to deliver leading advice and grow our standing in this important region.\n\n## The next chapter of our growth story\n\nLooking ahead, we're setting our sights on unlocking our next phase of growth.\n\nWith client and investor expectations changing rapidly, it's clear to me that the banks that succeed in the future will be the ones that take advantage of scale to deliver the best value as efficiently as possible.\n\nThis is exactly the approach we're taking as we reposition the bank for the future - controlling what we can control, making tough choices, and sharpening our focus to ensure our people and investments are aligned with our highest priorities across the bank.\n\nOne of those priorities is to double down on our core deposit franchise - both on the consumer side and the business side. We've spent years building this advantage and will continue to prioritize this foundational element of banking so that we're well positioned to drive long-term growth better than our peers.\n\nBut in a rapidly changing world, our size and scale must be underpinned by our ability to deliver differentiated client experiences. This is why we're continually on the lookout for the next great opportunity to deliver new insights and innovations that will make banking smarter, simpler and better for our clients.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe want to go beyond what people expect from a bank and offer the best and most personalized client experiences possible.\n\nWe've been doing that by bringing extra value to clients through partnerships with leading brands like Petro-Canada \u2021 , Rexall \u2021 , WestJet \u2021 and METRO Inc., and by expanding our Avion Rewards\u2122 loyalty program to all Canadians, no matter where they bank. We were particularly proud to offer Avion \u00ae members an exclusive allocation of tickets to the iconic and record-smashing Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour for its 2024 stops in Canada.\n\nAs we continue to redefine what a bank can do, we're focused on investing in technologies that can deliver data-backed insights and advice to help clients build confidence and make better decisions, including through our NOMI \u00ae suite of capabilities and our AI-based Aiden \u00ae trading platform.",

(4)\n\nWith the emergence of generative AI capabilities, we're exploring how to safely and securely tap into the full potential of this technology to develop the best products and services for our clients. We believe that combining ideas and human creativity with real-time information and data sets will open up endless possibilities for our bank, our economy and our society.\n\n## Powering ideas for people and planet\n\nAs a trusted partner to clients and communities around the world, RBC and our people are in a unique position to help put ideas into action and make progress possible toward a more inclusive, sustainable and prosperous future.\n\nIn 2023, we invested $172+ million globally through cash donations and community investments because we know our bank is only as strong as the collective wellbeing of the communities where we live and work.\n\n## Amidst the unique mix of societal challenges we're seeing across the world today, we need to sharpen our focus on where we can make the most positive difference.\n\nThat's why this year we established the RBC Purpose Framework Powering Ideas for People and Planet , an initiative that is designed to add structure to our ESG approach around three clear societal ambitions: accelerating the transition to a greener economy, equipping people with the skills they need for a thriving future and driving more equitable prosperity in our communities.\n\nSince my earliest days as CEO, I have been focused on all three of these areas, but one in particular - the challenge and opportunity of Canada's climate transition - has dominated much of my thinking.\n\nIt's an unquestionable fact that our world is at an urgent moment in addressing climate change. We all see the catastrophic impact of environmental crises, especially this year, which was one of the worst on record for extreme weather events that caused devastation and disruption to people and businesses across the world.\n\nOur continued success as a bank depends on our clients succeeding commercially over the long term, including through the transition to a low-carbon economy. The best way RBC can help is by supporting clients in their decarbonization efforts and helping them reach their ambitions.\n\nOver the past year, we've made progress in a number of areas - from advising on large renewable energy projects to supporting clean tech innovators taking solutions to the market. We've also continued to execute on our 2030 financed interim emissions reduction targets for the highest emitting sectors in our loan portfolio: oil and gas, power generation and automotive.\n\n- (4)  Evident AI Index, November 2023\n- (5)   The Client Engagement Approach on Climate is available at rbc.com/climate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMoving forward, we'll accelerate our climate strategy by more clearly and actively sharing what we're doing to help get our clients and communities to net-zero faster. This includes a market-leading framework that formalizes how we assess our clients' transition plans called the Client Engagement Approach on Climate. (5) Starting with our energy sector clients, this approach will guide how we'll provide financing and advice to support those clients that are implementing transition plans.\n\nWe believe that progress on the collective journey to netzero requires the collaboration of many stakeholders across Canada, and we're committed to continued dialogue with clients, investors, Indigenous leaders, researchers, students and many other engaged groups.\n\nThis is happening alongside our work to convene decisionmaking leaders in Canada across industry, government and NGOs through the RBC Climate Action Institute. We're already making progress working with clients and leaders in the agriculture and buildings sectors, and we'll continue to engage with these stakeholders to help them apply climatesmart solutions across the country.\n\nI am proud of the progress we've made to date, and you have my commitment that we'll continue our efforts to achieve our goals.\n\n## Thank you\n\nAs we enter 2024, I'm more confident and excited than ever about the future of RBC and our important role of helping clients thrive and communities prosper.\n\nAs a pillar of strength in our society and the economies in which we operate, we know this is our moment to help bring greater leadership, stability and confidence to those we proudly serve.\n\nOn behalf of everyone on Team RBC, I want to express my heartfelt thanks to you for continuing to place your trust and support in us.\n\nI look forward to continuing to share our progress in the year ahead.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDave McKay\n\nPresident and CEO",

Millions of people benefit as a result. The bank's motivation to create meaningful value for those it serves supports its efforts to maintain and extend its leading market position in areas of strategic importance.\n\n## RBC's solid financial results in 2023 reflect its purpose-driven performance. It enters the new fiscal year as one of the highest valued banks globally.\n\nThe Board participates in strategic planning, receives regular updates from management on business plans and helps ensure the bank operates within the parameters of its risk appetite, which helps deliver above-average, low-volatility growth through economic cycles.\n\nAn important focus is talent management, given the enduring advantage of enabling RBC's 94,000+ employees to perform at their highest level. The Board helps develop the next generation of executives by overseeing succession planning and advising on career pathways that hone essential skills. We also closely monitor the bank's ongoing efforts to enhance executive representation of women, Black, Indigenous and People of Colour. RBC has increased the representation (1) of women in executive roles from 38 per cent in 2015 to 43 per cent in 2023, and Black, Indigenous and People of Colour executives from 16 per cent to 24 per cent over the same period. We continue to drive toward our ambitious but attainable goals for new executive appointments for women and Black, Indigenous and People of Colour, which we have set at 50 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively. (2)\n\nThe Board looks to 2024 with confidence. Notably, pending regulatory approval, the addition of HSBC Canada clients and colleagues will help enhance the bank's value\n\n- (1)  Represents data for our businesses in Canada governed by the Employment Equity Act.

The proposed acquisition has been a priority focus during each regular Board meeting in 2023 and will continue to be for the foreseeable future.\n\nStill, as Dave notes in his letter, the world is both complex and dynamic. The Board plays an important oversight role in supporting the bank's operational and financial resilience. To better protect the bank's clients, for instance, its businesses and functions maintained their focus on identifying the most critical services and where the most severe harm could occur in a prolonged disruption. Additionally, the bank continued to advance its risk management operating model, approach and capabilities to withstand stress and unexpected events. Ongoing efforts to build resilience help sustain the public's trust in RBC.\n\nThe Board recognizes RBC operates in a wide universe of stakeholders, many of whom the bank shares common interests with, such as a healthy and sustainable environment.\n\nIndeed, the bank is committing to support the transition to a net-zero economy, which includes working closely with clients to help them achieve their emissions reduction objectives for the transition, an area of focus where the Board believes RBC can make an impactful contribution in advancing its own climate strategy. More broadly, in 2023, Directors were presented with the RBC Purpose Framework\n\n-Powering Ideas for People and Planet . Its aim is to create clarity and structure around three societal ambitions where RBC can have a meaningful impact. Building on existing environmental, social and governance priorities, RBC wants to help accelerate the transition to a greener economy, equip people with skills for a thriving future and drive more equitable prosperity in its communities.\n\nFor more than eight years, I have benefitted from the exceptional talent of my Board colleagues, and their unwavering commitment to do the right things, in the right",

We may make forward-looking statements in this 2023 Annual Report, in other filings with Canadian regulators or the SEC, in other reports to shareholders, and in other communications. In addition, our representatives may communicate forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, the media and others. Forward-looking statements in this document include, but are not limited to, statements relating to our financial performance objectives, vision and strategic goals, the economic, market, and regulatory review and outlook for Canadian, U.S., U.K., European and global economies, the regulatory environment in which we operate, the implementation of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, the expected closing of the transaction involving HSBC Bank Canada, including plans for the combination of our operations with HSBC Bank Canada and the financial, operational and capital impacts of the transaction, the expected closing of the transaction involving the U.K. branch of RBC Investor Services Trust and the RBC Investor Services business in Jersey, the expected impact of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's special assessment, the Strategic priorities and Outlook sections for each of our business segments, the risk environment including our credit risk, market risk, liquidity and funding risk as well as the effectiveness of our risk monitoring, our climate- and sustainability-related beliefs, targets and goals (including our net-zero and sustainable finance commitments) and related legal and regulatory developments, and includes statements made by our President and Chief Executive Officer and other members of management. The forward-looking statements contained in this document represent the views of management and are presented for the purpose of assisting the holders of our securities and financial analysts in understanding our financial position and results of operations as at and for the periods ended on the dates presented, as well as our financial performance objectives, vision, strategic goals and priorities and anticipated financial performance, and may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as 'believe', 'expect', 'suggest', 'seek', 'foresee', 'forecast', 'schedule', 'anticipate', 'intend', 'estimate', 'goal', 'commit', 'target', 'objective', 'plan', 'outlook', 'timeline' and 'project' and similar expressions of future or conditional verbs such as 'will', 'may', 'might', 'should', 'could', 'can' or 'would' or negative or grammatical variations thereof.\n\nBy their very nature, forward-looking statements require us to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific in nature, which give rise to the possibility that our predictions, forecasts, projections, expectations or conclusions will not prove to be accurate, that our assumptions may not be correct, that our financial performance, environmental & social or other objectives, vision and strategic goals will not be achieved, and that our actual results may differ materially from such predictions, forecasts, projections, expectations or conclusions.\n\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements as a number of risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements. These factors - many of which are beyond our control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict - include, but are not limited to: credit, market, liquidity and funding, insurance, operational, regulatory compliance (which could lead to us being subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings, the potential outcome of which could include regulatory restrictions, penalties and fines), strategic, reputation, legal and regulatory environment, competitive, model, systemic risks and other risks discussed in the risk sections of our 2023 Annual Report, including business and economic conditions in the geographic regions in which we operate, Canadian housing and household indebtedness, information technology, cyber and third-party risks, geopolitical uncertainty, environmental and social risk (including climate change), digital disruption and innovation, privacy and data related risks, regulatory changes, culture and conduct risks, the effects of changes in government fiscal, monetary and other policies, tax risk and transparency, and our ability to anticipate and successfully manage risks arising from all of the foregoing factors. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations in such forward-looking statements can be found in the risk sections of our 2023 Annual Report, as may be updated by subsequent quarterly reports.\n\nWe caution that the foregoing list of risk factors is not exhaustive and other factors could also adversely affect our results. When relying on our forward-looking statements to make decisions with respect to us, investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events, as well as the inherent uncertainty of forward-looking statements. Material economic assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained in this 2023 Annual Report are set out in the Economic, market and regulatory review and outlook section and for each business segment under the Strategic priorities and Outlook headings, as such sections may be updated by subsequent quarterly reports. Except as required by law, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by us or on our behalf.\n\nAdditional information about these and other factors can be found in the risk sections of this 2023 Annual Report, as may be updated by subsequent quarterly reports.\n\n33\n\n37\n\n42\n\n49\n\n53\n\n57\n\n57\n\n57\n\n58\n\n60\n\n60\n\n60\n\n63\n\n63\n\n65\n\n66\n\n71\n\n71\n\n81\n\n86\n\n| Key performance and non-GAAP   measures   |     |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----|\n| Personal & Commercial Banking             |     |\n| Wealth Management                         |     |\n| Insurance                                 |     |\n| Capital Markets                           |     |\n| Corporate Support                         |     |\n| Quarterly financial information           |     |\n| Fourth quarter performance                |     |\n| Quarterly results and trend analysis      |     |\n| Financial condition                       |     |\n| Condensed balance sheets                  |     |\n| Off-balance sheet arrangements            |     |\n| Risk management                           |     |\n| Top and emerging risks                    |     |\n| Overview                                  |     |\n| Enterprise risk management                |     |\n| Transactional/positional risk drivers     |     |\n| Credit risk                               |     |\n| Market risk                               |     |\n| Liquidity and funding risk                |     |\n| Insurance risk                            | 100 |",

Learn more at rbc.com.\n\nEffective the first quarter of 2023, we simplified our reporting structure by eliminating the Investor & Treasury Services segment and moving its former businesses to existing segments. We moved our Investor Services business to our Wealth Management segment, and our Treasury Services and Transaction Banking businesses to our Capital Markets segment. Effective the fourth quarter of 2023, we moved the Investor Services lending business from our Wealth Management segment to our Capital Markets segment. From a reporting perspective, there were no changes to our Personal & Commercial Banking and Insurance segments. Comparative results in this MD&A have been revised to conform to our new basis of segment presentation.\n\nOur business segments are described below.\n\n| Personal &   in Canada, the Caribbean and the U.S. Our commitment to building and maintaining deep and   meaningful relationships with our clients is underscored by the delivery of exceptional client   experiences, the breadth of our product suite, our depth of expertise, and the features of our   | Commercial Banking   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Wealth   offer a comprehensive suite of wealth, investment, trust, banking, credit and other advice-based   solutions.

If this information or these assumptions are not accurate, actual economic outcomes may differ materially from the outlook presented in this section.\n\n## Economic and market review and outlook\n\nGDP growth is slowing across most advanced economies as headwinds from higher interest rates continue to have a lagged impact. Unemployment rates remain low across most economies. However, they have begun to marginally increase in Canada and the United Kingdom (U.K.). The U.S. economy has remained resilient with strong GDP growth and a low unemployment rate. However, credit conditions continue to tighten, the number of job openings are signaling a decline in hiring demand and the excess of household savings accumulated during the pandemic has shrunk. U.S. GDP growth is expected to slow late in calendar 2023 with mild recessions expected in the first half of calendar 2024. Canadian GDP is expected to decline over the second half of calendar 2023 and grow slowly in early calendar 2024. Inflation is still high but has been slowing in most advanced economies. Interest rates have increased to levels that most central banks view as sufficient to slow economic growth and reduce inflationary pressures over time. We expect central banks will not increase policy interest rates further and expect a shift to reductions in interest rates from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and Bank of Canada (BoC) in the next calendar year. However, interest rates are expected to remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels.",

        "page_content": "## Canada\n\nCanadian GDP is expected to increase 1.0% in calendar 2023 following a 3.4% increase in calendar 2022. Output in early calendar 2023 was supported by strength in consumer spending and an unexpectedly strong rebound in housing market activity in the spring. However, GDP declined slightly in the second calendar quarter of 2023 as consumer spending slowed. An additional 50 basis points of interest rate increases from the BoC over June and July 2023 helped to slow housing markets over the summer. Per-capita GDP growth and consumer spending have been substantially softer, controlling for historically strong population growth. Labour market conditions have also more recently shown signs of weakening. The unemployment rate has increased by 0.7% since April and the number of job openings has continued to decline. Inflation growth rates have moderated from peak levels in calendar 2022 but remain above the top end of the BoC's 1% to 3% inflation target range. GDP is expected to continue to decline marginally over the second half of calendar 2023 before shifting back to a positive growth rate in calendar 2024. The unemployment rate is expected to rise above 6% in the first half of calendar 2024. The BoC has increased the overnight rate by 475 basis points since March 2022, and as interest rate increases continue to slow consumer spending, we do not anticipate additional increases. However, we do not expect a shift to interest rate decreases until the second half of calendar 2024.\n\n## U.S.\n\nU.S. GDP is expected to increase 2.4% in calendar 2023 following a 1.9% increase in calendar 2022. U.S. GDP growth has been exceptionally resilient in calendar 2023. Consumer spending has remained strong despite rising interest rates and employment has continued to increase at a solid pace. However, the unemployment rate increased to 3.9% in October, wage growth is showing signs of deceleration, and the number of job openings has declined. The Fed has increased the federal funds rate by 525 basis points since March 2022 and views the current level of interest rates as restrictive enough to slow GDP growth and inflationary pressures over time. We expect the Fed will hold the target range steady before shifting to interest rate decreases beginning in the second calendar quarter of 2024. We expect U.S. GDP growth softening in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023 followed by a marginal decline in the first half of calendar 2024.\n\n## Europe\n\nEuro area GDP is expected to rise by 0.4% in calendar 2023 following a 3.4% increase in calendar 2022. The Euro area economy is losing momentum. GDP declined 0.1% in the third calendar quarter of 2023 and we expect another 0.1% decline in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023. Labour markets remain exceptionally firm but are expected to soften alongside weaker GDP growth. Euro area inflation is still high but has begun to slow. The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to hold the deposit rate steady through calendar 2024 after a 25 basis point increase to 4% in September 2023. U.K. GDP is projected to rise by 0.4% in calendar 2023 after a 4.3% increase in calendar 2022. In the U.K., GDP held steady in the third calendar quarter of 2023 as the impact of the Bank of England's (BOE) 515 basis points of cumulative rate increases since December 2021 begin to slow consumer spending. Headline inflation remains elevated; however it is showing signs of moderating. The BOE is expected to hold the Bank Rate at 5.25% through to the end of calendar 2024.\n\n## Financial markets\n\nBond yields have increased substantially in calendar 2023 as markets demand higher term premiums and expect central banks to hold policy interest rates higher for longer. The spread between longer and shorter duration bond yields, which is a commonly used recession indicator, increased since the second calendar quarter of 2023 but remains well below zero, as markets continue to expect deterioration in economic growth. Equity markets have rebounded after declining earlier in the fall and are still above levels at the end of calendar 2022. Global inflation pressures have shown signs of easing. However, underlying price pressures are not expected to fully ease until there is a more pronounced slowdown in domestic demand and the economy.\n\n## Regulatory environment\n\nWe continue to monitor and prepare for regulatory developments and changes in a manner that seeks to ensure compliance with new requirements, while mitigating adverse business or financial impacts. Such impacts could result from new or amended laws or regulations and the expectations of those who enforce them. A high level summary of the key regulatory changes that have the potential to increase or decrease our costs and the complexity of our operations is included in the Legal and regulatory environment risk section of this 2023 Annual Report.\n\nFor a discussion on risk factors resulting from these and other developments which may affect our business and financial results, refer to the risk sections of this 2023 Annual Report. For further details on our framework and activities to manage risks, refer to the risk and Capital management sections of this 2023 Annual Report.\n\n## Key corporate events\n\n## HSBC Bank Canada\n\nOn November 29, 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the common shares of HSBC Bank Canada (HSBC Canada) for an all-cash purchase price of $13.5 billion. HSBC Canada is a premier Canadian personal and commercial bank focused on globally connected clients. We will also purchase all of the existing preferred shares and subordinated debt of HSBC Canada held directly or indirectly by HSBC Holdings plc at par value.\n\nThe agreement includes a locked box mechanism under which HSBC Canada's earnings from June 30, 2022 to the closing date accrue to RBC and will be reflected in the acquired net assets on closing. Relatedly, we will pay an additional amount that accrues from August 30, 2023 to the closing date, which is calculated based on the all-cash purchase price for the common shares of HSBC Canada and the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the first calendar quarter of 2024 and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. For further details, refer to Note 6 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## RBC Investor Services\n\nOn July 3, 2023, we completed the previously announced sale of the European asset servicing activities of RBC Investor Services \u00ae and its associated Malaysian centre of excellence (the partial sale of RBC Investor Services operations) to CACEIS, the asset",

As a result of the transaction, we recorded a pre-tax gain on disposal of $69 million in Non-Interest income within the Wealth Management segment ($77 million after-tax).\n\nThe completion of the sale of the business of the U.K. branch of RBC Investor Services Trust and the RBC Investor Services business in Jersey remains subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. For further details, refer to Note 6 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Defining and measuring success through total shareholder returns\n\nOur focus is to maximize total shareholder returns (TSR) through the achievement of top half performance compared to our global peer group over the medium-term (3-5 years), which we believe reflects a longer-term view of strong and consistent financial performance.\n\nMaximizing TSR is aligned with our three strategic goals discussed earlier and we believe represents the most appropriate measure of shareholder value creation. TSR is a concept used to compare the performance of our common shares over a period of time, reflecting share price appreciation and dividends paid to common shareholders. The absolute size of TSR will vary depending on market conditions, and the bank's position reflects the market's perception of our overall performance relative to our peers over a period of time.\n\nFinancial performance objectives are used to measure our performance against our medium-term TSR objectives and are used as goals as we execute against our strategic priorities. We review and revise these financial performance objectives as economic, market and regulatory environments change.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of our 3-year and 5-year performance against our medium-term financial performance objectives:\n\n| Financial performance compared to our medium-term objectives   Medium-term objectives  (1)   | 3-year  (2)   | Table 2    5-year  (2)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|\n| Diluted EPS growth of 7% +                                                                   | 10%           | 5%                       |\n| ROE of 16% +                                                                                 | 16.4%         | 16.0%                    |\n| Strong capital ratio (CET1) (3)                                                              | 13.6%         | 13.1%                    |\n| Dividend payout ratio 40% - 50%                                                              | 45%           | 47%                      |\n\nOur 3-year and 5-year medium-term financial performance objectives will remain unchanged in fiscal 2024.\n\nWe compare our TSR to that of a global peer group approved by our Board of Directors (the Board). The global peer group consists of the following 9 financial institutions:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Canadian financial institutions: Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Manulife Financial Corporation, National Bank of Canada, The Bank of Nova Scotia, and Toronto-Dominion Bank.\n- GLYPH<129> U.S. banks: JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Company.\n- GLYPH<129> International banks: Westpac Banking Corporation.\n\n| Medium-term objectives - 3- and 5-year TSR vs. peer group average   | 3-year TSR (1)    | Table 3    5-year TSR (1)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Royal Bank of Canada                                                | 10%               | 7%                          |\n| Peer group average (excluding RBC)                                  | Bottom half   14% | Top half   5%               |\n\n| Common share and dividend information   For the year ended October 31   | 2023     | 2022   | 2021                    | 2020    | Table 4    2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|-------------------------|---------|-------------------|\n| Common share price (RY on TSX) - close, end of period                   | $ 110.76 |        | $ 126.05   $ 128.82   $ |         | 93.16   $ 106.24  |\n| Dividends paid per share                                                | 5.34     | 4.96   | 4.32                    | 4.26    | 4.00              |\n| Increase (decrease) in share price                                      | (12.1)%  | (2.2)% | 38.3%                   | (12.3)% | 10.8%             |\n| Total shareholder return                                                | (8.3)%   | 1.6%   | 43.8%                   | (8.4)%  | 15.2%             |\n\n## Financial performance\n\n## Overview\n\n## 2023 vs. 2022\n\nNet income of $14,866 million was down $941 million or 6% from last year.

        "page_content": "Our earnings were down from last year, primarily driven by the impact of the CRD and other tax related adjustments in the current year, which is reported in Corporate Support. Our results also reflect lower earnings in Wealth Management, Personal & Commercial Banking and Insurance. This was partially offset by higher results in Capital Markets. Results in the current year reflect higher PCL, mainly driven by higher provisions on impaired loans and provisions taken on performing loans as compared to releases of provisions on performing loans last year.\n\nFor further details on our business segment results and CET1 ratio, refer to the Business segment results and Capital management sections, respectively.\n\n## Adjusted results\n\nAdjusted results exclude specified items, consisting of impairment losses on our interest in an associated company, certain deferred tax adjustments, the CRD and other tax related adjustments and HSBC Canada transaction and integration costs (net of tax), as well as the after-tax impact of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Adjusted results are non-GAAP measures.

        "page_content": "## 2023 vs. 2022\n\nTotal revenue increased $7,144 million or 15% from last year, mainly due to higher net interest income, Insurance premiums, investment and fee income (insurance revenue), and trading revenue. Higher investment management and custodial fees, other revenue and foreign exchange revenue, other than trading also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by income (loss) from joint ventures and associates and lower mutual fund revenue. The impact of foreign exchange translation increased revenue by $936 million.\n\nNet interest income increased $2,412 million or 11%, largely due to higher spreads in Canadian Banking and Wealth Management and average volume growth in Canadian Banking. These factors were partially offset by lower revenue from non-trading derivatives, which was offset in Other revenue, and lower fixed income trading revenue, both in Capital Markets.\n\nNIM was up 2 bps, mainly due to the impact of the higher interest rate environment in Canadian Banking and Wealth Management, partially offset by an unfavourable shift in deposit mix within Canadian Banking and higher funding costs in Capital Markets.\n\nInsurance revenue increased $2,165 million or 62%, primarily reflecting the change in fair value of investments backing policyholder liabilities, higher group annuity sales, and business growth across most products, all of which are largely offset in PBCAE.\n\nInvestment management and custodial fees increased $734 million or 10%, mainly reflecting the inclusion of RBC Brewin Dolphin.\n\nTrading revenue increased $1,466 million, mainly due to higher fixed income trading revenue across all regions. The prior year also included the impact of loan underwriting markdowns.\n\nForeign exchange revenue, other than trading increased $254 million or 24%, primarily driven by foreign currency translation gains associated with certain foreign currency denominated funding, which was offset by the impact of economic hedges in Other revenue.\n\nMutual fund revenue decreased $226 million or 5%, largely due to lower average fee-based client assets, largely driven by unfavourable market conditions in Wealth Management, and lower average mutual fund balances driving lower distribution fees in Canadian Banking.\n\nIncome (loss) from joint ventures and associates decreased $329 million, mainly attributable to impairment losses on our interest in an associated company in Wealth Management.\n\nOther revenue increased $452 million or 88%, mainly attributable to gains from our non-trading portfolios, which were offset in Net interest income, and changes in the fair value of the hedges related to our U.S. share-based compensation plans, which was largely offset in Non-interest expense. Higher revenue from sweep deposits and a favourable impact from tax-related items also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by the impact of economic hedges.\n\n## Additional trading information\n\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)   | 2023    | Table 8    2022   |\n|----------------------------------|---------|-------------------|\n| Net interest income (1)          | $ 1,510 | $ 2,024           |\n| Non-interest income              | 2,392   | 926               |\n| Total trading revenue            | $ 3,902 | $ 2,950           |\n| Total trading revenue by product |         |                   |\n| Interest rate and credit         | $ 2,528 | $ 1,147           |\n| Equities                         | 604     | 951               |\n| Foreign exchange and commodities | 770     | 852               |\n| Total trading revenue            | $ 3,902 | $ 2,950           |\n\n## 2023 vs. 2022\n\nTotal trading revenue of $3,902 million, which is comprised of trading-related revenue recorded in Net interest income and Non-interest income, increased $952 million or 32% from last year, mainly due to higher fixed income trading revenue across all regions.

We provide services that are administrative in nature, including safekeeping, collecting investment income, settling purchase and sale transactions, and record keeping. Underlying investment strategies within AUA are determined by our clients and generally do not impact the administrative fees that we receive. Administrative fees can be impacted by factors such as asset valuation level changes from market movements, types of services administered, transaction volumes, geography and client relationship pricing based on volumes or multiple services.\n\nOur Wealth Management business is the primary business segment that has AUA with approximately 92% of total AUA, mainly in the Investor Services line of business with approximately 57% of AUA, as at October 31, 2023. The Personal & Commercial Banking business has approximately 8% of total AUA.\n\n## 2023 vs. 2022\n\nAUA decreased $1,316 billion or 23% from last year, mainly due to the partial sale of RBC Investor Services operations, partially offset by the favourable impact of market appreciation.\n\nThe following table summarizes AUA by geography and asset class:\n\n| AUA by geographic mix and asset class   (Millions of Canadian dollars)   | 2023        | Table 12    2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------|\n| Canada  (1)                                                              |             |                    |\n| Money market                                                             | $ 34,900    | $ 43,200           |\n| Fixed income                                                             | 705,800     | 735,800            |\n| Equity                                                                   | 770,500     | 734,000            |\n| Multi-asset and other                                                    | 1,045,800   | 1,006,300          |\n| Total Canada                                                             | 2,557,000   | 2,519,300          |\n| U.S.  (1)                                                                |             |                    |\n| Money market                                                             | 31,600      | 40,700             |\n| Fixed income                                                             | 131,600     | 116,000            |\n| Equity                                                                   | 271,600     | 246,300            |\n| Multi-asset and other                                                    | 326,500     | 304,300            |\n| Total U.S.                                                               | 761,300     | 707,300            |\n| Other International  (1)                                                 |             |                    |\n| Money market                                                             | 19,100      | 38,200             |\n| Fixed income (2)                                                         | 130,000     | 255,200            |\n| Equity                                                                   | 404,100     | 636,600            |\n| Multi-asset and other (2)                                                | 466,500     | 1,497,000          |\n| Total International  (2)                                                 | 1,019,700   | 2,427,000          |\n| Total AUA  (2)                                                           | $ 4,338,000 | $ 5,653,600        |\n\n## Assets under management\n\nAUM are assets managed by us which are beneficially owned by our clients. Management fees are paid by the investment funds and other clients for the investment capabilities of an investment manager and can also cover administrative services. Management fees may be calculated daily, monthly or quarterly as a percentage of the AUM, depending on the distribution channel, product and investment strategies. In general, equity strategies carry a higher fee rate than fixed income or money market strategies. Fees are also impacted by asset mix and relationship pricing for clients using multiple services. Higher risk assets generally produce higher fees, while clients using multiple services can take advantage of synergies which reduce the fees they are charged. Certain funds may have performance fee arrangements where fees are recorded when certain benchmarks or performance targets are achieved. These factors could lead to differences in fees earned by product and therefore net return by asset class may vary despite similar average AUM. Our Wealth Management segment is the primary business segment that has AUM with approximately 99% of total AUM as at October 31, 2023.\n\n## 2023 vs. 2022\n\nAUM increased $68 billion or 7% from last year, mainly due to the impact of market appreciation and net sales.",

This approach is intended to ensure that our business segments' results include all applicable revenue and expenses associated with the conduct of their business and depicts how management views those results.\n\n## Key methodologies\n\nThe following outlines the key methodologies and assumptions used in our management reporting framework. These are periodically reviewed by management to ensure they remain valid. Effective the first quarter of 2023, we simplified our reporting structure by eliminating the Investor & Treasury Services segment and moving its former businesses to existing segments. Effective the fourth quarter of 2023, we moved the Investor Services lending business from our Wealth Management segment to our Capital Markets segment. For further details, refer to the About Royal Bank of Canada section.\n\n## Expense and tax allocation\n\nTo ensure that our business segments' results include expenses associated with the conduct of their business, we allocate costs incurred or services provided by Technology & Operations and Functions, which are directly undertaken or provided on the business segments' behalf. For other costs not directly attributable to our business segments, including overhead costs and other indirect expenses, we use our management reporting framework for allocating these costs to each business segment in a manner that is intended to reflect the underlying benefits.",

        "page_content": "## Capital attribution\n\nOur management reporting framework also determines the attribution of capital to our business segments in a manner that is intended to consistently measure and align economic costs with the underlying benefits and risks associated with the activities of each business segment. The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as attributed capital. Unattributed capital and associated amounts are reported in Corporate Support. For further information, refer to the Capital management section.\n\n## Funds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing refers to the pricing of intra-company borrowing or lending for management reporting purposes. We employ a funds transfer pricing process to enable risk-adjusted management reporting of segment results. This process determines the costs and revenue for intra-company borrowing and lending of funds after taking into consideration our interest rate risk and liquidity risk management objectives, as well as applicable regulatory requirements.\n\n## Provisions for credit losses\n\nPCL is recorded to recognize expected credit losses on all financial assets, except for financial assets classified or designated as FVTPL and equity securities designated as FVOCI, which are not subject to impairment assessment. For details on our accounting policy on Allowance for credit losses (ACL), refer to Note 2 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nPCL is included in the results of each business segment to fully reflect the appropriate expenses related to the conduct of each business segment.\n\nIn addition to the key methodologies described above, the following components of our management reporting framework also impact how our business segments are managed and reported:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Wealth Management results include disclosure in U.S. dollars, primarily for U.S. Wealth Management (including City National) as we review and manage the results of this business largely in this currency.\n- GLYPH<129> Capital Markets results are reported on a teb basis, which grosses up total revenue from certain tax-advantaged sources (Canadian taxable corporate dividends and the U.S. tax credit investment business) to their effective taxable equivalent value with a corresponding offset recorded in the provision for income taxes. We record the elimination of the teb adjustments in Corporate Support. We believe these adjustments are useful and reflect how Capital Markets manages its business, since it enhances the comparability of revenue and related ratios across taxable revenue and our principal tax-advantaged sources of revenue. The use of teb adjustments and measures may not be comparable to similar GAAP measures or similarly adjusted amounts disclosed by other financial institutions.\n- GLYPH<129> Corporate Support results include all enterprise level activities that are undertaken for the benefit of the organization that are not allocated to our four business segments, such as certain treasury and liquidity management activities, including amounts associated with unattributed capital, and consolidation adjustments, including the elimination of the teb gross-up amounts. In addition, we record gains (losses) on economic hedges of our U.S. Wealth Management (including City National) share-based compensation plans, which are reflected in revenue, and related variability in share-based compensation expense driven by changes in the fair value of liabilities relating to these plans in Corporate Support as we believe this presentation more closely aligns with how we view business performance and manage the underlying risks.\n\n## Key performance and non-GAAP measures\n\n## Performance measures\n\nWe measure and evaluate the performance of our consolidated operations and each business segment using a number of financial metrics, such as net income and ROE. Certain financial metrics, including ROE, do not have a standardized meaning under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other financial institutions.\n\n## Return on common equity\n\nWe use ROE, at both the consolidated and business segment levels, as a measure of return on total capital invested in our business. Management views the business segment ROE measure as a useful measure for supporting investment and resource allocation decisions because it adjusts for certain items that may affect comparability between business segments and certain competitors.\n\nOur consolidated ROE calculation is based on net income available to common shareholders divided by total average common equity for the period. Business segment ROE calculations are based on net income available to common shareholders divided by average attributed capital for the period. For each segment, average attributed capital includes the capital required to underpin various risks as described in the Capital management section and amounts invested in goodwill and intangibles.\n\nThe attribution of capital involves the use of assumptions, judgments and methodologies that are regularly reviewed and revised by management as deemed necessary. Changes to such assumptions, judgments and methodologies can have a material effect on the business segment ROE information that we report. Other companies that disclose information on similar attributions and related return measures may use different assumptions, judgments and methodologies.",

These measures enhance the comparability of our financial performance for the year ended October 31, 2023 with the results from last year. Non-GAAP measures do not have a standardized meaning under GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other financial institutions.\n\nThe following discussion describes the non-GAAP measures we use in evaluating our operating results.\n\n## Adjusted results\n\nWe believe that providing adjusted results and certain measures excluding the impact of the specified items discussed below and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles enhance comparability with prior periods and enables readers to better assess trends in the underlying businesses. Specified items impacting our results for the current year are:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Impairment losses: reflects impairment losses on our interest in an associated company in the fourth quarter of 2023. For further details, refer to Note 12 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- GLYPH<129> Certain deferred tax adjustments: reflects the recognition of deferred tax assets relating to realized losses in City National associated with the intercompany sale of certain debt securities in the fourth quarter of 2023\n- GLYPH<129> CRD and other tax related adjustments: reflects the impact of the CRD and the 1.5% increase in the Canadian corporate tax rate applicable to fiscal 2022, net of deferred tax adjustments, which were announced in the Government of Canada's 2022 budget and enacted in the first quarter of 2023\n- GLYPH<129> Transaction and integration costs relating to our planned acquisition of HSBC Canada\n\n## Adjusted efficiency ratio\n\nThe adjusted efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP ratio and is calculated based on adjusted Non-interest expenses excluding specified items and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles divided by total revenue excluding specified items and net of PBCAE, both of which are non-GAAP measures. We believe that the adjusted efficiency ratio is a useful measure as the change in fair value of investments backing policyholder liabilities can lead to volatility in revenue, which is largely offset within PBCAE, that could obscure trends in underlying business performance and reduce comparability with prior periods.",

We are focused on building deep and meaningful relationships with our clients, underscored by the delivery of exceptional client experiences, the breadth of our product suite, our depth of expertise, and the features of our digital solutions.\n\n## ~15 million\n\n## #1 or #2\n\n38,027\n\nNumber of Canadian Banking clients\n\n## Revenue by business lines\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 68%  Personal Banking\n- 27%  Business  Banking\n- 5%  Caribbean and U.S. Banking\n\n## 2023 Operating environment\n\n- \u203a In response to persistent inflation, the BoC continued tightening its monetary policy, raising the benchmark interest rate by 125 basis points in fiscal 2023; and by 475 basis points since the beginning of March 2022. As a result of these interest rate increases, we continued to see NIM expansion. The combination of higher NIM and solid volumes drove strong growth in net interest income.\n- \u203a The credit environment was impacted by slowing economic growth and rising interest rates, resulting in higher provisions on performing and impaired loans.\n- \u203a For Canadian Banking, non-interest expense reflects investments in staff, mainly increased average FTE, marketing costs and ongoing investments in technology.\n- \u203a Our results were also impacted by a higher effective tax rate reflecting the 1.5% increase in the Canadian corporate tax rate, which was implemented at the beginning of the fiscal year.\n- \u203a As a result of interest rate increases, housing activity has slowed and household debt servicing costs have increased, driving a decline in mortgage originations from prior year levels.\n- \u203a We experienced significant growth in term deposit products, reflecting client preference for low-risk products at higher yields, driven by the BoC's monetary policy. Despite this, volumes for personal and business demand deposits remained above pre-pandemic levels.\n- \u203a We continued to see unfavourable market conditions in fiscal 2023, driving lower sales of mutual fund products, which was also impacted by the client preference shift to term deposit products. We also continued to see a declining trend in overall trade volume activity in our Direct Investing business.\n- \u203a Growth in cards volume was strong in fiscal 2023, reflecting strong acquisition levels. Purchase volumes were stable and reflect an environment where clients are increasingly mindful of their spending habits.\n- \u203a Clients are increasingly demonstrating a preference for digital offerings, and we continue to invest in digital solutions to improve the client experience and deliver personalized advice.\n- \u203a Our Caribbean Banking business was favourably impacted by increases in interest rates, driving strong net interest income growth. As well, we saw higher fee-based income, reflecting higher client activity driven by the recovery of the travel industry since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- \u203a In the U.S., higher interest rates had a favourable impact on net interest income.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRanking in market share for all key retail and business products\n\nEmployees\n\nWe operate through two businesses - Canadian Banking and Caribbean & U.S. Banking. Canadian Banking serves our home market in Canada. We have the largest branch network, the most ATMs, and one of the largest mobile sales forces across Canada along with market-leading digital capabilities. In Caribbean & U.S. Banking, we offer a broad range of financial products and services in targeted markets.\n\nIn Canada, we compete with other Schedule 1 banks, independent trust companies, foreign banks, credit unions, caisses populaires, auto financing companies, as well as emerging entrants to the financial services industry.\n\nIn the Caribbean, our competition includes banks, emerging digital banks, trust companies and investment management companies serving retail and corporate clients, as well as public institutions. In the U.S., we compete primarily with other Canadian banking institutions that have U.S. operations.",

The Canadian unemployment rate is still low but has increased 0.7% since April. Canadian GDP growth has slowed significantly to-date in calendar 2023. The Canadian housing market has cooled after an unexpected strong rebound in the spring following an additional 50 basis points of interest rate increases from the BoC over the summer. The U.S. economy has remained exceptionally resilient. However, excess pandemic savings and excess job openings have been declining, the global growth backdrop is softening, credit conditions continue to tighten, and inflation growth has slowed. We do not expect further interest rate increases from the Fed or the BoC with economic growth and inflation pressures expected to soften. We expect the Fed to shift to interest rate decreases beginning in the second calendar quarter of 2024, with the BoC following with the first cuts to the overnight rate expected in the second half of calendar 2024. In response to this economic environment, we will continue to pursue industry-leading growth and deepen client relationships to meet the evolving needs of our clients.\n\nThe Caribbean region maintained its growth momentum during 2023, supported by tourism-related travel. Real GDP is projected to continue to expand in 2024, but at a more normalized rate as economic recovery matures. Regionally, inflation rates decelerated during 2023 and are forecasted to normalize through 2024. Risks to the regional outlook remain tilted to the downside as the spillover effects of global risks could weigh on growth prospects. In addition, the threat of weather-induced shocks, particularly hurricanes also pose a risk to the Caribbean's economic outlook. Our Investing for Growth strategy continues, with a refreshed focus on delivering exceptional client value, enhancing operational efficiency and resilience, and developing engaged and empowered teams.",

These factors were partially offset by higher net interest income.\n\nTotal revenue increased $1,977 million or 10%, primarily due to higher net interest income, reflecting higher spreads and average volume growth of 8% in deposits and 7% in loans in Canadian Banking.\n\nNIM increased 19 bps, mainly due to the impact of the higher interest rate environment, partially offset by an unfavourable shift in deposit mix.\n\nPCL increased $1,116 million, mainly reflecting provisions taken on performing loans this year, largely in our Canadian Banking portfolios, primarily driven by unfavourable changes in credit quality and portfolio growth as compared to releases last year which reflected reduced uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher provisions on impaired loans, primarily in our Canadian Banking retail portfolios, also contributed to the increase, resulting in an increase of 7 bps in the PCL on impaired loans ratio.\n\nNon-interest expense increased $778 million or 9%, mainly attributable to higher staff-related costs and higher marketing costs.\n\nAverage loans and acceptances increased $40 billion or 7%, mainly driven by mortgage and business banking loan growth, reflecting client activity.\n\nAverage deposits increased $45 billion or 8%, largely reflecting an increase in term deposits, partially offset by a decline in demand deposits.\n\n## Business line review\n\nIn Canada, we operate through two business lines: Personal Banking and Business Banking.",

Higher PCL and the impact of the specified item relating to impairment losses on our interest in an associated company also contributed to the decrease. These factors were partially offset by higher net interest income driven by higher interest rates. Adjusted net income decreased $606 million or 19%.\n\nTotal revenue increased $1,301 million or 8%, primarily due to the inclusion of RBC Brewin Dolphin, higher net interest income driven by higher interest rates partially offset by lower deposits, as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation. These factors were partially offset by the impact of the specified item relating to impairment losses on our interest in an associated company. Adjusted total revenue increased $1,543 million or 9%.\n\nPCL increased $295 million, primarily in U.S. Wealth Management (including City National), mainly reflecting higher provisions on impaired loans largely in the real estate and related and telecom and media sectors resulting in a 14 bps increase in the PCL on impaired loans ratio. Higher provisions on performing loans, primarily reflecting unfavourable changes to our macroeconomic forecast and credit quality, also contributed to the increase.\n\nNon-interest expense increased $2,113 million or 18%, mainly due to the inclusion of RBC Brewin Dolphin and related costs. Higher staff costs and professional fees, largely reflecting continued investments in the operational infrastructure of City National, as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation also contributed to the increase.\n\nAUA decreased $1,313 billion or 25%, primarily in the Investor Services line of business reflecting the partial sale of RBC Investor Services operations. This was partially offset by AUA growth in other Wealth Management lines of business, mainly due to the impact of market appreciation and foreign exchange translation as well as net sales.\n\nAUM increased $67 billion or 7%, primarily due to the impact of market appreciation. Net sales and the impact of foreign exchange translation also contributed to the increase.\n\nFor further details on specified items, including a reconciliation, refer to the Key performance and non-GAAP measures section.\n\n## Business line review\n\n## Canadian Wealth Management\n\nCanadian Wealth Management includes our full-service Canadian wealth advisory business, which is the largest in Canada as measured by AUA, with over 2,000 investment advisors providing comprehensive financial solutions with a focus on HNW and UHNW clients.

We provide a broad range of investment management services through mutual, pooled and private funds, fee-based accounts and separately managed portfolios. We distribute our investment solutions through a broad network of bank branches, our self-directed and full-service wealth advisory businesses, independent third-party advisors and private banks, and directly to individual clients. We also provide investment solutions directly to institutional clients, including pension plans, insurance companies, corporations, endowments and foundations.\n\nWe are the largest retail fund company in Canada measured by AUM, as well as a leading institutional asset manager. We face competition in Canada from banks, insurance companies and asset management organizations. The Canadian fund management industry is large and mature, but remains a relatively fragmented industry.\n\nIn the U.S., our asset management business offers investment management solutions and services, primarily to institutional investors, and competes with independent asset management firms, as well as those that are part of national and international banks and insurance companies.\n\nInternationally, through our global capabilities distributed under the brand RBC BlueBay Asset Management, we offer investment management solutions for institutions and, through private banks including RBC Wealth Management \u00ae , to HNW and UHNW investors. We face competition from asset managers that are owned by international banks, as well as national and regional asset managers in the geographies where we serve clients.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nRevenue decreased $41 million or 2% from last year, mainly due to lower average fee-based client assets, largely driven by unfavourable market conditions. This was partially offset by changes in the fair value of seed capital investments.\n\n| Selected highlights                                               | Table 28   | Table 28   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)                                    | 2023       | 2022       |\n| Total revenue                                                     | $ 2,626    | $ 2,667    |\n| Other information                                                 |            |            |\n| Canadian net long-term mutual   fund sales (redemptions) (1)      | (11,367)   | (5,246)    |\n| Canadian net money market   mutual fund sales   (redemptions) (1) | 1,121      | (127)      |\n| AUM (2)                                                           | 541,300    | 522,700    |\n| Average AUM                                                       | 550,700    | 562,200    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Average AUA and AUM (Millions of U.S. dollars)\n\n<!-- image -->",

As Canadians focus more attention on having a seamless experience transitioning between a digital interface and advisors, we will remain focused on further strengthening our client-led advice and solutions and leveraging technology and data to provide a seamless client experience. We will seek to maintain our strength by investing in operational improvements, enhancing the omnichannel client experience, and focusing on sustainable growth. This will enable achievement of our goal of being an innovative, clientfocused provider of a full suite of insurance solutions and should allow us to thrive in a rapidly changing environment.\n\nFor further details on our general economic review and outlook, refer to the Economic, market and regulatory review and outlook section.",

We also offer property & casualty insurance through a distribution agreement with Aviva Canada. Our life and health portfolio includes participating whole life, term life, critical illness, disability, and group benefits, including long-term disability, and health and dental insurance. Wealth solutions include a family of segregated funds as well as individual annuities. Our travel products include out-of-province/country medical coverage, and trip cancellation and interruption insurance.\n\nOur group annuities business helps defined benefit pension plan sponsors better manage and control risk. RBC Insurance \u00ae has a set of strategies and initiatives aimed at building our momentum and positioning us for growth in this product line, where companies are increasingly looking to transfer the risks associated with their pension obligations to insurance companies either through group annuity contracts or longevity swap products.\n\nIn Canada, many of our competitors specialize in either life and health, wealth, or in property and casualty products. As a multi-line carrier, we offer a broad suite of solutions, increasing convenience for our clients. Many of our solutions hold market leadership positions, including our disability insurance, term life, and group annuity products.",

Amidst these market dynamics, we expect Global Investment Banking fee pools to return to historical levels with some moderation in Global Markets industry revenue pools. We will continue to pursue market share growth in both our Corporate & Investment Banking and Global Markets businesses. In Investment Banking, we will continue to focus on targeted sectors and investment in talent, with an emphasis on advisory products. In Global Markets, our focus remains on delivering robust results through continued resource optimization, acceleration of cross-selling activities, further deployment of electronic and digital capabilities, and building on our strong risk management practices. In Corporate Banking, following higher levels of balance sheet deployment in support of client financing demands in fiscal 2023, we will continue to pursue a disciplined growth approach to deepen relationships with lending clients to drive growth in our non-lending businesses. This strategy will continue to be underpinned by strong credit risk management practices, optimization of our financial resources and supporting our clients in the execution of their strategies.\n\nFor further details on our general economic review and outlook, refer to the Economic, market and regulatory review and outlook section.",

These factors were partially offset by higher PCL, higher compensation and ongoing technology investments.\n\nTotal revenue increased $1,102 million or 11%, mainly due to higher fixed income trading across all regions. The prior year also included the impact of loan underwriting markdowns. The impact of foreign exchange translation also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by lower equity trading revenue across all regions.\n\nPCL was $561 million compared to $(13) million last year, mainly reflecting higher provisions on impaired loans across most sectors, resulting in a 29 bps increase in the PCL on impaired loans ratio. Provisions taken on performing loans in the current year driven by unfavourable changes to our macroeconomic forecast and credit quality outlook also contributed to the increase.\n\nNon-interest expense increased $693 million or 12%, mainly due to higher compensation on increased results, the impact of foreign exchange translation and ongoing technology investments.",

Diluted EPS of $2.90 was up $0.16 and ROE of 15.2% was down 40 bps. Our CET1 ratio of 14.5% was up 190 bps from a year ago. Our earnings were up primarily due to a specified item relating to certain deferred tax adjustments, as well as a favourable impact from tax-related items, which are both reported in Corporate Support. Higher earnings in Capital Markets and Insurance also contributed to the increased results, which were partially offset by lower earnings in Wealth Management and Personal & Commercial Banking.",

        "page_content": "Total revenue increased $459 million or 4%, largely due to higher average fee-based client assets reflecting net sales and the inclusion of RBC Brewin Dolphin and higher spreads and average volume growth in Canadian Banking. A favourable impact from tax-related items also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by the impact of economic hedges, impairment losses on our interest in an associated company in Wealth Management, and lower equity trading revenue in Capital Markets.\n\nTotal PCL of $720 million increased $339 million or 89%, primarily reflecting higher provisions in Personal & Commercial Banking and Capital Markets. The PCL on loans ratio of 34 bps increased 16 bps.\n\nPBCAE decreased $24 million or 21%, primarily reflecting the change in fair value of investments backing policyholder liabilities, improved claims experience and benefits from favourable reinsurance contract renegotiations. These factors were partially offset by lower favourable investment-related experience, business growth including group annuity sales and lower favourable annual actuarial assumption updates.\n\nNon-interest expense increased $934 million or 13%, mainly attributable to higher staff costs, including severance, transaction and integration costs relating to the planned acquisition of HSBC Canada and the impact of legal provisions in our Wealth Management segment. The inclusion of RBC Brewin Dolphin and related costs and higher professional fees, largely reflecting continued investments in the operational infrastructure of City National, also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by reduced expenses following the partial sale of RBC Investor Services operations.\n\nIncome tax expense decreased $1,039 million, primarily due to the impact of a specified item relating to certain deferred tax adjustments, changes in earnings mix and lower income before income taxes. The effective income tax rate of (1.5)% decreased 21.6% from last year, primarily due to the impact of certain deferred tax adjustments as noted above and changes in earnings mix.\n\n## Q4 2023 vs. Q3 2023\n\nNet income of $4,131 million was up $259 million or 7% compared to last quarter, primarily due to a specified item relating to certain deferred tax adjustments, as well as a favourable impact from tax-related items, both in Corporate Support. These factors were partially offset by a specified item relating to impairment losses on our interest in an associated company, as well as the impact of legal provisions, both in Wealth Management.\n\n## Quarterly results and trend analysis\n\nOur quarterly results are impacted by a number of trends and recurring factors, which include seasonality of certain businesses, general economic and market conditions, and fluctuations in the Canadian dollar relative to other currencies.

        "page_content": "## Seasonality\n\nSeasonal factors may impact our results in certain quarters. The first quarter has historically been stronger for our Capital Markets businesses. The second quarter has fewer days than the other quarters, which generally results in a decrease in net interest income and certain expense items. The third and fourth quarters include the summer months which generally results in lower client activity and may negatively impact the results of our Capital Markets trading business.\n\n## Trend analysis\n\nEarnings over the period have been impacted by the factors noted below.\n\nPersonal & Commercial Banking revenue has benefitted from solid volume growth in loans and deposits over the period. NIM has been favourably impacted over the majority of the period by the higher interest rate environment. NIM has been adversely impacted by a shift in deposit mix in fiscal 2023.\n\nWealth Management revenue has generally benefitted from growth in average fee-based client assets, which was impacted by market conditions, and volume growth in loans over the period. The higher interest rate environment also favourably impacted revenue over the majority of the period. The revenue of RBC Brewin Dolphin has been included since the acquisition closed on September 27, 2022. On July 3, 2023, we completed the sale of the European asset servicing activities of RBC Investor Services and its associated Malaysian centre of excellence. The fourth quarter of 2023 reflected impairment losses on our interest in an associated company.\n\nInsurance revenue has fluctuated over the period, primarily due to the impact of changes in the fair value of investments backing policyholder liabilities as well as the timing of group annuity sales, both of which are largely offset in PBCAE. Group annuity sales can vary significantly by quarter and are generally higher in the first half of the fiscal year.\n\nCapital Markets revenue is influenced, to a large extent, by market conditions that impact client activity. In the second half of fiscal 2022, there was a decline in global investment banking fee pools amidst challenging market conditions, including the impact of loan underwriting markdowns in the third quarter. In 2023, we saw strong client activity, driving higher sales & trading revenues particularly in the first quarter.\n\nPCL is comprised of provisions taken on performing assets and provisions taken on impaired assets. PCL on performing assets fluctuated over the period as it is impacted by changes in credit quality, macroeconomic conditions, and exposures. Throughout the first half of 2022, we saw improvements in our macroeconomic forecast and credit quality outlook, as the economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic eased in most regions, resulting in releases of provisions on performing assets. We have seen provisions on performing assets over the remainder of the period generally reflecting unfavourable changes in credit quality and our macroeconomic forecast. PCL on impaired assets was low during the early part of the period, but has trended upwards over the remainder of the period.\n\nPBCAE has fluctuated over the period reflecting changes in the fair value of investments backing policyholder liabilities, which is impacted by changes in market conditions, as well as group annuity sales, both of which are largely offset in revenue. PBCAE has also fluctuated due to the impact of investment-related experience and claims costs over the period. Actuarial adjustments, which generally occur in the fourth quarter of each year, also impact PBCAE.\n\nNon-interest expense has been impacted by fluctuations in variable compensation over the period, commensurate with fluctuations in revenue and earnings. Changes in the fair value of our U.S. share-based compensation plans, which are largely offset in revenue, have also contributed to fluctuations over the period and are impacted by market conditions. While we continue to focus on efficiency management activities, expenses over the period also reflect investments in staff and technology. Non-interest expenses of RBC Brewin Dolphin have been included since the acquisition closed on September 27, 2022. Beginning in fiscal 2023, expenses have also included transaction and integration costs relating to the planned acquisition of HSBC Canada.\n\nOur effective income tax rate has fluctuated over the period, mostly due to varying levels of tax adjustments and changes in earnings mix. The second and fourth quarters of 2022 reflected the impact of net favourable tax adjustments and an increase in income from lower tax rate jurisdictions, respectively. The first quarter of 2023 reflects the impact of the CRD and other tax related adjustments. The fourth quarter of 2023 reflects the recognition of deferred tax assets relating to realized losses in City National associated with the intercompany sale of certain debt securities.",

Foreign exchange translation increased total assets by $14 billion. Cash and due from banks was down $10 billion or 14%, mainly due to lower deposits with central banks, reflecting our shortterm cash management activities.\n\nInterest-bearing deposits with banks decreased $37 billion or 34%, largely due to the impact of the partial sale of RBC Investor Services operations. For further details, refer to Note 6 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. Lower deposits with central banks also contributed to the decrease, reflecting our cash and liquidity management activities.\n\nSecurities, net of applicable allowance, were up $92 billion or 29%, largely due to higher government debt securities mainly reflecting cash management activities and business activities. Higher equity trading and corporate debt securities also contributed to the increase.\n\nAssets purchased under reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos) and securities borrowed increased $22 billion or 7%, largely due to increased client demand. The impact of foreign exchange translation also contributed to the increase.\n\nLoans (net of Allowance for loan losses) were up $33 billion or 4%, largely due to volume growth in residential mortgages\n\nand wholesale loans. The impact of foreign exchange translation also contributed to the increase.\n\nDerivative assets were down $12 billion or 8%, primarily attributable to the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nTotal liabilities increased $78 billion or 4% from last year. Foreign exchange translation increased total liabilities by $14 billion. Deposits increased $23 billion or 2% due to an increase in term deposits attributable to higher interest rates and the impact of foreign exchange translation. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in demand and notice deposits and the impact of the partial sale of RBC Investor Services operations.\n\nDerivative liabilities were down $11 billion or 7%, primarily attributable to the impact of foreign exchange translation. Other liabilities increased $65 billion or 15%, primarily due to higher obligations related to repurchase agreements (repos) reflecting increased client demand.\n\nTotal equity increased $10 billion or 9%, primarily reflecting earnings, net of dividends, and the issuance of common shares.\n\n## Off-balance sheet arrangements\n\nIn the normal course of business, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, for accounting purposes, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Off-balance sheet transactions are generally undertaken for risk, capital and funding management purposes which benefit us and our clients. These include transactions with structured entities and may also include the issuance of guarantees. These transactions give rise to, among other risks, varying degrees of market, credit, liquidity and funding risk, which are discussed in the Risk management section.\n\nWe use structured entities to securitize our financial assets as well as assist our clients in securitizing their financial assets. These entities are not operating entities, typically have no employees, and may or may not be recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.",

        "page_content": "In the normal course of business, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that may qualify for derecognition. We apply the derecognition rules to determine whether we have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards or control associated with the financial assets to a third party. If the transaction meets specific criteria, it may qualify for full or partial derecognition from our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Securitizations of our financial assets\n\nWe periodically securitize our credit card receivables and residential and commercial mortgage loans primarily to diversify our funding sources, enhance our liquidity position and for capital purposes. We also securitize residential and commercial mortgage loans as part of our sales and trading activities.\n\nWe securitize our credit card receivables, on a revolving basis, through a consolidated structured entity. We securitize single and multiple-family residential mortgages through the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities (NHA MBS) program. The majority of our securitization activities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we do not meet the derecognition criteria. During 2023 and 2022, we did not derecognize any mortgages securitized through the NHA MBS program. For further details, refer to Note 7 and Note 8 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe also periodically securitize commercial mortgage loans by selling them in collateral pools, which meet certain diversification, leverage and debt coverage criteria, to structured entities, one of which is sponsored by us. Securitized commercial mortgage loans are derecognized from our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we have transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the securitized assets. During the year ended October 31, 2023, we did not securitize any commercial mortgages (October 31, 2022 - $450 million). Our continuing involvement with the transferred assets is limited to servicing certain of the underlying commercial mortgages sold. As at October 31, 2023, there was $2 billion of commercial mortgages outstanding that we continue to service related to these securitization activities (October 31, 2022 - $2 billion).\n\n## Involvement with unconsolidated structured entities\n\nIn the normal course of business, we engage in a variety of financial transactions with structured entities to support our customers' financing and investing needs, including securitization of our clients' financial assets, creation of investment products, and other types of structured financing.\n\nWe have the ability to use credit mitigation tools such as third-party guarantees, credit default swaps, and collateral to mitigate risks assumed through securitization and re-securitization exposures. The process in place to monitor the credit quality of our securitization and re-securitization exposures involves, among other things, reviewing the performance data of the underlying assets. We affirm our ratings each quarter and formally confirm or assign a new rating at least annually. For further details on our activities to manage risks, refer to the Risk management section.\n\nBelow is a description of our activities with respect to certain significant unconsolidated structured entities. For a complete discussion of our interests in consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities, refer to Note 8 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Multi-seller conduits\n\nWe administer multi-seller conduits which are used primarily for the securitization of our clients' financial assets. Our clients primarily use our multi-seller conduits to diversify their financing sources and to reduce funding costs by leveraging the value of high-quality collateral. The conduits offer us a favourable revenue stream and risk-adjusted return.\n\nWe provide services such as transaction structuring, administration, backstop liquidity facilities and partial credit enhancements to the multi-seller conduits. Revenue for all such services amounted to $387 million during the year (October 31, 2022 - $296 million).\n\nOur total commitment to the conduits in the form of backstop liquidity and credit enhancement facilities is shown below. The total committed amount of these facilities exceeds the total amount of the maximum assets that may have to be purchased by the conduits under the purchase agreements. As a result, the maximum exposure to loss attributable to our backstop liquidity and credit enhancement facilities is less than the total committed amounts of these facilities.\n\n| Liquidity and credit enhancement facilities     |                                        |                                |                                   | Table 40                               | Table 40                       | Table 40                          |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                                                 | 2023                                   | 2023                           | 2023                              | 2022                                   | 2022                           | 2022                              |\n| As at October 31 (Millions of Canadian dollars) | Notional of   committed   amounts  (1) | Allocable   notional   amounts | Maximum   exposure   to loss  (2) | Notional of   committed   amounts  (1) | Allocable   notional   amounts | Maximum   exposure   to loss  (2) |\n| Backstop liquidity facilities                   | $ 54,713                               | $ 51,469                       | $ 51,469                          | $ 48,235                               | $ 45,261                       | $ 45,261                          |\n| Credit enhancement facilities (3)               | 3,244                                  | 3,244                          | 3,244                             | 2,974                                  | 2,974                          | 2,974                             |\n| Total                                           | $ 57,957                               | $ 54,713                       | $ 54,713                          | $ 51,209                               | $ 48,235                       | $ 48,235                          |\n\nAs at October 31, 2023, the notional amount of backstop liquidity facilities we provide increased $6 billion or 13% from last year, primarily due to an increase in outstanding securitized assets of the multi-seller conduits. The notional amount of partial credit enhancement facilities we provide increased $270 million or 9% from last year, primarily due to higher client usage of the multi-seller conduits.",

All of the multi-seller conduits transactions were internally rated A or above. All transactions funded by the unconsolidated multi-seller conduits are internally rated using a rating system as outlined in the internal ratings map in the credit risk section.\n\nMultiple independent debt rating agencies review all of the transactions in the multi-seller conduits. Transactions financed in the U.S. multi-seller conduits are reviewed by Moody's Investors Service (Moody's\u2021), Standard & Poor's (S&P\u2021) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch\u2021). Transactions in two of the Canadian multi-seller conduits are reviewed by DBRS Morningstar (DBRS\u2021) and Moody's while one of the Canadian multi-seller conduits is also reviewed by S&P. Each applicable rating agency also reviews ongoing transaction performance on a monthly basis and may publish reports detailing portfolio and program information related to the conduits.\n\nAs at October 31, 2023, the total asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) issued by the conduits amounted to $37 billion, an increase of $4 billion or 12% from last year, primarily due to higher client usage. The rating agencies that rate the ABCP rated 100% (October 31, 2022 - 100%) of the total amount issued within the top ratings category.\n\n## Structured finance\n\nWe provide liquidity facilities to certain municipal bond tender option bond trusts in which we have an interest but do not consolidate because the residual certificates issued by the tender option bond trusts are held by third parties. As at October 31, 2023, our maximum exposure to loss from these unconsolidated municipal bond tender option bond trusts was $3 billion (October 31, 2022 - $3 billion).\n\nWe provide senior warehouse financing to unaffiliated structured entities that are established by third parties to acquire loans and issue term collateralized loan obligations (CLO). Subordinated financing is provided during the warehouse phase by either the collateral manager or third-party investors. Subordinated financing serves as the first loss tranche which absorbs losses prior to ourselves as the senior lender. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the term CLO is used to fully repay the senior warehouse financing that we provide. As at October 31, 2023, our maximum exposure to loss associated with the outstanding senior warehouse financing facilities was $796 million (October 31, 2022 - $640 million). The increase in our maximum exposure to loss from last year was driven by the addition of new financing facilities partially offset by the repayment of existing financing facilities.\n\nWe provide senior financing to unaffiliated structured entities that are established by third parties to acquire loans. Subordinated financing is provided by either the collateral manager or third-party investors. Subordinated financing serves as the first loss tranche which absorb losses prior to ourselves as the senior lender. These facilities tend to be longer in term than the CLO warehouse facilities and benefit from credit enhancement designed to cover a multiple of historical losses. As at October 31, 2023, our maximum exposure to loss associated with the outstanding senior financing facilities was $6 billion (October 31, 2022 - $5 billion). The increase in our maximum exposure to loss from last year was driven by the addition of new financing facilities partially offset by the repayment of existing financing facilities.\n\n## Non-RBC managed investment funds\n\nWe invest in hedge funds primarily to provide clients with desired exposures to reference funds. As we make investments in the reference funds, exposures to the funds are simultaneously transferred to clients through derivative transactions. Our maximum exposure to loss in the reference funds is limited to our investments in the funds. As at October 31, 2023, our maximum exposure to loss was $2 billion (October 31, 2022 - $3 billion). The decrease in our maximum exposure to loss from last year was driven by redemptions in third-party investment funds.\n\nWe also provide liquidity facilities to certain third-party investment funds. The funds issue unsecured variable-rate preferred shares and invest in portfolios of tax-exempt bonds. As at October 31, 2023, our maximum exposure to loss on these funds was $632 million (October 31, 2022 - $667 million). The decrease in our maximum exposure to loss from last year was driven by redemption of capital by third-party investors of the funds.\n\n## Third-party securitization vehicles\n\nWe hold interests in certain unconsolidated third-party securitization vehicles, which are structured entities. We, as well as other financial institutions, are obligated to provide funding to these entities up to our maximum commitment level and are exposed to credit losses on the underlying assets after various credit enhancements. As at October 31, 2023, our maximum exposure to loss",

The increase in our maximum exposure to loss compared to last year reflects an increase in client activity with third-party securitization vehicles. Interest and non-interest income earned in respect of these investments was $528 million (October 31, 2022 - $186 million).\n\n## Other\n\nOther unconsolidated structured entities include managed investment funds, arrangements to pass credit risk to third parties, credit investment products and tax credit funds. Refer to Note 8 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for more details regarding our other unconsolidated structured entities.\n\n## Guarantees, retail and commercial commitments\n\nWe provide our clients with guarantees and commitments that expose us to liquidity and funding risks. Our maximum potential amount of future payments in relation to our commitments and guarantee products as at October 31, 2023 amounted to $496 billion compared to $453 billion last year. The increase compared to last year was primarily driven by growth in other commitments to extend credit, sponsored member guarantees, backstop liquidity facilities and financial standby letters of credit. Refer to Liquidity and funding risk and Note 24 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding our guarantees and commitments.\n\n## Risk management\n\nWe are in the business of managing the risks inherent to the financial services industry as we aim to create maximum value for our shareholders, clients, employees and communities. The ability to manage risk is a core competency of the bank, and is supported by our risk-aware culture and risk management approach. Our view of risks is dynamic, and reflects the pace of change in the financial services industry.\n\n## Top and emerging risks\n\nAn important component of our risk management approach is to ensure that top and emerging risks, as they evolve, are identified, managed and incorporated into our existing risk management assessment, measurement, monitoring and escalation processes and addressed in our risk frameworks and policies. These practices are intended to ensure a forward-looking risk assessment is maintained by management in the course of business development and as part of the execution of ongoing risk oversight responsibilities. Top and emerging risks are discussed by senior management and the Board on a regular basis.\n\nWe have developed supplementary internal guidance to support enterprise-wide identification and assessment of all material risks, including those that are not readily apparent. Top and emerging risks encompass those that could materially impact our financial results, financial and operational resilience, reputation, business model or strategy, as well as those that may materially impact us as the risks evolve. The following represents our top and emerging risks:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Top & emerging risks                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Business and economic   conditions            | Our financial results are affected to varying degrees by the general business and economic conditions in   the geographic regions in which we operate. These conditions may include factors such as: economic   growth or contraction trends, consumer saving and spending habits; consumer and corporate borrowing   and repayment patterns; unemployment rates; the differing economic trajectories among nations across   the globe; global tensions and geopolitical uncertainty; the level of business investment and overall   business sentiment; trade; the emergence of a new outbreak of a pandemic or other health crisis; the   level of government spending, as well as fiscal and monetary policy; the level of activity and volatility of   the financial markets; disruptions to energy and other commodity markets; competitiveness; supply   chain challenges and labour shortages; the evolution of elevated inflationary pressures; and possible   stagflation or deflation. Moreover, interest rate changes and actions taken by central banks to manage   inflation or the broader economy have implications for us. Our financial results are sensitive to changes   in interest rates, as described in the Systemic risk section.   For example, a slowdown in economic growth or an economic downturn could adversely impact |\n| Canadian housing and   household indebtedness | consumer trends, and potentially have broader societal and government policy implications.   Canadian housing and household indebtedness risks remain heightened in the current interest rate   environment. Concerns around elevated levels of Canadian household debt, which accelerated during   the COVID-19 pandemic, could escalate if interest rates remain higher for longer, if the cost of living   increases further, or if job losses increase significantly, potentially resulting in, among other things,   higher credit losses. Moreover, continued interest rate increases or slowing economic growth could   adversely impact housing market activity and housing prices, which could push loan-to-value (LTV)   ratios higher and further increase credit losses.   While real estate rental activity has rebounded in certain markets, challenging affordability conditions,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |",

Geopolitical tensions have increased the   risk of nation state actors attacking critical infrastructure, including banks and critical third parties   (e.g., utilities, telecom providers, etc.). We continue to be subject to the heightened inherent risk of   cyberattacks, data breaches, cyber extortion and similar compromises, due to: (i) the size, scale and   global nature of our operations; (ii) our heavy reliance on the internet to conduct day-to-day business   activities; (iii) our intricate technological infrastructure; and (iv) our reliance on third-party service   providers. Our potential exposure to these risks increases as we continue to partner with third-party   service providers and adopt new business models and technologies (e.g., cloud computing, Artificial   Intelligence (AI) and machine learning).

Additional risks continue to emerge as demographic trends, evolving client expectations, the   increased power to analyze data and the emergence of disruptors are creating competitive pressures   across a number of sectors. Moreover, established technology companies, new competitors, and   regulatory changes continue to foster new business models that could challenge traditional banks and   financial products. Finally, while the adoption of new technologies, such as AI (including generative AI)   and machine learning, presents opportunities for us, it is resulting or could result in new and complex   strategic, operational, regulatory, compliance and reputation risks that would need to be managed   effectively.                                                                            |\n| Privacy and data   related risks    | The protection and responsible use of personal information are critical to maintaining our clients' trust.   In addition, the management and governance of our data also remains a top risk given the high value   attributed to our data for the insights it can generate for clients and communities. Resulting implications   from failing to manage data and privacy risks could include financial loss, theft of intellectual property   and/or confidential information, litigation, enhanced regulatory attention and penalties, as well as   reputational damage. Effective privacy and information management practices continue to grow in   importance, as demonstrated by the continued development of complex regulations in the jurisdictions   in which we operate. Privacy and data related risks have also heightened as a result of the evolving   threat landscape, and associated data breach risks.

Culture and conduct risks are considered top risks for the financial services industry due to the impact   that our choices, behaviours, and overall risk governance can have on outcomes for our clients and   other stakeholders. We embed client considerations into our decision-making processes and continue to   focus on the fair treatment of clients which also aligns with regulatory direction. We seek to be   responsive to evolving employee needs while expecting employees to always act with integrity.

We seek to accomplish this through an effective and evolving risk management approach. All risk-taking activities and exposures are within the Boardapproved risk appetite, corresponding constraints and risk limits. We seek to ensure that our business activities and transactions provide an appropriate balance of return for the risks assumed and the costs incurred.

Risk can be realized through losses or an undesirable outcome with respect to volatility of earnings in relation to expected earnings, capital adequacy or liquidity. Our principal risks include credit, market, liquidity, insurance, operational, regulatory compliance, strategic, reputation, legal and regulatory environment, competitive, and systemic risks, that have been classified into four categories (risk drivers) based on the level of control and influence that we can exert against these risks. There are certain activities that we undertake that will give rise to several risks. There are also certain risks that are transverse (e.g., climate and conduct risks) that can impact other risk types. Top and emerging risk categories are maintained by GRM and reviewed regularly to ensure all principal risks are reflected. This classification methodology provides a common language and discipline for the identification and assessment of risk in existing businesses, new businesses, products or initiatives, as well as acquisitions and alliances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Enterprise risk management\n\nUnder the oversight of the Board and senior management, the Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) provides an overview of our enterprise-wide programs for managing risk, including identifying, assessing, measuring, controlling, monitoring and reporting on the significant risks that face the organization.\n\n## Risk governance\n\nWe have an effective and well-established risk governance framework in place that seeks to ensure risks impacting our businesses are identified, appropriately categorized, assessed, managed and communicated to the Board in a timely manner. This framework has been established, and is maintained in alignment with, the expectations of OSFI, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's (BCBS) corporate governance principles and the requirements and expectations of other regulators in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business, and in accordance with industry best practices. The Board oversees the implementation of our risk management framework, while employees at all levels of the organization are responsible for managing the day-to-day risks that arise in the context of their mandates.

        "page_content": "## Risk appetite\n\nEffective risk management protects us from unacceptable losses or undesirable outcomes with respect to earnings volatility, capital adequacy or liquidity, reputation risk or other risks while supporting and enabling our overall business strategy. It requires the clear articulation of our risk appetite, which is the amount and type of risk that we are able and willing to accept in the pursuit of our business objectives. It reflects our self-imposed upper bound to risk-taking, set at levels inside of regulatory limits and constraints, and influences our risk management philosophy, Code of Conduct, business practices and resource allocation. It provides clear boundaries and sets an overall tone for balancing risk-reward trade-offs to ensure the long-term viability of the organization.\n\nOur risk appetite is integrated into our strategic, financial, and capital planning processes, as well as ongoing business decision-making processes and is reviewed and approved annually by the Board.\n\nOur Enterprise Risk Appetite Framework (ERAF) outlines the foundational aspects of our approach to risk appetite, articulates our quantitative and qualitative risk appetite statements and their supporting measures and associated constraints, which can be applied at the enterprise, business segment, business unit and legal entity level, and describes our requirements and expectations to embed effective risk appetite practices throughout the organization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk appetite statements\n\n## Quantitative statements\n\n## Qualitative statements\n\n- GLYPH<129> Manage earnings volatility and exposure to future losses under normal and stressed conditions.\n- GLYPH<129> Avoid excessive concentrations of risk.\n- GLYPH<129> Ensure capital adequacy and sound management of liquidity and funding risk.\n- GLYPH<129> Ensure sound management of operational and regulatory compliance risk.\n- GLYPH<129> Maintain strong credit ratings and a risk profile in the top half of our peer group.\n- GLYPH<129> Always uphold our Purpose and vision and consistently abide by our values and Code of Conduct to maintain our reputation and the trust of our clients, colleagues and communities.\n- GLYPH<129> Undertake only risks we understand. Make thoughtful and future-focused risk decisions, taking environmental and social considerations into account.\n- GLYPH<129> Effectively balance risk and reward to enable sustainable growth.\n- GLYPH<129> Maintain a healthy and robust control environment to protect our stakeholders.\n- GLYPH<129> Always be operationally prepared and financially resilient for a potential crisis.\n\nThe allocation of our risk appetite across the bank is supported by the establishment of delegated authorities or risk limits. These delegated authorities or risk limits represent the maximum level of risk permitted for a line of business, portfolio, individual or group and are used to govern ongoing operations. Risk posture, the anticipated shift in risk profile as a result of changes in objectives, strategies and external factors, is used to provide insights on key areas that may require management attention to ensure strategies are able to be executed successfully within our risk appetite.\n\n## Risk measurement\n\nQuantifying risk is a key component of our enterprise-wide risk and capital management processes. Risk measurement and planning processes are integrated across the enterprise, especially in regards to forward-looking projections and analyses, including but not limited to, stress testing, recovery and resolution planning, and credit provisioning.\n\nCertain risks, such as credit, market, liquidity and insurance risks, can be more easily quantified than others, such as operational, reputation, strategic, legal, and regulatory compliance risks. For the risks that are more difficult to quantify, greater emphasis is placed on qualitative risk factors and assessment of activities to gauge the overall level of risk. In addition, judgmental risk measures and techniques such as stress testing, and scenario and sensitivity analyses can be used to assess and measure risks, and we are continuously evolving our risk measures and techniques to manage our risks. Our primary methods for measuring risk include:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Quantifying expected loss: losses that are statistically expected to occur as a result of conducting business in a given time period;\n- GLYPH<129> Quantifying unexpected loss: an estimate of the deviation of actual earnings from expected earnings, over a specified time horizon;\n- GLYPH<129> Stress testing: evaluates, from a forward-looking perspective, the potential effects of a set of specified changes in risk factors, corresponding to exceptional but plausible adverse economic and financial market events; and\n- GLYPH<129> Back-testing: the realized values are compared to the parameter estimates that are currently used in an effort to ensure the parameters remain appropriate for regulatory and economic capital calculations.",

        "page_content": "## Stress testing\n\nStress testing is an important component of our risk management framework. Stress testing results are used for:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Assessing the viability of long-term business plans and strategies;\n- GLYPH<129> Monitoring our risk profile relative to our risk appetite in terms of earnings and capital at risk;\n- GLYPH<129> Setting limits;\n- GLYPH<129> Identifying key risks to, and potential shifts in, our capital and liquidity levels, as well as our financial position;\n- GLYPH<129> Enhancing our understanding of available mitigating actions in response to potential adverse events; and\n- GLYPH<129> Assessing the adequacy of our capital and liquidity levels.\n\nOur enterprise-wide stress tests evaluate key balance sheet, income statement, leverage, capital and liquidity impacts arising from risk exposures and changes in earnings. The results are used by the Board, Group Risk Committee (GRC) and senior management risk committees to understand our performance drivers under stress, and review stressed capital, leverage and liquidity ratios against regulatory thresholds and internal limits. The results are also incorporated into our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and capital plan analyses.\n\nWe evaluate a number of enterprise-wide stress scenarios over a multi-year horizon, featuring a range of severities. Our Board reviews the recommended scenarios, and GRM leads the scenario assessment process. Results from across the organization are integrated to develop an enterprise-wide view of the impacts, with input from subject matter experts in GRM, Corporate Treasury, Finance, Economics and the various business segments. Generally, our stress testing scenarios evaluate global recessions, equity market corrections, elevated debt levels, changes in interest rates, real estate price corrections, and shocks to credit spreads and commodity markets, among other factors. During our fiscal 2023 stress testing exercises, we addressed several top and emerging risks including geopolitical tensions, rising interest rates, cyber threats and climate risks, with a focus on the impacts of these risks on revenue, losses, net income and capital projections.\n\nOngoing stress testing and scenario analyses within specific risk types, such as market risk (including Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book [IRRBB]), liquidity risk, retail and wholesale credit risk, operational risk and insurance risk, supplement and support our enterprise-wide analyses. Results from these risk-specific programs are used in a variety of decision-making processes including risk limit setting, portfolio composition evaluation, risk appetite articulation and business strategy implementation.\n\nIn addition to ongoing enterprise-wide and risk-specific stress testing, we use ad hoc and reverse stress testing to deepen our knowledge of the risks we face. Ad hoc stress tests are one-off analyses used to investigate developing conditions or to stress a particular portfolio in more depth. Reverse stress tests aim to reverse-engineer scenarios that might lead to a particular severe outcome, such as bank non-viability, and are used in resolution & recovery planning and to improve our understanding of risk/ return boundaries.\n\nIn addition to internal stress tests, we participate in a number of regulatory stress testing exercises, on a periodic basis, across several jurisdictions.\n\n## Model governance and validation\n\nQuantitative models are used for many purposes including, but not limited to, the valuation of financial products, the identification, measurement and management of different types of risk, stress testing, assessing capital adequacy, informing business and risk decisions, measuring compliance with internal limits, meeting financial reporting and regulatory requirements, and issuing public disclosures.\n\nModel risk is the risk of adverse financial and/or reputational consequences to the enterprise arising from the use or misuse of a model at any stage throughout its life cycle and is managed through our model risk governance and oversight structure. The governance and oversight structure, which is implemented through our three lines of defence governance model, is founded on the basis that model risk management is a shared responsibility across the three lines spanning all stages of the model's life cycle.\n\nPrior to being used, models are subject to independent validation and approval by our enterprise model risk management function, a team of modelling professionals with reporting lines independent of those of the model owners, developers and users. The validation seeks to ensure that models are sound and capable of fulfilling their intended use. In addition to independently validating models prior to use, our enterprise model risk management function provides controls that span the life-cycle of a model, including model change management procedures, requirements for ongoing monitoring, and annual assessments to ensure each model continues to serve its intended purpose.\n\nAI based applications are subject to the same model governance and validation requirements as other models and are assessed in conjunction with other relevant risk functions. Controls for predominant AI risks, including fairness and explainability, are subject to Risk Committee oversight and approval. Model risk reports including AI matters are reviewed periodically by the Board.\n\n## Risk control\n\nOur enterprise-wide risk management approach is supported by a comprehensive set of risk controls that are defined in our ERMF. The ERMF serves as the foundation for our approach to risk management and promotes RBC's risk management principles, approach and governance. It further sets the expectations for the development and communication of policies, the establishment of formal independent risk review and approval processes, and the establishment of delegated risk approval authorities and risk limits. The ERMF is further reinforced and supported by a number of additional Board-approved risk frameworks, various policies thereunder and a comprehensive set of risk controls. Together, our risk frameworks and supporting policies provide direction and insight on how respective risks are identified, assessed, measured, managed, mitigated, monitored and reported. The enterprise-wide policies are considered our minimum requirements, articulating the parameters within which business groups and employees must operate.",

Board or Board Committee approval is required in some instances (e.g., RBC Code of Conduct, Dividend Policy)\n\nGenerally, by business or Functional Unit management/committees. Group Risk Management approval is required if there are significant risk implications\n\n## Risk appetite, risk approval authorities and risk limits\n\nRisk Appetite is the amount and type of risk that we are able and willing to accept in the pursuit of our business objectives. It reflects our self-imposed upper bound to risk taking and influences our risk management philosophy, conduct, operating style and resource allocation. Risk Appetite is supported by Risk Approval Authorities delegated by the Board to senior management which provide thresholds for escalation of exposures and transactions to the Risk Committee of the Board for review and approval. The allocation of Risk Appetite and Board Delegated Authorities may be supported by the establishment of management delegated authorities and/or risk limits. These represent the maximum level of risk permitted for a line of business, portfolio, individual or other groups. These authorities and limits are used to implement risk management strategies and govern ongoing operations. Excesses to risk approval authorities and risk limits can act as early warning indicators for risk appetite constraints allowing for timely management attention. Senior management can delegate some or all of their authorities onwards to others in the organization. The delegated authorities enable the approval of single name, geographic and industry sectors, and product and portfolio exposures within defined parameters and limits. They are also used to manage concentration risk, establish underwriting and inventory limits for trading and investment banking activities and set market risk tolerances.\n\n## Risk review and approval processes\n\nRisk review and approval processes provide an important control mechanism and are established by GRM based on the nature, size and complexity of the risk involved. In general, the risk review and approval process involves a formal review and approval by an individual, group or committee that is independent from the originator. The approval responsibilities are governed by the Enterprise Risk Appetite Framework and the delegated risk authorities and risk limits are based on the following categories: transactions, projects and initiatives, and new products and services.\n\n## Risk monitoring and reporting\n\nEnterprise and business segment level risk monitoring and internal reporting are critical components of our enterprise risk management program and support the ability of senior management and the Board to effectively perform their risk management and oversight responsibilities. The ongoing monitoring of our risk profile, and the organization's risk exposure against our risk appetite, enables proactive risk management and oversight. It seeks to ensure that our businesses operate within established and approved risk appetite; detect areas where business activity or growth may be constrained in the future; identify situations where risk taking may be overly conservative or aggressive; enable senior management to assess the impact of stress and unanticipated events; and inform the development and implementation of risk mitigation strategies in order to operate within risk appetite. The Risk Committee of the Board receives a CRO report at each meeting that has been reviewed by senior management, and which includes, among others, top and emerging risks, industry trends or other notable items. On a quarterly basis, we provide our Enterprise Risk Report to senior management and the Risk Committee of the Board which includes, among others, top and emerging risks, risk profile relative to our risk appetite, portfolio quality metrics and a range of risks we face along with an analysis of the related issues, key trends and, when required, management actions. On an annual basis, we provide a benchmarking review to the Board which compares our performance to peers across a variety of risk metrics and includes a composite risk scorecard which provides an objective measure of our ranking relative to the peer group. In addition to our regular risk monitoring, other risk-specific presentations are provided to, and discussed with, senior management and the Board on top and emerging risks or changes in our risk profile. In addition, we publish external reports on risk matters to comply with regulatory requirements.",

Therefore, these shaded text and marked tables represent an integral part of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Transactional/positional risk drivers\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of loss associated with an obligor's potential inability or unwillingness to fulfill its contractual obligations on a timely basis and may arise directly from the risk of default of a primary obligor (e.g., issuer, debtor, counterparty, borrower or policyholder), indirectly from a secondary obligor (e.g., guarantor or reinsurer), and/or through off-balance sheet exposures, contingent credit risk, associated credit risk and/or transactional risk. Credit risk includes counterparty credit risk arising from both trading and non-trading activities. Exposure to credit risk may occur any time funds are extended, committed or invested through an actual or implied contractual agreement.\n\nThe responsibility for managing credit risk is shared broadly following the three lines of defence governance model. The allocation of the Board approved credit risk appetite is supported by the establishment of risk approval authorities and risk limits, delegated by the Board to the President & CEO and CRO. Credit transactions in excess of these authorities must be approved by the Risk Committee of the Board. To facilitate day-to-day business activities, the CRO has been empowered to further delegate credit risk approval authorities to individuals within GRM, the business segments, and functional units as deemed necessary.\n\nWe balance our risk and return by setting the following objectives for the management of credit risk:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Ensuring credit quality is not compromised for growth;\n- GLYPH<129> Managing credit risks in transactions, relationships and portfolios;\n- GLYPH<129> Avoiding excessive concentrations in correlated credit risks;\n- GLYPH<129> Using our credit risk rating and scoring systems or other approved credit risk assessment or rating methodologies, policies and tools;\n- GLYPH<129> Pricing appropriately for the credit risk taken;\n- GLYPH<129> Detecting and preventing inappropriate credit risk through effective systems and controls;\n- GLYPH<129> Applying consistent credit risk exposure measurements;\n- GLYPH<129> Ongoing credit risk monitoring and administration;\n- GLYPH<129> Transferring credit risk to third parties where appropriate through approved credit risk mitigation techniques (e.g., sale,\n- hedging, insurance, securitization); and\n- GLYPH<129> Avoiding activities that are inconsistent with our values, Code of Conduct or policies.\n\nThe Enterprise Credit Risk Management Framework (ECRMF) provides an overview of our approach to the management of Credit Risk including principles, methodologies, systems, roles and responsibilities, reports and controls. Additional supporting policies exist that are designed to provide further clarification of roles and responsibilities, acceptable practices, limits and key controls within the enterprise.\n\n## Credit risk measurement\n\nWe quantify credit risk at both the individual obligor and portfolio levels to manage expected credit losses and minimize unexpected losses to limit earnings volatility and ensure we are adequately capitalized.\n\nWe employ a variety of risk measurement methodologies to measure and quantify credit risk for our wholesale and retail credit portfolios. The wholesale portfolio is comprised of businesses, sovereigns, public sector entities, banks and other financial institutions, as well as certain HNW individuals. The retail portfolio is comprised of residential mortgages, personal loans, credit cards and small business loans. Our credit risk rating systems are designed to assess and quantify the risk inherent in credit activities in an accurate and consistent manner. The resulting ratings and scores are then used for both client- and transaction-level risk decision-making and as key inputs for our risk measurement and capital calculations.\n\n## Measurement of economic and regulatory capital\n\nEconomic capital, which is our internal quantification of risks, is used for limit setting. It is also used for internal capital adequacy and allocation of capital to the Insurance segment. Our methodology for allocating capital to our business segments, other than Insurance, is based on regulatory requirements. For further details, refer to the Capital management section.\n\nIn measuring credit risk to determine regulatory capital, two principal approaches are available: the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) Approach and the Standardized Approach as per OSFI's CAR guideline. The IRB Approach allows both a full modelled based approach referred to as the Advanced Internal Ratings Based (A-IRB) Approach and a more supervisorybased approach know as the Foundation Internal Ratings Based Approach (F-IRB).\n\nThe Standardized Approach applies primarily to Wealth Management, including our City National wholesale portfolio, as well as our Caribbean banking operations, and is based on risk weights prescribed by OSFI that are used to calculate RWA for credit risk exposure.",

        "page_content": "The A-IRB Approach, which applies to most of our retail and wholesale credit risk exposures (excluding F-IRB exposures discussed below), utilizes three key parameters which form the basis of our credit risk measures for both regulatory and economic capital:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Probability of default (PD): An estimated percentage that represents the likelihood of default within a given time period of an obligor for a specific rating grade or for a particular pool of exposure.\n- GLYPH<129> Exposure at default (EAD): An amount expected to be owed by an obligor at the time of default.\n- GLYPH<129> Loss given default (LGD): An estimated percentage of EAD that is not expected to be recovered during the collections and recovery process following a default.\n\nThese parameters are determined based primarily on historical experience from internal credit risk rating systems in accordance with supervisory standards.\n\nPD is estimated based on a long-run average of default rates for a specific rating grade or for a particular pool of exposure. The PD assigned to a default grade(s) or pools, consistent with the definition of default, is 100%.\n\nEAD is estimated based on the current exposure to the obligor and the possible future changes in that exposure driven by factors such as the current utilization of approved limit. As with LGD, rates are estimated to reflect an economic downturn, with added conservatism to reflect data and statistical uncertainties identified in the modelling process.\n\nEach credit facility is assigned an LGD rate that is largely driven by factors that impact the extent of losses anticipated in the event the obligor defaults. These factors mainly include seniority of debt, collateral and the industry sector in which the obligor operates. Estimated LGD rates draw primarily on internal loss experiences. Where we have limited internal loss data, we also refer to appropriate external data to supplement the estimation process. LGD rates are estimated to reflect conditions that might be expected to prevail in a period of an economic downturn, with additional conservatism added to reflect data limitations and statistical uncertainties identified in the estimation process.\n\nEstimates of PD, LGD and EAD are reviewed on an annual basis and updates are then validated by an independent validation team within the bank. In addition, quarterly monitoring and back-testing is performed by the estimation team. These ratings and risk measurements are used to determine our expected losses as well as economic and regulatory capital, setting of risk limits, portfolio management and product pricing.\n\nThe F-IRB Approach is a prescribed regulatory approach that must be used to determine RWA related to our exposures to all banks and large corporates defined as having total consolidated revenues in excess of $750 million annually. The F-IRB Approach uses the same PD parameter as the A-IRB Approach but requires the use of supervisory-prescribed EAD and LGD parameters.\n\n## Financial and regulatory measurement distinctions\n\nExpected loss models are used for both regulatory capital and accounting purposes. Under both models, expected losses are calculated as the product of PD, LGD and EAD. However, there are certain key differences under current Basel and IFRS reporting frameworks which could lead to significantly different expected loss estimates, including:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Basel PDs are based on long-run averages over an entire economic cycle. IFRS PDs are based on current conditions, adjusted for estimates of future conditions that will impact PD under probability-weighted macroeconomic scenarios.\n- GLYPH<129> Basel PDs consider the probability of default over the next 12 months. IFRS PDs consider the probability of default over the next 12 months only for instruments in stage 1. Expected credit losses for instruments in stage 2 are calculated using lifetime PDs.\n- GLYPH<129> Basel LGDs are based on severe but plausible downturn economic conditions. IFRS LGDs are based on current conditions, adjusted for estimates of future conditions that will impact LGD under probability-weighted macroeconomic scenarios. For further details, refer to the Critical accounting policies and estimates section.\n\n## Gross credit risk exposure\n\nGross credit risk is categorized as i) lending-related and other credit risk or ii) trading-related credit risk, and is calculated based on the Basel III framework. Under this method, EAD for all lending-related and other credit transactions and tradingrelated repo-style transactions is calculated before taking into account any collateral and is inclusive of an estimate of potential future changes to that credit exposure. EAD for derivatives is calculated inclusive of collateral in accordance with regulatory guidelines.\n\nLending-related and other credit risk includes:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Loans and acceptances outstanding, undrawn commitments, and other exposures, including contingent liabilities such as letters of credit and guarantees, debt securities carried at FVOCI or amortized cost and deposits with financial institutions. Undrawn commitments represent an estimate of the contractual amount that may be drawn upon at the time of default of an obligor.\n\nTrading-related credit risk includes:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Repo-style transactions, which include repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions. For repo-style transactions, gross exposure represents the amount at which securities were initially financed, before taking collateral into account.\n- GLYPH<129> Derivative amounts which represent the credit equivalent amount, as defined by OSFI as the replacement cost plus an add-on amount for potential future credit exposure, scaled by a regulatory factor. For further details on replacement cost and credit equivalent amounts, refer to Note 9 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Credit risk assessment Wholesale credit risk\n\nThe wholesale credit risk rating system is designed to measure the credit risk inherent in our wholesale credit activities. Each obligor is assigned a borrower risk rating (BRR), reflecting an assessment of the credit quality of the obligor. Each BRR has a PD calibrated against it. The BRR differentiates the riskiness of an obligor and represents our evaluation of the obligor's ability and willingness to meet its contractual obligations on time over a three year time horizon. The assignment of BRRs is based on the evaluation of the obligor's business risk and financial risk through fundamental credit analysis, as well as data-driven modelling. The determination of the PD associated with each BRR relies primarily on internal default history",

It incorporates not only the contract's current value, but also considers how that value can move as market conditions change. Counterparty credit risk usually arises from trading-related derivative and repo-style transactions. Derivative transactions include forwards, futures, swaps and options, and can have underlying references that are either financial (e.g., interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, or equity) or non-financial (e.g., precious metal or other commodities). For further details on our derivative instruments and credit risk mitigation, refer to Note 9 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTrading counterparty credit activities are undertaken in a manner consistent with the relevant requirements under enterprise Credit, Market, and Model risk management frameworks and with approval in accordance with the appropriate delegated authorities.\n\nThe primary risk mitigation techniques for trading counterparty credit risk are close-out netting and collateralization. Close-out netting considers the net value of contractual obligations between counterparties in a default situation, thereby reducing overall credit exposure. Collateralization is when a borrower pledges assets as security, which provides recourse to the lender in the event of default. The policies that we maintain in relation to the recognition of risk mitigation from these techniques incorporate such considerations as:\n\n- GLYPH<129> The use of standardized agreements such as the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreement and Credit Support Annex;\n- GLYPH<129> Generally restricting eligible collateral to high quality liquid assets, primarily cash and highly-rated government securities, subject to appropriate haircuts; and\n- GLYPH<129> The use of initial margin and variation margin arrangements in accordance with regulatory requirements and internal risk standards.\n\nSimilarly, for securities finance and repurchase trading activity we mitigate counterparty credit risk via the use of standardized securities finance agreements, and by taking collateral generally in the form of eligible liquid securities.\n\nWe also mitigate counterparty credit risk through the use of central counterparties (CCPs). These highly-regulated entities intermediate trades between participating bilateral counterparties and mitigate credit risk through the use of initial and variation margin and the ability to net offsetting trades amongst participants. The specific structure and capitalization, including contingent capital arrangements, of individual CCPs are analyzed as part of assigning an internal counterparty credit risk rating and determining appropriate counterparty credit risk limits.",

        "page_content": "## Wrong-way risk\n\nWrong-way risk is the risk that exposure to a counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that counterparty. There are two types of wrong-way risk:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Specific wrong-way risk, which exists when our exposure to a particular counterparty is positively correlated with the PD of the counterparty due to the nature of our transactions with them (e.g., loans collateralized by shares or debt issued by the counterparty or a related party). Specific wrong-way risk over-the-counter (OTC) derivative trades are done on an exception basis only, and are permitted only when explicitly pre-approved by GRM. Factors considered in reviewing such trades include the credit quality of the counterparty, the nature of the asset(s) underlying the derivative and the existence of credit mitigation.\n- GLYPH<129> General wrong-way risk, which exists when there is a positive correlation between the PD of the counterparties and general macroeconomic or market factors. General wrong way risk can arise in various circumstances, depending on the transaction, collateral type, and the nature of the counterparty. We monitor general wrong-way counterparty credit risk using a variety of metrics including stress scenarios, correlation analysis, and investment strategy concentration.\n\n## Retail credit risk\n\nCredit scoring is the primary risk rating system for assessing obligor and transaction risk for retail exposures. Scoring models use internal and external data to assess and score borrowers, predict future performance and manage limits for existing loans and collection activities. Credit scores are one of the factors employed in the acquisition of new clients and management of existing clients. The credit score of the borrower is used to assess credit risk for each independent acquisition or account management action, leading to an automated decision or guidance for an adjudicator. Credit scoring improves credit decision quality, adjudication timeframes and consistency in the credit decision process and facilitates risk-based pricing.\n\nWe seek to continuously improve our credit scoring and analytic capabilities by exploring client behavioral data and advanced analytical techniques to make sound credit decisions.\n\nTo arrive at a retail risk rating, borrower scores are categorized and associated with PDs for further grouping into risk rating categories. The following table maps PD bands to various summarized risk levels for retail exposures:\n\n| Internal ratings map*   | Table 43         |\n|-------------------------|------------------|\n| PD bands                | Description      |\n| 0.050% - 3.965%         | Low risk         |\n| 3.966% - 7.428%         | Medium risk      |\n| 7.429% - 99.99%         | High risk        |\n| 100%                    | Impaired/Default |\n\n## Credit risk mitigation\n\nWe seek to reduce our exposure to credit risk through a variety of means, including the structuring of transactions and the use of collateral.\n\n## Structuring of transactions\n\nSpecific credit policies and procedures set out the requirements for structuring transactions. Risk mitigants include the use of guarantees, collateral, seniority, LTV requirements and covenants. Product-specific guidelines set out appropriate product structuring as well as client and guarantor criteria.\n\n## Collateral\n\nWhen we advance credit, we often require obligors to pledge collateral as security. The extent of risk mitigation provided by collateral depends on the amount, type and quality of the collateral taken. Specific requirements relating to collateral valuation and management are set out in our credit risk management policies.\n\nThe types of collateral we use to secure credit or trading facilities within the bank are varied. For example, our securities financing and collateralized OTC derivatives activities are primarily secured by cash and highly-rated liquid government and agency securities. Wholesale lending to business clients is often secured by pledges of the assets of the business, such as accounts receivable, inventory, operating assets and commercial real estate. In Canadian Banking and Wealth Management, collateral typically consists of a pledge over a real estate property, or a portfolio of debt securities and equities trading on a recognized exchange.\n\n- GLYPH<129> We employ a risk-based approach to property valuation. Property valuation methods include automated valuation models (AVM) and appraisals. An AVM is a tool that estimates the value of a property by reference to market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued is located. Using a risk-based approach, we also employ appraisals which can include drive-by or full on-site appraisals.\n- GLYPH<129> We continue to actively manage our mortgage portfolio and perform stress testing, based on a combination of increasing unemployment, rising interest rates and a downturn in real estate markets.\n- GLYPH<129> We seek to be in compliance with regulatory requirements that govern residential mortgage underwriting practices, including LTV parameters and property valuation requirements.\n\nThere were no significant changes regarding our risk management policies on collateral or to the quality of the collateral held during the period.",

Our enterprise-wide credit risk policies set out the minimum requirements for the management of credit risk in a variety of borrower, transactional and portfolio management contexts.\n\n## Transaction approval\n\nCredit transactions are governed by our RBC Enterprise Policy on Risk Limits and Risk Approval Authorities that captures the authorities and risk limits delegated to management as well as the credit rules policy, which outlines the minimum standards for managing credit risk at the individual client relationship and/or transaction level. The credit rules policy is further supported by business and/or product-specific policies and guidelines as appropriate. Where a transaction will exceed senior management's authorities, the approval of the Risk Committee of the Board is required.\n\n## Product approval\n\nProposals for credit products and services are comprehensively reviewed and approved under a risk assessment process and are subject to product and suitability risk approval authorities which increase as the level of risk increases. New and amended products must be reviewed relative to all risk drivers, including credit risk. All existing products must be reviewed on a regular basis following a risk-based assessment approach.\n\n## Credit risk limits\n\n- GLYPH<129> The allocation of risk appetite and Board delegated authorities are supported by the establishment of risk limits which take both regulatory constraints and internal risk management judgment into account. Risk limits are established at the following levels: single name limits, regional, country and industrial sector limits (notional and economic capital), regulatory large exposure limits, product and portfolio limits, and underwriting and distribution risk limits. These limits apply across all businesses, portfolios, transactions and products.\n- GLYPH<129> We actively manage credit exposures and limits to ensure alignment with our risk appetite, to maintain our target business mix and to ensure that there is no undue concentration risk.\n- GLYPH<129> Concentration risk is defined as the risk arising from large exposures that are highly correlated such that their ability to meet contractual obligations could be similarly affected by changes in economic, political, or other risk drivers.\n- GLYPH<129> Credit concentration limits are reviewed on a regular basis after considering business, economic, financial, and regulatory environments.\n\n## Credit risk administration Loan forbearance\n\nIn our overall management of borrower relationships, economic or legal reasons may necessitate forbearance to certain clients with respect to the original terms and conditions of their loans. We have specialized groups and formalized policies that direct the management of high risk, delinquent or defaulted borrowers. We strive to identify borrowers in financial difficulty early and modify their loan terms to minimize losses and assist clients in need. A forbearance agreement may be entered into with the borrower where we will forbear from enforcing on security in exchange for concessions made by the borrower. In these circumstances, a borrower may be granted concessions that would not otherwise be considered. Examples of such concessions to retail borrowers may include rate reduction, payment deferral and term extensions. Concessions to wholesale borrowers may include payment deferral, restructuring the agreements, modifying the original terms of the agreement and/or relaxation of covenants. For both retail and wholesale loans, the appropriate remediation techniques are based on the individual borrower's situation, our policy and the client's willingness and capacity to meet the new arrangement.",

This includes potential gains or losses due to changes in market determined variables such as interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and implied volatilities.\n\nThe measures of financial condition impacted by market risk are as follows:\n\n- 1. Positions whose revaluation gains and losses are reported in revenue, which includes:\n- a) Changes in the fair value of instruments classified or designated as FVTPL, and\n- b) Hedge ineffectiveness.\n- 2. CET1 capital, which includes:\n- a) All of the above, plus\n- b) Changes in the fair value of FVOCI securities where revaluation gains and losses are reported as OCI,\n- c) Changes in the Canadian dollar value of investments in foreign subsidiaries, net of hedges, due to foreign exchange translation, and\n- d) Changes in the fair value of employee benefit plan deficits.\n- 3. CET1 ratio, which includes:\n- a) All of the above, plus\n- b) Changes in RWA resulting from changes in traded market risk factors, and\n- c) Changes in the Canadian dollar value of RWA due to foreign exchange translation.\n- 4. The economic value of the Bank, which includes:\n- a) Points 1 and 2 above, plus\n- b) Changes in the economic value of other non-trading positions, net interest income, and fee based income, as a result of changes in market risk factors.\n\n## Market risk controls - FVTPL positions, including trading portfolios 1\n\nAs an element of the ERAF, the Board approves our overall market risk constraints. GRM creates and manages the control structure for FVTPL positions which are designed to ensure that business is conducted on a basis consistent with Board requirements. The Market and Counterparty Credit Risk function within GRM is responsible for creating and managing the controls and governance procedures that are designed to ensure that risk taken is consistent with risk appetite constraints set by the Board. These controls include limits on probabilistic measures of potential loss such as Value-at-Risk and stress tests as defined below:\n\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) is a statistical measure of potential loss for a financial portfolio computed at a given level of confidence and over a defined holding period. We measure VaR at the 99th percentile confidence level for price movements over a one-day holding period using historic simulation of the last two years of equally weighted historic market data. These calculations are updated daily with current risk positions, with the exception of certain less material positions that are not actively traded and are updated on at least a monthly basis. Trading VaR captures potential loss for our trading portfolio that excludes the impacts of non-trading FVTPL positions such as loan underwriting commitments. Total VaR captures potential loss for all positions classified as FVTPL.\n\nVaR is a statistical estimate based on historical market data and should be interpreted with knowledge of its limitations, which include the following:\n\n- GLYPH<129> VaR will not be predictive of future losses if the realized market movements differ significantly from the historical periods used to compute it.\n- GLYPH<129> VaR projects potential losses over a one-day holding period and does not project potential losses for risk positions held over longer time periods.\n- GLYPH<129> VaR is measured using positions at close of business and does not include the impact of trading and hedging activity over the course of a day.\n\nWe validate our VaR measures through a variety of means - including subjecting the models to vetting and validation by a group independent of the model developers and by back-testing the VaR against daily marked-to-market revenue to identify and examine events in which actual outcomes in trading revenue exceed the VaR projections.\n\nStress tests - Our market risk stress testing program is used to identify and control risk due to large changes in market prices and rates. We conduct stress testing daily on positions that are marked-to-market. The stress tests simulate both historical and hypothetical events which are severe and long-term in duration. Historical scenarios are taken from actual market events and range in duration up to 90 days. Examples include the COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020, Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and the Taper Tantrum of 2013. Hypothetical scenarios are designed to be forward-looking at potential future market stresses, and are designed to be severe but plausible. We are constantly evaluating and refining these scenarios as market conditions change. Stress results are calculated assuming an instantaneous revaluation of our positions with no management action.",

The investments which support actuarial liabilities are predominantly fixed income assets designated as FVTPL. Consequently, changes in the fair values of these assets are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are largely offset by changes in the fair value of the actuarial liabilities, the impact of which is reflected in PBCAE. As at October 31, 2023, we held assets in support of approximately $12 billion of liabilities with respect to insurance obligations (October 31, 2022 - $12 billion).\n\n## Market risk controls - Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) positions 2\n\nIRRBB arises primarily from traditional customer-originated banking products such as deposits and loans, and includes related hedges and interest rate risk from securities held for liquidity management purposes. Factors contributing to IRRBB include mismatches between asset and liability repricing dates, relative changes in asset and liability rates in response to market rate scenarios, and other product features affecting the expected timing of cash flows, such as options to pre-pay loans or redeem term deposits prior to contractual maturity. IRRBB sensitivities are regularly measured and reported, and subject to limits and controls with independent oversight from GRM.\n\nThe Board approves the risk appetite for IRRBB, and the Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) and GRM provide ongoing governance through IRRBB risk policies, limits, operating standards and other controls. IRRBB reports are reviewed regularly by GRM, ALCO, the GRC, the Risk Committee of the Board and the Board.\n\n## IRRBB measurement\n\nTo monitor and control IRRBB, we assess two primary metrics, Net Interest Income (NII) risk and Economic Value of Equity (EVE) risk, under a range of market shocks, scenarios, and time horizons. Market scenarios include currency-specific parallel and non-parallel yield curve changes, interest rate volatility shocks, and interest rate scenarios prescribed by regulators.\n\nIn measuring NII risk, detailed banking book balance sheets and income statements are dynamically simulated to estimate the impact of market stress scenarios on projected NII. Assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions are simulated over various time horizons. The simulations incorporate maturities, renewals, and new originations along with prepayment and redemption behaviour. Product pricing and volumes are forecasted based on past experience to determine response expectations under a given market shock scenario. EVE risk captures the market value sensitivity to changes in rates. In measuring EVE risk, deterministic (single-scenario) and stochastic (multiple-scenario) valuation techniques are applied to spot position data. NII and EVE risks are measured for a range of market risk stress scenarios which include extreme but plausible changes in market rates and volatilities. IRRBB measures assume continuation of existing hedge strategies.\n\nManagement of NII and EVE risk is complementary and supports our efforts to generate a sustainable high-quality NII stream. NII and EVE risks for specific units are measured daily, weekly or monthly depending on materiality, complexity and hedge strategy.\n\nA number of assumptions affecting cash flows, product re-pricing and the administration of rates underlie the models used to measure NII and EVE risk. The key assumptions pertain to the projected funding date of mortgage rate commitments, fixed-rate loan prepayment behaviour, term deposit redemption behaviour, and the term and rate profile of non-maturity deposits. All assumptions are derived empirically based on historical client behaviour and product pricing with consideration of possible forward-looking changes. All models and assumptions used to measure IRRBB are subject to independent oversight by GRM.\n\n## Market risk measures - IRRBB Sensitivities\n\nThe following table shows the potential before-tax impact of an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase or decrease in interest rates on projected EVE and 12-month NII, assuming no subsequent hedging. Interest rate risk measures are based on current on and off-balance sheet positions which can change over time in response to business activity and management actions.",

The change in NII sensitivity reflects a change in product mix and the change in EVE sensitivity can be attributed to a reduction in the term of fixed rate assets. During 2023, NII and EVE risks remained within approved limits.\n\n## Market risk measures for other material non-trading portfolios Investment securities carried at FVOCI\n\nWe held $128 billion of investment securities carried at FVOCI as at October 31, 2023, compared to $93 billion at the end of the prior year. We hold debt securities carried at FVOCI primarily as investments, as well as to manage liquidity risk and hedge interest rate risk in our non-trading banking balance sheet. As at October 31, 2023, our portfolio of investment securities carried at FVOCI is interest rate sensitive and would impact OCI by a pre-tax change in value of $5 million as measured by the change in the value of the securities for a one basis point parallel increase in yields. The portfolio also exposes us to credit spread risk of a pre-tax change in value of $28 million, as measured by the change in value for a one basis point widening of credit spreads. The value of the investment securities carried at FVOCI included in our IRRBB measures as at October 31, 2023 was $125 billion. Our investment securities carried at FVOCI also include equity exposures of $1 billion as at October 31, 2023, compared to $1 billion at the end of the prior year.\n\n## Non-trading foreign exchange rate risk\n\nForeign exchange rate risk is the potential adverse impact on earnings and economic value due to changes in foreign currency rates. Our revenue, expenses and income denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar are subject to fluctuations as a result of changes in the value of the average Canadian dollar relative to the average value of those currencies. Our most significant exposure is to the U.S. dollar, due to our operations in the U.S. and other activities conducted in U.S. dollars. Our other significant exposure is to the British pound due to our activities conducted internationally in this currency. A strengthening or weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar and British pound could reduce or increase, as applicable, the translated value of our foreign currency denominated revenue, expenses and earnings and could have a significant effect on the results of our operations. We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk arising from our investments in foreign operations. For unhedged equity investments, when the Canadian dollar appreciates against other currencies, the unrealized translation losses on net foreign investments decreases our shareholders' equity through the other components of equity and decreases the translated value of the RWA of the foreign currency-denominated asset. The reverse is true when the Canadian dollar depreciates against other currencies. Consequently, we consider these impacts in selecting an appropriate level of our investments in foreign operations to be hedged.\n\n## Derivatives related to non-trading activity\n\nDerivatives are also used to hedge market risk exposure unrelated to our trading activity. Hedge accounting is elected where applicable. These derivatives are included in our IRRBB measures and other internal non-trading market risk measures. We use interest rate swaps to manage our IRRBB, funding and investment activities. Interest rate swaps are also used to hedge changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate instruments. We also use foreign exchange derivatives to manage our exposure to equity investments in subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar, British Pound, and Euro.\n\nFor further details on the application of hedge accounting and the use of derivatives for hedging activities, refer to Notes 2 and 9 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.",

Liquidity risk arises from mismatches in the timing and value of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet cash flows.\n\n## Governance of liquidity risk\n\nOur liquidity risk management activities are conducted in accordance with internal frameworks and policies, including the Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF), the Enterprise Risk Appetite Framework (ERAF), the Enterprise Liquidity Risk Management Framework (LRMF), the Enterprise Liquidity Risk Policy, and the Enterprise Pledging Policy. Collectively, our frameworks and policies establish liquidity and funding management requirements appropriate for the execution of our strategy and ensuring liquidity risk remains within our risk appetite.\n\nLiquidity risk objectives, policies and risk appetite are reviewed regularly, and updated to reflect changes in industry practice and relevant regulatory guidance. Enterprise policies are supported by subsidiary, operational, desk and productlevel policies and standards that specify risk control elements, such as parameters, methodologies, limits and authorities governing the measurement and management of liquidity. Management practices, parameters, models and methodologies are also subject to regular review, and are updated to reflect market conditions and business mix. Stress testing is employed to assess the robustness of the control framework and inform liquidity contingency plans.",

        "page_content": "## Responsibilities for liquidity risk oversight and management\n\nThe Board, the Risk Committee of the Board, the Group Risk committee (GRC), the Asset Liability Committee (ALCO), and the Policy Review Committee (PRC) are accountable for the identification, assessment, control, monitoring and oversight of liquidity risk. The GRC, PRC and/or the ALCO review liquidity reporting and policies prior to review by the Board or its committees.\n\n- GLYPH<129> The Board, the Risk Committee of the Board, the GRC and the ALCO regularly review information on our consolidated liquidity position;\n- GLYPH<129> The PRC approves the Liquidity Risk Policy, which establishes minimum risk control elements in accordance with the Board-approved risk appetite and the LRMF, and the Pledging Policy, which outlines the requirements and authorities for the management of our pledging activities;\n- GLYPH<129> The ALCO annually approves the Enterprise Liquidity Contingency Plan (ELCP) and provides strategic direction and oversight to Corporate Treasury, other functions, and business segments on the management of liquidity and funding. In addition to our committee oversight framework, liquidity risk management activities are subject to the three lines of defence governance model. Corporate Treasury, the first line of defence for the management of liquidity risk, is subject to independent second line challenge and oversight by GRM. RBC Internal Audit is the third line of defence. The three lines of defence are independent of the business whose activities generate liquidity risks.\n\n## Liquidity risk mitigation strategies and techniques\n\nOur liquidity management policies and practices are designed to ensure the soundness of our liquidity position. Our liquidity profile is structured to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy current and prospective commitments in both normal and stressed conditions. For this purpose, we employ the following liquidity risk mitigation strategies and techniques:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Maintaining a sufficient buffer of cash, central bank reserves, and unencumbered marketable securities, supported by a demonstrated capacity to monetize these securities during stress;\n- GLYPH<129> Access to a broad range of funding sources, including a stable base of core client deposits and a diversified wholesale funding mix;\n- GLYPH<129> Access to central bank funding facilities in Canada and the U.S., and select other jurisdictions in which we operate;\n- GLYPH<129> Timely and granular risk measurement and reporting to control and monitor liquidity sources and uses, and inform liquidity risk management decisions;\n- GLYPH<129> A comprehensive program for liquidity stress testing and crisis management;\n- GLYPH<129> Governance of pledging activity through limits and designated liquid asset buffers to address potential increased pledging activity;\n- GLYPH<129> Achieving an appropriate balance between the level of exposure allowed under our risk appetite and the cost of risk mitigation;\n- GLYPH<129> Transparent liquidity transfer pricing and cost allocation mechanisms to align risk management with business strategies; and\n- GLYPH<129> A three-lines-of-defence governance model providing effective oversight and challenge of liquidity risk strategies, metrics, assumptions, and controls.\n\nOur dedicated liquid asset portfolios are managed and controlled in accordance with internal policies and are subject to minimum asset quality and other relevant requirements (e.g., term to maturity, diversification, and eligibility for central bank advances). These securities, along with other unencumbered liquid assets held for trading or other activities, contribute to our liquidity reserve, as reflected in the liquidity disclosures below.\n\n## Risk tolerance\n\nOur liquidity risk appetite is reviewed at a minimum annually by ALCO, GRC, and the Risk Committee of the Board before it is recommended for approval to the Board. Risk appetite, a key element of our enterprise risk management framework, is defined as the amount and type of risk that RBC is able and willing to take in pursuit of its business objectives.\n\n## Risk measurement and internal liquidity reporting\n\nWe maintain robust liquidity risk measurement capabilities to support timely and frequent reporting of information for the management of our liquidity position and oversight of risk. This reporting, which includes internal and regulatory metrics, is used to monitor adherence with our risk appetite and limits, and position relative to regulatory minimums. Regulatory metrics used to manage and control liquidity risk include OSFI's Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) and Net Cumulative Cash Flow (NCCF). The specificity with which we measure and manage liquidity allows us to make ongoing informed assessments of the demands and mobility of liquidity, considering currency requirements, access to foreign exchange markets and commitments, and expectations under local regulations.\n\nInternal assessments of liquidity risk include application of scenario-specific assumptions against our assets and liabilities, and various off-balance sheet commitments and obligations to project cash flows over varying time horizons and degrees of stress. For example, certain government bonds could be quickly and easily converted to cash without significant loss of value. In contrast, lower-rated securities may not be deemed appropriate sources of liquidity in times of stress, or may incur higher potential monetization costs. While relationship-based deposits contractually can be withdrawn immediately, in practice, these balances can be relatively stable sources of funding depending on several factors, such as the nature of the client and their intended use. Assumptions and methodologies informing our assessment of liquidity risk are periodically reviewed and validated to ensure alignment with our operating environment, expected economic and market conditions, rating agency preferences, regulatory requirements and generally accepted industry practices.",

        "page_content": "To manage liquidity risk within our liquidity risk appetite, we set limits on various metrics over a range of time horizons, jurisdictions and currencies. We also consider various levels of stress conditions in our development of appropriate contingency, recovery and resolution plans. Our liquidity risk measurement and control activities cover multiple areas:\n\n## Structural (longer-term) liquidity risk\n\nWe use both internal and regulatory metrics to manage and control the structural alignment between long-term illiquid assets, the availability of core relationship deposits and longer-term funding. Conversely, we aim to align the use of shorter-term wholesale funding with assets of equivalent liquidity-generating potential.\n\n## Tactical (shorter-term) liquidity risk\n\nTo address potential immediate cash flow risks during periods of stress, we use short-term net cash flow limits to control risk at the material unit, subsidiary and currency levels. Net cash flow positions are determined by applying internally-derived risk assumptions and parameters to known and anticipated cash flows for all material unencumbered assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet activities. Additional product-level controls and limits are employed to manage concentration risk and perceived market capacity limitations for more sensitive liquidity sources and uses. We also control tactical liquidity by adhering to relevant regulatory standards, such as LCR.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nOur comprehensive stress testing program informs internal assessments of the sufficiency of liquid assets, and whether they are adequately pre-positioned and accessible to meet stressed liquidity needs. Our stress tests, which include elements of scenario and sensitivity analyses, measure our prospective exposure to systemic and RBC-specific events over periods of time. Different degrees of severity are considered for each type of crisis with some scenarios reflecting multiple downgrades to our credit ratings.\n\n## Contingency liquidity risk management and funding plans\n\nContingency liquidity risk planning assesses the impact of sudden stress on our liquidity risk position and identifies a range of potential mitigating actions and plans. Corporate Treasury maintains the Enterprise Liquidity Contingency Plan (ELCP) and regional liquidity contingency plans (LCPs) that identify potential sources of stress and guide our responses to liquidity crises. Potential sources of stress are calibrated based on relevant historical experience and resulting contingent funding needs, including those from draws on committed credit and liquidity lines, demands for increased collateral and deposit run-offs. The ELCP also identifies alternative liquidity sources and considerations for their use.\n\nAdditionally, under the leadership of Corporate Treasury, enterprise and regional Liquidity Crisis Teams (LCTs) each meet regularly to assess our liquidity status, review, and approve the LCPs and during times of stress, provide linkages to the front line and other functions to support effective and coordinated crisis management and oversight. Enterprise and local LCTs include members from key business segments, GRM, Finance, Operations, and Communications. The liquidity status assessment and monitoring process informs management, the Board and regulatory agencies of our assessment of internal and external events and their potential implications on liquidity risk.\n\n## Liquidity reserve and asset encumbrance\n\nThe following tables provide summaries of our liquidity reserve and asset encumbrance. To varying degrees, unencumbered assets represent a ready source of funding. Unencumbered assets are the difference between total and encumbered assets from both on- and off-balance sheet sources. Encumbered assets include: (i) bank-owned liquid assets that are either pledged as collateral (e.g., repo financing and derivative pledging) or not freely available due to regulatory or internal policy requirements (e.g., earmarked to satisfy mandatory reserve or regional capital adequacy requirements and to maintain continuous access to payment and settlement systems); (ii) securities received as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions which have either been re-hypothecated where permissible (e.g., to obtain financing through repos or to cover securities sold short) or have no liquidity value since re-hypothecation is prohibited; and (iii) illiquid assets that have been securitized and sold into the market or that have been pledged as collateral in support of structured term funding vehicles. As per our liquidity management framework and practice, encumbered assets are not considered a source of liquidity.\n\n## Liquidity reserve\n\nOur liquidity reserve consists only of available unencumbered liquid assets. Although unused wholesale funding capacity could be another potential source of liquidity, it is excluded in the determination of the liquidity reserve.",

These factors were partially offset by a decrease in cash and deposits with banks.\n\n## Funding\n\n## Funding strategy\n\nMaintaining a diversified funding base is a key strategy for managing our liquidity risk profile.\n\nCore funding, comprising capital, longer-term wholesale liabilities and a diversified pool of personal as well as the stable portion of our commercial and institutional deposits, is the foundation of our structural liquidity position.\n\nWholesale funding activities are well-diversified by geography, investor segment, instrument, currency, structure, and maturity. We maintain an ongoing presence in different funding markets, which allows us to continuously monitor market developments and trends, identify opportunities and risks, and take appropriate and timely actions.\n\nWe continuously evaluate opportunities to expand into new markets and untapped investor segments since diversification expands our wholesale funding flexibility, minimizes funding concentration and dependency, and generally reduces financing costs.\n\nWe regularly assess our funding concentration and have implemented limits on certain funding sources to support diversification of our funding base.\n\n## Deposit and funding profile\n\nAs at October 31, 2023, relationship-based deposits, which are the primary source of funding for retail and commercial lending, were $844 billion or 52% of our total funding (October 31, 2022 - $819 billion or 54%). The remaining portion is comprised of shortand long-term wholesale funding.\n\nFunding for highly liquid assets consists primarily of short-term wholesale funding that reflects the monetization period of those assets. Long-term wholesale funding is used mostly to fund less liquid wholesale assets and to support liquid asset buffers. Senior long-term debt issued by the bank on or after September 23, 2018, that has an original term greater than 400 days and is marketable, subject to certain exceptions, is subject to the Canadian Bank Recapitalization (Bail-in) regime. Under the Bail-in regime, in circumstances when the Superintendent of Financial Institutions has determined that a bank may no longer be viable,",

As at October 31, 2023, the notional value of issued and outstanding long-term debt subject to conversion under the Bail-in regime was $106 billion (October 31, 2022 - $85 billion).\n\nFor further details on our wholesale funding, refer to the Composition of wholesale funding tables below.\n\n## Long-term debt issuance\n\nDuring 2023, we continued to experience favourable unsecured wholesale funding access and pricing. We issued, either directly or through our subsidiaries, unsecured long-term funding of $44 billion in various currencies and markets.\n\nWe use residential mortgage and credit card securitization programs as a source of funding and for liquidity and asset/liability management purposes. Our total secured long-term funding includes outstanding MBS sold, covered bonds that are collateralized with residential mortgages and securities backed by credit card receivables.\n\nFor further details, refer to the Off-balance sheet arrangements section.\n\n| Long-term funding sources*  (1)   | Table 56          | Table 56          |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                   | As at             | As at             |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)    | October 31   2023 | October 31   2022 |\n| Unsecured long-term funding       | $ 139,882         | $ 119,241         |\n| Secured long-term funding         | 74,720            | 68,953            |\n| Subordinated debentures           | 12,038            | 10,639            |\n|                                   | $ 226,640         | $ 198,833         |\n\n- * This table represents an integral part of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- (1) Based on original term to maturity greater than 1 year.\n\nThe following table summarizes our registered programs and their authorized limits by geography.\n\n| Programs by geography                                        | Table 57                                                                                                                                                |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Canada   U.S.                                                | Europe/Asia                                                                                                                                             |\n| GLYPH<129> Canadian Shelf Program - $25 billion   GLYPH<129> | U.S. Shelf Program - US$50 billion   GLYPH<129> European Debt Issuance Program - US$75 billion   GLYPH<129> Global Covered Bond Program -  \u20ac 75 billion |\n\nWe also raise long-term funding using Canadian Senior Notes, Kangaroo Bonds (issued in the Australian domestic market by foreign firms) and Yankee Certificates of Deposit (issued in the U.S. domestic market by foreign firms).\n\nAs presented in the following charts, our current long-term debt profile is well-diversified by both currency and product.\n\n## Long-term debt (1) - funding mix by currency of issuance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) Includes unsecured and secured long-term funding and subordinated debentures with an original term to maturity greater than 1 year\n- (1) Includes unsecured and secured long-term funding and subordinated debentures with an original term to maturity greater than 1 year\n- (2) Mortgage-backed securities and Canada Mortgage Bonds\n\n<!-- image -->",

The following table shows the additional collateral obligations required at the reporting date in the event of a one-, two- or threenotch downgrade. These additional collateral obligations are incremental requirements for each successive downgrade and do not represent the cumulative impact of multiple downgrades. The amounts reported change periodically due to several factors, including the transfer of trading activity to centrally cleared financial market infrastructures and exchanges, the expiration of transactions with downgrade triggers, the imposition of internal limitations on new agreements to exclude downgrade triggers, as well as normal course mark-to-market. There is no outstanding senior debt issued in the market that contains rating triggers that would lead to early prepayment of principal.\n\n## Additional contractual obligations for rating downgrades\n\n|                                                        | As at                 | As at                 | As at                   | As at                 | As at                 | As at                   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                                        | October 31            | October 31            | October 31              | October 31   2022     | October 31   2022     | October 31   2022       |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)                         | One-notch   downgrade | Two-notch   downgrade | Three-notch   downgrade | One-notch   downgrade | Two-notch   downgrade | Three-notch   downgrade |\n| Contractual derivatives funding or margin requirements | $ 217   $             | 138   $               | 199                     | $ 236   $             | 146   $               | 304                     |\n| Other contractual funding or margin requirements (1)   | 41                    | 57                    | 42                      | 38                    | 21                    | 25                      |",

        "page_content": "We manage our LCR position within a target range that reflects our liquidity risk tolerance, business mix, asset composition and funding capabilities. The range is subject to periodic review, considering changes to internal requirements and external developments.\n\nWe maintain HQLAs in major currencies with dependable market depth and breadth. Our treasury management practices are designed to ensure that the levels of HQLA are actively managed to meet target LCR objectives. Our Level 1 assets, as calculated according to OSFI LAR and the BCBS LCR requirements, represent 88% of total HQLA. These assets consist of cash, placements with central banks and highly rated securities issued or guaranteed by governments, central banks and supranational entities.\n\nLCR captures cash flows from on- and off-balance sheet activities that are either expected or could potentially occur within 30 days in an acute stress scenario. Cash outflows result from the application of withdrawal and non-renewal factors to demand and term deposits, differentiated by client type (wholesale, retail and small- and medium-sized enterprises). Cash outflows also arise from business activities that create contingent funding and collateral requirements, such as repo funding, derivatives, short sales of securities and the extension of credit and liquidity commitments to clients. Cash inflows arise primarily from maturing secured loans, interbank loans and non-HQLA securities.\n\nLCR does not reflect any market funding capacity that we believe would be available in a stress situation. All maturing wholesale debt is assigned 100% outflow in the LCR calculation.\n\n## Q4 2023 vs. Q3 2023\n\nThe average LCR for the quarter ended October 31, 2023 was 131%, which translates into a surplus of approximately $91 billion, compared to 134% and a surplus of approximately $97 billion in the prior quarter. Average LCR levels decreased from prior quarter primarily due to lower wholesale funding levels and loan growth, partially offset by an increase in client deposits.\n\n## Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)\n\nNSFR is a Basel III metric that measures the sufficiency of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding. The BCBS and OSFI regulatory minimum coverage level for NSFR is 100%.\n\nAvailable stable funding is defined as the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be reliable over the one-year time horizon considered by the NSFR. Required stable funding is a function of the liquidity characteristics and residual maturities of various bank assets and off-balance sheet exposures.\n\nOSFI requires Canadian D-SIBs to disclose the NSFR using the standard Basel disclosure template. Amounts presented in this disclosure template are determined in accordance with the requirements of OSFI's LAR guideline and are not necessarily aligned with the classification requirements prescribed under IFRS.",

        "page_content": "Available stable funding is comprised primarily of a diversified pool of personal and commercial deposits, capital, and long-term wholesale liabilities. Required stable funding is driven mainly by the bank's mortgage and loan portfolio, secured loans to financial institutions and to a lesser extent by other less liquid assets. NSFR does not reflect any unused market funding capacity that we believe would be available.\n\nVolume and composition of available stable funding is actively managed to optimize our structural funding position and meet NSFR objectives. Our NSFR is managed in accordance with our comprehensive LRMF.\n\n## Q4 2023 vs. Q3 2023\n\nThe NSFR as at October 31, 2023 was 113%, which translates into a surplus of approximately $109 billion, compared to 112% and a surplus of approximately $104 billion in the prior quarter. NSFR increased compared to the prior quarter mainly due to an increase in deposits and stable funding, partially offset by loan growth.\n\n## Contractual maturities of financial assets, financial liabilities and off-balance sheet items\n\nThe following tables provide remaining contractual maturity profiles of all our assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items at their carrying value (e.g., amortized cost or fair value) at the balance sheet date. Off-balance sheet items are allocated based on the expiry date of the contract.\n\nDetails of contractual maturities and commitments to extend funds are a source of information for the management of liquidity risk. Among other purposes, these details form a basis for modelling a behavioural balance sheet with effective maturities to calculate liquidity risk measures. For further details, refer to the Risk measurement and internal liquidity reporting section.\n\n|                                                                                              |

Disclosed amounts are the contractual undiscounted cash flows of all financial liabilities (e.g., par value or amount payable upon maturity). The amounts do not reconcile directly with those in our consolidated balance sheets as the table incorporates only cash flows relating to payments on maturity and do not recognize premiums, discounts or mark-to-market adjustments recognized in the instruments' carrying values as at the balance sheet date. Financial liabilities are based upon the earliest period in which they are required to be paid. For off-balance sheet items, the undiscounted cash flows potentially payable under financial guarantees and commitments to extend credit are classified based on the earliest date they can be called.\n\n| Contractual maturities of financial liabilities and off-balance sheet items -

        "page_content": "## Insurance risk\n\nInsurance risk refers to the potential financial loss that may arise where the amount, timing and/or frequency of benefit and/or premium payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are different than expected. Insurance risk is distinct from those risks covered by other parts of our risk management framework (e.g., credit, market and operational risk) where those risks are ancillary to, or accompany, the risk transfer. The five insurance sub-risks are: morbidity, mortality, longevity, policyholder behaviour (lapse), and travel risk.\n\nOur Insurance Risk Management Framework provides an overview of our processes and tools for identifying, assessing, managing, mitigating and reporting on the insurance risks that face the organization. These are also supported by our robust three lines of defence governance structure, which is consistent with our Enterprise Risk Management Framework.\n\n## Operational/regulatory compliance risk drivers\n\n## Operational risk\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss or harm resulting from people, inadequate or failed internal processes, controls and systems or from external events. Operational risk is inherent in all of our activities and third-party activities and failure to manage operational risk can result in direct or indirect financial loss, reputational impact or regulatory scrutiny and proceedings in the various jurisdictions where we operate.\n\nOur management of operational risk follows the three lines of defence governance model, encompassing the organizational roles and responsibilities for a coordinated enterprise-wide approach. For further details on the structure and organization of our operational risk management and control function, refer to the Risk management - Enterprise risk management section.\n\n## Operational risk framework\n\nWe have an Enterprise Operational Risk Framework which sets out the processes to identify, assess, monitor, measure, report and communicate on operational risk. The processes are established through the following:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Risk identification and assessment tools, including the collection and analysis of risk event data, help risk owners understand and proactively manage operational risk exposures. Risk assessments are intended to ensure alignment between risk exposures and efforts to manage them. Management uses outputs of these tools to make informed risk decisions.\n- GLYPH<129> Risk monitoring tools alert management to changes in the operational risk profile. When paired with escalation and monitoring triggers, risk monitoring tools can identify risk trends, warn management of risk levels that approach or exceed defined limits, as well as prompt actions and mitigation plans to be undertaken.\n- GLYPH<129> Risk capital measurement is designed to provide credible estimation of potential risk exposure, including surfacing risk vulnerabilities, and informs strategic and capital planning decisions, which are ultimately intended to ensure that the bank is sufficiently resilient to withstand operational risk losses both in normal times and under stress situations.\n- GLYPH<129> Risk reporting and communication processes seek to ensure that relevant operational risk information is made available to management in a timely manner to support risk-informed business decisions.\n\nConclusions from our operational risk programs enable learning based on what has occurred, insights into whether it could happen elsewhere in the organization, and what controls we need to amend or implement. These conclusions support the articulation of our operational risk appetite and are used to inform the overall level of operational risk exposure which thereby defines our operational risk profile. This profile includes significant operational risk exposures, potential new and emerging exposures and trends, and overall conclusions on the control environment and risk outlook.\n\nWe consider the potential risks and rewards of our decisions to strike a balance between accepting potential losses versus incurring costs of mitigation, the expression of which is in the form of our operational risk appetite. Our operational risk appetite is established at the Board level and cascaded throughout each of our business segments. We proactively identify and investigate corporate insurance opportunities to mitigate and reduce potential future impacts of operational risk.\n\nManagement reports have been implemented at various levels to support proactive management of operational risk and transparency of risk exposures. These reports are provided to senior management on a regular basis and provide detail on the main drivers of the risk status and trend for each of our business segments and the bank overall. In addition, changes to the operational risk profile that are not aligned to our business strategy or operational risk appetite are identified and discussed at the Operational Risk Committee (comprised of executives across the business and risk management) and presented to GRC and the Risk Committee of the Board.",

        "page_content": "## Operational risk capital\n\nRequirements for operational risk capital are determined in accordance with OSFI issued guidelines. Upon implementation of the Basel III reforms in Q2 2023, we adopted a new Standardized Approach (SA) for the measurement of operational risk capital. This SA methodology is a formula-based calculation where a Business Indicator Component (BIC) is multiplied by an Internal Loss Multiplier (ILM) to determine operational risk capital. The BIC is a financial statement-based proxy for operational risk that reflects a 3-year average of specified components of net income multiplied by a set of supervisory provided coefficients. The ILM is a scaling factor that is based on our 10-year historical operational loss average relative to the BIC. Operational Risk losses are recorded in our operational risk management system, and robust processes exist to support high quality internal loss data. For further details on operational risk capital, refer to the Capital management section.\n\n## Operational risk loss events\n\nAs at October 31, 2023, our operational risk losses remain within our risk appetite. For further details on our contingencies, including litigation, refer to Notes 24 and 25 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Culture and conduct risk\n\nOur values set the tone of our organizational culture and translate into desired behaviours as articulated in our Code of Conduct and leadership model. We define conduct as the manifestation of culture through the behaviours, judgment, decisions and actions of the organization and its employees. Our organizational direction establishes the expectation of good conduct outcomes as the operating norm for the organization, all employees, and third-party service providers operating on our behalf to drive positive outcomes for our clients, employees, other stakeholders, financial markets and our reputation. We hold ourselves to the highest standards of conduct to build the trust of our clients, colleagues and communities. The desired outcomes from effective culture and conduct practices align with our purpose and values and support our risk appetite statements.\n\nRisk culture is a subset of our overall culture that influences how, individually and collectively, we take and manage risks. Our risk culture helps us identify and understand risks, openly discuss risks and act on the organization's current and perceived future risks. Our risk culture practices are grounded in our existing risk management and human resource disciplines and protocols. When combined with the elements of effective leadership and values, these practices provide a base from which the resulting risk culture and conduct can be assessed, monitored, sustained and subjected to ongoing enhancement.\n\nOur Board-approved Enterprise Culture and Conduct Risks Framework provides organizational direction and describes our approach to a set of related topics applicable to all risk categories such as fair outcomes for clients and other stakeholders, and our culture, including accountability and risk culture, conduct risk, sales conduct and client practices, and misconduct.\n\nOn a regular basis, management communicates behavioural expectations to our employees with an emphasis on conduct and values. Our leadership model also supports and encourages effective challenge between the businesses and control functions. These behavioural expectations are supported by tools and resources which are designed to help employees live our values, report misconduct and raise concerns, including those that might have ethical implications. We are committed to fostering an environment where employees feel safe to speak up without retaliation. Employees have the ability to report matters through a global anonymous Conduct Hotline. In addition, our Code of Conduct outlines an employee's responsibility to be truthful, respect others and comply with laws, regulations and our policies. Anyone who breaches or fails to report an actual or possible breach of the Code of Conduct is subject to corrective or disciplinary action. This can range from reprimands and impacts on performance ratings and compensation, to termination of employment relationships with the organization. As well, Internal Audit conducts select behavioural science reviews to better understand and enhance employee attitudes and behaviours as they relate to risk management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulatory compliance risk\n\nRegulatory compliance risk is the risk of potential non-conformance with laws, rules, regulations and prescribed practices in any jurisdiction in which we operate. Issues regarding compliance with laws and regulations can arise in a number of areas in large complex financial institutions, such as ourselves, and are often the result of inadequate or failed internal processes, controls, people or systems. We currently are, and may be at any given time, subject to a number of legal and regulatory proceedings and subject to numerous governmental and regulatory examinations, investigations and other inquiries.",

        "page_content": "Laws and regulations are in place to protect the financial and other interests of our clients, shareholders and the public. As a large-scale global financial institution, we are subject to numerous laws and extensive and evolving regulation by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities and self-regulatory organizations in Canada, the U.S., the U.K., Europe and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulation continues to become increasingly extensive and complex. In addition, regulatory scrutiny and expectations in Canada, the U.S., the U.K., Europe and other jurisdictions for large financial institutions with respect to, among other things, governance, risk management practices and controls, and conduct, as well as the enforcement of regulatory compliance matters, has intensified. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements and expectations or to resolve any identified deficiencies could result in increased regulatory oversight and restrictions. Resolution of such matters can also result in the payment of substantial penalties, agreements with respect to future operation of our business, actions with respect to relevant personnel, admission of wrongdoing, and guilty pleas with respect to criminal charges, which may in turn prohibit us from conducting certain types of business absent regulatory relief.\n\nOperating in this increasingly complex regulatory environment and intense regulatory enforcement environment, we are and have been subject to a variety of legal proceedings, including civil claims and lawsuits, criminal charges, regulatory scrutiny, examinations and proceedings, investigations, audits and requests for information by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities in various jurisdictions, and we anticipate that our ongoing business activities will give rise to such matters in the future. The global scope of our operations also means that a single issue may give rise to overlapping regulatory investigations, regulatory proceedings and or civil litigation claims in different jurisdictions. RBC can be subject to such proceedings due to alleged violations of law or, if determined by regulators, allegedly inadequate policies, procedures, controls or remediation of deficiencies. Changes to laws, including tax laws, regulations or regulatory policies, as well as the changes in how they are interpreted, implemented or enforced, could adversely affect us, for example, by lowering barriers to entry in the businesses in which we operate, increasing our costs of compliance, or limiting our activities and ability to execute our strategic plans. In addition, the severity of the remedies sought in legal and regulatory proceedings to which RBC is subject have increased. Further, there is no assurance that we always will be, or be deemed to be, in compliance with laws, regulations or regulatory policies or expectations. Accordingly, it is possible that we could receive a judicial or regulatory enforcement judgment or decision that results in significant fines, damages, penalties, and other costs or injunctions, criminal convictions, or loss of licenses or registrations that would damage our reputation, and negatively impact our earnings and ability to conduct some of our businesses. We are also subject to litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business and the adverse resolution of any litigation could have a significant adverse effect on our results or could give rise to significant reputational damage, which in turn could impact our future business prospects.\n\nOur Regulatory Compliance Management Framework outlines how we manage and mitigate the regulatory compliance risks associated with failing to comply with, or adapt to, current and changing laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nRegulatory compliance risk includes the regulatory risks associated with financial crimes (which include, but are not limited to, money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery, corruption, and violations of economic sanctions), privacy, market conduct, consumer protection and business conduct, as well as prudential and other generally applicable non-financial requirements. Specific compliance policies, procedures and supporting frameworks have been developed to seek to manage regulatory compliance risk.\n\n## Strategic risk drivers\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nStrategic risk is the risk that the enterprise or particular business areas will make inappropriate strategic choices, or will be unable to successfully implement selected strategies or achieve the expected benefits. Business strategy is a major driver of our risk appetite and consequently the strategic choices we make in terms of business mix determine how our risk profile changes.\n\nResponsibility for selecting and successfully implementing business strategies is mandated to the individual heads of each business segment. Oversight of strategic risk is the responsibility of the heads of the business segments and their operating committees, the Enterprise Strategy & Transformation group, the GE and the Board. The Enterprise Strategy & Transformation group supports the management of strategic risk through the strategic planning process, articulated within our Enterprise Strategic Planning Policy, ensuring alignment across our business, financial, capital and risk planning.\n\nOur annual business portfolio review and project approval request processes help to identify and mitigate strategic risk by seeking to ensure that strategies for new initiatives, lines of business, and the enterprise as a whole align with our risk appetite and risk posture. GRM provides oversight of strategic risk by providing independent reviews of these processes, establishing enterprise risk frameworks, and independently monitoring and reporting on the level of risk established against our risk appetite metrics in accordance with the three lines of defence governance model.\n\nFor details on the key strategic priorities for our business segments, refer to the Business segment results section.\n\n## Reputation risk\n\nReputation risk is the risk of an adverse impact on stakeholders' perception of RBC due to i) perceived or actual misalignment between stakeholder perceptions of RBC and the actions or inactions of the bank, its employees, or individuals or groups affiliated with RBC (e.g. stakeholder perceptions of our role as a good corporate citizen), ii) negative or shifting public sentiment on existing, evolving, or emerging industry or global issues, or iii) negative outcomes relating to any risk inherent to the financial services industry, including ineffective management of these risks, or situations beyond our control such as external events or systemic risks. A strong and trustworthy reputation will generally strengthen our market position, reduce the cost of capital, increase shareholder value, strengthen our resiliency, and help attract and retain top talent. Conversely, damage to our reputation can result in reduced share price and market capitalization, increased cost of capital, loss of strategic flexibility, inability to enter or expand into markets, loss of client loyalty and business, regulatory fines and penalties, restrictive agreements with regulators or prosecutors, or criminal prosecutions. The sources of reputation risk are widespread. Reputation risk is a transverse risk which can manifest as an outcome of other risk types including but not limited to credit, regulatory, legal, operational, and environmental and social risks. We can also experience reputation risk from a failure to maintain an effective control environment, exhibit good conduct and maintain appropriate cultural practices.",

        "page_content": "Managing our reputation risk is an integral part of our organizational culture and our overall enterprise risk management approach, as well as a priority for employees and our Board. Our Board-approved Reputation Risk Management Framework provides an overview of our approach to identify, assess, manage, monitor and report on reputation risk. This framework outlines governance authorities, roles and responsibilities, and controls and mechanisms to manage our reputation risk, including our culture of integrity, compliance with our Code of Conduct and operating within our risk appetite.\n\nOur governance of reputation risk aims to be holistic and provides an integrated view of potential reputation issues across the organization. This governance structure is designed to ensure that ownership and accountability for reputation risk are understood across the enterprise, both proactive and reactive reputation risk decisions are escalated to senior management for review and evaluation, and reporting on reputation risk is comprehensive and integrated.\n\n## Legal and regulatory environment risk\n\nLegal and regulatory environment risk is the risk that new or modified laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of laws and regulations, will negatively impact the way in which we operate, both in Canada and in the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business. The full impact of some of these changes on our business will not be known until final rules are implemented and market practices have developed in response. We continue to respond to these and other developments and are working to minimize any potential adverse business or economic impact. The following provides a high-level summary of some of the key regulatory changes that have potential to increase or decrease our costs, impact our profitability and increase the complexity of our operations.\n\n## Global uncertainty\n\nSignificant uncertainty about inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions continues to pose risks to the global economic outlook. In October 2023, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected global growth of 3.0% in calendar 2023 which remains unchanged from its July 2023 forecast and is up from 2.7% in October 2022. The IMF projected global growth in 2024 of 2.9%. The global growth recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict remains slow and uneven, as economic activity in certain geographies has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels, resulting in regional divergences. The resolution of the U.S. debt ceiling standoff, and decisive actions taken by global authorities to contain instability in the U.S. regional banking sector have reduced the immediate risks of financial turmoil. However, uncertainty remains regarding: interest rates being sustained at higher levels for longer; the severity and impact of central banks' monetary policy tightening as they attempt to reduce persistent levels of elevated inflation; ongoing geopolitical tensions, including those between Russia and Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East; extreme weather-related events; and the potential re-emergence of financial sector instability as banks face regulatory reform in the U.S. Our diversified business model, as well as our product and geographic diversification, continue to help mitigate the risks posed by global uncertainty.\n\n## Environment and social-related legal and regulatory activity\n\nEnvironmental and social-related regulations, frameworks, and guidance that apply to banks, insurers and asset managers continue to rapidly evolve. As such, new or heightened requirements could result in increased regulatory, compliance or other costs or higher capital requirements, and may subject us to different and potentially conflicting requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We continue to monitor the development of applicable laws in this area, including but not limited to the evolution of disclosure requirements for public issuers and climate risk management requirements for financial institutions.\n\nIn Canada, OSFI released its final Guideline B-15 - Climate Risk Management on March 7, 2023, which sets out expectations for the management and disclosure of climate-related risks for federally regulated financial institutions (FRFIs) and aims to support FRFIs in developing greater resilience to, and management of, these risks. The first set of guidelines will be effective fiscal year-end 2024, with annual disclosures required to be made publicly available no later than 180 days after fiscal year-end. OSFI intends to review and amend the guideline as practices and standards evolve. We are currently assessing the impact of the guideline and have initiated work to meet the requirements by the effective date.\n\nIn the U.S., the SEC issued proposed rule changes on March 21, 2022, which would require many registrants to include certain climate-related disclosures in their regulatory filings, including the financial statements. We continue to monitor developments in this area. In addition, various states in the United States have enacted or proposed statutes or regulations addressing environmental and/or social matters. As environmental and social issues become more politicized, statutes or regulations in certain states may be interpreted to prohibit governmental entities, such as public pension funds and issuers of municipal bonds, from doing business with certain financial institutions, and political pressure may be placed upon governmental entities to not do business with certain financial institutions, based on the financial institutions' perceived positions on certain environmental and/or social matters. We continue to monitor developments in this area and assess their impacts on our businesses.\n\nInternationally, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) issued its inaugural standards on June 26, 2023, being IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosures of Sustainability-related Financial Information and IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures (collectively, the ISSB Standards). IFRS S1 sets out general reporting requirements for disclosing sustainabilityrelated financial information. IFRS S2 requires an entity to disclose information about climate-related risks and opportunities and the impact on an entity's financial position, performance, cash flows, strategy and business model. The applicability of the standards and the effective date for Canadian reporting issuers is subject to adoption by Canadian regulators, and we continue to monitor communication from the Canadian Securities Administrators.\n\nIn addition, the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) requires reporting under the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). The ESRS, which were adopted by the European Commission on July 31, 2023, set out the requirements for companies to report on sustainability-related impacts, opportunities and risks. We are currently assessing the impact of the CSRD.\n\nWe continue to monitor trends in climate-related litigation and regulatory enforcement actions, including those involving claims of 'greenwashing', which generally refer to claims that false or misleading information about an organization's products or services or operations has been conveyed to suggest that the organization is doing more to protect the environment than it is, and to assess the impact on our litigation and regulatory compliance risks.",

        "page_content": "## Government of Canada 2023 Budget\n\nOn March 28, 2023, the Government of Canada presented its 2023 budget ('Budget 2023'), which introduced a number of proposed measures including a proposal to deny the dividend received deduction in respect of dividends received by financial institutions after December 31, 2023 on shares of corporations resident in Canada where such shares are mark-to-market property for tax purposes, and a new 2% tax on net share buybacks for publicly listed corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2024. Budget 2023 also reinforced the Government of Canada's commitment to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's two-pillar plan for international tax reform, including a global 15% minimum tax on multinational enterprises, and associated draft legislation for a Global Minimum Tax Act was published on August 4, 2023 and the period for public comment was closed on September 29, 2023. Timing of enactment of these changes remains uncertain, and legislation remains subject to amendment prior to enactment. The ultimate impact of the proposed measures will depend on the final legislation.\n\nBudget 2023 also introduced harmonized sales tax (HST) on payment card clearing services, to be applied prospectively in all cases and retroactively under certain circumstances. A bill with this legislation received royal assent and became law on June 22, 2023.\n\n## Third-party risk management\n\nOn April 24, 2023, OSFI released its final Guideline B-10 - Third-Party Risk Management, which sets out expectations for managing risks associated with third-party arrangements for FRFIs.\n\nThis guideline will be effective on May 1, 2024. We have assessed the requirements and do not anticipate any issues in complying with the requirements by the effective date.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nAs part of the interest rate benchmark reform, the publication of all remaining USD London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings ceased on June 30, 2023. As at October 31, 2023, and consistent with our transition plan, our exposure to financial instruments referencing USD LIBOR is no longer material. For further details, refer to Note 2 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAdditionally, on July 27, 2023 the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate Working Group published a market notice confirming that effective November 1, 2023, no new CDOR or Bankers' Acceptance (BA) based lending will be permitted. This announcement does not impact the ability to draw on existing CDOR or BA loan facilities entered into prior to November 1, 2023 and is in line with OSFI's expectations. Our transition plan has been updated to reflect this announcement.\n\n## Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) special assessment\n\nOn November 16, 2023, the FDIC Board of Directors approved the imposition of a special assessment on certain U.S. depository institutions to recover the cost associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The special assessment will be assessed at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points of a U.S. depository institution's uninsured deposits over a specified threshold, to be collected over an anticipated eight quarterly assessment periods with the first quarterly assessment period beginning January 1, 2024. The cost of the special assessment for us is expected to be approximately US$120 million.\n\nFor further details on regulatory capital and related requirements, refer to the risk and Capital management sections of this 2023 Annual Report.\n\n## Competitive risk\n\nCompetitive risk is the risk of an inability to build or maintain a sustainable competitive advantage in a given market or markets and includes the potential for loss of market share due to competitors offering superior products and services. Competitive risk can arise from within or outside the financial sector, from traditional or non-traditional competitors, domestically or globally. There is intense competition for clients among financial services companies. Client loyalty and retention can be influenced by several factors, including new technology used or services offered by our competitors, relative service levels and prices, product and service attributes, reputation, actions taken by our competitors, and adherence with competition and anti-trust laws. Other companies, such as insurance companies and non-financial companies, as well as new technological applications, are increasingly offering services traditionally provided by banks. This competition could also reduce our revenue which could adversely affect our results.\n\nWe identify and assess competitive risks as part of our overall risk management process. Our products and services are regularly benchmarked against existing and potential competitors. In addition, we regularly conduct risk reviews of our products, services, mergers and acquisitions strategy, and we seek to ensure adherence to competition and anti-trust laws. Our annual strategy-setting process also plays an integral role in managing competitive risk.\n\n## Macroeconomic risk drivers\n\n## Systemic risk\n\nSystemic risk is the risk that the financial system as a whole, or a major part of it - either in an individual country, a region or globally - is put in real and immediate danger of collapse or serious damage due to an unforeseen event causing a substantive shock to the financial system with the likelihood of material damage to the economy, and which would result in financial, reputation, legal or other risks for us.\n\nSystemic risk is considered to be the least controllable risk, leading to increased vulnerabilities as experienced during the 2008 global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, U.S. regional bank failures highlighted the potential vulnerability of the financial system to systemic risks, particularly given tightening financial regulations and technology-driven increases in transaction velocity. Our ability to mitigate systemic risk when undertaking business activities is limited, other than through collaborative mechanisms between key industry participants, and, as appropriate, the public sector and regulators to reduce the frequency and impact of these risks. The two most significant measures in mitigating the impact of systemic risk are diversification and stress testing.",

        "page_content": "Our diversified business model, portfolios, products, activities and funding sources help mitigate the potential impacts from systemic risk. Our established risk limits also seek to ensure our portfolio is diversified, and concentration risk is reduced and remains within our risk appetite.\n\nStress testing involves consideration of the simultaneous movements in several risk factors. Stress testing seeks to ensure our business strategies and capital planning are robust by measuring the potential impacts of credit, market, liquidity and operational risks, under adverse economic conditions. Our enterprise-wide stress testing program evaluates the potential effects of a set of specified changes in risk factors, corresponding to exceptional but plausible adverse economic and financial market events. These stress scenarios are evaluated across the organization, and results are integrated to develop an enterprise-wide view of the impacts on our financial results and capital requirements. For further details on our stress testing, refer to the Enterprise risk management section.\n\nOur financial results are affected by the business and economic conditions in the geographic regions in which we operate. These conditions include consumer saving and spending habits as well as consumer borrowing and repayment patterns, business investment, government spending, exchange rates, sovereign debt risks, the level of activity and volatility of the capital markets, strength of the economy and inflation. Given the importance of our Canadian and U.S. operations, an economic downturn may largely affect our personal and business lending activities and may result in higher provisions for credit losses. Deterioration and uncertainty in global capital markets could result in continued high volatility that would impact results in Capital Markets. In Wealth Management, weaker market conditions could lead to lower average fee-based client assets and transaction volumes. In addition, worsening financial and credit market conditions may adversely affect our ability to access capital markets on favourable terms and could negatively affect our liquidity, resulting in increased funding costs and lower transaction volumes in Capital Markets and Wealth Management.\n\nOur financial results are also sensitive to changes in interest rates. To address persistent inflationary pressures, major central banks continued increasing benchmark interest rates during fiscal 2023 and the future path of monetary policy is uncertain. While there may be a potential benefit to our NIM, elevated interest rates generally result in higher funding costs. If elevated interest rates are coupled with persistent inflation, it could increase market volatility and reduce asset values, and adversely impact household and corporate balance sheets. This could lead to credit deterioration and impact our financial results, particularly in our Personal & Commercial Banking, Wealth Management and Capital Markets businesses.\n\n## Overview of other risks\n\nIn addition to the risks described in the risk sections, there are other risk factors, described below, which may affect our businesses and financial results. The following discussion is not exhaustive as other factors could also adversely affect our results.\n\n## Government fiscal, monetary and other policies\n\nOur businesses and earnings are affected by monetary policies that are adopted by the BoC, the Fed in the U.S., the ECB in the European Union (EU), the BoE in the U.K. and monetary authorities in other jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as the fiscal policies of the governments of Canada, the U.S., the U.K., Europe and such other jurisdictions. Such policies can also adversely affect our clients and counterparties in Canada, the U.S. and internationally, which may increase the risk of default by such clients and counterparties.\n\n## Tax risk and transparency\n\nTax risk refers to the risk of loss related to unexpected tax liabilities. The tax laws and systems that are applicable to us are complex and wide-ranging. As a result, we seek to ensure that any decisions or actions related to tax always reflect our assessment of the long-term costs and risks involved, including their impact on our reputation and our relationship with clients, shareholders and regulators.\n\nOur approach to taxation is grounded in principles which are reflected in our Code of Conduct, is governed by our Enterprise Tax Risk Management Policy, and incorporates the fundamentals of our risk drivers. Oversight of our tax policy and the management of tax risk is the responsibility of the GE, the CFO and the Senior Vice President, Taxation. We discuss our tax strategy with the Audit Committee annually and provide updates on our tax position on a regular basis.\n\nOur tax strategy is designed to provide transparency and support our business strategy, and is aligned with our corporate vision and values. We seek to maximize shareholder value by structuring our businesses in a tax-efficient manner while considering reputation risk by being in compliance with all laws and regulations. Our policy requires that we:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Act with integrity and in a straightforward, open and honest manner in all tax matters;\n- GLYPH<129> Ensure tax strategy is aligned with our business strategy supporting only bona fide transactions with a business purpose and economic substance;\n- GLYPH<129> Ensure all intercompany transactions are conducted in accordance with applicable transfer pricing requirements;\n- GLYPH<129> Ensure our full compliance and full disclosure to tax authorities of our statutory obligations; and\n- GLYPH<129> Endeavour to work with the tax authorities to build positive long-term relationships and where disputes occur, address them constructively.\n\nWith respect to assessing the needs of our clients, we consider a number of factors including the purpose of the transactions. We seek to ensure that we only support bona fide client transactions with a business purpose and economic substance. Should we become aware of client transactions that are aimed at evading their tax obligations, we will not proceed with the transactions.\n\nWe operate in 29 countries worldwide. Our activities in these countries are subject to both Canadian and international tax legislation and other regulations, and are fully disclosed to the relevant tax authorities. The Taxation group and GRM both regularly review the activities of all entities in an effort to ensure compliance with tax requirements and other regulations.\n\nGiven that we operate globally, complex tax legislation and accounting principles have resulted in differing legal interpretations between the respective tax authorities we deal with and ourselves, and we are at risk of tax authorities disagreeing with prior positions we have taken for tax purposes. When this occurs, we are committed to an open and transparent dialogue with the tax authorities to facilitate a quick assessment and prompt resolution of the issues where possible. Failure to",

In Canada, total income and other tax expense for the year ended October 31, 2023 to various levels of government totalled $4 billion (2022 - $5 billion).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on income and other tax expense, refer to the Financial performance section.\n\n## Environmental and social risk\n\nEnvironmental and social (E&S) risk is the potential for an E&S issue associated with us, a client, transaction, product, supplier or activity, to have a negative impact on us, including our financial position, operations, legal and regulatory compliance, or reputation. It refers to the risk that we face as a result of the manner in which we, a supplier or a client manages E&S issues or relationships with stakeholders and communities.\n\nE&S issues include, but are not limited to, site contamination, waste management, land and resource use, biodiversity, water quality and availability, climate change, environmental regulation, human rights (including, but not limited to social and racial inequality and Indigenous Peoples' rights), and community engagement.\n\nE&S risks, including climate risk, are each unique and transverse risks and impact all our principal risk types in different ways and to varying degrees, including but not limited to strategic, operational, credit, reputation, legal and regulatory environment, and regulatory compliance risks. See the Climate risk section below for additional information specific to climate risk.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Board oversees how we manage our E&S risks, our enterprise approach to E&S risks, and how we conduct our business to meet high standards of E&S responsibility. The Board approved our updated climate strategy, the RBC Climate Blueprint, which was published in February 2022. The Committees of the Board have oversight of E&S risks that are specific to their respective responsibilities, with the Governance Committee playing a specific oversight and coordination role over ESG matters, including over certain of our ESG-related disclosures. For further details on risk governance, refer to the Enterprise risk management - Risk governance section.\n\nRoles and responsibilities related to E&S risk management are governed by the Enterprise Risk Management Framework and the three lines of defence governance model. Business segments and functional areas are responsible for incorporating E&S risk management requirements within their own operations, while GRM is responsible for developing and maintaining an integrated enterprise view of E&S risk, including establishing policies and procedures, and performing effective challenge and oversight in relation to E&S risk.\n\n## Risk management\n\nWe seek to integrate E&S risk considerations into our risk management processes. We continue to evolve our approach to E&S risk by leveraging existing risk management capabilities, and where new capability builds are required, we incorporate regulatory guidance, industry best practices and improved data analytics to identify and assess, measure, manage, mitigate, monitor and report on potential impacts to clients, portfolios, and our operations.\n\nOur Enterprise Policy on Environmental (including climate) and Social Risk (E&S Risk Policy) 1 serves as the foundation for our approach to managing E&S risks arising from our activities. It outlines our principles for E&S risk management, and sets out standards for how E&S risks arising from our activities are identified, assessed, measured, managed, mitigated, monitored and reported.\n\nThe E&S Risk Policy is supported by additional policies and procedures on E&S risk management for business segments, which includes an enhanced due diligence process which we undertake for certain corporate and commercial clients, to identify E&S issues that may drive E&S risk for RBC. As a signatory to the Equator Principles (EP) framework, we also have a procedure that outlines our governance for managing E&S risks related to certain project finance-related transactions. We also have policy guidelines 2 in place for sensitive sectors and activities, which address our financing activities to clients and projects operating in the coal-fired power generation and coal mining sectors, the Arctic ecosystem, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites.",

        "page_content": "## Climate risk\n\nClimate risk is the risk related to the global transition to a net-zero economy (transition risk) and the physical impacts of climate change (physical risk), which includes both chronic (longer-term) risks (e.g., rising sea levels and increases in average temperatures) and acute (event driven) risks (e.g., wildfires and floods). Both we and our clients may be exposed to climaterelated transition risk, including through emerging regulatory and legal requirements, changing business and consumer sentiment towards products and services, technological developments, and changes in stakeholder expectations. Additionally, we and our clients may be vulnerable to climate-related physical risk through disruptions to operations and services.\n\nWe continue to advance our climate risk measurement, management, monitoring and reporting capabilities and our understanding of the impact climate-related risks may have on our business and our clients' businesses.\n\nWe maintain a diversified lending portfolio, which improves our resilience to geographic or sectoral downturns and limits concentrations of credit exposure to climate risk. We continue to build our capability to assess the potential impact of both transition and physical risk on our portfolio. In particular, we conduct portfolio, client and scenario analyses to assess our exposure to, and the impact of, climate-related risks. As part of our annual stress testing and analysis, we continue to integrate components of climate risk through transition and physical risk stresses and to assess its impact on our key portfolios. We seek to improve data quality to further identify those sectors within our wholesale portfolio that are most affected by physical and transition risk. We are continuing to expand our climate data inventory and enhance our climate data governance processes, to improve our climate risk analytical capabilities.\n\nWe classify critical environment sites based on our business risk tolerance for site-specific downtime and, among other things, site location, power supply, exposure to flooding, geological stability, and other hazards. We also take steps to mitigate and adapt to climate change through our building design and our purchasing decisions.\n\nOur continued development of our climate risk measurement capabilities will inform the enhancements to our climate risk management practices and advance the integration of climate risks into our policies and procedures.\n\n## Human rights and codes of conduct\n\nOur approach to identifying, assessing, managing and mitigating social issues such as human rights issues, is set out in our E&S Risk Policy, and is supported by additional policies and position statements that reflect our approach to managing our businesses in a responsible manner.\n\nRBC is committed to respecting human rights, including those of any clients, employees, third parties with whom we conduct business or who may be affected by our business activities - either directly or indirectly - and to taking the actions set out in RBC's Human Rights Position Statement (Statement) in order to meet the responsibility of businesses like ours to respect human rights as set out in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Our Statement is adopted at the highest levels of our organization and is published on our website.\n\nOur Modern Slavery Act Statement is published annually and sets out our commitment to preventing slavery and human trafficking from taking place in our businesses and in our supply chains.\n\nOur Code of Conduct establishes standards of desired behaviour that apply to all directors, employees, and contract workers of the bank and its subsidiaries. In addition, our principles-based Supplier Code of Conduct articulates our expectations with respect to a supplier's business integrity, responsible business practices and responsible treatment of individuals and the environment.\n\n## Framework and commitments\n\nWe are a participant or signatory to various industry principles and initiatives that are designed to help mitigate E&S risk within our business activities or advance responsible business practices, including but not limited to the following:\n\n- GLYPH<129> RBC is a member of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), which is a global industry-led initiative to accelerate and support efforts to address climate change by aligning member banks' lending and investment portfolios with net-zero emissions by 2050 3 . As a member of the NZBA, we made a commitment to setting and disclosing interim emissions reduction targets for our key high-emitting sectors.\n- GLYPH<129> RBC is a member of the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), which is an industry-led partnership to facilitate transparency and enable financial institutions to assess and disclose greenhouse gas emissions of loans and investments. In October 2022, in accordance with our NZBA commitment, we published our initial interim emissions reduction targets in our lending activities for the oil and gas, power generation and automotive sectors 3 .\n- GLYPH<129> RBC is a signatory to the Equator Principles (EP), which is a benchmark for determining, assessing and managing E&S risks for project finance. We report annually on projects assessed according to the EP framework.\n- GLYPH<129> RBC GAM and Brewin Dolphin Holdings Limited are signatories to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI) and report on their responsible investment activities to the UN PRI.\n\nIn addition, we are committed to providing $500 billion in sustainable finance by 2025 4 . In October 2022, we published our approach and methodology for classifying, tracking, and disclosing progress towards our sustainable finance commitment and to support the identification of new growth opportunities for our clients and our business.\n\nWe may be exposed to legal, regulatory or reputation risk in the event that we do not fully implement these frameworks or meet these commitments, goals or targets, either as a result of our own actions or due to external factors. More specifically, our ability to achieve our climate and sustainable finance-related commitments, goals and targets, including those discussed above, will depend on the collective efforts and actions across a wide range of stakeholders outside of our control, and there can be no assurance that they will be achieved 5 .",

        "page_content": "## Legal and regulatory developments\n\nEnvironmental and social-related regulations, frameworks, and guidance that apply to banks, insurers and asset managers continue to rapidly evolve. As such, new or heightened requirements could result in increased regulatory, compliance or other costs or higher capital requirements, and may subject us to different and potentially conflicting requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. As regulatory requirements evolve, we will continue to monitor such developments and update our risk management practices and disclosures as necessary. See the Legal and regulatory environment risk section for further details.\n\n## Capital management\n\nWe actively manage our capital to maintain strong capital ratios and high ratings while providing strong returns to our shareholders. In addition to the regulatory requirements, we consider the expectations of credit rating agencies, depositors and shareholders, as well as our business plans, stress tests, peer comparisons and our internal capital ratio targets. Our goal is to optimize our capital usage and structure, and to provide support for our business segments and clients. We also aim to generate optimal returns for our shareholders, while protecting depositors and creditors.\n\n## Capital management framework\n\nOur capital management framework establishes policies and processes for defining, measuring, raising and investing all forms of capital in a coordinated and consistent manner. It sets our overall approach to capital management, including guiding principles and roles and responsibilities relating to capital adequacy and transactions, dividends, solo capital, and management of RWA, leverage ratio exposures, TLAC capital and TLAC leverage ratios. We manage and monitor capital from several perspectives, including regulatory capital, solo capital and TLAC.\n\nOur capital planning process is dynamic and involves various teams including Finance, Corporate Treasury, GRM, Economics and our businesses, and covers internal capital ratio targets, potential capital transactions as well as projected dividend payouts and share repurchases. This process considers our business operating plans, enterprise-wide stress testing and ICAAP, regulatory capital changes and supervisory requirements, accounting changes, internal capital requirements, rating agency metrics and solo capital.\n\nOur capital plan is established on an annual basis and is aligned with the management actions included in the annual business operating plan, which includes forecast growth in assets and earnings taking into account our business strategies, the projected market and economic environment, and peer positioning. This includes incorporating potential capital transactions based on our projected internal capital generation, business forecasts, market conditions and other developments, such as accounting and regulatory changes that may impact capital requirements. All of the components in the capital plan are monitored throughout the year and are revised as deemed appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncapital ratios\n\nOur enterprise-wide stress testing and annual ICAAP processes provide key inputs for capital planning, including setting internal capital ratio targets. The stress scenarios are evaluated across the organization, and results are integrated to develop an enterprise-wide view of financial impacts and capital requirements, which in turn facilitate the planning of mitigating actions to absorb adverse events. ICAAP assesses capital adequacy and requirements covering all material risks, with a cushion for plausible contingencies. In accordance with OSFI guidelines, major components of our ICAAP process include comprehensive risk assessment, stress testing, capital assessment and planning, Board and senior management oversight, monitoring and reporting and internal control review.\n\nOur internal capital targets are established to maintain robust capital positions in excess of OSFI's Basel III regulatory targets. The results of our enterprise-wide stress testing and ICAAP processes are incorporated into the OSFI Capital Buffers, Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIB)/Globally Systemically Important Banks (G-SIB) surcharge, and Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB), with a view to ensure that the bank has adequate capital to underpin risks and absorb losses under all plausible stress scenarios given our risk profile and appetite. In addition, we include a discretionary cushion on top of OSFI's regulatory targets to reflect our risk appetite, our forecasts of potential negative downturns and to maintain our capital strength for forthcoming regulatory and accounting changes, peer comparatives, rating agencies sensitivities, future acquisitions and solo capital level.\n\nThe Board is responsible for the ultimate oversight of capital management, including the annual review and approval of the capital plan. ALCO and GE share responsibility for capital management and receive regular reports detailing our compliance with approved limits and guidelines. The Audit and Risk Committees jointly approve the ICAAP process.\n\n## Basel III\n\nOur consolidated regulatory capital requirements are determined by OSFI's Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) guidelines, which are based on the minimum Basel III capital ratio requirements adopted by the BCBS.\n\nUnder Basel III, banks select from two main approaches, the Standardized Approach (SA) or the IRB Approach, to calculate their minimum regulatory capital required to support credit, market and operational risks. We adopted the Basel III IRB approach to calculate credit risk capital for consolidated regulatory reporting purposes. While the majority of our credit risk exposures are reported under the Basel III IRB Approach for regulatory capital purposes, certain portfolios continue to use the Basel III SA for credit risk, primarily in Wealth Management, including our City National wholesale portfolio, and our Caribbean Banking operations. For consolidated regulatory reporting of market risk capital, we currently use both the Internal Models-based and Standardized Approaches. For consolidated regulatory reporting of operational risk capital we use the SA, as implemented under Basel III. We determine our regulatory leverage ratio based on OSFI's LR Guideline, which reflects the BCBS Basel III leverage ratio requirements.",

The FSB publishes an updated list of G-SIBs annually. On November 27, 2023, we were re-designated as a G-SIB by the FSB. This designation requires us to maintain a higher loss absorbency requirement (common equity as a percentage of RWA) of 1% consistent with the D-SIB requirement.\n\nOSFI's TLAC guideline establishes two minimum standards: the risk-based TLAC ratio, which builds on the risk-based capital ratios described in the CAR guideline, and the TLAC leverage ratio, which builds on the leverage ratio described in OSFI's LR guideline. The TLAC requirement is intended to address the sufficiency of a D-SIB's loss absorbing capacity in supporting its recapitalization in the event of its failure. TLAC is defined as the aggregate of Tier 1 capital, Tier 2 capital and external TLAC instruments which allow conversion in whole or in part into common shares under the CDIC Act and meet all of the eligibility criteria under the TLAC guideline.\n\nOSFI requires all D-SIBs to publicly disclose their Pillar 2 DSB requirement as part of their quarterly disclosures, similar to other current capital-related disclosure requirements. The level of the Pillar 2 buffer ranges between 0% and 4% of the entity's total RWA for each of the six systemically important banks in Canada. The DSB requirements must be met at the CET1 capital level. OSFI undertakes a review of the DSB on a semi-annual basis, in June and December, and will publicly announce any changes at that time.\n\nOn December 8, 2022, OSFI announced an increase in the DSB upper limit to 4% of total RWA from the upper limit of 2.5% of total RWA, and an increase to the DSB level of 50 bps to 3%, effective February 1, 2023. On June 20, 2023, OSFI announced an increase in the DSB level from the current 3% to 3.5% of total RWA effective November 1, 2023.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of OSFI's current regulatory target ratios under Basel III and Pillar 2 requirements. We are in compliance with all current capital, leverage and TLAC requirements imposed by OSFI:\n\n| Basel III - OSFI regulatory targets   Table 65    | Basel III - OSFI regulatory targets   Table 65

Regulatory adjustments under Basel III include full deductions of certain items and additional capital components that are subject to threshold deductions as prescribed in the CAR guidelines.\n\nTier 1 capital comprises predominantly CET1 and Additional Tier 1 items including non-cumulative preferred shares and limited recourse capital notes (LRCNs) that meet certain criteria. Tier 2 capital primarily includes subordinated debentures that meet certain criteria and certain loan loss allowances. Total capital is defined as the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Preferred shares, LRCNs, and subordinated debentures issued after January 1, 2013 require Non-viability contingent capital (NVCC) features to be included into regulatory capital. NVCC requirements ensure that non-common regulatory capital instruments bear losses before banks seek government funding.\n\nTLAC available is defined as the sum of Total capital and external TLAC instruments. External TLAC instruments comprise predominantly senior bail-in debt, which includes eligible senior unsecured debt with an original term to maturity of greater than 400 days and remaining term to maturity of greater than 365 days.\n\nCapital ratios are calculated by dividing CET1, Tier 1, Total capital and TLAC available by total RWA.\n\nThe following chart provides a summary of the major components of CET1, Additional Tier 1, Tier 2 capital and external TLAC instruments.\n\nDeductions\n\n(2)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThreshold\n\nDeductions\n\n- (1) In accordance with OSFI's regulatory adjustments announced in Q2 2020, our 2022 figures include capital modifications associated with Stage 1 and 2 allowances which were subject to a 25% after-tax exclusion rate in fiscal 2022.

These factors were partially offset by RWA growth (excluding FX) and the impact of the CRD and other tax related adjustments.\n\nOur Tier 1 capital ratio of 15.7% was up 190 bps, mainly reflecting the factors noted above under the CET1 ratio.\n\nOur Total capital ratio of 17.6% was up 220 bps, mainly reflecting the factors noted above under the Tier 1 capital ratio and a favourable impact from the net issuance of subordinated debentures.\n\nOur Leverage ratio of 4.3% was down 10 bps, mainly due to the reversal of the regulatory modification for central bank reserves qualifying as HQLA, business-driven growth in leverage exposures and the impact of the CRD and other tax related adjustments. These factors were partially offset by net internal capital generation and the impacts of share issuances under the DRIP, the partial sale of RBC Investor Services operations and the Basel III reforms.\n\nLeverage exposures increased by $282 billion, mainly driven by the reversal of the regulatory modification noted above, business growth primarily in securities, personal and commercial lending in Canada, repo-style transactions and undrawn commitments, partially offset by lower interest-bearing deposits with banks and cash. The impact of foreign exchange translation also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by the impact of the partial sale of RBC Investor Services operations and the Basel III reforms.\n\nOur TLAC ratio of 31.0% was up 460 bps, reflecting the factors noted above under the Total capital ratio, as well as a favourable impact from a net increase in eligible external TLAC instruments.\n\nOur TLAC leverage ratio of 8.5% was unchanged, reflecting the factors noted above under the Leverage ratio offset by a favourable impact from a net increase in eligible external TLAC instruments.\n\nExternal TLAC instruments include long-term senior debt subject to conversion into common shares under the Bail-in regime. For further details, refer to Deposit and funding profile in the Liquidity and funding risk section.\n\n## Basel III RWA\n\nOSFI requires banks to meet minimum risk-based capital requirements for exposures to credit risk, operational risk, and where they have significant trading activity, market risk. RWA is calculated for each of these risk types and added together to determine total RWA. In addition, a minimum capital floor requirement must be maintained as prescribed under OSFI's CAR guidelines which is currently set to 65% of RWA as calculated under current Basel III standardized credit risk and market risk approaches as defined in the CAR guidelines. If the capital requirement is less than the required threshold, a floor adjustment to RWA must be applied to the reported RWA as prescribed by OSFI's CAR guidelines.",

This was partially offset by the net impact of business growth, primarily in personal and commercial lending in Canada that was partly offset by lower corporate lending and trading related activities. The impact of foreign exchange translation and net credit migration, primarily in our wholesale portfolios, also partially offset the impact from the Basel III reforms. In our CET1 ratio, the impact of foreign exchange translation on RWA is largely mitigated with economic hedges.",

        "page_content": "## Attributed capital\n\nOur methodology for allocating capital to our business segments is based on the Basel III regulatory capital requirements, with the exception of Insurance. For Insurance, the allocation of capital is based on fully diversified economic capital. Risk-based capital attribution provides a uniform base for performance measurement among business segments, which compares to our overall corporate return objective and facilitates management decisions in resource allocation in conjunction with other factors.\n\nThe calculation and attribution of capital involves a number of assumptions and judgments by management which are monitored to ensure that the regulatory capital framework remains comprehensive and consistent. The models are benchmarked to leading industry practices via participation in surveys, reviews of methodologies and ongoing interaction with external risk management industry professionals.\n\nFor additional information on the risks highlighted below, refer to the Risk management section.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) RWA amount represents period-end spot balances. Attributed Capital represents average balances.\n- (2) Other includes (a) non-Insurance segments: equity required to underpin Basel III regulatory capital deductions other than Goodwill and other intangibles as well as capital modifications for expected loss provisioning and (b) Insurance segment: equity required to underpin risks associated with business, fixed assets and insurance risks.\n- (3) Insurance RWA represents our investments in the insurance subsidiaries capitalized at the regulatory prescribed rate as required under the OSFI CAR guideline.\n\n## Other considerations affecting capital\n\nCapital treatment for equity investments in other entities is determined by a combination of accounting and regulatory guidelines based on the size or nature of the investment. Three broad approaches apply as follows:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Consolidation: entities which we control are consolidated on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n- GLYPH<129> Deduction: certain holdings are deducted from our regulatory capital. These include all unconsolidated 'substantial investments', as defined by the Bank Act (Canada) in the capital of financial institutions, as well as all investments in insurance subsidiaries and certain equity investments in funds.\n- GLYPH<129> Risk-weighting: equity investments that are not deducted from capital are risk-weighted at a prescribed rate for determination of capital charges.\n\n## Regulatory capital approach for securitization exposures\n\nOur securitization regulatory capital approach reflects Chapter 6 of OSFI's CAR guidelines. For our securitization exposures, we use an internal assessment approach (IAA) for exposures related to our ABCP business, and as per regulatory guidelines for other securitization exposures we use a combination of approaches including an external ratings-based approach, an IRB approach and a standardized approach.\n\nWhile our IAA rating methodologies are based in large part on criteria that are published by External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) such as S&P and therefore are similar to the methodologies used by these institutions, they are not identical. Our ratings process includes a comparison of the available credit enhancement in a securitization structure to a stressed level of projected losses. The stress level used is determined by the desired risk profile of the transaction. As a result, we stress the cash flows of a given transaction at a higher level in order to achieve a higher rating. Conversely, transactions that only pass lower stress levels achieve lower ratings.",

        "page_content": "Many of the other securitization exposures (non-ABCP) carry external ratings and we use the external ratings-based approach, otherwise will follow the SA, for determining the proper capital allocation for these positions. We periodically compare our own ratings to ECAIs ratings to ensure that the ratings provided by ECAIs are reasonable.\n\nGRM is responsible for providing risk assessments for capital purposes in respect of all our banking book exposures. GRM is independent of the business originating the securitization exposures and performs its own analysis, sometimes in conjunction with but always independent of the applicable business. GRM has developed asset class specific criteria guidelines which provide the rating methodologies for each asset class. The guidelines are reviewed periodically and are subject to the ratings replication process mandated by Pillar I of the Basel rules.\n\n## Regulatory developments\n\n## Basel III reforms\n\nOn January 31, 2022, OSFI announced revised capital, leverage, liquidity and disclosure guidelines that incorporate the final BCBS Basel III reforms. OSFI's first phase of the adoption of the final BCBS Basel III reforms came into effect in Q2 2023 and included the following notable changes:\n\n- GLYPH<129> For IRB portfolios, elimination of a 6% regulatory scaling factor applied to RWA generated by internal models and introduction of prescribed supervisory parameters applicable to certain asset classes within our wholesale portfolio.\n- GLYPH<129> Adoption of a new operational risk SA framework based on 3 years of average income and 10 years of historical losses.\n- GLYPH<129> Adoption of a new SA framework enhancing risk sensitivity.\n- GLYPH<129> Prescribed revisions to the existing regulatory capital floor from 70% to 65% requiring a transition to a new regulatory capital floor of 72.5% of RWA under the SA by 2026. This new regulatory floor will be transitioned over three years, reflecting a regulatory capital floor requirement of 67.5%, 70% and 72.5% in fiscal 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.\n- GLYPH<129> Application of a 50 bps leverage ratio buffer to all D-SIBs.\n\nThe revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements that were effective upon adoption of the Basel III reforms are reflected in our Q2 2023 standalone Pillar 3 Report with further additional updated disclosure requirements reflected in our Q4 2023 Pillar 3 Report.\n\nOn November 14, 2023, OSFI released Pillar 3 disclosure requirements related to the second phase of the implementation of the final BCBS Basel III reforms relating to the revised credit valuation adjustment (CVA) and market risk chapters of the CAR guideline. The guideline on the revised CVA and market risk chapters of the CAR was effective for us November 1, 2023, and the impact is not expected to be material.\n\n## Revisions to CAR guidelines\n\nOn October 20, 2023, OSFI released further revisions to the CAR guidelines which established changes to capital requirements for variable rate fixed-payment residential mortgages where payments are insufficient to cover the interest component. This guideline is effective November 1, 2023, and we expect no impact on our capital requirements as we do not originate mortgage products with a structure that would result in negative amortization.\n\n## Accounting and control matters\n\n## Critical accounting policies and estimates\n\n## Application of critical accounting policies, judgments, estimates and assumptions\n\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies and related estimates are recognized as critical because they require us to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and significantly different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Our critical accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions relate to the fair value of financial instruments, ACL, goodwill and other intangible assets, employee benefits, consolidation of structured entities, derecognition of financial assets, application of the effective interest method, provisions, insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities, and income taxes. Our critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed and approved by our Audit Committee, in consultation with management, as part of their review and approval of our significant accounting policies, judgments, estimates and assumptions.\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We determine fair value by incorporating factors that market participants would consider in setting a price, including commonly accepted valuation approaches.\n\nWe give priority to third-party pricing services and valuation techniques with the highest and most consistent accuracy. The level of accuracy is determined over time by comparing third-party price values to traders' or system values, other pricing service values and, when available, actual trade data. Other valuation techniques are used when a price or quote is not available. Some valuation processes use models to determine fair value. We have a systematic and consistent approach to control the use of models.\n\nIn determining fair value, a hierarchy is used which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Determination of fair value based on this hierarchy requires the use of observable market data whenever available. Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and model inputs that are either observable, or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 inputs include one or more inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value of the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available at the measurement date. The availability of inputs for valuation may affect the selection of valuation techniques. The classification of a financial instrument in the fair value hierarchy for disclosure purposes is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value.",

        "page_content": "Where observable prices or inputs are not available, management judgment is required in the determination of fair values by assessing other relevant sources of information such as historical data, proxy information from similar transactions, and through extrapolation and interpolation techniques. For more complex or illiquid instruments, significant judgment is required to determine the model used, the selection of model inputs, and in some cases, the application of valuation adjustments to the model value or quoted price for inactively traded financial instruments. The selection of model inputs may be subjective and the inputs may be unobservable. Unobservable inputs are inherently uncertain as there is little or no market data available from which to determine the level at which the transaction would occur under normal business circumstances. Appropriate parameter uncertainty and market risk valuation adjustments for such inputs and other model risk valuation adjustments are assessed in all such instances.\n\nValuation adjustments may be subjective as they require significant judgment in the input selection, such as implied PD and recovery rate, and are intended to arrive at a fair value that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument. The ultimate realized price for a transaction may differ from its recorded fair value estimated using management judgment.\n\nFor further information on the fair value of financial instruments, refer to Notes 2 and 3 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Allowance for credit losses\n\nAn allowance for credit losses (ACL) is established for all financial assets, except for financial assets classified or designated as FVTPL and equity securities designated as FVOCI, which are not subject to impairment assessment. Assets subject to impairment assessment include loans, debt securities, interest-bearing deposits with banks, customers' liability under acceptances, accounts and accrued interest receivable, and finance and operating lease receivables. Off-balance sheet items subject to impairment assessment include financial guarantees and undrawn loan commitments.\n\nWe measure the ACL on each balance sheet date according to a three-stage expected credit loss impairment model:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Performing financial assets\n- GLYPH<129> Stage 1 - From initial recognition of a financial asset to the date on which the asset has experienced a significant increase in credit risk relative to its initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized equal to the credit losses expected to result from defaults occurring over the 12 months following the reporting date.\n- GLYPH<129> Stage 2 - Following a significant increase in credit risk relative to the initial recognition of the financial asset, a loss allowance is recognized equal to the credit losses expected over the remaining lifetime of the asset.\n- GLYPH<129> Impaired financial assets\n- GLYPH<129> Stage 3 - When a financial asset is considered to be credit-impaired, a loss allowance is recognized equal to credit losses expected over the remaining lifetime of the asset. Interest income is calculated based on the carrying amount of the asset, net of the loss allowance, rather than on its gross carrying amount.\n\nThe ACL is a discounted probability-weighted estimate of the cash shortfalls expected to result from defaults over the relevant time horizon. For loan commitments, credit loss estimates consider the portion of the commitment that is expected to be drawn over the relevant time period. For financial guarantees, credit loss estimates are based on the expected payments required under the guarantee contract. For finance lease receivables, credit loss estimates are based on cash flows consistent with the cash flows used in measuring the lease receivable.\n\nThe ACL represents an unbiased estimate of expected credit losses on our financial assets as at the balance sheet date. Judgment is required in making assumptions and estimations when calculating the ACL, including movements between the three stages, the inclusion of forward looking information and the application of expert credit judgment. The underlying assumptions and estimates may result in changes to the provisions from period to period that significantly affect our results of operations.\n\nFor further information on ACL, refer to Notes 2, 4 and 5 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nWe allocate goodwill to groups of cash-generating units (CGU). Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are objective indications of impairment. We test for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount of a CGU with its carrying amount.\n\nWe estimate the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal of our CGUs primarily using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates each CGU's internal forecasts of revenues and expenses. Significant management judgment is applied in the determination of expected future cash flows (uncertainty in timing and amount), discount rates (based on CGU-specific risks) and terminal growth rates. CGU-specific risks include country risk, business/operational risk, geographic risk (including political risk, devaluation risk and government regulation), currency risk and price risk (including product pricing risk and inflation). If the future cash flows and other assumptions in future periods deviate significantly from the current amounts used in our impairment testing, the value of our goodwill could become impaired.\n\nWe assess for indicators of impairment of our other intangible assets at each reporting period. If there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, an impairment test is performed by comparing the carrying amount of the intangible asset to its recoverable amount. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, we estimate the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. Significant judgment is applied in estimating the useful lives and recoverable amounts of our intangible assets and assessing whether certain events or circumstances constitute objective evidence of impairment. We do not have any intangible assets with indefinite lives.\n\nFor further details, refer to Notes 2 and 11 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nWe sponsor a number of benefit programs for eligible employees, including registered pension plans, supplemental pension plans, health, dental, disability and life insurance plans.\n\nThe calculation of defined benefit expenses and obligations depends on various assumptions such as discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, projected salary increases, retirement age, and mortality and termination rates. Discount rates are determined using a yield curve based on spot rates from high quality corporate bonds. All other assumptions are determined by us and are reviewed by the actuaries. Actual experience that differs from the actuarial assumptions will affect the amounts of benefit obligations and remeasurements that we recognize. The weighted average assumptions used and the sensitivity of key assumptions are presented in Note 17 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidation of structured entities\n\nSubsidiaries are those entities, including structured entities, over which we have control. We control an entity when we are exposed, or have rights, to variable returns from our involvement with the entity and have the ability to affect those returns through our power over the investee. We have power over an entity when we have existing rights that give us the current ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the entity's returns (relevant activities). Power may be determined on the basis of voting rights or, in the case of structured entities, other contractual arrangements.\n\nWe are not deemed to control an entity when we exercise power over an entity as the agent of a third party or parties. In determining whether we are acting as an agent, we consider the overall relationship between us, the investee and other parties to the arrangement with respect to the following factors: (i) the scope of our decision-making power; (ii) the rights held by other parties; (iii) the remuneration to which we are entitled; and (iv) our exposure to variability of returns.\n\nThe determination of control is based on the current facts and circumstances and is continuously assessed. In some circumstances, different factors and conditions may indicate that various parties control an entity depending on whether those factors and conditions are assessed in isolation or in totality. Significant judgment is applied in determining whether we control an entity, specifically, assessing whether we have substantive decision-making rights over the relevant activities and whether we are exercising our power as a principal or an agent.\n\nWe consolidate all subsidiaries from the date we obtain control, and cease consolidation when an entity is no longer controlled by us. Our consolidation conclusions affect the classification and amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFor further details, refer to Note 8 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nWe periodically enter into transactions in which we transfer financial assets such as loans or MBS to structured entities or trusts that issue securities to investors. We derecognize the assets when our contractual rights to the cash flows from the assets have expired; when we retain the rights to receive the cash flows of the assets but assume an obligation to pay those cash flows to a third party subject to certain pass-through requirements; or when we transfer our contractual rights to receive the cash flows and substantially all of the risks and rewards of the assets have been transferred. When we retain substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets are not derecognized from our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are accounted for as secured financing transactions. When we neither retain nor transfer substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the assets, we derecognize the assets if control over the assets is relinquished. If we retain control over the transferred assets, we continue to recognize the transferred assets to the extent of our continuing involvement. Management judgment is applied in determining whether we have transferred or retained substantially all risk and rewards of ownership of the transferred financial asset.\n\nThe majority of assets transferred under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements, and in our Canadian residential mortgage securitization transactions do not qualify for derecognition. As a result, we continue to record the associated transferred assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and no gains or losses are recognized for those securitization activities. Otherwise, a gain or loss is recognized on securitization by comparing the carrying amount of the transferred asset with its fair value at the date of the transfer. For further information on derecognition of financial assets, refer to Notes 2 and 7 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Application of the effective interest method\n\nInterest is recognized in Interest income and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income generally for all interest bearing financial instruments using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash flows over the expected life of the financial asset or liability to the net carrying amount upon initial recognition. Significant judgment is applied in determining the effective interest rate due to uncertainty in the timing and amounts of future cash flows.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount and are recognized when we have a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date. Significant judgment is required in determining whether a present obligation exists and in estimating the probability, timing and amount of any outflows. We record provisions related to litigation, asset retirement obligations and other items.\n\nThe forward-looking nature of these estimates requires us to use a significant amount of judgment in projecting the timing and amount of future cash flows. We record our provisions on the basis of all available information at the end of the reporting period and make adjustments on a quarterly basis to reflect current expectations. Should actual results differ from our expectations, we may incur expenses in excess of the provisions recognized.\n\n## Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities\n\nInsurance claims and policy benefit liabilities represent current claims and estimates for future insurance policy benefits. Liabilities for life insurance contracts are determined using the Canadian Asset Liability Method, which incorporates assumptions for mortality, morbidity, policy lapses and surrenders, investment yields, policy dividends, operating and policy maintenance expenses, and provisions for adverse deviation. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually and updated in response to actual experience and market conditions. Liabilities for property and casualty insurance represent estimated provisions for reported and unreported claims. Liabilities for life and property and casualty insurance are included in Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities. Changes in Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities are included in the Insurance policyholder benefits, claims and acquisition expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which the estimates change. Refer to Note 15 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nWe are subject to income tax laws in various jurisdictions where we operate, and the complex tax laws are potentially subject to different interpretations by us and the relevant taxation authority. Management judgment is applied in interpreting the relevant tax laws, in assessing the probability of acceptance of our tax positions by the relevant tax authorities and in estimating the",

        "page_content": "expected timing and amount of the provision for current and deferred income taxes. A deferred tax asset or liability is determined for each temporary difference based on the tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the period that the asset is realized or the liability is settled, except for earnings related to our subsidiaries, branches, associates and interests in joint ventures where the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future and we have the ability to control the timing of reversal.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, we review whether it is probable that the benefits associated with our deferred tax assets will be realized, using both positive and negative evidence. Refer to Note 22 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\n## Future changes in accounting policy and disclosure\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17)\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 to establish a comprehensive insurance standard which provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held and will replace the existing IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4). In June 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 17, including deferral of the effective date by two years. This new standard is effective for us on November 1, 2023 and is to be applied retrospectively with comparatives restated beginning November 1, 2022.\n\nUnder IFRS 17, insurance contracts are contracts under which we accept significant insurance risk from a policyholder by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder. Embedded derivatives, investment components and promises to provide non-insurance services, provided specific criteria are met, are separated from the measurement of insurance and reinsurance contracts. Insurance and reinsurance contracts are aggregated into portfolios that are subject to similar risks and are managed together, and then divided into groups based on the period of issuance and expected profitability. Groups are separately recognized and measured using one of three measurement models depending on the characteristics of the contracts:\n\n- GLYPH<129> For insurance contracts with direct participating features, the contracts are measured using the variable fee approach (VFA).\n- GLYPH<129> For insurance contracts and reinsurance contracts held with a short duration of one year or less, the premium allocation approach (PAA) is elected.\n- GLYPH<129> The general measurement method (GMM) is applied to all remaining contracts.\n\nUnder the GMM and VFA, the liabilities for remaining coverage and incurred claims for groups of contracts are measured as the sum of the fulfilment cash flows and the contractual service margin (CSM), which are recalculated at the end of each reporting period. The fulfilment cash flows consist of the present value of future cash flows and a risk adjustment for non-financial risk. For insurance contracts, the CSM represents the unearned profit for providing insurance coverage. For reinsurance contracts held, the CSM represents the net cost or net gain of purchasing reinsurance. Under the PAA, the liability for remaining coverage for each group is measured as the premiums received less insurance revenue recognized for services provided, while the liability for incurred claims is measured as the fulfillment cash flows for incurred claims plus adjustment on any financing components. Losses from the recognition of onerous groups of insurance contracts, regardless of the measurement model applied, are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income immediately.\n\n- The following are key differences between IFRS 17 and IFRS 4:\n- GLYPH<129> New business profits are deferred and measured as the CSM of the insurance contract liabilities and amortized into income as insurance contract services are provided, while losses are recognized into income immediately. Under IFRS 4, gains and losses are recognized in income immediately. On July 18, 2023, OSFI released regulatory guidance to allow the inclusion of the CSM in calculating CET1 capital and related ratios, therefore, there will be no impact on the capital metrics from such reduction in retained earnings resulting from the CSM.\n- GLYPH<129> Discount rates used in calculating the present value of insurance contract liabilities are based on the characteristics of the insurance contracts unlike IFRS 4 which is based on the assets supporting the liabilities.\n- GLYPH<129> Presentation and disclosure changes are expected due to the new requirements.\n\nWhile IFRS 17 impacts the timing of profit recognition of insurance contracts, it will have no impact on total profit recognized over the lifetime of these contracts.\n\n## Governance\n\nWe are in the final stage of implementation for IFRS 17. As part of the implementation process, a comprehensive program and governance structure led by Finance and the Insurance business was established to focus on the evaluation of the impacts of the standard and implementation of policies, systems and processes required for the adoption. Regular updates are provided to senior management as well as the Audit Committee and Board of Directors to ensure escalation of key issues and risks. We have enhanced existing controls, and designed and operationalized new controls and governance procedures to support the implementation of IFRS 17, including controls over data and systems, key assumptions and measurement approaches.\n\n## Impact of IFRS 17 transition excluding the impact of reclassifications of financial assets\n\nUpon the adoption of IFRS 17, we will apply IFRS 17 retrospectively by adjusting our Consolidated Balance Sheets as at November 1, 2022 and restating comparative information. The full retrospective approach will be applied for all insurance and reinsurance contracts unless it is impracticable to do so. The full retrospective approach is applied to all contracts measured using the PAA and all new contracts issued on and after November 1, 2022 measured using the GMM and VFA as if IFRS 17 had always been applied. Due to data availability and the inability to use hindsight, the fair value approach is applied to contracts issued before November 1, 2022 that are measured under the GMM and VFA. Under the fair value approach, the CSM of the liability for remaining coverage is calculated as the difference between the fair value of a group of contracts and the fulfillment cash flows measured at the date of transition.\n\nBased on current estimates, the adoption of IFRS 17 is expected to result in a reduction in retained earnings of approximately $2.4 billion, net of taxes, as at November 1, 2022. This is attributable to the establishment of the CSM and other remeasurement changes to insurance and reinsurance contracts and related tax effects. The estimated CSM of all insurance contracts net of reinsurance contracts held as at November 1, 2022 was approximately $1.8 billion. The net impact to our CET1 ratio is not expected to be material. These estimates are subject to change as we finalize the quantitative impacts of the adoption in the first quarter of 2024.",

        "page_content": "## Impact of reclassifications of financial assets\n\nAs permitted by IFRS 17, we will change the classification and measurement of certain eligible financial assets held in respect of an activity that relates to insurance contracts upon the adoption of IFRS 17. We will apply these changes retrospectively by adjusting our Consolidated Balance Sheets as at November 1, 2023 with no restatement of comparative information. We expect to reclassify financial assets between fair value classification categories, which is not expected to have a net impact to total equity nor the carrying amounts of those assets. Similarly, no net impact to our CET1 ratio is expected. This is subject to change as we finalize the quantitative impacts of these changes and the quantitative impacts of adopting IFRS 17 in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n## Controls and procedures\n\n## Disclosure controls and procedures\n\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under Canadian and U.S. securities laws is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under those laws and include controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nAs of October 31, 2023, management evaluated, under the supervision of and with the participation of the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined under rules adopted by the Canadian securities regulatory authorities and the U.S. SEC. Based on that evaluation, the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 31, 2023.\n\n## Internal control over financial reporting\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS. However, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. See Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended October 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Related party transactions\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide normal banking services and operational services, and enter into other transactions with associated and other related corporations, including our joint venture entities, on terms similar to those offered to non-related parties. We grant loans to directors, officers and other employees at rates normally accorded to preferred clients. In addition, we offer deferred share and other plans to non-employee directors, executives and certain other key employees.

        "page_content": "## Acceptances\n\nA bill of exchange or negotiable instrument drawn by the borrower for payment at maturity and accepted by a bank. The acceptance constitutes a guarantee of payment by the bank and can be traded in the money market. The bank earns a 'stamping fee' for providing this guarantee.\n\n## Allowance for credit losses (ACL)\n\nThe amount deemed adequate by management to absorb expected credit losses as at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established for all financial assets subject to impairment assessment, including certain loans, debt securities, customers' liability under acceptances, financial guarantees, and undrawn loan commitments. The allowance is changed by the amount of provision for credit losses recorded, which is charged to income, and decreased by the amount of write-offs net of recoveries in the period.\n\n## ACL on loans ratio\n\nACL on loans ratio is calculated as ACL on loans as a percentage of total loans and acceptances.\n\n## Asset-backed securities (ABS)\n\nSecurities created through the securitization of a pool of assets, for example auto loans or credit card loans.\n\n## Assets under administration (AUA)\n\nAssets administered by us, which are beneficially owned by clients, unless otherwise noted.

The ratio should be at least equal to 100% on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Normal course issuer bid (NCIB)\n\nA program for the repurchase of our own shares for cancellation through a stock exchange that is subject to the various rules of the relevant stock exchange and securities commission.\n\n## Notional amount\n\nThe contract amount used as a reference point to calculate payments for derivatives.\n\n## Off-balance sheet financial instruments\n\nA variety of arrangements offered to clients, which include credit derivatives, written put options, backstop liquidity facilities, stable value products, financial standby letters of credit, performance guarantees, credit enhancements, mortgage loans sold with recourse, commitments to extend credit, securities lending, documentary and commercial letters of credit, sponsor member guarantees, securities lending indemnifications and indemnifications.\n\n## Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI)\n\nThe primary regulator of federally chartered financial institutions and federally administered pension plans in Canada. OSFI's mission is to safeguard policyholders, depositors and pension plan members from undue loss.\n\n## Operating leverage\n\nThe difference between our revenue growth rate and non-interest expense growth rate.\n\n## Options\n\nA contract or a provision of a contract that gives one party (the option holder) the right, but not the obligation, to perform a specified transaction with another party (the option issuer or option writer) according to specified terms.\n\n## Provision for credit losses (PCL)\n\nThe amount charged to income necessary to bring the allowance for credit losses to a level determined appropriate by management. This includes provisions on performing and impaired financial assets.\n\n## PCL on loans ratio\n\nPCL on loans ratio is calculated using PCL on loans as a percentage of average net loans and acceptances.\n\n## RBC Homeline Plan products\n\nThis is comprised of residential mortgages and secured personal loans whereby the borrower pledges real estate as collateral.\n\n## Repurchase agreements\n\nThese involve the sale of securities for cash and the simultaneous repurchase of the securities for value at a later date. These transactions normally do not constitute economic sales and therefore are treated as collateralized financing transactions.\n\n## Return on common equity (ROE)\n\nNet income available to common\n\nshareholders, expressed as a percentage of average common equity.\n\n## Reverse repurchase agreements\n\nThese involve the purchase of securities for cash and the simultaneous sale of the securities for value at a later date. These transactions normally do not constitute economic sales and therefore are treated as collateralized financing transactions.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets (RWA)\n\nAssets adjusted by a regulatory risk-weight factor to reflect the riskiness of on and off-balance sheet exposures. Certain assets are not risk-weighted, but deducted from capital. The calculation is defined by OSFI's Capital Adequacy Requirements guidelines. For more details, refer to the Capital management section.\n\n## Securities lending\n\nTransactions in which the owner of securities agrees to lend it under the terms of a prearranged contract to a borrower for a fee. Collateral for the loan consists of either high quality securities or cash and collateral value must be at least equal to the market value of the loaned securities. Borrowers pay a negotiated fee for loans collateralized by securities, whereas for cash collateral lenders pay borrowers interest at a negotiated rate and reinvest the cash collateral to earn a return. An intermediary such as a bank often acts as agent lender for the owner of the security in return for a share of the revenue earned by the owner from lending securities. Most often, agent lenders indemnify the owner against the risk of the borrower's failure to redeliver the loaned securities - counterparty credit risk if a borrower defaults and market risk if the value of the non-cash collateral declines. The agent lender does not indemnify against the investment risk of re-investing cash collateral which is borne by the owner.\n\n## Securities sold short\n\nA transaction in which the seller sells securities and then borrows the securities in order to deliver them to the purchaser upon settlement. At a later date, the seller buys identical securities in the market to replace the borrowed securities.\n\n## Securitization\n\nThe process by which various financial assets are packaged into newly issued securities backed by these assets.\n\n## Standardized Approach (SA)\n\nRisk weights prescribed by OSFI are used to calculate RWA for the credit risk exposures. Credit assessments by OSFI-recognized external credit rating agencies of S&P, Moody's, Fitch, and DBRS are used to riskweight our Sovereign and Bank exposures based on the standards and guidelines issued by OSFI. For our Business and Retail exposures, we use the standard risk weights prescribed by OSFI.\n\n## Structured entities\n\nA structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when the activities that significantly affect the entity's returns are directed by means of contractual arrangements. Structured entities often have restricted activities, narrow and well defined objectives, insufficient equity to finance their activities, and financing in the form of multiple contractually-linked instruments.\n\n## Taxable equivalent basis (teb)\n\nIncome from certain specified tax advantaged sources (eligible Canadian taxable corporate dividends) is increased to a level that would make it comparable to income from taxable sources. There is an offsetting adjustment in the tax provision, thereby generating the same after-tax net income.\n\n## Tier 1 capital\n\nTier 1 capital comprises predominantly of CET1 capital, with additional Tier 1 items such as preferred shares, limited recourse capital notes and non-controlling interests in subsidiaries Tier 1 instruments.\n\n## Tier 2 capital\n\nTier 2 capital consists mainly of subordinated debentures that meet certain criteria, certain loan loss allowances and non-controlling interests in subsidiaries' Tier 2 instruments.\n\n## Total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC)\n\nThe aggregate of Tier 1 capital, Tier 2 capital, and external TLAC instruments which allow conversion in whole or in part into common shares under the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act and meet all of the eligibility criteria under the guideline.\n\n## TLAC ratio\n\nThe risk-based TLAC ratio is defined as TLAC divided by total risk-weighted assets.\n\n## TLAC leverage ratio\n\nThe TLAC leverage ratio is defined as TLAC divided by the Leverage ratio exposure.\n\n## Total capital and total capital ratio\n\nTotal capital is defined as the total of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. The total capital ratio is calculated by dividing total capital by riskweighted assets.\n\n## Tranche\n\nA security class created whereby the risks and returns associated with a pool of assets are packaged into several classes of securities offering different risk and return profiles from those of the underlying asset pool. Tranches are typically rated by ratings agencies, and reflect both the credit quality of underlying collateral as well as the level of protection based on the tranches' relative subordination.\n\n## Unattributed capital\n\nUnattributed capital represents common equity in excess of common equity attributed to our business segments and is reported in the Corporate Support segment.\n\n## Value-at-Risk (VaR)\n\nA generally accepted risk-measurement concept that uses statistical models based on historical information to estimate within a given level of confidence the maximum loss in market value we would experience in our financial portfolio from an adverse one-day movement in market rates and prices.",

These consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the Bank Act (Canada) and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Financial information appearing throughout our Management's Discussion and Analysis is consistent with these consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are authorized, assets are safeguarded and proper records are maintained. These controls include quality standards in hiring and training of employees, policies and procedures manuals, a corporate code of conduct and accountability for performance within appropriate and welldefined areas of responsibility.\n\nThe system of internal controls is further supported by a compliance function, which is designed to ensure that we and our employees comply with securities legislation and conflict of interest rules, and by an internal audit staff, which conducts periodic audits of all aspects of our operations.\n\nThe Board of Directors oversees management's responsibilities for financial reporting through an Audit Committee, which is composed entirely of independent directors. This Committee reviews our consolidated financial statements and recommends them to the Board for approval. Other key responsibilities of the Audit Committee include reviewing our existing internal control procedures and planned revisions to those procedures, and advising the directors on auditing matters and financial reporting issues. Our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Internal Auditor have full and unrestricted access to the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI) examines and inquires into our business and affairs as deemed necessary to determine whether the provisions of the Bank Act are being complied with, and that we are in sound financial condition. In carrying out its mandate, OSFI strives to protect the rights and interests of our depositors and creditors.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm appointed by our shareholders upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee and Board, has performed an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards and the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) as stated in their Independent Auditor's Report and Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, respectively. The auditors have full and unrestricted access to the Audit Committee to discuss their audit and related findings.\n\nDavid I. McKay\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nNadine Ahn Chief Financial Officer\n\nToronto, November 29, 2023\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nManagement of Royal Bank of Canada is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and effected by the Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. It includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions related to and dispositions of our assets;\n- GLYPH<129> Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and our receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n- GLYPH<129> Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\n\nDue to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nManagement evaluated, under the supervision of and with the participation of the President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that, as of October 31, 2023, internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the criteria established in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013).\n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, as stated in their Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, which appears herein.\n\nDavid I.

These disclosures are cross-referenced from the consolidated financial statements and are identified as audited.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the Bank in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in Canada. We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses for Financial Assets Categorized as Stage 1 and Stage 2 (Stage 1 and Stage 2 ACL)\n\nRefer to Note 2 - Summary of significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments, Note 4 - Securities and Note 5 Loans and allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Bank's allowance for credit losses for financial assets was $5,366 million as of October 31, 2023 and represents management's estimate of expected credit losses on financial assets as of the balance sheet date, of which a significant portion relates to financial assets categorized as Stage 1 and Stage 2. Performing financial assets are categorized as Stage 1 from initial recognition to the date on which the asset has experienced a significant increase in credit risk relative to its initial recognition. Performing financial assets transfer into Stage 2 following a significant increase in credit risk relative to the initial recognition. Financial assets are categorized as Stage 3 when considered to be credit-impaired. As disclosed by management, the measurement of expected credit losses is a complex calculation that involves a significant number of interrelated inputs and assumptions such as borrower risk ratings, forward-looking macroeconomic conditions, scenario design and the weight assigned to each scenario. The probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default inputs are modelled based on the macroeconomic variables that are most closely correlated with credit losses.\n\nManagement's estimation of expected credit losses in Stage 1 and Stage 2 considers five distinct future macroeconomic\n\nOur approach to addressing the matter included the following procedures, among others:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the estimation of the Stage 1 and Stage 2 ACL, including controls over:\n- O The probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default models.\n- O The design of future macroeconomic scenarios, the forecasting of certain macroeconomic variables, and the probability-weighting of these scenarios.\n- O The assignment of borrower risk ratings.\n- O The completeness and accuracy of certain data inputs underlying the Stage 1 and Stage 2 ACL calculation.\n- GLYPH<129> Testing management's process for estimating the Stage 1 and Stage 2 ACL, which consisted of:\n- O Testing the completeness and accuracy of certain underlying data used in the estimation of the Stage 1 and Stage 2 ACL.\n- O Using professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating:\n- GLYPH<129> The appropriateness of the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default models used in the estimation of the Stage 1 and Stage 2 ACL.",

We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Bank's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- GLYPH<129> Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank's internal control.\n- GLYPH<129> Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- GLYPH<129> Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- GLYPH<129> Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- GLYPH<129> Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Bank to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Lona Mathis.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nChartered Professional Accountants, Licensed Public Accountants",

We also have audited the Bank's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Also in our opinion, the Bank maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Bank's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Bank's consolidated financial statements and on the Bank's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Bank in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nAn entity's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. An entity's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses for Financial Assets Categorized as Stage 1 and Stage 2 (Stage 1 and Stage 2 ACL) As described in Notes 2, 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Bank's allowance for credit losses for financial assets was $5,366 million as of October 31, 2023 and represents management's estimate of expected credit losses on financial assets as of the balance sheet date, of which a significant portion relates to financial assets categorized as Stage 1 and Stage 2. Performing financial assets are categorized as Stage 1 from initial recognition to the date on which the asset has experienced a significant increase in credit risk relative to its initial recognition.

These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for estimating the Stage 1 and Stage 2 ACL. This consisted of (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of certain underlying data used in the estimation of the Stage 1 and Stage 2 ACL; and (ii) with the assistance of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge, evaluating (a) the appropriateness of the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default models used in the estimation of the Stage 1 and Stage 2 ACL, and (b) the reasonableness of significant inputs and assumptions used in the estimation of the Stage 1 and Stage 2 ACL related to (1) the design of future macroeconomic scenarios, (2) certain forecasted macroeconomic variables, (3) the probability-weights assigned to these scenarios, and (4) the assignment of borrower risk ratings for samples of loans.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Bank is subject to income tax laws in various jurisdictions where it operates and the complex tax laws are potentially subject to different interpretations by management and the relevant taxation authorities. As disclosed by management, significant judgment is required in the interpretation of the relevant tax laws, and in assessing the probability of acceptance of the Bank's tax positions to determine tax provisions, which includes management's best estimate of uncertain tax positions that are under audit or appeal by the relevant taxation authorities. Management performs a review on a quarterly basis to incorporate its best assessment based on information available, but additional liability and income tax expense could result based on the acceptance of the Bank's tax positions by the relevant tax authorities.

Refer to Note 27 for further details on our business segments.\n\nThe parent bank, Royal Bank of Canada, is a Schedule I Bank under the Bank Act (Canada) incorporated and domiciled in Canada. Our corporate headquarters are located at Royal Bank Plaza, 200 Bay Street, Toronto, Ontario, Canada and our head office is located at 1 Place Ville-Marie, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Our common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol RY.\n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Unless otherwise stated, monetary amounts are stated in Canadian dollars. Tabular information is stated in millions of dollars, except as noted. These Consolidated Financial Statements also comply with Subsection 308 of the Bank Act (Canada), which states that, except as otherwise specified by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI), our Consolidated Financial Statements are to be prepared in accordance with IFRS. The accounting policies outlined in Note 2 have been consistently applied to all periods presented.\n\nOn November 29, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the Consolidated Financial Statements for issue.\n\n## Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments\n\nThe significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements, including the accounting requirements prescribed by OSFI, are summarized below. These accounting policies conform, in all material respects, to IFRS. The same accounting policies have been applied to all periods presented.\n\n## General\n\n## Use of estimates and assumptions\n\nIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make subjective estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, net income and related disclosures. Estimates made by management are based on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. Key sources of estimation uncertainty include: determination of fair value of financial instruments, allowance for credit losses, insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities, pensions and other post-employment benefits, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, and provisions. Accordingly, actual results may differ from these and other estimates thereby impacting our future Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to the relevant accounting policies in this Note for details on our use of estimates and assumptions.\n\n## Significant judgments\n\nIn preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make significant judgments that affect the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses recorded during the period. Significant judgments have been made in the following areas and discussed as noted in the Consolidated Financial Statements:\n\n| Consolidation of structured entities   | Note 2   Note 8          | Application of the effective interest method   | Note 2                     |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Fair value of financial instruments    | Note 2   Note 3          | Derecognition of financial assets              | Note 2   Note 7            |\n| Allowance for credit losses            | Note 2   Note 4   Note 5 | Income taxes                                   | Note 2   Note 22           |\n| Employee benefits                      | Note 2   Note 17         | Provisions                                     | Note 2   Note 24   Note 25 |\n| Goodwill and other intangibles         | Note 2                   |                                                |                            |\n\nNote 11\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements include the assets and liabilities and results of operations of the parent company, Royal Bank of Canada, and its subsidiaries including certain structured entities, after elimination of intercompany transactions, balances, revenues and expenses.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nSubsidiaries are those entities, including structured entities, over which we have control. We control an entity when we are exposed, or have rights, to variable returns from our involvement with the entity and have the ability to affect those returns through our power over the investee. We have power over an entity when we have existing rights that give us the current ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the entity's returns (relevant activities). Power may be determined on the basis of voting rights or, in the case of structured entities, other contractual arrangements.\n\nWe are not deemed to control an entity when we exercise power over an entity as the agent of a third party or parties. In determining whether we are acting as an agent, we consider the overall relationship between us, the investee and other parties to the arrangement with respect to the following factors: (i) the scope of our decision-making power; (ii) the rights held by other parties; (iii) the remuneration to which we are entitled; and (iv) our exposure to variability of returns.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments (continued)\n\nThe determination of control is based on the current facts and circumstances and is continuously assessed. In some circumstances, different factors and conditions may indicate that various parties control an entity depending on whether those factors and conditions are assessed in isolation or in totality. Significant judgment is applied in determining whether we control an entity, specifically, assessing whether we have substantive decision-making rights over the relevant activities and whether we are exercising our power as a principal or an agent.\n\nWe consolidate all subsidiaries from the date we obtain control and cease consolidation when an entity is no longer controlled by us. Our consolidation conclusions affect the classification and amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests in subsidiaries that we consolidate are shown on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as a separate component of equity which is distinct from equity attributable to our shareholders. The net income attributable to non-controlling interests is separately disclosed in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## Investments in joint ventures and associates\n\nOur investments in associated corporations and limited partnerships over which we have significant influence are accounted for using the equity method. The equity method is also applied to our interests in joint ventures over which we have joint control. Under the equity method of accounting, investments are initially recorded at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize our share of the investee's net profit or loss, including our proportionate share of the investee's Other comprehensive income (OCI), subsequent to the date of acquisition.\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nNon-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is satisfied when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, management is committed to the sale, and it is highly probable to occur within one year. Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and if significant, are presented separately from other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nA disposal group is classified as a discontinued operation if it meets the following conditions: (i) it is a component that can be distinguished operationally and financially from the rest of our operations and (ii) it represents either a separate major line of business or is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations. Disposal groups classified as discontinued operations are presented separately from our continuing operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\n## Classification of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are classified and subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or amortized cost based on our business model for managing the financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument.\n\nDebt instruments are measured at amortized cost if both of the following conditions are met and the asset is not designated as FVTPL: (a) the asset is held within a business model that is Held-to-Collect (HTC) as described below, and (b) the contractual terms of the instrument give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI).\n\nDebt instruments are measured at FVOCI if both of the following conditions are met and the asset is not designated as FVTPL: (a) the asset is held within a business model that is Held-to-Collect-and-Sell (HTC&S) as described below, and (b) the contractual terms of the instrument give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are SPPI.\n\nAll other debt instruments are measured at FVTPL.\n\nEquity instruments are measured at FVTPL, unless the asset is not held for trading purposes and we make an irrevocable election to designate the asset as FVOCI. This election is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\n## Business model assessment\n\nWe determine our business models at the level that best reflects how we manage portfolios of financial assets to achieve our business objectives. Judgment is used in determining our business models, which is supported by relevant, objective evidence including:\n\n- GLYPH<129> How the economic activities of our businesses generate benefits, for example through trading revenue, enhancing yields or hedging funding or other costs and how such economic activities are evaluated and reported to key management personnel;\n- GLYPH<129> The significant risks affecting the performance of our businesses, for example, market risk, credit risk, or other risks as described in the Risk Management section of the MD&A, and the activities undertaken to manage those risks;\n- GLYPH<129> Historical and future expectations of sales of the loans or securities portfolios managed as part of a business model; and\n- GLYPH<129> The compensation structures for managers of our businesses, to the extent that these are directly linked to the economic performance of the business model.\n\nOur business models fall into three categories, which are indicative of the key strategies used to generate returns:\n\n- GLYPH<129> HTC: The objective of this business model is to hold loans and securities to collect contractual principal and interest cash flows. Sales are incidental to this objective and are expected to be insignificant or infrequent.\n- GLYPH<129> HTC&S: Both collecting contractual cash flows and sales are integral to achieving the objective of the business model.\n- GLYPH<129> Other fair value business models: These business models are neither HTC nor HTC&S, and primarily represent business models where assets are held-for-trading or managed on a fair value basis.",

        "page_content": "## SPPI assessment\n\nInstruments held within a HTC or HTC&S business model are assessed to evaluate if their contractual cash flows are comprised of solely payments of principal and interest. SPPI payments are those which would typically be expected from basic lending arrangements. Principal amounts include par repayments from lending and financing arrangements, and interest primarily relates to basic lending returns, including compensation for credit risk and the time value of money associated with the principal amount outstanding over a period of time. Interest can also include other basic lending risks and costs (for example, liquidity risk, servicing or administrative costs) associated with holding the financial asset for a period of time, and a profit margin.\n\nWhere the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or variability of cash flows that are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at FVTPL.\n\n## Securities\n\nTrading securities include all securities that are classified as FVTPL by nature and securities designated as FVTPL. Obligations to deliver trading securities sold but not yet purchased are recorded as liabilities and carried at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these securities are generally recorded in Non-interest income - Trading revenue or Non-interest income Other. Dividends and interest income accruing on Trading securities are recorded in Interest and dividend income. Interest and dividends accrued on securities sold short are recorded in Interest expense.\n\nInvestment securities include all securities classified as FVOCI and amortized cost. All investment securities are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured according to the respective classification.\n\nInvestment securities carried at amortized cost are measured using the effective interest method, and are presented net of any allowance for credit losses, calculated in accordance with our policy for Allowance for credit losses, as described below. Interest income, including the amortization of premiums and discounts on securities measured at amortized cost are recorded in Interest and dividend income. Impairment gains or losses recognized on amortized cost securities are recorded in Provision for credit losses (PCL). When a debt instrument measured at amortized cost is sold, the difference between the sale proceeds and the amortized cost of the security at the time of the sale is recorded as Net gains on investment securities in Non-interest income.\n\nDebt securities carried at FVOCI are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in fair value included in Other components of equity. Impairment gains and losses are included in PCL and correspondingly reduce the accumulated changes in fair value included in Other components of equity. When a debt instrument measured at FVOCI is sold, the cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from Other components of equity to Net gains on investment securities in Non-interest income.\n\nEquity securities carried at FVOCI are measured at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recorded in Other components of equity and not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss when realized. Dividends from FVOCI equity securities are recognized in Interest and dividend income.\n\nWe account for all of our securities using settlement date accounting and changes in fair value between the trade date and settlement date are reflected in income for securities measured at FVTPL, and changes in the fair value of securities measured at FVOCI between the trade and settlement dates are recorded in OCI except for changes in foreign exchange rates on debt securities, which are recorded in Non-interest income.\n\n## Fair value option\n\nA financial instrument with a reliably measurable fair value can be designated as FVTPL (the fair value option) on its initial recognition even if the financial instrument was not acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing. The fair value option can be used for financial assets if it eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities, or recognizing related gains and losses on a different basis (an accounting mismatch). The fair value option can be elected for financial liabilities if: (i) the election eliminates an accounting mismatch; (ii) the financial liability is part of a portfolio that is managed on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy; or (iii) there is an embedded derivative in the financial or non-financial host contract and the derivative is not closely related to the host contract. These instruments cannot be reclassified out of the FVTPL category while they are held or issued.\n\nFinancial assets designated as FVTPL are recorded at fair value and any unrealized gain or loss arising due to changes in fair value is included in Non-interest income - Trading revenue or Non-interest income - Other, depending on our business purpose for holding the financial asset.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated as FVTPL are recorded at fair value and fair value changes attributable to changes in our own credit risk are recorded in OCI. Own credit risk amounts recognized in OCI will not be reclassified subsequently to net income. The remaining fair value changes not attributable to changes in our own credit risk are recorded in Non-interest income - Trading revenue or Non-interest income - Other, depending on our business purpose for holding the financial liability. Upon initial recognition, if we determine that presenting the effects of own credit risk changes in OCI would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in net income, the full fair value change in our debt designated as FVTPL is recognized in net income. To make that determination, we assess whether we expect that the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk will be offset in profit or loss by a change in the fair value of another financial instrument measured at FVTPL. Such an expectation is based on an economic relationship between the characteristics of the liability and the characteristics of the other financial instrument. The determination is made at initial recognition and is not reassessed. To determine the fair value adjustments on our debt instruments designated as FVTPL, we calculate the present value of the instruments based on the contractual cash flows over the term of the arrangement by using our effective funding rate at the beginning and end of the period.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We determine fair value by incorporating factors that market participants would consider in setting a price, including commonly accepted valuation approaches.\n\nThe Board of Directors provides oversight on valuation of financial instruments, primarily through the Audit Committee and Risk Committee. The Audit Committee reviews the presentation and disclosure of financial instruments that are measured at fair value, while the Risk Committee assesses the adequacy of governance structures and control processes for the valuation of these instruments.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments (continued)\n\nWe have established policies, procedures and controls for valuation methodologies and techniques to ensure that fair value is reasonably estimated. Major valuation processes and controls include, but are not limited to, profit and loss decomposition, independent price verification (IPV) and model validation standards. These control processes are managed by either Finance or Group Risk Management and are independent of the relevant businesses and their trading functions. Profit and loss decomposition is a process to explain the fair value changes of certain positions and is performed daily for trading portfolios. All fair value instruments are subject to IPV, a process whereby trading function valuations are verified against external market prices and other relevant market data. Market data sources include traded prices, brokers and price vendors. We give priority to those third-party pricing services and prices having the highest and most consistent accuracy. The level of accuracy is determined over time by comparing third-party price values to traders' or system values, other pricing service values and, when available, actual trade data. Quoted prices for identical instruments from pricing services or brokers are generally not adjusted unless there are issues such as stale prices. If multiple quotes for identical instruments are received, fair value is based on an average of the prices received or the quote from the most reliable vendor, after the outlier prices that fall outside of the pricing range are removed. Other valuation techniques are used when a price or quote is not available. Some valuation processes use models to determine fair value. We have a systematic and consistent approach to control the use of models. Valuation models are approved for use within our model risk management framework. The framework addresses, among other things, model development standards, validation processes and procedures and approval authorities. Model validation ensures that a model is suitable for its intended use and sets parameters for its use. All models are revalidated regularly by qualified personnel who are independent of the model design and development. Annually, our model risk profile is reported to the Board of Directors.\n\nIFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement permits an exception, through an accounting policy choice, to measure the fair value of a portfolio of financial instruments on a net open risk position basis when certain criteria are met. We have elected to use this policy choice to determine the fair value of certain portfolios of financial instruments, primarily derivatives, based on a net exposure to market or credit risk.\n\nWe record valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality of our derivative portfolio, differences between the actual counterparty collateral discount curve and standard overnight index swap (OIS) discounting for collateralized derivatives, funding valuation adjustments (FVA) for uncollateralized and under-collateralized over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, unrealized gains or losses at inception of the transaction, bid-offer spreads, unobservable parameters and model limitations. These adjustments may be subjective as they require significant judgment in the input selection, such as implied probability of default (PD) and recovery rate, and are intended to arrive at a fair value that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument. The ultimate realized price for a transaction may differ from its fair recorded value previously estimated using management judgment.\n\nValuation adjustments are recorded for the credit risk of our derivative portfolios in order to arrive at their fair values. Credit valuation adjustments (CVA) take into account our counterparties' creditworthiness, the current and potential future mark-to-market of transactions and the effects of credit mitigants such as master netting and collateral agreements. CVA amounts are derived from estimates of exposure at default (EAD), PD, recovery rates on a counterparty basis and market and credit factor correlations. EAD is the value of expected derivative related assets and liabilities at the time of default, estimated through modelling using underlying risk factors. PD is implied from the market prices for credit protection and the credit ratings of the counterparty. When market data is unavailable, it is estimated by incorporating assumptions and adjustments that market participants would use for determining fair value using these inputs. Correlation is the statistical measure of how credit and market factors may move in relation to one another. Correlation is estimated using historical data. CVA is calculated daily and changes are recorded in Non-interest income - Trading revenue.\n\nFVA is also calculated to incorporate the cost and benefit of funding in the valuation of uncollateralized and undercollateralized OTC derivatives. Future expected cash flows of these derivatives are discounted to reflect the cost and benefit of funding the derivatives by using a funding curve, implied volatilities and correlations as inputs.\n\nWhere required, a valuation adjustment is made to reflect the unrealized gain or loss at inception of a financial instrument contract where the fair value of that financial instrument is not obtained from a quoted market price or cannot be evidenced by other observable market transactions based on a valuation technique incorporating observable market data.\n\nA bid-offer valuation adjustment is required when a financial instrument is valued at the mid-market price, instead of the bid or offer price for asset or liability positions, respectively. The valuation adjustment takes into account the spread from the mid-market price to either the bid or offer price.\n\nSome valuation models require parameter calibration from such factors as market observable option prices. The calibration of parameters may be sensitive to factors such as the choice of instruments or optimization methodology. A valuation adjustment is also estimated to mitigate the uncertainties of parameter calibration and model limitations.\n\nIn determining fair value, a hierarchy is used which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Determination of fair value based on this hierarchy requires the use of observable market data whenever available. Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and model inputs that are either observable, or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 inputs include one or more inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value of the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available at the measurement date. The availability of inputs for valuation may affect the selection of valuation techniques. The classification of a financial instrument in the fair value hierarchy for disclosure purposes is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value.\n\nWhere observable prices or inputs are not available, management judgment is required to determine fair values by assessing other relevant sources of information such as historical data, proxy information from similar transactions, and through extrapolation and interpolation techniques. For more complex or illiquid instruments, significant judgment is required in the determination of the model used, the selection of model inputs, and in some cases, the application of valuation adjustments to the model value or quoted price for inactively traded financial instruments. The selection of model inputs may be subjective and the inputs may be unobservable. Unobservable inputs are inherently uncertain as there is little or no market data available from",

Appropriate parameter uncertainty and market risk valuation adjustments for such inputs and other model risk valuation adjustments are assessed in all such instances.\n\n## Loans\n\nLoans are debt instruments recognized initially at fair value and are subsequently measured in accordance with the Classification of financial assets policy provided above. The majority of our loans are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, which represents the gross carrying amount less allowance for credit losses.\n\nInterest on loans is recognized in Interest income using the effective interest method. The estimated future cash flows used in this calculation include those determined by the contractual term of the asset and all fees that are considered to be integral to the effective interest rate. Also included in this amount are transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts. Fees that relate to activities such as originating, restructuring or renegotiating loans are deferred and recognized as Interest income over the expected term of such loans using the effective interest method. Where there is a reasonable expectation that a loan will be originated, commitment and standby fees are also recognized as interest income over the expected term of the resulting loans using the effective interest method. Otherwise, such fees are recorded as other liabilities and amortized into Non-interest income over the commitment or standby period. Future prepayment fees on mortgage loans are not included as part of the effective interest rate at origination. If prepayment fees are received on a renewal of a mortgage loan before maturity, the fee is included as part of the effective interest rate, and if not renewed, the prepayment fee is recognized in interest income at the prepayment date.\n\nFor loans carried at amortized cost or FVOCI, impairment losses are recognized at each balance sheet date in accordance with the three-stage impairment model outlined below.\n\n## Allowance for credit losses\n\nAn allowance for credit losses (ACL) is established for all financial assets, except for financial assets classified or designated as FVTPL and equity securities designated as FVOCI, which are not subject to impairment assessment. Assets subject to impairment assessment include loans, debt securities, interest-bearing deposits with banks, customers' liability under acceptances, accounts and accrued interest receivable, and finance and operating lease receivables. ACL on loans measured at amortized cost is presented in Allowance for loan losses. ACL on debt securities measured at FVOCI is presented in Other components of equity. Other financial assets carried at amortized cost are presented net of ACL on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nOff-balance sheet items subject to impairment assessment include financial guarantees and undrawn loan commitments. ACL on off-balance sheet items is separately calculated and included in Other Liabilities - Provisions.\n\nWe measure the ACL on each balance sheet date according to a three-stage expected credit loss impairment model:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Performing financial assets\n- GLYPH<129> Stage 1 - From initial recognition of a financial asset to the date on which the asset has experienced a significant increase in credit risk relative to its initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized equal to the credit losses expected to result from defaults occurring over the 12 months following the reporting date.\n- GLYPH<129> Stage 2 - Following a significant increase in credit risk relative to the initial recognition of the financial asset, a loss allowance is recognized equal to the credit losses expected over the remaining lifetime of the asset.\n- GLYPH<129> Impaired financial assets\n- GLYPH<129> Stage 3 - When a financial asset is considered to be credit-impaired, a loss allowance is recognized equal to credit losses expected over the remaining lifetime of the asset. Interest income is calculated based on the carrying amount of the asset, net of the loss allowance, rather than on its gross carrying amount.\n\nThe ACL is a discounted probability-weighted estimate of the cash shortfalls expected to result from defaults over the relevant time horizon. For loan commitments, credit loss estimates consider the portion of the commitment that is expected to be drawn over the relevant time period. For financial guarantees, credit loss estimates are based on the expected payments required under the guarantee contract. For finance lease receivables, credit loss estimates are based on cash flows consistent with the cash flows used in measuring the lease receivable.\n\nIncreases or decreases in the required ACL attributable to model changes and new originations, sales or maturities, and changes in risk, parameters and exposures due to changes in loss expectations or stage transfers are recorded in PCL. Write-offs and recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded against ACL.\n\nThe ACL represents an unbiased estimate of expected credit losses on our financial assets as at the balance sheet date. Judgment is required in making assumptions and estimations when calculating the ACL, including movements between the three stages and the application of forward-looking information. The underlying assumptions and estimates may result in changes to the provisions from period to period that significantly affect our results of operations.\n\n## Measurement of expected credit losses\n\nExpected credit losses are based on a range of possible outcomes and consider all available reasonable and supportable information, including internal and external ratings, historical credit loss experience and expectations about future cash flows. The measurement of expected credit losses is based primarily on the product of the instrument's PD, loss given default (LGD), and EAD discounted to the reporting date. The main difference between Stage 1 and Stage 2 expected credit losses for performing financial assets is the respective calculation horizon. Stage 1 estimates project PD, LGD and EAD over a maximum period of 12 months while Stage 2 estimates project PD, LGD and EAD over the remaining lifetime of the instrument.\n\nAn expected credit loss estimate is produced for each individual exposure. Relevant parameters are modelled on a collective basis using portfolio segmentation that allows for appropriate incorporation of forward-looking information. To reflect other characteristics that are not already considered through modelling, expert credit judgment is exercised in determining the final expected credit losses.\n\nFor a small percentage of our portfolios which lack detailed historical information and/or loss experience, we apply simplified measurement approaches that may differ from what is described above. These approaches have been designed to maximize the available information that is reliable and supportable for each portfolio and may be collective in nature.\n\nExpected credit losses are discounted to the reporting period date using the effective interest rate.",

For most instruments, the expected life is limited to the remaining contractual life.\n\nAn exemption is provided for certain instruments with the following characteristics: (a) the instrument includes both a loan and undrawn commitment component; (b) we have the contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment; and (c) our exposure to credit losses is not limited to the contractual notice period. For products in scope of this exemption, the expected life may exceed the remaining contractual life and is the period over which our exposure to credit losses is not mitigated by our normal credit risk management actions. This period varies by product and risk category and is estimated based on our historical experience with similar exposures and consideration of credit risk management actions taken as part of our regular credit review cycle. Products in scope of this exemption include credit cards, overdraft balances and certain revolving lines of credit. Judgment is required in determining the instruments in scope for this exemption and estimating the appropriate remaining life based on our historical experience and credit risk mitigation practices.\n\n## Assessment of significant increase in credit risk\n\nThe assessment of significant increase in credit risk requires significant judgment. Movements between Stage 1 and Stage 2 are based on whether an instrument's credit risk as at the reporting date has increased significantly relative to the date it was initially recognized. For the purposes of this assessment, credit risk is based on an instrument's lifetime PD, not the losses we expect to incur. The assessment is generally performed at the instrument level.\n\nOur assessment of significant increases in credit risk is performed at least quarterly based on three factors. If any of the following factors indicates that a significant increase in credit risk has occurred, the instrument is moved from Stage 1 to Stage 2:\n\n- (1) We have established thresholds for significant increases in credit risk based on both a percentage and absolute change in lifetime PD relative to initial recognition. For our wholesale portfolio, a decrease in the borrower's risk rating is also required to determine that credit risk has increased significantly.\n- (2)  Additional qualitative reviews may be performed, as necessary, to assess the staging results, which may lead to adjustments to better reflect the positions whose credit risk has increased significantly. These reviews are completed at both the individual borrower levels and the portfolio level and may result in an instrument, a portfolio or a portion of a portfolio moving from Stage 1 to Stage 2.\n- (3)  Instruments which are 30 days past due are generally considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk, even if our other metrics do not indicate that a significant increase in credit risk has occurred.\n\nThe thresholds for movement between Stage 1 and Stage 2 are symmetrical. After a financial asset has transferred to Stage 2, if its credit risk is no longer considered to have significantly increased relative to its initial recognition, the financial asset will move back to Stage 1.\n\nFor certain instruments with low credit risk as at the reporting date, it is presumed that credit risk has not increased significantly relative to initial recognition. Credit risk is considered to be low if the instrument has a low risk of default, and the borrower has the ability to fulfill their contractual obligations both in the near term and in the longer term, including periods of adverse changes in the economic or business environment. Certain interest-bearing deposits with banks, assets purchased under reverse repurchase agreements, insurance policy loans, and liquidity facilities extended to our multi-seller conduits have been identified as having low credit risk.\n\n## Use of forward-looking information\n\nThe measurement of expected credit losses for each stage and the assessment of significant increase in credit risk considers information about past events and current conditions as well as reasonable and supportable projections of future events and economic conditions. The estimation and application of forward-looking information requires significant judgment.\n\nThe PD, LGD and EAD inputs used to estimate Stage 1 and Stage 2 credit loss allowances are modelled based on the macroeconomic variables (or changes in macroeconomic variables) that are most closely correlated with credit losses in the relevant portfolio. Each macroeconomic scenario used in our expected credit loss calculation includes a projection of all relevant macroeconomic variables used in our models for a five-year period, subsequently reverting to long-run averages. Macroeconomic variables used in our expected credit loss models include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, gross domestic product growth rates, equity return indices, commodity prices, and Canadian housing prices. Depending on their usage in the models, macroeconomic variables may be projected at a country, province/state or more granular level.\n\nOur estimation of expected credit losses in Stage 1 and Stage 2 is a discounted probability-weighted estimate that considers a minimum of three future macroeconomic scenarios. Our base case scenario is based on macroeconomic forecasts published by our internal economics group. The published forecasts are developed from models based on historical macroeconomic data, derived from public sources and financial markets. Upside and downside scenarios vary relative to our base case scenario based on reasonably possible alternative macroeconomic conditions. Additional and more severe downside scenarios are designed to capture a broader range of potential credit losses in certain sectors. Scenario design, including the identification of additional downside scenarios, occurs at least on an annual basis and more frequently if conditions warrant.\n\nScenarios are designed to capture a wide range of possible outcomes and weighted according to our best estimate of the relative likelihood of the range of outcomes that each scenario represents. Scenario weights take into account historical frequency, current trends, and forward-looking conditions and are updated on a quarterly basis. All scenarios considered are applied to all portfolios subject to expected credit losses with the same probabilities.\n\nOur assessment of significant increases in credit risk is based on changes in probability-weighted forward-looking lifetime PDs as at the reporting date, using the same macroeconomic scenarios as the calculation of expected credit losses.\n\n## Definition of default\n\nThe definition of default used in the measurement of expected credit losses is consistent with the definition of default used for our internal credit risk management purposes. Our definition of default may differ across products and consider both quantitative and qualitative factors, such as the terms of financial covenants and days past due. For retail and wholesale borrowers, except as detailed below, default occurs when the borrower is more than 90 days past due on any material obligation",

        "page_content": "to us, and/or we consider the borrower unlikely to make their payments in full without recourse action on our part, such as taking formal possession of any collateral held. For certain credit card balances, default occurs when payments are 180 days past due. For these balances, the use of a period in excess of 90 days past due is reasonable and supported by observable data on write-off and recovery rates experienced on historical credit card portfolios. The definition of default used is applied consistently from period to period and to all financial instruments unless it can be demonstrated that circumstances have changed such that another definition of default is more appropriate.\n\n## Credit-impaired financial assets (Stage 3)\n\nFinancial assets are assessed for credit-impairment at each balance sheet date and more frequently when circumstances warrant further assessment. Evidence of credit-impairment may include indications that the borrower is experiencing significant financial difficulty, probability of bankruptcy or other financial reorganization, as well as a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows evidenced by the adverse changes in the payments status of the borrower or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. An asset that is in Stage 3 will move back to Stage 2 when, as at the reporting date, it is no longer considered to be credit-impaired. The asset will transfer back to Stage 1 when its credit risk at the reporting date is no longer considered to have increased significantly from initial recognition, which could occur during the same reporting period as the transfer from Stage 3 to Stage 2.\n\nWhen a financial asset has been identified as credit-impaired, expected credit losses are measured as the difference between the asset's gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the instrument's original effective interest rate. For impaired financial assets with drawn and undrawn components, expected credit losses also reflect any credit losses related to the portion of the loan commitment that is expected to be drawn down over the remaining life of the instrument.\n\nWhen a financial asset is credit-impaired, interest ceases to be recognized on the regular accrual basis, which accrues income based on the gross carrying amount of the asset. Rather, interest income is calculated by applying the original effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the asset, which is the gross carrying amount less the related ACL.\n\nACL for credit-impaired loans in Stage 3 are established at the borrower level, where losses related to impaired loans are identified on individually significant loans, or collectively assessed and determined through the use of portfolio-based rates, without reference to particular loans.\n\n## Individually assessed loans (Stage 3)\n\nWhen individually significant loans are identified as impaired, we reduce the carrying value of the loans to their estimated realizable value by recording an individually assessed ACL to cover identified credit losses. The individually assessed ACL reflects the expected amount of principal and interest calculated under the terms of the original loan agreement that will not be recovered, and the impact of time delays in collecting principal and/or interest (time value of money). The estimated realizable value for each individually significant loan is the present value of expected future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate for each loan. When the amounts and timing of future cash flows cannot be estimated with reasonable reliability, the estimated realizable amount may be determined using observable market prices for comparable loans, the fair value of collateral underlying the loans, and other reasonable and supported methods based on management judgment.\n\nIndividually-assessed allowances are established in consideration of a range of possible outcomes, which may include macroeconomic or non-macroeconomic scenarios, to the extent relevant to the circumstances of the specific borrower being assessed. Assumptions used in estimating expected future cash flows reflect current and expected future economic conditions and are generally consistent with those used in Stage 1 and Stage 2 measurement.\n\nSignificant judgment is required in assessing evidence of credit-impairment and estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows when determining expected credit losses. Changes in the amount expected to be recovered would have a direct impact on PCL and may result in a change in the ACL.\n\n## Collectively assessed loans (Stage 3)\n\nLoans that are collectively assessed are grouped on the basis of similar risk characteristics, taking into account loan type, industry, geographic location, collateral type, past due status and other relevant factors.\n\nThe collectively-assessed ACL reflects: (i) the expected amount of principal and interest calculated under the terms of the original loan agreement that will not be recovered, and (ii) the impact of time delays in collecting principal and/or interest (time value of money).\n\nThe expected principal and interest collection is estimated on a portfolio basis and references historical loss experience of comparable portfolios with similar credit risk characteristics, adjusted for the current environment and expected future conditions. A portfolio specific coverage ratio is applied against the impaired loan balance in determining the collectivelyassessed ACL. The time value of money component is calculated by using the discount factors applied to groups of loans sharing common characteristics. The discount factors represent the expected recovery pattern of the comparable group of loans, and reflect the historical experience of these groups adjusted for current and expected future economic conditions and/or industry factors. Significant judgment is required in assessing evidence of impairment and estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows when determining expected credit losses. Changes in the amount expected to be recovered would have a direct impact on PCL and may result in a change in the ACL.\n\n## Write-off of loans\n\nLoans and the related ACL are written off, either partially or in full, when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Where loans are secured, they are generally written off after receipt of any proceeds from the realization of collateral. In circumstances where the net realizable value of any collateral has been determined and there is no reasonable expectation of further recovery, write off may be earlier. For credit cards, the balances and related ACL are generally written off when payment is 180 days past due. Personal loans are generally written off at 150 days past due.\n\n## Modifications\n\nThe original terms of a financial asset may be renegotiated or otherwise modified, resulting in changes to the contractual terms of the financial asset that affect the contractual cash flows. The treatment of such modifications is primarily based on the process undertaken to execute the renegotiation and the nature and extent of the expected changes. In the normal course of business, modifications which are performed for credit reasons, primarily related to troubled debt restructurings, are generally",

Modifications which are performed for other than credit reasons are generally considered to be an expiry of the original cash flows; accordingly, such renegotiations are treated as a derecognition of the original financial asset and recognition of a new financial asset.\n\nIf a modification of terms does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, the carrying amount of the financial asset is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate and a gain or loss is recognized. The financial asset continues to be subject to the same assessments for significant increase in credit risk relative to initial recognition and credit-impairment, as described above. A modified financial asset will transfer out of Stage 3 if the conditions that led to it being identified as credit-impaired are no longer present and relate objectively to an event occurring after the original credit-impairment was recognized. A modified financial asset will transfer out of Stage 2 when it no longer satisfies the relative thresholds set to identify significant increases in credit risk, which are based on changes in its lifetime PD, days past due and other qualitative considerations. The financial asset continues to be monitored for significant increases in credit risk and credit-impairment.\n\nIf a modification of terms results in derecognition of the original financial asset and recognition of the new financial asset, the new financial asset will generally be recorded in Stage 1, unless it is determined to be credit-impaired at the time of the renegotiation. For the purposes of assessing for significant increases in credit risk, the date of initial recognition for the new financial asset is the date of the modification.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nWhen derivatives are embedded in other financial instruments or host contracts, such combinations are known as hybrid instruments. Some of the cash flows of a hybrid instrument vary in a way similar to a stand-alone derivative. If the host contract is a financial asset within the scope of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), the classification and measurement criteria are applied to the entire hybrid instrument as described in the Classification of financial assets section of Note 2. If the host contract is a financial liability or an asset that is not within the scope of IFRS 9, embedded derivatives are separately recognized if the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, unless an election has been made to elect the fair value option, as described above. The host contract is accounted for in accordance with the relevant standards.\n\nDerivatives are primarily used in trading activities. Derivatives are also used to manage our exposure to interest, currency, credit and other market risks. The most frequently used derivative products are interest rate and foreign exchange swaps, options, futures and forward rate agreements, equity swaps and credit derivatives. All derivative instruments are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.\n\nWhen derivatives are used in trading activities, the realized and unrealized gains and losses on these derivatives are recognized in Trading revenue in Non-interest income. Derivatives with positive fair values are reported as Derivative assets and derivatives with negative fair values are reported as Derivative liabilities. In accordance with our policy for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities, the net fair value of certain derivative assets and liabilities are reported as an asset or liability, as appropriate. Valuation adjustments are included in the fair value of Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities. Premiums paid and premiums received are shown in Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities, respectively.\n\nWhen derivatives are used to manage our own exposures, we determine for each derivative whether hedge accounting can be applied, as discussed in the Hedge accounting section below.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognized from our Consolidated Balance Sheets when our contractual rights to the cash flows from the assets have expired, when we retain the rights to receive the cash flows of the assets but assume an obligation to pay those cash flows to a third party subject to certain pass-through requirements or when we transfer our contractual rights to receive the cash flows and substantially all of the risks and rewards of the assets have been transferred. When we retain substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets are not derecognized from our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are accounted for as secured financing transactions. When we neither retain nor transfer substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the assets, we derecognize the assets if control over the assets is relinquished. If we retain control over the transferred assets, we continue to recognize the transferred assets to the extent of our continuing involvement.\n\nManagement judgment is applied in determining whether the contractual rights to the cash flows from the transferred assets have expired or whether we retain the rights to receive cash flows on the assets but assume an obligation to pay for those cash flows. We derecognize transferred financial assets if we transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of the ownership in the assets. When assessing whether we have transferred substantially all of the risk and rewards of the transferred assets, management considers the Bank's exposure before and after the transfer with the variability in the amount and timing of the net cash flows of the transferred assets. In transfers in which we retain the servicing rights, management has applied judgment in assessing the benefits of servicing against market expectations. When the benefits of servicing are greater than fair value, a servicing asset is recognized in Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. When the benefits of servicing are less than fair value, a servicing liability is recognized in Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nWe derecognize a financial liability from our Consolidated Balance Sheets when our obligation specified in the contract expires, or is discharged or cancelled. We recognize the difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability transferred and the consideration paid in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## Interest\n\nInterest is recognized in Interest income and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income for all interest-bearing financial instruments. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash flows over the expected life of the financial asset or liability to the net carrying amount upon initial recognition. Significant judgment is applied in determining the effective interest rate due to uncertainty in the timing and amounts of future cash flows.",

        "page_content": "## Dividend income\n\nDividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established. This is the ex-dividend date for listed equity securities, and usually the date when shareholders have approved the dividend for unlisted equity securities.\n\n## Transaction costs\n\nTransaction costs are expensed as incurred for financial instruments classified or designated as FVTPL. For other financial instruments, transaction costs are capitalized on initial recognition. For financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortized cost and debt financial assets measured at FVOCI, capitalized transaction costs are amortized through net income over the estimated life of the instrument using the effective interest method.\n\n## Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets when there exists both a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## Assets purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and sold under repurchase agreements\n\nWe purchase securities under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) and take possession of these securities. We monitor the market value of the securities purchased and additional collateral is obtained when appropriate. We have the right to liquidate the collateral held in the event of counterparty default. Reverse repurchase agreements are treated as collateralized lending transactions. We also sell securities under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements), which are treated as collateralized borrowing transactions. The securities received under reverse repurchase agreements and securities delivered under repurchase agreements are not recognized on, or derecognized from, our Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively, unless the risks and rewards of ownership are obtained or relinquished.\n\nReverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements are carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the amounts at which the securities were initially acquired or sold, except when they are classified or designated as FVTPL and are recorded at fair value. Interest earned on reverse repurchase agreements is included in Interest income, and interest incurred on repurchase agreements is included in Interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes in fair value for reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements classified or designated as FVTPL are included in Trading revenue or Other in Non-interest income.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nWe have elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting principles under IAS 39 instead of those under IFRS 9.\n\nWe use derivatives and non-derivatives in our hedging strategies to manage our exposure to interest rate, currency, credit and other market risks. Where hedge accounting can be applied, a hedge relationship is designated and documented at inception to detail the particular risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. The documentation identifies the specific asset, liability or anticipated cash flows being hedged, the risk that is being hedged, the type of hedging instrument used and how effectiveness will be assessed. We assess, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the hedging instruments are 'highly effective' in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged items. A hedge is regarded as highly effective only if the following criteria are met: (i) at inception of the hedge and throughout its life, the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, and (ii) actual results of the hedge are within a pre-determined range. We perform effectiveness testing to demonstrate that the relationship has been and is expected to be effective over the remaining term of the hedge. In the case of hedging a forecast transaction, the transaction must have a high probability of occurring and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect the reported net profit or loss. Hedge accounting is discontinued when it is determined that the hedging instrument is no longer effective as a hedge, the hedging instrument or hedged item is terminated or sold, or the forecast transaction is no longer deemed highly probable. Refer to Note 9 for the fair value of derivatives and non-derivative instruments categorized by their hedging relationships, as well as derivatives that are not designated in hedging relationships.\n\nUntil the hedging relationships impacted by the Interest rate benchmark reform (the Reform) fully transition to alternative benchmark rates (ABRs), our prospective effectiveness testing is based on existing hedged cash flows or hedged risks and any ineffectiveness arising from retrospective testing does not result in a discontinuation of the hedge. Additionally, effectiveness testing is applied separately to hedged items referencing ABRs and hedged items referencing interbank offered rates (IBORs), which include USD London Interbank Offered Rate (USD LIBOR) and Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR), in accordance with the Phase 2 amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments , IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement , IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures , IFRS 4 Insurance contracts , and IFRS 16 Leases (the Amendments). Subsequently, when these relationships fully transition to ABRs, and provided qualifying criteria are met, we will amend the related hedge documentation for the ABR risk, including consequential changes to the description of the hedging instrument(s), the hedged item(s), and the method for assessing hedge effectiveness, without discontinuing the existing hedging relationships.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nIn a fair value hedging relationship, the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk and recognized in Non-interest income. Changes in fair value of the hedged item, to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective, are offset by changes in the fair value of the hedging derivative, which are also recognized in Non-interest income. When hedge accounting is discontinued, the carrying value of the hedged item is no longer adjusted and the cumulative fair value adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged items are amortized to Net income over the expected remaining life of the hedged items.\n\nWe predominantly use interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to changes in a fixed interest rate instrument's fair value caused by changes in interest rates. Until the hedging relationships impacted by the Reform fully transition to ABRs, we apply hedge accounting to IBOR rates which may not be contractually specified when that rate is separately identifiable and reliably measurable at inception of the hedge relationship.",

When hedge accounting is discontinued, the cumulative amounts previously recognized in OCI are reclassified to Net interest income during the periods when the variability in the cash flows of the hedged item affects Net interest income. Unrealized gains and losses on derivatives are reclassified immediately to Net income when the hedged item is sold or terminated early, or when the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur.\n\nWe predominantly use interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in cash flows related to a variable-rate asset or liability. Until the hedging relationships impacted by the Reform fully transition to ABRs, we treat the highly probable hedged IBORs based cash flows of groups of similar assets or liabilities with similar risk characteristics as unchanged as a result of the Reform. In addition, associated cash flow hedge reserves are not recycled into net income solely due to changes related to the transition from IBORs to ABRs. Subsequently, when some items in the group transition to ABRs before other items, the individual hedged items are allocated to subgroups based on the benchmark interest rate being hedged. We test hedge effectiveness based on the defined subgroups, in accordance with the Amendments, if eligibility requirements are met. If a subgroup fails the eligibility requirements, we would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively for the hedging relationship in its entirety.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nIn hedging our foreign currency exposure to a net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portion of foreign exchange gains and losses on the hedging instruments, net of applicable taxes, is recognized in OCI and the ineffective portion is recognized in Non-interest income. The amounts, or a portion thereof, previously recognized in Other components of equity are recognized in Net income on the disposal, or partial disposal, of the foreign operation.\n\nWe use foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency-denominated liabilities to manage our foreign currency exposures to net investments in foreign operations having a functional currency other than the Canadian dollar.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts are contracts that contingently require us to make specified payments (in cash, other assets, our own shares or provision of services) to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. Liabilities are recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the inception of a guarantee for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. Financial guarantees are subsequently remeasured at the higher of (i) the amount of expected credit losses and (ii) the amount initially recognized less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognized.\n\nIf the financial guarantee contract meets the definition of a derivative, it is measured at fair value at each balance sheet date and reported under Derivatives on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Insurance and segregated funds\n\nPremiums from long-duration contracts, primarily life, health and annuity insurance (life insurance), are recognized when due in Non-interest income - Insurance premiums, investment and fee income. Premiums from short-duration contracts, primarily property and casualty, and fees for administrative services are recognized in Insurance premiums, investment and fee income over the related contract period. Unearned premiums of the short-duration contracts, representing the unexpired portion of premiums, are reported in Other liabilities. Investments made by our insurance operations are classified as FVOCI instruments and amortized cost instruments, except for investments supporting the policy benefit liabilities on life insurance contracts and a portion of property and casualty contracts. These are designated as FVTPL with changes in fair value reported in Insurance premiums, investment and fee income.\n\nInsurance claims and policy benefit liabilities represent current claims and estimates for future insurance policy benefits. Liabilities for life insurance contracts are determined using the Canadian Asset Liability Method (CALM), which incorporates assumptions for mortality, morbidity, policy lapses and surrenders, investment yields, policy dividends, operating and policy maintenance expenses and provisions for adverse deviation. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually and updated in response to actual experience and market conditions. Liabilities for property and casualty insurance represent estimated provisions for reported and unreported claims. Liabilities for life and property and casualty insurance are included in Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities. Changes in Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities are included in the Insurance policyholder benefits, claims and acquisition expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which the estimates change.\n\nPremiums ceded for reinsurance and reinsurance recoveries on policyholder benefits and claims incurred are reported in income and expense as appropriate. Reinsurance recoverables, which relate to paid benefits and unpaid claims, are included in Other assets.\n\nAcquisition costs for new insurance contracts consist of commissions, premium taxes, certain underwriting costs and other costs that vary with the acquisition of new contracts. Deferred acquisition costs for life insurance products are implicitly recognized in Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities by CALM. For property and casualty insurance, these costs are classified as Other assets and amortized over the policy term.\n\nSegregated funds are lines of business in which we issue an insurance contract where the benefit amount is directly linked to the market value of the investments held in the underlying fund. The contractual arrangement is such that the underlying segregated fund assets are registered in our name but the segregated fund policyholders bear the risks and rewards of the funds' investment performance. Liabilities for these contracts are calculated based on contractual obligations using actuarial assumptions and are at least equivalent to the surrender or transfer value calculated by reference to the value of the relevant underlying funds or indices. Segregated funds' assets and liabilities are separately presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the segregated fund policyholders bear the risks and rewards of the funds' performance, investment income earned by the segregated funds and expenses incurred by the segregated funds are offset and are not separately presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Fee income we earn from segregated funds includes management fees, mortality, policy administration and surrender charges, and these fees are recorded in Non-interest income - Insurance premiums, investment",

The liability associated with these minimum guarantees is recorded in Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities.\n\nLiability adequacy tests are performed for all insurance contract portfolios at each balance sheet date to ensure the adequacy of insurance contract liabilities. Current best estimates of future contractual cash flows, claims handling and administration costs, and investment returns from the assets backing the liabilities are taken into account in the tests. When the test results indicate that there is a deficiency in liabilities, the deficiency is charged immediately to our Consolidated Statements of Income by writing down the deferred acquisition costs in Other assets and/or increasing Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities.\n\n## Employee benefits - Pensions and other post-employment benefits\n\nOur defined benefit pension expense, which is included in Non-interest expense - Human resources, consists of the cost of employee pension benefits for the current year's service, net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset), past service cost and gains or losses on settlement. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit obligation, which comprise actuarial gains and losses and return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability), are recognized immediately in OCI in the period in which they occur. Actuarial gains and losses comprise experience adjustments (the effects of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred), as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions. Amounts recognized in OCI will not be reclassified subsequently to net income. Past service cost is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment and is charged immediately to income.\n\nFor each defined benefit pension plan, we recognize the present value of our defined benefit obligations less the fair value of the plan assets as a defined benefit liability reported in Other liabilities - Employee benefit liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For plans where there is a net defined benefit asset, the amount is reported as an asset in Other assets Employee benefit assets on our Consolidated Balance sheets.\n\nThe calculation of defined benefit expenses and obligations requires significant judgment as the recognition is dependent on discount rates and various actuarial assumptions such as healthcare cost trend rates, projected salary increases, retirement age and mortality and termination rates. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. For our pension and other post-employment benefit plans, the discount rate is determined by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds. Since the discount rate is based on currently available yields, and involves management's assessment of market liquidity, it is only a proxy for future yields. Actuarial assumptions, set in accordance with current practices in the respective countries of our plans, may differ from actual experience as country specific statistics are only estimates of future employee behaviour. These assumptions are determined by management and are reviewed by actuaries at least annually. Changes to any of the above assumptions may affect the amounts of benefits obligations, expenses and remeasurements that we recognize.\n\nOur contributions to defined contribution pension plans are expensed when employees have rendered services in exchange for such contributions. Defined contribution pension expense is included in Non-interest expense - Human resources.\n\n## Share-based compensation\n\nWe offer share-based compensation plans to certain key employees and to our non-employee directors.\n\nTo account for stock options granted to employees, compensation expense is recognized over the applicable vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity. Fair value is determined by using option valuation models, which take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and other relevant factors. When the options are exercised, the exercise price proceeds together with the amount initially recorded in equity are credited to common shares. Our other share-based compensation plans include performance deferred share plans and deferred share unit plans for key employees (the Plans). The obligations for the Plans are accrued over their vesting periods. The Plans are settled in cash.\n\nFor cash-settled awards, our accrued obligations are adjusted to their fair value at each balance sheet date. For sharesettled awards, our expected obligations recognized in equity are based on the fair value of our common shares at the date of grant. Changes in our obligations, net of related hedges, are recorded as Non-interest expense - Human resources in our Consolidated Statements of Income with a corresponding increase in Other liabilities for cash-settled awards and in Retained earnings for share-settled awards. Compensation expense is recognized in the year the awards are earned by plan participants based on the vesting schedule of the relevant plans, net of estimated forfeitures.\n\nThe compensation cost attributable to options and awards granted to employees who are eligible to retire or will become eligible to retire during the vesting period, is recognized immediately if the employee is eligible to retire on the grant date or over the period between the grant date and the date the employee becomes eligible to retire.\n\nOur contributions to the employee savings and share ownership plans are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome tax comprises current tax and deferred tax and is recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity.\n\nCurrent income tax payable on profits is recognized as an expense based on the applicable tax laws in each jurisdiction in the period in which profits arise, calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting and tax purposes. A deferred income tax asset or liability is determined for each temporary difference, except for earnings related to our subsidiaries, branches, associates and interests in joint ventures where the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future and we have the ability to control the timing of reversal. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the period that the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset when they are levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities within the same tax reporting group (which intends to settle on a net basis), and when there is a legal right to offset. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the same conditions are satisfied. Our Consolidated Statements of Income include items that are non-taxable or non-deductible for income tax purposes and, accordingly, this causes the income tax provision to be different from what it would be if based on statutory rates.",

On a quarterly basis, we review our deferred income tax assets to determine whether it is probable that the benefits associated with these assets will be realized; this review involves evaluating both positive and negative evidence.\n\nWe are subject to income tax laws in various jurisdictions where we operate, and the complex tax laws are potentially subject to different interpretations by us and the relevant taxation authorities. Significant judgment is required in the interpretation of the relevant tax laws and in assessing the probability of acceptance of our tax positions to determine our tax provision, which includes our best estimate of uncertain tax positions that are under audit or appeal by the relevant tax authorities. We perform a review on a quarterly basis to incorporate our best assessment based on information available, but additional liability and income tax expense could result based on the acceptance of our tax positions by the relevant tax authorities.\n\nThe determination of our deferred tax asset or liability also requires significant management judgment as the recognition is dependent on our projection of future taxable profits and tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the period the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Any changes in our projection will result in changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and also deferred tax expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nThe IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes (IAS 12) in May 2023 to address the Pillar Two Model Rules for International Tax Reform , including a global 15% minimum tax. The amendments introduce, with immediate effect, a temporary recognition exception in relation to accounting and disclosure for deferred taxes arising from the implementation of the international tax reform.\n\n## Business combinations, goodwill and other intangibles\n\nAll business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Non-controlling interests, if any, are recognized at their proportionate share of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities, unless otherwise indicated. Identifiable intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill and included in Other intangibles. Goodwill represents the excess of the price paid for the business acquired over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired on the date of acquisition.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing, which is undertaken at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Impairment testing is performed annually as at August 1, or more frequently if there are objective indicators of impairment, by comparing the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit (CGU) with its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its value in use (VIU) and its fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD). VIU is the present value of the expected future cash flows from a CGU. FVLCD is the amount obtainable from the sale of a CGU in an orderly transaction between market participants, less disposal costs. The fair value of a CGU is estimated using valuation techniques such as a discounted cash flow method, adjusted to reflect the considerations of a prospective third-party buyer. External evidence such as binding sale agreements or recent transactions for similar businesses within the same industry is considered to the extent that it is available.\n\nSignificant judgment is involved in estimating the model inputs used to determine the recoverable amount of our CGUs, in particular future cash flows, discount rates and terminal growth rates, due to the uncertainty in the timing and amount of cash flows and the forward-looking nature of these inputs. Future cash flows are based on financial plans agreed by management which are estimated based on forecast results, business initiatives, planned capital investments and returns to shareholders. Discount rates are based on the bank-wide cost of capital, adjusted for CGU-specific risks and currency exposure as reflected by differences in expected inflation. Bank-wide cost of capital is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, the Dividend Growth Model and peer analysis. CGU-specific risks include country risk, business/operational risk, geographic risk (including political risk, devaluation risk and government regulation), currency risk and price risk (including product pricing risk and inflation). Terminal growth rates are based on the long-term steady state growth expectations in the countries within which the CGU operates. If the future cash flows and other assumptions in future periods deviate significantly from the current amounts used in our impairment testing, the value of our goodwill could become impaired, with any such impairment loss recognized in Non-interest expense.\n\nThe carrying amount of a CGU includes the carrying amount of assets, liabilities and goodwill allocated to the CGU. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other non-financial assets of the CGU proportionately based on the carrying amount of each asset. Any impairment loss is charged to income in the period in which the impairment is identified. Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment are prohibited.\n\nUpon disposal of a portion of a CGU, the carrying amount of goodwill related to the portion of the CGU sold is included in the determination of gains or losses on disposal. The carrying amount is determined based on the relative fair value of the disposed portion to the total CGU.\n\n## Other intangibles\n\nIntangible assets represent identifiable non-monetary assets and are acquired either separately or through a business combination, or generated internally. Intangible assets acquired through a business combination are recognized separately from goodwill when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, and their fair value can be measured reliably. The cost of a separately acquired intangible asset includes its purchase price and directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for its intended use. In respect of internally generated intangible assets, cost includes all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Research and development costs that are not eligible for capitalization are expensed. After initial recognition, an intangible asset is carried at its cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets with a finite-life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: computer software - 3 to 10 years; and customer list and relationships - 10 to 20 years. We do not have any intangible assets with indefinite lives.\n\nIntangible assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting period. If there is an indication that an intangible asset may be impaired, an impairment test is performed by comparing the carrying amount of the intangible asset to its recoverable amount. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, we estimate the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. If the recoverable amount of the asset (or CGU) is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the intangible asset is written down to its recoverable amount as an impairment loss.",

If an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is revised to the lower of its recoverable amount and the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization) had there been no prior impairment.\n\nDue to the subjective nature of these estimates, significant judgment is required in determining the useful lives and recoverable amounts of our intangible assets, and assessing whether certain events or circumstances constitute objective evidence of impairment. Estimates of the recoverable amounts of our intangible assets rely on certain key inputs, including future cash flows and discount rates. Future cash flows are based on sales projections and allocated costs which are estimated based on forecast results and business initiatives. Discount rates are based on the bank-wide cost of capital, adjusted for assetspecific risks. Changes in these assumptions may impact the amount of impairment loss recognized in Non-interest expense.\n\n## Other\n\n## Translation of foreign currencies\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Canadian dollars at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the translation and settlement of these items are recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost are translated into Canadian dollars at historical rates.\n\nAssets and liabilities of our foreign operations with functional currencies other than Canadian dollars are translated into Canadian dollars at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date, and income and expenses of these foreign operations are translated at average rates of exchange for the reporting period.\n\nUnrealized gains or losses arising as a result of the translation of our foreign operations along with the effective portion of related hedges are reported in Other components of equity on an after-tax basis. Upon disposal or partial disposal of a foreign operation, an appropriate portion of the accumulated net translation gains or losses is included in Non-interest income.\n\n## Premises and equipment\n\nPremises and equipment includes land, buildings, leasehold improvements, computer equipment, furniture, fixtures and other equipment, and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, except for land which is not depreciated, and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises the purchase price, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for its intended use, and the initial estimate of any disposal costs. Depreciation is recorded principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are 25 to 50 years for buildings, 3 to 10 years for computer equipment, and 5 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures and other equipment. The amortization period for leasehold improvements is the lesser of the useful life of the leasehold improvements or the lease term plus the first renewal period, if reasonably assured of renewal. Depreciation methods, useful lives, and residual values are reassessed at each reporting period and adjusted as appropriate. Gains and losses on disposal are recorded in Non-interest income.\n\nPremises and equipment are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting period. If there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, an impairment test is performed by comparing the asset's carrying amount to its recoverable amount.\n\nAfter the recognition of impairment, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to reflect the asset's revised carrying amount. If an impairment is later reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is revised to the lower of the asset's recoverable amount and the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation) had there been no prior impairment loss. The depreciation charge in future periods is adjusted to reflect the revised carrying amount.\n\nRight-of-use assets are also included in premises and equipment.\n\n## Leasing\n\nAt inception of a contract, we assess whether a contract is or contains a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from, and direct the use of, an identified asset for a period of time in return for consideration.\n\nWhen we are the lessee in a lease arrangement, we initially record a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets are unspecialized, common, technologically unsophisticated, widely available and widely used non-infrastructure assets. For short-term leases and leases of low-value assets, we record the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWhere we are reasonably certain to exercise extension and termination options, they are included in the lease term. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted at our incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, recorded in Interest expense.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured based on the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for lease payments made on or before the commencement date, initial direct costs incurred, and an estimate of costs to dismantle, remove, or restore the asset, less any lease incentives received. Costs related to dismantling and removing leasehold improvements are capitalized as part of the leasehold improvement asset (rather than the right-of-use asset of the lease) when the leasehold improvements are separately capitalized.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated to the earlier of the lease term and the useful life, unless ownership will transfer to RBC or we are reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, in which case the useful life of the right-of-use asset is used. We apply IAS 36 Impairment of assets to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and account for any identified impairment loss as described in the premises and equipment accounting policies above.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount and are recognized when we have a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date. Significant judgment is required in determining whether a present obligation exists and in estimating the probability, timing and amount of any outflows. We record provisions related to litigation, asset retirement obligations and other items.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments (continued)\n\nWe are required to estimate the results of ongoing legal proceedings, and expenses to be incurred to dispose of capital assets. The forward-looking nature of these estimates requires us to use a significant amount of judgment in projecting the timing and amount of future cash flows. We record our provisions on the basis of all available information at the end of the reporting period and make adjustments on a quarterly basis to reflect current expectations. It may not be possible to predict the resolution of these matters or the timing of their ultimate resolution. Should actual results differ from our expectations, we may incur expenses in excess of the provisions recognized. Where appropriate, we apply judgment in limiting the extent of our provisions-related disclosures as not to prejudice our positions in matters of dispute.\n\nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, such as an insurer, a separate asset is recognized if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received.\n\n## Commissions and fees\n\nCommissions and fees primarily relate to Investment management and custodial fees, Mutual fund revenue, Securities brokerage commissions, Services charges, Underwriting and other advisory fees, Card service revenue and Credit fees, and are recognized based on the applicable service contracts with clients.\n\nInvestment management and custodial fees and Mutual fund revenue are generally calculated as a percentage of daily or period-end net asset values (NAV) based on the terms of the contract with clients and are received monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually, depending on the terms of the contract. Investment management and custodial fees are generally derived from assets under management (AUM) when our clients solicit the investment capabilities of an investment manager or from assets under administration (AUA) where the investment strategy is directed by the client or a designated third-party manager. Mutual fund revenue is generally derived from the daily NAV of the mutual funds. Investment management and custodial fees and Mutual fund revenue are recognized over time when the service is provided to the client, provided that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur.\n\nCommissions earned on Securities brokerage services and Service charges that are related to the provision of specific transaction-type services are recognized when the service is fulfilled. Where services are provided over time, revenue is recognized as the services are provided.\n\nUnderwriting and other advisory fees primarily relate to underwriting of new issuances of debt or equity and various advisory services. Underwriting fees are generally expressed as a percentage of the funds raised through issuance and are recognized when the service has been completed. Advisory fees vary depending on the scope and type of engagement and can be fixed in nature or contingent on a future event. Advisory fees are recognized over the period in which the service is provided and are recognized only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue will not occur.\n\nCard service revenue primarily includes interchange revenue and annual card fees. Interchange revenue is calculated as a fixed percentage of the transaction amount and recognized when the card transaction is settled. Annual card fees are fixed fees and are recognized over a 12 month period.\n\nCredit fees are primarily earned for arranging syndicated loans and making credit available on undrawn facilities. The timing of the recognition of credit fees varies based on the nature of the services provided.\n\nWhen service fees and other costs are incurred in relation to commissions and fees earned, we record these costs on a gross basis in either Non-interest expense - Other or Non-interest expense - Human resources based on our assessment of whether we have primary responsibility to fulfill the contract with the client and have discretion in establishing the price for the commissions and fees earned, which may require judgment.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share is computed by dividing Net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Net income available to common shareholders is determined after deducting dividend entitlements of preferred shareholders and distributions on other equity instruments, any gains (losses) on redemption of preferred shares and other equity instruments net of related income taxes and the net income attributable to non-controlling interests.\n\nDiluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if additional common shares are assumed to be issued under securities or contracts that entitle their holders to obtain common shares in the future, to the extent such entitlement is not subject to unresolved contingencies. For contracts that may be settled in cash or in common shares at our option, diluted earnings per share is calculated based on the assumption that such contracts will be settled in shares. Income and expenses associated with these types of contracts are excluded from the Net income available to common shareholders, and the additional number of shares that would be issued is included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. For stock options whose exercise price is less than the average market price of our common shares, using the treasury stock method, they are assumed to be exercised and the proceeds are used to repurchase common shares at the average market price for the period. The incremental number of common shares issued under stock options and repurchased from proceeds is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.\n\n## Share capital and other equity instruments\n\nWe classify a financial instrument that we issue as a financial asset, financial liability or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.\n\nOur common shares held by us are classified as treasury shares in equity and accounted for at weighted average cost. Upon the sale of treasury shares, the difference between the sale proceeds and the cost of the shares is recognized in Retained earnings. Financial instruments issued by us are classified as equity instruments when there is no contractual obligation to transfer cash or other financial assets. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of equity instruments are included in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax. Financial instruments that will be settled by a variable number of our common shares upon their conversion by the holders as well as the related accrued distributions are classified as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Dividends and yield distributions on these instruments are classified as Interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. For compound instruments comprised of both liability and equity components, the liability component is initially measured at fair value with any residual amount assigned to the equity component.",

        "page_content": "## Future changes in accounting policy and disclosure\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17)\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 to establish a comprehensive insurance standard which provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held and will replace the existing IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4). In June 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 17, including deferral of the effective date by two years. This new standard is effective for us on November 1, 2023 and is to be applied retrospectively with comparatives restated beginning November 1, 2022.\n\nUnder IFRS 17, insurance contracts are contracts under which we accept significant insurance risk from a policyholder by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder. Embedded derivatives, investment components and promises to provide non-insurance services, provided specific criteria are met, are separated from the measurement of insurance and reinsurance contracts. Insurance and reinsurance contracts are aggregated into portfolios that are subject to similar risks and are managed together, and then divided into groups based on the period of issuance and expected profitability. Groups are separately recognized and measured using one of three measurement models depending on the characteristics of the contracts:\n\n- GLYPH<129> For insurance contracts with direct participating features, the contracts are measured using the variable fee approach (VFA).\n- GLYPH<129> For insurance contracts and reinsurance contracts held with a short duration of one year or less, the premium allocation approach (PAA) is elected.\n- GLYPH<129> The general measurement method (GMM) is applied to all remaining contracts.\n\nUnder the GMM and VFA, the liabilities for remaining coverage and incurred claims for groups of contracts are measured as the sum of the fulfilment cash flows and the contractual service margin (CSM), which are recalculated at the end of each reporting period. The fulfilment cash flows consist of the present value of future cash flows and a risk adjustment for non-financial risk. For insurance contracts, the CSM represents the unearned profit for providing insurance coverage. For reinsurance contracts held, the CSM represents the net cost or net gain of purchasing reinsurance. Under the PAA, the liability for remaining coverage for each group is measured as the premiums received less insurance revenue recognized for services provided, while the liability for incurred claims is measured as the fulfillment cash flows for incurred claims plus adjustment on any financing components. Losses from the recognition of onerous groups of insurance contracts, regardless of the measurement model applied, are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income immediately.\n\n- The following are key differences between IFRS 17 and IFRS 4:\n- GLYPH<129> New business profits are deferred and measured as the CSM of the insurance contract liabilities and amortized into income as insurance contract services are provided, while losses are recognized into income immediately. Under IFRS 4, gains and losses are recognized in income immediately. On July 18, 2023, OSFI released regulatory guidance to allow the inclusion of the CSM in calculating CET1 capital and related ratios, therefore, there will be no impact on the capital metrics from such reduction in retained earnings resulting from the CSM.\n- GLYPH<129> Discount rates used in calculating the present value of insurance contract liabilities are based on the characteristics of the insurance contracts unlike IFRS 4 which is based on the assets supporting the liabilities.\n- GLYPH<129> Presentation and disclosure changes are expected due to the new requirements.\n\nWhile IFRS 17 impacts the timing of profit recognition of insurance contracts, it will have no impact on total profit recognized over the lifetime of these contracts.\n\n## Impact of IFRS 17 transition excluding the impact of reclassifications of financial assets\n\nUpon the adoption of IFRS 17, we will apply IFRS 17 retrospectively by adjusting our Consolidated Balance Sheets as at November 1, 2022 and restating comparative information. The full retrospective approach will be applied for all insurance and reinsurance contracts unless it is impracticable to do so. The full retrospective approach is applied to all contracts measured using the PAA and all new contracts issued on and after November 1, 2022 measured using the GMM and VFA as if IFRS 17 had always been applied. Due to data availability and the inability to use hindsight, the fair value approach is applied to contracts issued before November 1, 2022 that are measured under the GMM and VFA. Under the fair value approach, the CSM of the liability for remaining coverage is calculated as the difference between the fair value of a group of contracts and the fulfillment cash flows measured at the date of transition.\n\nBased on current estimates, the adoption of IFRS 17 is expected to result in a reduction in retained earnings of approximately $2.4 billion, net of taxes, as at November 1, 2022. This is attributable to the establishment of the CSM and other remeasurement changes to insurance and reinsurance contracts and related tax effects. The estimated CSM of all insurance contracts net of reinsurance contracts held as at November 1, 2022 was approximately $1.8 billion. These estimates are subject to change as we finalize the quantitative impacts of the adoption in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n## Impact of reclassifications of financial assets\n\nAs permitted by IFRS 17, we will change the classification and measurement of certain eligible financial assets held in respect of an activity that relates to insurance contracts upon the adoption of IFRS 17. We will apply these changes retrospectively by adjusting our Consolidated Balance Sheets as at November 1, 2023 with no restatement of comparative information. We expect to reclassify financial assets between fair value classification categories, which is not expected to have a net impact to total equity nor the carrying amounts of those assets. This is subject to change as we finalize the quantitative impacts of these changes and the quantitative impacts of adopting IFRS 17 in the first quarter of 2024.",

Transition activities are focused on two broad streams of work: (i) developing new ABR linked products, and (ii) conversion of existing CDOR based contracts to ABRs. Our program timelines are ultimately dependent on broader market acceptance of products that reference the new ABRs and our clients' readiness and ability to adopt the replacement products. Significant matters that we continue to evaluate include client product offerings, short and long-term funding strategies, and our hedging programs. We continue to work towards the recommended target date for the cessation of CDOR based products provided by our regulators and are on track with our transition activities to move to ABRs.\n\nThe following tables show the Bank's significant exposures to financial instruments referencing benchmark interest rates subject to the Reform that have yet to transition to ABRs.

        "page_content": "Fair values of our significant assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are determined and classified in the fair value hierarchy table using the following valuation techniques and inputs.\n\n## Interest-bearing deposits with banks\n\nThe majority of our Interest-bearing deposits with banks are designated as FVTPL. These FVTPL deposits are composed of shortdated deposits placed with banks, and are included in Interest-bearing deposits with banks in the fair value hierarchy table. The fair values of these instruments are determined using the discounted cash flow method. The inputs to the valuation models include interest rate swap curves and credit spreads, where applicable. They are classified as Level 2 instruments in the hierarchy as the inputs are observable.\n\n## Government bonds (Canadian, U.S. and other OECD governments)\n\nGovernment bonds are included in Canadian government debt, U.S. federal, state, municipal and agencies debt, Other OECD government debt and Obligations related to securities sold short in the fair value hierarchy table. The fair values of government issued or guaranteed debt securities in active markets are determined by reference to recent transaction prices, broker quotes, or third-party vendor prices and are classified as Level 1 in the hierarchy. The fair values of securities that are not traded in active markets are based on either security prices, or valuation techniques using implied yields and risk spreads derived from prices of actively traded and similar government securities. Securities with observable prices or rate inputs as compared to transaction prices, dealer quotes or vendor prices are classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Securities where inputs are unobservable are classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy.\n\n## Corporate and U.S. municipal bonds\n\nThe fair values of corporate and U.S. municipal bonds, which are included in Corporate debt and other debt, U.S. federal, state, municipal and agencies debt and Obligations related to securities sold short in the fair value hierarchy table, are determined using either recently executed transaction prices, broker quotes, pricing services, or in certain instances, the discounted cash flow method using rate inputs such as benchmark yields (CDOR, Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and other similar reference rates) and risk spreads of comparable securities. Securities with observable prices or rate inputs are classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Securities where inputs are unobservable are classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy.\n\n## Asset-backed securities and Mortgage-backed securities\n\nAsset-backed securities (ABS) and MBS are included in Asset-backed securities, Mortgage-backed securities, Canadian government debt, U.S. federal, state, municipal and agencies debt, and Obligations related to securities sold short in the fair value hierarchy table. Inputs for valuation of ABS and MBS are, when available, traded prices, dealer or lead manager quotes, broker quotes and vendor prices of the identical securities. When prices of the identical securities are not readily available, we use industry standard models with inputs such as discount margins, yields, default, prepayment and loss severity rates that are implied from transaction prices, dealer quotes or vendor prices of comparable instruments. Where security prices and inputs are observable, ABS and MBS are classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Otherwise, they are classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy.\n\n## Equities\n\nEquities consist of listed and unlisted common shares, private equities, mutual funds and hedge funds with certain redemption restrictions and are included in equities and obligations for securities sold short. The fair values of common shares are based on quoted prices in active markets, where available, and are classified as Level 1 in the hierarchy. Where quoted prices in active markets are not readily available, fair value is determined based on quoted market prices for similar securities or through valuation techniques, such as multiples of earnings and the discounted cash flow method with forecasted cash flows and discount rate as inputs. Private equities are classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy as their inputs are not observable. Hedge funds are valued using Net Asset Values (NAV). If we can redeem a hedge fund at NAV prior to the next quarter end, the fund is classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Otherwise, it is classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy.\n\n## Loans\n\nLoans include base metal loans, corporate loans, banker acceptances and asset-backed financing loans. Fair values are determined based on market prices, if available, or discounted cash flow method using the following inputs: market interest rates, base metal commodity prices, market based spreads of assets with similar credit ratings and terms to maturity, LGD, expected default frequency implied from credit derivative prices, if available, and relevant pricing information such as contractual rate, origination and maturity dates, redemption price, coupon payment frequency and day count convention. Loans with market prices or observable inputs are classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy and loans with unobservable inputs that have significant impacts on the fair values are classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe fair values of exchange-traded derivatives, such as interest rate and equity options and futures, are based on quoted market prices and are typically classified as Level 1 in the hierarchy. OTC derivatives primarily consist of interest rate contracts, foreign exchange contracts, commodity derivatives, equity derivatives and credit derivatives. The exchange-traded or OTC interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity and equity derivatives are included in Interest rate contracts, Foreign exchange contracts and Other contracts, respectively, in the fair value hierarchy table. The fair values of OTC derivatives are determined using valuation models when quoted market prices or third-party consensus pricing information are not available. The valuation models, such as discounted cash flow method or Black-Scholes option model, incorporate observable or unobservable inputs for interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices (including indices), credit spreads, corresponding market volatility levels, and other market-based pricing factors. Other adjustments to fair value include bid-offer, CVA, FVA, OIS, parameter and model uncertainties, and unrealized gain or loss at inception of a transaction. A derivative instrument is classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy if observable market inputs are available or the unobservable inputs are not significant to the fair value. Otherwise, it is classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy.",

        "page_content": "## Note 3 Fair value of financial instruments (continued)\n\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements In the fair value hierarchy table, these instruments are included in Assets purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed, and Obligations related to assets sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned. The fair values of these contracts are determined using valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flow method using interest rate curves as inputs. They are classified as Level 2 instruments in the hierarchy as the inputs are observable.\n\n## Deposits\n\nA majority of our deposits are measured at amortized cost but certain deposits are designated as FVTPL. These FVTPL deposits include deposits taken from clients, issuances of certificates of deposits and promissory notes, and interest rate and equity linked notes. The fair values of these instruments are determined using the discounted cash flow method and derivative option valuation models. The inputs to the valuation models include benchmark yield curves, credit spreads, interest rates, equity and interest rate volatility, dividends and correlation, where applicable. They are classified as Level 2 or 3 instruments in the hierarchy, depending on the significance of the unobservable credit spreads, volatility, dividend and correlation rates.\n\nQuantitative information about fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 Instruments) The following table presents fair values of our significant Level 3 financial instruments, valuation techniques used to determine their fair values, ranges and weighted averages of unobservable inputs.\n\n## As at October 31, 2023 (Millions of Canadian dollars, except for prices, percentages and ratios)\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                             | Fair value   | Fair value           |                                                                      |                                                                                                                                  | Range of input values  (1), (2) Weighted        | Range of input values  (1), (2) Weighted        | Range of input values  (1), (2) Weighted   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Products                                                                                                                                                       | Reporting line in the fair value   hierarchy table                                                          |              | Assets   Liabilities | Valuation   techniques                                               | Significant   unobservable   inputs (3)                                                                                          | Low                                             | High                                            | average /   Inputs   distribution          |\n| Corporate debt and related   derivatives                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                             |              |                      | Price-based                                                          | Prices      Credit spread                                                                                                        | $                                               | 9.88   $ 107.13   $                             | 87.66                                      |\n|                                                                                                                                                                | Corporate debt and other debt   Loans                                                                       | $ -

margins\n\nA financial instrument's yield is the interest rate used to discount future cash flows in a valuation model. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement and vice versa. A credit spread/discount margin is the difference between a debt instrument's yield and a benchmark instrument's yield. Benchmark instruments have high credit quality ratings, similar maturities and are often government bonds. The credit spread/discount margin therefore represents the discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows of an asset to reflect the market return required for uncertainty in the estimated cash flows. The credit spread/discount margin for an instrument forms part of the yield used in a discounted cash flow method.\n\n## Funding spread\n\nFunding spreads are credit spreads specific to funding or deposit rates. A decrease in funding spreads, on its own, will increase the fair value of our liabilities, and vice versa.\n\n## Default rates\n\nA default rate is the rate at which borrowers fail to make scheduled loan payments. A decrease in the default rate will typically increase the fair value of the loan, and vice versa. This effect will be significantly more pronounced for a non-government guaranteed loan than a government guaranteed loan.",

        "page_content": "## Note 3 Fair value of financial instruments (continued)\n\n## Prepayment rates\n\nA prepayment rate is the rate at which a loan will be repaid in advance of its expected amortization schedule. Prepayments change the future cash flows of a loan. An increase in the prepayment rate in isolation will result in an increase in fair value when the loan interest rate is lower than the current reinvestment rate, and a decrease in the prepayment rate in isolation will result in a decrease in fair value when the loan interest rate is lower than the current reinvestment rate. Prepayment rates are generally negatively correlated with interest rates.\n\n## Recovery and loss severity rates\n\nA recovery rate is an estimation of the amount that can be collected in a loan default scenario. The recovery rate is the recovered amount divided by the loan balance due, expressed as a percentage. The inverse concept of recovery is loss severity. Loss severity rate is an estimation of the loan amount not collected when a loan defaults. The loss severity rate is the loss amount divided by the loan balance due, expressed as a percentage. Generally, an increase in the recovery rate or a decrease in the loss severity rate will increase the loan fair value, and vice versa.\n\n## Volatility rates\n\nVolatility measures the potential variability of future prices and is often measured as the standard deviation of price movements. Volatility is an input to option pricing models used to value derivatives and issued structured notes. Volatility is used in valuing equity, interest rate, commodity and foreign exchange options. A higher volatility rate means that the underlying price or rate movements are more likely to occur. Higher volatility rates may increase or decrease an option's fair value depending on the option's terms. The determination of volatility rates is dependent on various factors, including but not limited to, the underlying's market price, the strike price and maturity.\n\n## Dividend yields\n\nA dividend yield is the underlying equity's expected dividends expressed as an annual percentage of its price. Dividend yield is used as an input for forward equity price and option models. Higher dividend yields will decrease the forward price, and vice versa. A higher dividend yield will increase or decrease an option's value, depending on the option's terms.\n\n## Correlation rates\n\nCorrelation is the linear relationship between the movements in two different variables. Correlation is an input to the valuation of derivative contracts and issued structured notes when an instrument's payout is determined by correlated variables. When variables are positively correlated, an increase in one variable will result in an increase in the other variable. When variables are negatively correlated, an increase in one variable will result in a decrease in the other variable. The referenced variables can be within a single asset class or market (equity, interest rate, commodities, credit and foreign exchange) or between variables in different asset classes (equity to foreign exchange, or interest rate to foreign exchange). Changes in correlation will either increase or decrease a financial instrument's fair value depending on the terms of the instrument.\n\n## Interest rates\n\nAn interest rate is the percentage amount charged on a principal or notional amount. Increasing interest rates will decrease the discounted cash flow value of a financial instrument, and vice versa.\n\n## Consumer Price Index swap rates\n\nA CPI swap rate is expressed as a percentage of an increase in the average price of a basket of consumer goods and services, such as transportation, food and medical care. An increase in the CPI swap rate will cause inflation swap payments to be larger, and vice versa.\n\n## EV/EBITDA multiples, P/E multiples, EV/Rev multiples, and liquidity discounts\n\nPrivate equity valuation inputs include EV/EBITDA multiples, P/E multiples and EV/Rev multiples. These are used to calculate either enterprise value or share value of a company based on a multiple of earnings or revenue estimates. Higher multiples equate to higher fair values for all multiple types, and vice versa. A liquidity discount may be applied when few or no transactions exist to support the valuations.\n\n## Credit Enhancement\n\nCredit enhancement is an input to the valuation of securitized transactions and is the amount of loan loss protection for a senior tranche. Credit enhancement is expressed as a percentage of the transaction sizes. An increase in credit enhancement will cause the credit spread to decrease and the tranche fair value to increase, and vice versa.\n\n## Interrelationships between unobservable inputs\n\nUnobservable inputs, including the above discount margin, default rate, prepayment rate, and recovery and loss severity rates, may not be independent of each other. For example, the discount margin can be affected by a change in default rate, prepayment rate, or recovery and loss severity rates. Discount margins will generally decrease when default rates decline or when recovery rates increase.",

For an asset or a liability that transfers into Level 3 during the period, the entire change in fair value for the period is excluded from the Gains (losses) included in earnings for positions still held column of the above reconciliation, whereas for transfers out of Level 3 during the period, the entire change in fair value for the period is included in the same column of the above reconciliation.\n\nTransfers between Level 1 and 2 are dependent on whether fair value is obtained on the basis of quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1).\n\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2023, significant transfers out of Level 1 to Level 2 included Trading U.S. federal, state, municipal and agencies debt of $763 million, Investment U.S. federal, state, municipal and agencies debt of $435 million and Obligations related to securities sold short of $151 million. During the year ended October 31, 2022, there were no significant transfers out of Level 1 to Level 2.\n\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, there were no significant transfers out of Level 2 to Level 1.\n\nTransfers between Level 2 and Level 3 are primarily due to either a change in the market observability for an input, or a change in an unobservable input's significance to a financial instrument's fair value.\n\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2023, significant transfers out of Level 2 to Level 3 included Other contracts and Deposits due to changes in the significance of unobservable inputs and changes in the market observability of inputs. During the year ended October 31, 2022, significant transfers out of Level 2 to Level 3 included Loans and Other contracts due to changes in the market observability of inputs and changes in the significance of unobservable inputs.\n\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2023, significant transfers out of Level 3 to Level 2 included Other contracts, Loans and Deposits due to changes in the market observability of inputs and changes in the significance of unobservable inputs. During the year ended October 31, 2022, there were no significant transfers out of Level 3 to Level 2.\n\n## Positive and negative fair value movements of Level 3 financial instruments from using reasonably possible alternative assumptions\n\nA financial instrument is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy if one or more of its unobservable inputs may significantly affect the measurement of its fair value. In preparing the financial statements, appropriate levels for these unobservable input parameters are chosen so that they are consistent with prevailing market evidence or management judgment. Due to the unobservable nature of the prices or rates, there may be uncertainty about the valuation of these Level 3 financial instruments.",

This sensitivity disclosure is intended to illustrate the potential impact of the relative uncertainty in the fair value of Level 3 financial instruments. In reporting the sensitivities below, we offset balances in instances where: (i) the move in valuation factors cause an offsetting positive and negative fair value movement, (ii) both offsetting instruments are in Level 3, and (iii) exposures are managed and reported on a net basis. With respect to overall sensitivity, it is unlikely in practice that all reasonably possible alternative assumptions would simultaneously be realized.\n\n(4)\n\n(3)\n\n(9)\n\n|                                      | As at                | As at                                                                            | As at                                                                            | As at                | As at                                                                            | As at                                                                            |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      | October 31, 2023     | October 31, 2023                                                                 | October 31, 2023                                                                 | October 31, 2022     | October 31, 2022                                                                 | October 31, 2022                                                                 |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)       | Level 3   fair value | Positive fair value   movement from   using reasonably   possible   alternatives | Negative fair value   movement from   using reasonably   possible   alternatives | Level 3   fair value | Positive fair value   movement from   using reasonably   possible   alternatives | Negative fair value   movement from   using reasonably   possible   alternatives |\n| Securities                           |                      |                                                                                  |                                                                                  |                      |                                                                                  |                                                                                  |\n| Trading                              |                      |                                                                                  |                                                                                  |                      |                                                                                  |                                                                                  |\n| Debt issued or guaranteed by:        |                      |                                                                                  |                                                                                  |                      |                                                                                  |                                                                                  |\n| U.S. state, municipal and   agencies | $ -

        "page_content": "## Amortized cost securities\n\nFair values of government bonds, corporate bonds, and ABS are based on quoted prices. Fair values of certain Non-OECD government bonds are based on vendor prices or the discounted cash flow method with yield curves of other countries' government bonds as inputs. For ABS, where market prices are not available, the fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow method. The inputs to the valuation model generally include market interest rates, spreads and yields derived from comparable securities, prepayment, and LGD.\n\n## Assets purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed, and Obligations related to assets sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned\n\nValuation methods used for the long-term instruments are described in the Fair value of assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis and classified using the fair value hierarchy section of this note. The carrying values of short-term instruments generally approximate their fair values.\n\n## Loans - Retail\n\nRetail loans include residential mortgages, personal and small business loans and credit cards. For residential mortgages, and personal and small business loans, we segregate the portfolio based on certain attributes such as product type, contractual interest rate, term to maturity and credit scores, if applicable. Fair values of these loans are determined by the discounted cash flow method using applicable inputs such as prevailing interest rates, contractual and posted client rates, client discounts, credit spreads, prepayment rates and loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. Fair values of credit card receivables are also calculated based on a discounted cash flow method with portfolio yields, write-offs and monthly payment rates as inputs. The carrying values of shortterm and variable rate loans generally approximate their fair values.\n\n## Loans - Wholesale\n\nWhere market prices are available, wholesale loans are valued based on market prices. Otherwise, fair value is determined by the discounted cash flow method using the following inputs: market interest rates and market based spreads of assets with similar credit ratings and terms to maturity, LGD, expected default frequency implied from credit default swap prices, if available, and relevant pricing information such as contractual rate, origination and maturity dates, redemption price, coupon payment frequency and date convention.\n\n## Deposits\n\nDeposits are comprised of demand, notice, and term deposits which include senior deposit notes we have issued to provide us with long-term funding. Fair values of term deposits are determined by one of several valuation techniques: (i) for term deposits and similar instruments, we segregate the portfolio based on term to maturity. Fair values of these instruments are determined by the discounted cash flow method using inputs such as client rates for new sales of the corresponding terms; and (ii) for senior deposit notes, we use actual traded prices, vendor prices or the discounted cash flow method using a market interest rate curve and our funding spreads as inputs. The carrying values of demand, notice, and short-term term deposits generally approximate their fair values.\n\n## Other assets and Other liabilities\n\nOther assets and Other liabilities include receivables and payables relating to certain commodities. Fair values of the commodity receivables and payables are calculated by the discounted cash flow method using applicable inputs such as market interest rates, counterparties' credit spreads, our funding spreads, commodity forward prices and spot prices.\n\n## Subordinated debentures\n\nFair values of Subordinated debentures are based on market prices, dealer quotes or vendor prices when available. Where prices cannot be observed, fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow method, with applicable inputs such as market interest rates and credit spreads.",

Reconciling items include the following:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Transfers between stages, which are presumed to occur before any corresponding remeasurement of the allowance.\n- GLYPH<129> Purchases, which reflect the allowance related to assets newly recognized during the period, including those assets that were derecognized following a modification of terms.\n- GLYPH<129> Sales and maturities, which reflect the allowance related to assets derecognized during the period without a credit loss being incurred, including those assets that were derecognized following a modification of terms.\n- GLYPH<129> Changes in risk, parameters and exposures, which comprise the impact of changes in model inputs or assumptions, including changes in forward-looking macroeconomic conditions; partial repayments; changes in the measurement following a transfer between stages; and unwinding of the time value discount due to the passage of time.\n\n## Allowance for credit losses - securities at FVOCI (1)\n\n(9)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n|                                             | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | For the year ended   |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                             | October 31, 2023     | October 31, 2023     | October 31, 2023     | October 31, 2023     | October 31, 2022     | October 31, 2022     | October 31, 2022     | October 31, 2022     |\n|                                             | Performing           | Performing           | Impaired             |                      | Performing           | Performing           | Impaired             |                      |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)              | Stage 1              | Stage 2              | Stage 3  (2)         | Total                | Stage 1              | Stage 2              | Stage 3 (2)          | Total                |\n| Balance at beginning of period              | $ 3   $              |                      | 1    $ (23)  $       | (19)                 | $                    | 2   $                | 1     $ (12)  $      |                      |\n| Provision for credit losses                 |                      |                      |                      |                      |                      |                      |                      |                      |\n| Transfers to stage 1                        | 1                    | (1)                  | -                    | -                    | 1                    | (1)                  | -                    | -                    |\n| Transfers to stage 2                        | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    |\n| Transfers to stage 3                        | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    |\n| Purchases                                   | 7                    | -                    | -                    | 7                    | 3                    | -                    | -                    | 3                    |\n| Sales and maturities                        | (2)                  | -                    | -                    | (2)                  | (1)                  | -                    | -                    |                      |\n| Changes in risk, parameters and   exposures | (5)                  | -                    | (17)                 | (22)                 | (2)                  | 1                    | (10)                 | (11)                 |\n| Exchange rate and other                     | -                    | -                    | 3                    | 3                    | -                    | -                    | (1)                  |                      |\n| Balance at end of period                    | $                    | 4   $                | -    $ (37)  $       | (33)                 | $                    | 3   $                | 1     $ (23)  $      | (19)                 |",

        "page_content": "## Key inputs and assumptions\n\nThe measurement of expected credit losses is a complex calculation that involves a significant number of interrelated inputs and assumptions and the allowance is not sensitive to any one single factor. The key drivers of changes in expected credit losses include the following:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Changes in the credit quality of the borrower or instrument, primarily reflected in changes in internal risk ratings;\n- GLYPH<129> Changes in forward-looking macroeconomic conditions, specifically the macroeconomic variables to which our models are calibrated, which are those most closely correlated with credit losses in the relevant portfolio;\n- GLYPH<129> Changes in scenario design and the weight assigned to each scenario; and\n- GLYPH<129> Transfers between stages, which can be triggered by changes to any of the above inputs.\n\nTo reflect relevant risk factors not captured in our modelled results, we applied expert credit judgment in determining the measurement of our weighted allowance for credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses, including scenario design and weightings, determining significant increases in credit risk since origination and application of expert credit judgment, is overseen by a senior management committee that includes representation from Finance, Group Risk Management and Economics.\n\n## Internal risk ratings\n\nInternal risk ratings are assigned according to the risk management framework outlined under the headings Wholesale credit risk and Retail credit risk of the Credit risk section of Management's Discussion and Analysis. Changes in internal risk ratings are primarily reflected in the PD parameters, which are estimated based on our historical loss experience at the relevant risk segment or risk rating level, adjusted for forward-looking information.\n\n## Scenario design and weightings\n\nOur estimation of expected credit losses in Stage 1 and Stage 2 considers five distinct future macroeconomic scenarios. Scenarios are designed to capture a wide range of possible outcomes and are weighted according to our expectation of the relative likelihood of the range of outcomes that each scenario represents at the reporting date. We weight each scenario to take into account historical frequency, current trends, and forward-looking conditions which will change over time. Scenario weightings take into consideration the extent to which the base case scenario includes both favourable and unfavourable economic expectations, and upside and downside risks to the base scenario materializing in the future. The base case scenario is based on forecasts of the expected rate, value or yield for each relevant macroeconomic variable. The upside and downside scenarios are set by adjusting our base projections to construct reasonably possible scenarios and weightings that are more optimistic and pessimistic, respectively, than the base case. Two additional downside scenarios capture the non-linear nature of potential credit losses across our portfolios. When the economy is at or near equilibrium, the severity of the downside scenario generally reflects an adverse event typical for a business cycle and both the non-linear downside scenarios reflect an outcome that is materially more adverse than the downside scenario.\n\nThe impact of each of our five scenarios varies across our portfolios given the portfolios have different sensitivities to movements in each macroeconomic variable. Our scenario weights are unchanged relative to October 31, 2022 to reflect continued uncertainty and downside risks that may drive recession outcomes that are more severe than contemplated in our base scenario.\n\nThe impact of weighting these multiple scenarios increased our ACL on performing loans, relative to our base scenario, by $868 million at October 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 - $738 million).\n\n## Forward looking macroeconomic variables\n\nThe PD, LGD and EAD inputs used to estimate Stage 1 and Stage 2 credit loss allowances are modelled based on the macroeconomic variables (or changes in macroeconomic variables) that are most closely correlated with credit losses in the relevant portfolio. Each macroeconomic scenario used in our expected credit loss calculation includes a projection of all relevant macroeconomic variables used in our models for a five year horizon, reverting to long-run averages generally within the 2 to 5 year period. Depending on their usage in the models, macroeconomic variables are projected at a country, province/state or more granular level. These include one or more of the variables described below, which differ by portfolio and region.\n\nOur allowance for credit losses reflects our economic outlook as at October 31, 2023. Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in our allowance for credit losses in future periods.\n\nOur base scenario reflects rising unemployment rates, high central bank policy interest rates and elevated but declining inflation, which result in mild recessions in Canada in the second half of calendar 2023 and the U.S. in the first half of calendar 2024. Expectations are that there will be no further increases in central bank interest rates in Canada and the U.S. Our base scenario also reflects commercial real estate price declines in the near term.\n\nDownside scenarios, including two additional and more severe downside scenarios designed for the energy and real estate sectors, reflect the possibility of a more severe macroeconomic shock beginning in calendar Q1 2024 relative to our base scenario. In these scenarios, conditions are expected to deteriorate from calendar Q4 2023 levels for up to 18 months, followed by a recovery for the remainder of the period. These scenarios assume monetary policy responses that return the economy to a long-run, sustainable growth rate within the forecast period. The possibility of a deeper recession and a more prolonged recovery as compared to our base scenario, including further monetary policy responses to elevated inflation rates which may increase credit risk, is reflected in our general downside scenario.\n\nThe upside scenario reflects slightly stronger economic growth than the base scenario, without prompting a further offsetting monetary policy response as compared to our base scenario, followed by a return to a long-run sustainable growth rate within the forecast period.",

GDP in calendar Q4 2024 is expected to be 1.6% and 0.1% above Q4 2023 levels in Canada and the U.S., respectively.\n\n## Canada Real GDP (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Base scenario (October 31, 2022)\n- (1)  Represents the seasonally adjusted annual rate indexed to 2012 Canadian dollars over the calendar quarters presented.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- GLYPH<129> Oil price (West Texas Intermediate in US$) - In our base forecast, we expect oil prices to average $81 per barrel over the next 12 months from calendar Q4 2023 and $67 per barrel in the following 2 to 5 years. The range of average prices in our alternative downside and upside scenarios is $28 to $103 per barrel for the next 12 months and $43 to $74 per barrel for the following 2 to 5 years. As at October 31, 2022, our base forecast included an average price of $88 per barrel for the next 12 months and $72 per barrel for the following 2 to 5 years.\n- GLYPH<129> Canadian housing price index - In our base forecast, we expect housing prices to increase by 1.6% over the next 12 months from calendar Q4 2023, with a compound annual growth rate of 5.0% for the following 2 to 5 years. The range of annual housing price growth (contraction) in our alternative real estate downside and upside scenarios is (30.0)% to 10.9% over the next 12 months and 4.2% to 9.6% for the following 2 to 5 years. As at October 31, 2022 our base forecast included housing price contraction of (1.0)% from calendar Q4 2022 for the next 12 months and housing price growth of 5.2% for the following 2 to 5 years.\n\n## U.S. Real GDP (1)",

        "page_content": "The primary variables driving credit losses in our retail portfolios are Canadian unemployment rates, Canadian housing price index and Canadian GDP. The Canadian overnight interest rate also impacts our retail portfolios. Our wholesale portfolios are affected by all of the variables discussed above; however, the specific variables differ by sector. Other variables also impact our wholesale portfolios including, but not limited to, Canadian and U.S. 10 year BBB corporate bond credit spreads, Canadian and U.S. 10 year government bond yields, U.S. 10 year BBB corporate bond yield, Canadian consumer confidence index, Canadian and U.S. commercial real estate price indices, U.S. housing price index, and natural gas prices (Henry Hub).\n\nIncreases in the following macroeconomic variables will generally correlate with higher expected credit losses: Canadian and U.S. unemployment rates, Canadian overnight interest rates, Canadian and U.S. 10 year BBB corporate bond credit spreads, Canadian and U.S. 10 year government bond yields, and U.S. 10 year BBB corporate bond yield.\n\nIncreases in the following macroeconomic variables will generally correlate with lower expected credit losses: Canadian and U.S. housing price indices, Canadian and U.S. GDP, Canadian consumer confidence index, Canadian and U.S. commercial real estate price indices, and oil and natural gas prices.\n\n## Transfers between stages\n\nTransfers between Stage 1 and Stage 2 are based on the assessment of significant increases in credit risk relative to initial recognition, as described in Note 2. The impact of moving from 12 months expected credit losses to lifetime expected credit losses, or vice versa, varies by product and is dependent on the expected remaining life at the date of the transfer. Stage transfers may result in significant fluctuations in expected credit losses.\n\nThe following table illustrates the impact of staging on our ACL by comparing our allowance if all performing loans were in Stage 1 to the actual ACL recorded on these assets.\n\n|                                | As at                                   | As at               | As at               | As at                                   | As at               | As at               |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                | October 31, 2023                        | October 31, 2023    | October 31, 2023    | October 31, 2022                        | October 31, 2022    | October 31, 2022    |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars) | ACL - All performing   loans in Stage 1 | Impact of   staging | Stage 1 and 2   ACL | ACL - All performing   loans in Stage 1 | Impact of   staging | Stage 1 and 2   ACL |\n| Performing loans (1)           | $ 2,893                                 | $ 1,257             | $ 4,150             | $ 2,373                                 | $ 1,094             | $ 3,467             |",

HSBC Canada is a premier Canadian personal and commercial bank focused on globally connected clients. We will also purchase all of the existing preferred shares and subordinated debt of HSBC Canada held directly or indirectly by HSBC Holdings plc at par value ($2.1 billion as of September 30, 2023).\n\nThe agreement includes a locked box mechanism under which HSBC Canada's earnings from June 30, 2022 to the closing date accrue to RBC and will be reflected in the acquired net assets on closing. Relatedly, we will pay an additional amount that accrues from August 30, 2023 to the closing date, which is calculated based on the all-cash purchase price for the common shares of HSBC Canada and the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the first calendar quarter of 2024 and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. The results of the acquired business will be consolidated from the date of close.\n\n## Wealth Management\n\nOn September 27, 2022, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued share capital of Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC (RBC Brewin Dolphin) via our subsidiary, RBC Wealth Management (Jersey) Holdings Limited. RBC Brewin Dolphin provides discretionary wealth management services in the U.K., Ireland and the Channel Islands. RBC Brewin Dolphin's business gives us a platform to significantly transform our wealth management business in the U.K., Ireland and the Channel Islands, and provides us with the opportunity to position the combined businesses as a premier integrated wealth management provider to private and institutional clients.\n\nTotal consideration of \u00a31,591 million ($2,341 million) as of the date of close consisted of \u00a31,564 million ($2,302 million) in cash, as well as amounts related to share based compensation. Our purchase price allocation assigned $3,279 million to assets and $938 million to liabilities, including customer relationship intangible assets of $1,292 million and goodwill of $913 million, which is allocated to our International Wealth Management and Global Asset Management CGUs and is not deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill reflects the expected synergies from the combined businesses and the expected growth of the Wealth Management segment.\n\nThe results of the acquisition have been consolidated from the date of close and included in our Wealth Management segment.\n\n## Disposition\n\n## Wealth Management\n\nOn July 3, 2023, we completed the previously announced sale of the European asset servicing activities of RBC Investor Services \u00ae and its associated Malaysian centre of excellence to CACEIS, the asset servicing banking group of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Banco Santander, S.A. As a result of the transaction, we recorded a pre-tax gain on disposal of $69 million in Non-Interest income within the Wealth Management segment ($77 million after-tax). The completion of the sale of the business of the U.K. branch of RBC Investor Services Trust and the RBC Investor Services business in Jersey remains subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. The disposal group consists of $2.6 billion of assets, primarily consisting of cash and due from banks, and $2.6 billion of liabilities, primarily consisting of deposits, and remains classified as held-for-sale, presented in Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively.\n\n## Note 7 Derecognition of financial assets\n\nWe enter into transactions in which we transfer financial assets such as loans or securities to structured entities or other third parties. The majority of assets transferred under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements, and in our Canadian residential mortgage securitization transactions do not qualify for derecognition as we continue to be exposed to substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, such as prepayment, credit, price, interest rate and foreign exchange risks.\n\n## Transferred financial assets not derecognized\n\n## Securitization of Canadian residential mortgage loans\n\nWe periodically securitize insured Canadian residential mortgage loans through the creation of MBS pools under the National Housing Act MBS (NHA MBS) program. All loans securitized under the NHA MBS program are required to be insured by the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) or a third-party insurer. We require the borrower to pay for mortgage insurance when the loan amount is greater than 80% of the original appraised value of the property (LTV ratio). For residential mortgage loans securitized under this program with LTV ratios less than 80%, we are required to insure the mortgages at our own expense. Under the NHA MBS program, we are responsible for making all payments due on our issued MBS, regardless of whether we collect the necessary funds from the mortgagor or the insurer. When a borrower defaults on a mortgage, we submit a claim to the insurer if the amount recovered from the collection or foreclosure process is lower than the sum of the principal balance,",

The insurance claim process is managed by the insurance provider in accordance with the insurer's policies and covers the entire unpaid loan balance plus generally up to 12 months of interest, selling costs and other eligible expenses. If an insurance claim is denied, a loss is recognized in Provision for credit losses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The amount recorded as a loss is not significant to our Consolidated Financial Statements and no significant losses were incurred due to legal action arising from mortgage defaults during 2023 and 2022.\n\nWe sell the NHA MBS pools primarily to Canada Housing Trust, a government-sponsored structured entity under the Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) program. The entity periodically issues CMBs, which are guaranteed by the government, and sells them to third-party investors. Proceeds of the CMB issuances are used by the entity to purchase the NHA MBS pools from eligible NHA MBS issuers who participate in the issuance of a particular CMB series. Our continuing involvement includes servicing the underlying residential mortgage loans we have securitized, either ourselves or through a third-party servicer. We also act as counterparty in interest rate swap agreements where we pay the entity the interest due to CMB investors and receive the interest on the underlying MBS and reinvested assets. As part of the swaps, we are also required to maintain a principal reinvestment account for principal payments received on the underlying mortgage loans to meet the repayment obligation upon maturity of the CMB. We reinvest the collected principal payments in permitted investments as outlined in the swap agreements.\n\nWe have determined that certain of the NHA MBS program loans transferred to the entity do not qualify for derecognition as we have not transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. As a result, these transferred MBS continue to be classified as residential mortgage loans and recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cash received for these transferred MBS is treated as a secured borrowing and a corresponding liability is recorded in Deposits - Business and government on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned\n\nWe also enter into transactions such as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements where we transfer assets under agreements to repurchase them at a future date and retain substantially all of the risks and rewards associated with the assets. These transferred assets remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are accounted for as collateralized borrowing transactions.\n\nThe following table provides information on the carrying amount and fair value of the transferred assets that did not qualify for derecognition, and their associated liabilities.\n\n|                                                                                 | As at                                               | As at                                                  | As at                    | As at                           | As at                                              | As at                                                 | As at                   | As at                           |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                                                                                 | October 31, 2023                                    | October 31, 2023                                       | October 31, 2023         | October 31, 2023                | October 31, 2022                                   | October 31, 2022                                      | October 31, 2022        | October 31, 2022                |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)                                                  | Canadian   residential   mortgage   loans  (1), (2) | Securities   sold under   repurchase   agreements  (3) | Securities   loaned  (3) | Total                           | Canadian   residential   mortgage   loans (1), (2) | Securities   sold under   repurchase   agreements (3) | Securities   loaned (3) | Total                           |\n| Carrying amount of transferred   assets that do not qualify for   derecognition | $ 28,312                                            |                                                        |                          | $ 313,558   $ 21,680  $ 363,550 | $ 32,812                                           |                                                       |                         | $ 258,615   $ 15,332  $ 306,759 |\n| Carrying amount of associated   liabilities                                     | 28,007                                              | 313,558                                                | 21,680                   | 363,245                         | 32,177                                             | 258,615                                               | 15,332                  | 306,124                         |\n| Fair value of transferred assets                                                | $ 26,472                                            |                                                        |                          | $ 313,558   $ 21,680  $ 361,710 | $ 31,174                                           |                                                       |                         | $ 258,615   $ 15,332  $ 305,121 |\n| Fair value of associated   liabilities                                          | 26,780                                              | 313,558                                                | 21,680                   | 362,018                         | 30,900                                             | 258,615                                               | 15,332                  | 304,847                         |\n| Fair value of net position                                                      | $ (308)                                             | $                                                      | -   $                    | -  $ (308)                      | $ 274                                              | $                                                     | -   $                   | -   $ 274                       |\n\n## Note 8 Structured entities\n\nIn the normal course of business, we engage in a variety of financial transactions with structured entities to support our financing and investing needs as well as those of our clients. A structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding control. Structured entities are generally created to achieve a narrow and well defined objective with restrictions around their ongoing activities. We consolidate a structured entity when we control the entity in accordance with our accounting policy as described in Note 2. In other cases, we may sponsor or have an interest in such an entity but may not consolidate it.\n\n## Consolidated structured entities\n\nWe consolidate the following structured entities, whose assets and liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Third-party investors in these structured entities generally have recourse only to the assets of the related entity and do not have recourse to our general assets unless we breach our contractual obligations to those entities. In the ordinary course of business, the assets of each consolidated structured entity can generally only be used to settle the obligations of that entity.\n\n## Multi-seller conduits\n\nWe generally do not maintain ownership in the multi-seller conduits that we administer and generally do not have rights to, or control of, their assets. However, we issue asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) through a multi-seller conduit that does not have an expected loss investor with substantive power to direct the significant operating activities of the conduit. This conduit is",

        "page_content": "consolidated because we have exposure to variability of returns from performance in the multi-seller arrangements through providing transaction-specific and program-wide liquidity, credit and loan facilities to the conduit and have decision-making power over the relevant activities. As of October 31, 2023, $1,316 million of financial assets held by the conduit were included in Loans (October 31, 2022 - $1,826 million) and $1,194 million of ABCP issued by the conduit was included in Deposits (October 31, 2022 - $1,284 million) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Credit card securitization vehicle\n\nWe securitize a portion of our credit card receivables through a structured entity on a revolving basis. The entity purchases co-ownership interests in a pool of credit card receivables and issues senior and subordinated term notes collateralized by that co-ownership interest in the underlying pool of credit card receivables. Investors who purchase the term notes have recourse only to that co-ownership interest in the underlying pool of credit card receivables.\n\nWe continue to service the credit card receivables and perform an administrative role for the entity. We also retain risk in the underlying pool of credit card receivables through our retained interest in the transferred assets, the cash reserve balance we fund from time to time, and also through certain subordinated notes which we retain. Additionally, we may own some senior notes as investments or for market-making activities and we act as counterparty to interest rate and cross currency swap agreements which hedge the entity's interest rate and currency risk exposure.\n\nWe consolidate the structured entity because we have decision-making power over the timing and size of future issuances and other relevant activities which were predetermined by us at inception. We also obtain significant funding benefits and are exposed to variability from the performance of the underlying credit card receivables through our retained interest. As at October 31, 2023, $7 billion of notes issued by our credit card securitization vehicle were included in Deposits on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (October 31, 2022 - $6 billion).\n\n## Collateralized commercial paper vehicle\n\nWe established a funding vehicle that provides loans to us and finances those loans by issuing commercial paper to third-party investors. The structured entity's commercial paper carries an equivalent credit rating to RBC because we are obligated to advance funds to the entity in the event there are insufficient funds from other sources to settle maturing commercial paper. We pledge collateral to secure the loans and are exposed to the market and credit risks of the pledged securities.\n\nWe consolidate the structured entity because we have decision-making power over the relevant activities, are the sole borrower from the structure, and are exposed to a majority of the residual ownership risks through the credit support provided. As at October 31, 2023, $17 billion of commercial paper issued by the vehicle was included in Deposits on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (October 31, 2022 - $14 billion).\n\n## Covered bonds\n\nWe periodically transfer mortgages to RBC Covered Bond Guarantor Limited Partnership (the Guarantor LP) to support funding activities and asset coverage requirements under our covered bonds program. The Guarantor LP was created to guarantee interest and principal payments under the covered bond program. The covered bonds guaranteed by the Guarantor LP are direct, unsecured and unconditional obligations of RBC; therefore, investors have a claim against the Bank which will continue if the covered bonds are not paid by the Bank and the mortgage assets in the Guarantor LP are insufficient to satisfy the obligations owing on the covered bonds. We act as general partner, limited partner, swap counterparty, lender and liquidity provider to the Guarantor LP, servicer for the underlying mortgages as well as the registered issuer of the covered bonds.\n\nWe consolidate the Guarantor LP as we have the decision-making power over the relevant activities through our role as general partner and are exposed to variability from the performance of the underlying mortgages. As at October 31, 2023, the total amount of mortgages transferred and outstanding was $100 billion (October 31, 2022 - $121 billion) and $50 billion of covered bonds were recorded as Deposits on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (October 31, 2022 - $43 billion).\n\n## Structured finance\n\nWe sell taxable and tax-exempt municipal bonds into Tender Option Bond (TOB) structures, which consist of a bond that is credit enhanced by us and purchased by a TOB trust. The TOB trust finances the purchase from us by issuing floating-rate certificates to short-term investors and a residual certificate that is purchased by us. We are the remarketing agent for the floating-rate certificates and provide a liquidity facility to the short-term investors which requires us to purchase any certificates tendered but not successfully remarketed. We credit enhance the bond purchased by the TOB trust with a letter of credit under which we are required to extend funding if there are any losses on the underlying bonds. We earn interest on the residual certificate and receive market-based fees for acting as remarketing agent and providing the liquidity facility and letter of credit.\n\nWe consolidate the TOB trust when we are the holder of the residual certificate as we have decision-making power over the relevant activities, including the selection of the underlying municipal bonds and the ability to terminate the structure, and are exposed to variability from the performance of the underlying municipal bonds. As at October 31, 2023, $5 billion of municipal bonds were included in Securities related to consolidated TOB structures (October 31, 2022 - $6 billion) and a corresponding $5 billion of floating-rate certificates were included in Deposits on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (October 31, 2022 - $7 billion).\n\nWe establish structured entities to acquire loans for the purposes of issuing term collateralized loan obligation (CLO) transactions and act as collateral manager. During the warehouse phase, we provide subordinated financing and, for certain term CLO transactions, act as the arranger and placement agent, and may provide senior warehouse financing. Proceeds from the sale of the term CLO are used to repay our warehouse financing. During the term CLO phase, we continue to provide subordinated financing, which serves as the first loss tranche that absorbs losses prior to the senior tranches, and may also directly invest in the other tranches.\n\nWe consolidate these CLO structures as we have decision-making power over the relevant activities of the entity, which include the initial selection and subsequent management of the underlying debt portfolio, and when our interests, including direct investment plus collateral management fees, indicate that we are acting as a principal. As at October 31, 2023, $493 million of Cash and due from banks and $1,675 million of Loans related to consolidated CLO structures (October 31, 2022 - $108 million and $1,410 million, respectively) and $1,706 million of Deposits representing the subordinated and senior tranches held by third parties (October 31, 2022 - $1,314 million) were recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.",

It also presents the size of each class of unconsolidated structured entity, as measured by the total assets of the entities in which we have an interest.\n\n|                                                    | As at October 31, 2023       | As at October 31, 2023   | As at October 31, 2023                 | As at October 31, 2023                  | As at October 31, 2023   | As at October 31, 2023   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)                     | Multi-seller   conduits  (1) | Structured   finance     | Non-RBC   managed   investment   funds | Third-party   securitization   vehicles | Other                    | Total                    |\n| On-balance sheet assets                            |                              |                          |                                        |                                         |                          |                          |\n| Securities                                         | $                            | 4   $                    | -

Multi-seller conduits primarily purchase financial assets from clients and finance those purchases by issuing ABCP.\n\nIn certain multi-seller conduit arrangements, we do not maintain any ownership of the multi-seller conduits that we administer and have no rights to, or control of, its assets. As the administrative agent, we earn a residual fee for providing services such as coordinating funding activities, transaction structuring, documentation, execution and monitoring. The ABCP issued by each multi-seller conduit is in the conduit's own name with recourse to the financial assets owned by the multi-seller conduit, and is non-recourse to us except through our participation in liquidity and/or credit enhancement facilities.\n\nWe provide transaction-specific and program-wide liquidity facilities to the multi-seller conduits. In addition, we provide program-wide credit enhancement to the multi-seller conduits which obligate us to purchase assets or advance funds in the",

    {
        "page_content": "event the multi-seller conduit does not otherwise have funds from other sources, such as from the liquidity facilities, to settle maturing ABCP. In some cases, we or another third party may provide transaction-specific credit enhancement which can take various forms. We receive market-based fees for providing these liquidity and credit facilities.\n\nFor certain transactions, we act as counterparty to various hedging contracts to facilitate our clients' securitization of fixed rate and/or foreign currency denominated assets through the conduits. These may take the form of forward contracts, interest rate swaps or cross currency swaps. These derivatives expose us to foreign exchange and interest rate risks that are centrally managed by our foreign exchange trading and swap desks, respectively, and credit risk on the underlying assets that is mitigated by the credit enhancement described below.\n\nEach transaction is structured with transaction-specific first loss protection provided by the third-party seller. This enhancement can take various forms, including but not limited to overcollateralization, excess spread, subordinated classes of financial assets, guarantees or letters of credit. The amount of this enhancement varies but is generally designed to cover a multiple of historical losses.\n\nAn unrelated third party (expected loss investor) absorbs losses, up to a maximum contractual amount, that may occur in the future on the assets in the multi-seller conduits before the multi-seller conduits' debt holders and us. In return for assuming this multi-seller conduit first-loss position, each multi-seller conduit pays the expected loss investor a return commensurate with its risk position. The expected loss investor has substantive power to direct the majority of the activities which significantly impact the conduit's economic performance, including initial selection and approval of the asset purchase commitments and liquidity facilities, approval of renewal and amendment of these transactions and facilities, sale or transfer of assets, ongoing monitoring of asset performance, mitigation of losses, and management of the ABCP liabilities.\n\nWe do not consolidate these multi-seller conduits as we do not control the conduits as noted above.\n\n## Structured finance\n\nWe participate in certain municipal bond TOB structures that we do not consolidate. These structures are similar to those consolidated municipal bond TOB structures described above; however, the residual certificates are held by third parties. We provide liquidity facilities for the benefit of floating-rate certificate holders which may be drawn if certificates are tendered but not able to be remarketed. For a portion of these trusts, we also provide a letter of credit for the underlying bonds held in the trust. We do not have decision-making power over the relevant activities of the structures; therefore, we do not consolidate these structures.\n\nWe provide senior warehouse financing to unaffiliated structured entities that are established by third parties to acquire loans for the purposes of issuing a term CLO transaction. Subordinated financing is provided during the warehouse phase by either the collateral manager or third-party investors. Subordinated financing serves as the first loss tranche which absorbs losses prior to ourselves as the senior lender. We act as the arranger and placement agent for the term CLO transaction. Proceeds from the sale of the term CLO are used to repay our senior warehouse financing, at which point we have no further involvement with the transaction. We do not consolidate these CLO structures as we do not have decision-making power over the relevant activities of the entity, which include the initial selection and subsequent management of the underlying debt portfolio.\n\nWe provide senior financing to unaffiliated structured entities that are established by third parties to acquire loans. Subordinated financing is provided by either the collateral manager or third-party investors. Subordinated financing serves as the first loss tranche which absorbs losses prior to ourselves as the senior lender. These facilities tend to be longer in term than the CLO warehouse facilities and benefit from credit enhancement generally designed to cover a multiple of historical losses. We do not consolidate these structures as we do not have decision-making power over the relevant activities of the entity, which include the initial selection and subsequent management of the underlying debt portfolio.\n\n## Non-RBC managed investment funds\n\nWe enter into fee-based equity derivative transactions with third parties including mutual funds, unit investment trusts and other investment funds. These transactions provide their investors with the desired exposure to reference funds, and we economically hedge our exposure to these derivatives by investing in those reference funds. We also act as custodian for several funds. We do not consolidate those reference funds that are managed by third parties as we do not have power to direct their investing activities.\n\nWe provide liquidity facilities to certain third-party investment funds. The funds issue unsecured variable-rate preferred shares and invest in portfolios of tax-exempt municipal bonds. Undrawn liquidity commitments expose us to the liquidity risk of the preferred shares and drawn commitments expose us to the credit risk of the underlying municipal bonds. We do not consolidate these third-party managed funds as we do not have power to direct their investing activities.\n\n## Third-party securitization vehicles\n\nWe hold interests in securitization vehicles that provide funding to certain third parties on whose behalf the entities were created. The activities of these entities are limited to the purchase and sale of specified financial assets from the sponsor. We, as well as other financial institutions, are obligated to provide funding up to our maximum commitment level and are exposed to credit losses on the underlying assets after various credit enhancements. Enhancements can take various forms, including but not limited to overcollateralization, excess spread, subordinated classes of financial assets, guarantees or letters of credit. The amount of this enhancement varies but is generally designed to cover a multiple of historical losses. We do not consolidate these entities as we do not have decision-making power over the relevant activities, including the entities' investing and financing activities.\n\n## Other\n\nOther unconsolidated structured entities include managed investment funds, arrangements to pass credit risk to third parties, credit investment products and tax credit funds.\n\nWe are sponsors and investment managers of mutual and pooled funds, which gives us the ability to direct the investment decisions of the funds. We do not consolidate those mutual and pooled funds if we exercise our decision-making power as an agent on behalf of other unit holders.\n\nWe use structured entities to generally transform credit derivatives into cash instruments, to distribute credit risk and to create customized credit products to meet investors' specific requirements. We enter into derivative contracts, including credit derivatives, to purchase protection from these entities (credit protection) and convert various risk factors such as yield, currency or credit risk of underlying assets to meet the needs of the investors. We act as sole arranger and swap provider for certain entities and, in some cases, fulfill other administrative functions for the entities. We do not consolidate these credit investment product entities as we do not have decision-making power over the relevant activities, which include selection of the collateral and reference portfolio, and are not exposed to a majority of the benefits or risks of the entities.",

        "page_content": "## Note 8 Structured entities (continued)\n\nWe created certain funds to pass through tax credits received from underlying low-income housing, historic rehabilitation real estate projects to third parties, new market tax credits or renewable energy tax credits to third parties (tax credit funds). We are sponsors of the tax credit funds as a result of our responsibility to manage the funds, arrange the financing, and perform the administrative duties of these tax credit funds. We do not consolidate the tax credit funds as the third-party investors in these funds have the decision-making power to select the underlying investments and are exposed to the majority of the residual ownership and tax risks of the funds.\n\nWe also purchase passive interests in renewable energy tax credit entities created and controlled by third parties. We do not consolidate these third-party funds as we do not have decision-making power over the relevant activities and our investments are managed as part of larger portfolios which are held for trading purposes.\n\n## Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities\n\nIn the normal course of business, we buy and sell passive interests in certain third-party structured entities, including mutual funds, exchange traded funds, and government-sponsored ABS vehicles. Our investments in these entities are managed as part of larger portfolios which are held for trading, liquidity or hedging purposes. We did not create or sponsor these entities and do not have any decision-making power over their ongoing activities. Our maximum exposure to loss is limited to our on-balance sheet investments in these entities, which are not included in the table above. As at October 31, 2023 and 2022, our investments in these entities were included in Trading and Investment securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 3 and Note 4 for further details on our Trading and Investment securities.\n\n## Sponsored entities\n\nWe are a sponsor of certain structured entities in which we have interests but do not consolidate. In determining whether we are a sponsor of a structured entity, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the purpose and nature of the entity, our initial and continuing involvement and whether we hold subordinated interests in the entity. We are considered to be the sponsor of certain credit investment products, tax credit entities, RBC managed mutual funds and a commercial mortgage securitization vehicle. During the year ended October 31, 2023, we did not transfer any commercial mortgages (October 31, 2022 $450 million) to a sponsored securitization vehicle in which we did not have any interests as at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Financial support provided to structured entities\n\nDuring the years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, we have not provided any financial or non-financial support to any consolidated or unconsolidated structured entities when we were not contractually obligated to do so. Furthermore, we have no intention to provide such support in the future.\n\n## Note 9 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities\n\nDerivative instruments are categorized as either financial or non-financial derivatives. Financial derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from an underlying interest rate, foreign exchange rate, credit risk, and equity or equity index. Non-financial derivatives are contracts whose value is derived from a precious metal, commodity instrument or index. The notional amount of derivatives represents the contract amount used as a reference point to calculate payments. Notional amounts are generally not exchanged by counterparties, and do not reflect our EAD.\n\n## Financial derivatives\n\n## Forwards and futures\n\nForward contracts are non-standardized agreements that are transacted between counterparties in the OTC market, whereas futures are standardized contracts with respect to amounts and settlement dates, and are traded on regular futures exchanges. Examples of forwards and futures are described below.\n\nInterest rate forwards (forward rate agreements) and futures are contractual obligations to buy or sell an interest-rate sensitive financial instrument on a predetermined future date at a specified price.\n\nForeign exchange forwards and futures are contractual obligations to exchange one currency for another at a specified price for settlement at a predetermined future date.\n\nEquity forwards and futures are contractual obligations to buy or sell at a fixed value (the specified price) of an equity index, a basket of stocks or a single stock at a predetermined future date.\n\n## Swaps\n\nSwaps are OTC contracts in which two counterparties exchange a series of cash flows based on agreed upon rates applied to a notional amount. Examples of swap agreements are described below.\n\nInterest rate swaps are agreements where two counterparties exchange a series of payments based on different interest rates applied to a notional amount in a single currency. Certain interest rate swaps are transacted and settled through clearing houses which act as central counterparties. Cross currency swaps involve the exchange of fixed payments in one currency for the receipt of fixed payments in another currency. Cross currency interest rate swaps involve the exchange of both interest and notional amounts in two different currencies.\n\nEquity swaps are contracts in which one counterparty agrees to pay or receive from the other cash flows based on changes in the value of an equity index, a basket of stocks or a single stock.\n\n## Options\n\nOptions are contractual agreements under which the seller (writer) grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, either to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a security, exchange rate, interest rate, or other financial instrument or commodity at a specified price, at or by a predetermined future date. The seller (writer) of an option can also settle the contract by paying the cash settlement value of the purchaser's right. The seller (writer) receives a premium from the purchaser for this right. The various option agreements that we enter into include but are not limited to interest rate options, foreign currency options, equity options and index options.",

        "page_content": "## Credit derivatives\n\nCredit derivatives are OTC contracts that transfer credit risk related to an underlying financial instrument (referenced asset) from one counterparty to another. Credit derivatives include credit default swaps, credit default baskets and total return swaps.\n\nCredit default swaps provide protection against the decline in the value of the referenced asset as a result of specified credit events such as default or bankruptcy. They are similar in structure to an option, whereby the purchaser pays a premium to the seller of the credit default swap in return for payment contingent on a credit event affecting the referenced asset.\n\nCredit default baskets are similar to credit default swaps except that the underlying referenced financial instrument is a group of assets instead of a single asset.\n\nTotal return swaps are contracts where one counterparty agrees to pay or receive from the other cash amounts based on changes in the value of a referenced asset or group of assets, including any returns such as interest earned on these assets, in exchange for amounts that are based on prevailing market funding rates.\n\n## Other derivative products\n\nOther contracts are stable value and equity derivative contracts.\n\n## Non-financial derivatives\n\nOther contracts also include non-financial derivative products such as precious metal and commodity derivative contracts in both the OTC and exchange markets.\n\n## Derivatives issued for trading purposes\n\nMost of our derivative transactions relate to client-driven sales and trading activities, and associated market risk hedging. Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of derivative products to clients, enabling them to modify or reduce risks. Trading involves market-making, positioning and arbitrage activities. Market-making involves quoting bid and offer prices to other market participants with the intention of generating revenue based on spread and volume. Positioning involves the active management of derivative transactions with the expectation of profiting from favourable movements in prices, rates, or indices. Arbitrage activities involve identifying and profiting from price differentials between markets and product types. Any realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivatives used for trading purposes are recognized immediately in Non-interest income - Trading revenue.\n\n## Derivatives issued for other-than-trading purposes\n\nWe also use derivatives for purposes other than trading, primarily for hedging, in conjunction with the management of interest rate, credit, equity and foreign exchange risk related to our funding, lending, investment activities and asset/liability management.\n\nInterest rate swaps are used to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by modifying the repricing or maturity characteristics of existing and/or forecasted assets and liabilities, including funding and investment activities. Purchased options are used to hedge redeemable deposits and other options embedded in consumer products. We manage our exposure to foreign currency risk with cross currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts. We predominantly use credit derivatives to manage our credit exposures. We mitigate industry sector concentrations and single-name exposures related to our credit portfolio by purchasing credit derivatives to transfer credit risk to third parties.\n\nCertain derivatives and cash instruments are specifically designated and qualify for hedge accounting. We also enter into derivative transactions to economically hedge certain exposures that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting, or where hedge accounting is not considered economically feasible to implement. In such circumstances, changes in fair value are reflected in Non-interest income - Other income.\n\n## Notional amount of derivatives by term to maturity (absolute amounts) (1)\n\n|                                    | As at October 31, 2023                                                                | As at October 31, 2023   | As at October 31, 2023   | As at October 31, 2023   | As at October 31, 2023   | As at October 31, 2023   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                    | Term to maturity                                                                      | Term to maturity         | Term to maturity         | Term to maturity         |                          |                          |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)     | Within   1 year                                                                       | 1 through   5 years      | Over   5 years           | Total                    | Trading                  | Other than   Trading     |\n| Over-the-counter contracts         |                                                                                       |                          |                          |                          |                          |                          |\n| Interest rate contracts            |                                                                                       |                          |                          |                          |                          |                          |\n| Forward rate agreements            | $ 1,008,978   $                                                                       | 691,397   $              | 358   $                  | 1,700,733   $            | 1,700,733   $            | -

We also use foreign denominated deposit liabilities in net investment hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk arising from our investments in foreign operations. The hedging instruments designated to manage these risks reference IBORs in multiple jurisdictions and will be affected by the Reform as the markets transition to ABRs as discussed in Note 2.\n\nThe following table presents the notional or principal amount of our hedging instruments which reference IBORs and are affected by the Reform as discussed in Note 2.

Therefore, derivative-related credit risk is represented by the positive fair value of the instrument and is normally a small fraction of the contract's notional amount.\n\nWe subject our derivative transactions to the same credit approval, limit and monitoring standards that we use for managing other transactions that create credit exposure. This includes evaluating the creditworthiness of counterparties, and managing the size, diversification and maturity structure of the portfolio. Credit utilization for all products is compared with established limits on a continual basis and is subject to a standard exception reporting process. We use a single internal rating system for all credit risk exposure, as outlined in the internal ratings maps in the Credit risk section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.\n\nOffsetting is a technique that can reduce credit exposure from derivatives and is generally facilitated through the use of master netting agreements and achieved when specific criteria are met in accordance with our accounting policy in Note 2. A master netting agreement provides for a single net settlement of all financial instruments covered by the agreement in the event of default. However, credit risk is reduced only to the extent that our financial obligations to the same counterparty can be set off against obligations of the counterparty to us. We maximize the use of master netting agreements to reduce derivative-related credit exposure. Our overall exposure to credit risk that is reduced through master netting agreements may change substantially following the reporting date as the exposure is affected by each transaction subject to the agreement as well as by changes in underlying market rates. Measurement of our credit exposure arising out of derivative transactions is reduced to reflect the effects of netting in cases where the enforceability of that netting is supported by appropriate legal analysis as documented in our trading credit risk policies.\n\nThe use of collateral is another significant credit mitigation technique for managing derivative-related counterparty credit risk. Mark-to-market provisions in our agreements with some counterparties, typically in the form of a Credit Support Annex, provide us with the right to request that the counterparty pay down or collateralize the current market value of its derivatives positions when the value exceeds a specified threshold amount.\n\nReplacement cost and credit equivalent amounts are determined in accordance with OSFI's non-modelled regulatory SA-CCR under the CAR guidelines. The replacement cost represents the total fair value of all outstanding contracts in a gain position after factoring in the master netting agreements and applicable margins. The credit equivalent amount is defined as the replacement cost plus an additional amount for potential future credit exposure, scaled by a regulatory factor. The risk-weighted equivalent is determined by applying appropriate risk-weights to the credit equivalent amount, including those risk weights reflective of model approval under the internal ratings based approach.",

accounting to minimize volatility in earnings and capital caused by changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates. Interest rate and currency fluctuations will either cause assets and liabilities to appreciate or depreciate in market value or cause variability in forecasted cash flows. When a hedging relationship is effective, gains, losses, revenue and expenses of the hedging instrument will offset the gains, losses, revenue and expenses of the hedged item.\n\nDerivatives used in hedging relationships are recorded in Other Assets - Derivatives or Other Liabilities - Derivatives on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Foreign currency-denominated liabilities used in net investment hedging relationships are recorded in Deposits - Business and Government and Subordinated debentures on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses relating to hedging ineffectiveness are recorded in Non-Interest income and amounts reclassified from hedge reserves in OCI to income are recorded in Net-interest income for cash flow hedges and Non-interest income for net investment hedges.\n\nWe assess and measure the effectiveness of a hedging relationship based on the change in the fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument relative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. When cash instruments are designated as hedges of foreign exchange risks, only changes in their value due to foreign exchange risk are included in the assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness.\n\nPotential sources of ineffectiveness can be attributed to differences between hedging instruments and hedged items:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Mismatches in the terms of hedged items and hedging instruments, for example the frequency and timing of when interest rates are reset and frequency of payment.\n- GLYPH<129> Difference in the discounting factors between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, taking into consideration the different reset frequency of the hedged item and hedging instrument.\n- GLYPH<129> Hedging derivatives with a non-zero fair value at inception date of the hedging relationship, resulting in mismatch in terms with the hedged item.",

        "page_content": "Below is a description of our risk management strategy for each risk exposure that we decide to hedge:\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nWe use interest rate contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by modifying the repricing characteristics of existing and/or forecasted assets and liabilities, including funding and investment activities. The swaps are designated in either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge and predominantly reference IBORs across multiple jurisdictions. Certain swaps will be affected by the Reform as the market transitions to ABRs.\n\nFor fair value hedges, we use interest rate contracts to manage the fair value movements of our fixed rate instruments due to changes in benchmark interest. The interest rate swaps are entered into on a one-to-one basis to manage the benchmark interest rate risk, and its terms are critically matched to the specified fixed rate instruments.\n\nWe also use interest rate swaps in fair value hedges to manage interest rate risk from residential mortgage assets and funding liabilities. Our exposure from this portfolio changes with the origination of new loans, repayments of existing loans and sale of securitized mortgages. Accordingly, we have adopted dynamic hedging for that portfolio, in which the hedge relationship is rebalanced on a more frequent basis, such as on a bi-weekly or on a monthly basis.\n\nFor cash flow hedges, we use interest rate contracts to manage the exposure to cash flow variability of our variable rate instruments as a result of changes in benchmark interest rates. The variable rate instruments and forecast transactions which reference certain IBORs and will be affected by the Reform. Whilst some of the interest rate swaps are entered into on a one-toone basis to manage a specific exposure, other interest rate swaps may be entered into for managing interest rate risks of a portfolio of assets and liabilities.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nWe manage our exposure to foreign currency risk with cross currency swaps in a cash flow hedge, and foreign exchange forward contracts in a net investment hedge. Certain cash instruments may also be designated in a net investment hedge, where applicable.\n\nFor cash flow hedges, we use cross currency swaps and forward contracts to manage the cash flow variability arising from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on our issued foreign denominated fixed rate liabilities and highly probable forecasted transactions. The maturity profile and repayment terms of these swaps are matched to those of our foreign denominated exposures to limit our cash flow volatility from changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\nFor net investment hedges, we use a combination of foreign exchange forwards and cash instruments, such as foreign denominated deposit liabilities, to manage our foreign exchange risk arising from our investments in foreign operations. Our most significant exposures include USD, GBP and Euro. When hedging net investments in foreign operations using foreign exchange forwards, only the undiscounted spot element of the foreign exchange forward is designated as the hedging instrument. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument as a result of changes in forward rates and the effects of discounting are not included in the hedging effectiveness assessment. Foreign operations are only hedged to the extent of the principal of the foreign denominated deposit liabilities or notional amount of the derivative; we generally do not expect to incur significant ineffectiveness on hedges of net investments in foreign operations.\n\n## Equity price risk\n\nWe use total return swaps in cash flow hedges to mitigate the cash flow variability of the expected payment associated with our cash settled share-based compensation plan for certain key employees by exchanging interest payments for indexed RBC share price change and dividend returns.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nWe predominantly use credit derivatives to economically hedge our credit exposures. We mitigate industry sector concentrations and single-name exposures related to our credit portfolio by purchasing credit derivatives to transfer credit risk to third parties.\n\n## Derivative instruments designated in hedging relationships (1)\n\nThe following table presents the fair values of the derivative instruments and the principal amounts of the non-derivative liabilities, categorized by their hedging relationships, as well as derivatives that are not designated in hedging relationships.\n\n|                                | As at                             | As at                             | As at                                       | As at                                        | As at                                                        | As at                                                        | As at                                                        | As at                                        |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n|                                | October 31, 2023                  | October 31, 2023                  | October 31, 2023                            | October 31, 2023                             | October 31, 2022                                             | October 31, 2022                                             | October 31, 2022                                             | October 31, 2022                             |\n|                                | Designated as hedging instruments | Designated as hedging instruments | Designated as hedging instruments           |                                              | Designated as hedging instruments   in hedging relationships | Designated as hedging instruments   in hedging relationships | Designated as hedging instruments   in hedging relationships |                                              |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars) | Fair value   Cash flow            |                                   | in hedging relationships   Net   investment | Not designated   in a hedging   relationship | Fair value                                                   | Cash flow                                                    | Net   investment                                             | Not designated   in a hedging   relationship |\n| Assets                         |                                   |                                   |                                             |                                              |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |                                              |\n| Derivative instruments         | $ 156   $                         | 19   $                            | 13   $                                      | 142,262                                      | $ 247   $                                                    | 57   $                                                       | 36   $                                                       | 154,099                                      |\n| Liabilities                    |                                   |                                   |                                             |                                              |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |                                              |\n| Derivative instruments         | 50                                | 100                               | 409                                         | 142,070                                      | 27                                                           | -                                                            | 126                                                          | 153,338                                      |\n| Non-derivative instruments     | -                                 | -                                 | 25,427                                      | n.a.                                         | -                                                            | -                                                            | 25,798                                                       | n.a.                                         |",

The recoverable amount of a CGU is represented by its VIU, except in circumstances where the carrying amount of a CGU exceeds its VIU. In such cases, the greater of the CGU's FVLCD and its VIU is the recoverable amount. Our annual impairment test is performed as at August 1.\n\nIn our 2023 annual impairment tests, the recoverable amount of our Caribbean Banking CGU was based on its FVLCD and the recoverable amounts of all other CGUs tested were based on their VIU. In our 2022 annual impairment tests, the recoverable amounts of the Caribbean Banking CGU and International Wealth Management CGU were based on their FVLCD and the recoverable amounts of all other CGUs tested were based on their VIU.\n\n## Value in use\n\nWe calculate VIU using a five-year discounted cash flow method, with the exception of our International Wealth Management CGU where cash flow projections covering a seven-year period were used, which more closely aligns with the strategic growth plan resulting from the acquisition of RBC Brewin Dolphin. Future cash flows are based on financial plans agreed by management, estimated based on forecast results, business initiatives, capital required to support future cash flows and returns to shareholders. Key drivers of future cash flows include net interest margins and average interest-earning assets. The values assigned to these drivers over the forecast period are based on past experience, external and internal economic forecasts, and management's expectations of the impact of economic conditions on our financial results. Beyond the initial cash flow projection period, cash flows are assumed to increase at a constant rate using a nominal long-term growth rate (terminal growth rate). Terminal growth rates are based on the long-term steady state growth expectations in the countries within which the CGU operates. The discount rates used to determine the present value of each CGU's projected future cash flows are based on the bank-wide cost of capital, adjusted for the risks to which each CGU is exposed. CGU-specific risks include: country risk, business/ operational risk, geographic risk (including political risk, devaluation risk, and government regulation), currency risk, and price risk (including product pricing risk and inflation).\n\nThe estimation of VIU involves significant judgment in the determination of inputs to the discounted cash flow model and is most sensitive to changes in future cash flows, discount rates and terminal growth rates applied to cash flows beyond the forecast period. The sensitivity of the VIU to key inputs and assumptions used was tested by recalculating the recoverable amount using reasonably possible changes to those parameters. As at August 1, 2023, no reasonably possible change in an individual key input or assumption, as described, would result in a CGU's carrying amount exceeding its recoverable amount based on VIU.",

We calculated FVLCD using a discounted cash flow method that projects future cash flows over a 5-year period. Cash flows are based on management forecasts, adjusted to approximate the considerations of a prospective third-party buyer. Cash flows beyond the initial 5-year period are assumed to increase at a constant rate using a nominal long-term growth rate. Future cash flows, terminal growth rates, and discount rates are based on the same factors noted above. The forecast future cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax rate of 12.9% (August 1, 2022 - 12.6%), reflecting a higher interest rate environment. This fair value measurement is categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as certain significant inputs are not observable. We use significant judgment to determine inputs to the discounted cash flow model, which is most sensitive to changes in future cash flows, discount rates and terminal growth rates.\n\nWe considered reasonably possible alternative scenarios, including market comparable transactions, which yielded valuations ranging from an immaterial deficit to an immaterial surplus. The sensitivity of the FVLCD to key inputs and assumptions was tested by recalculating the recoverable amount using reasonably possible changes to those parameters. A 50 bps change in the terminal growth rate would increase and decrease the recoverable amount by $235 million and $209 million, respectively. A 50 bps increase in the discount rate would decrease the recoverable amount by $278 million. A reduction in the forecasted cash flows of 10% per annum would reduce the recoverable amount by $485 million. If future cash flows were reduced by 8%, the recoverable amount would approximate the carrying amount. Changes in these assumptions have been applied holding other individual factors constant. However, changes in one factor may be magnified or offset by related changes in other assumptions as impacts to the recoverable amount are highly interdependent and changes in assumptions may not have a linear effect on the recoverable amount of the CGU. In aggregate, the range of reasonably possible outcomes would not materially affect the recoverable amount of the CGU.",

We do not have a high degree of concentration risk due to our geographic diversity and business mix. Concentration risk is not a major concern for the life insurance business as it does not have a material level of region-specific characteristics. Reinsurance is also used for a majority of our Canadian insurance business to lower our risk profile and limit the liability on a single claim. We manage underwriting and pricing risk through the use of underwriting guidelines which detail the class, nature and type of business that may be accepted, pricing policies by product line and controls over policy wordings. The risk that claims are handled or paid inappropriately is mitigated by using a range of information technology (IT) system controls and manual processes conducted by experienced staff. These, together with a range of detailed policies and procedures, ensure that all claims are handled in a timely, appropriate and accurate manner.\n\n## Reinsurance ceded\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, our insurance operations reinsure risks to other insurance and reinsurance companies in order to lower our risk profile, limit loss exposure to large risks, and provide additional capacity for future growth. These ceding reinsurance arrangements do not relieve our insurance subsidiaries from our direct obligations to the insured parties. We evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurers and monitor our concentrations of credit risks to minimize our exposure to losses from reinsurer insolvency. Reinsurance amounts (ceded premiums) included in Non-interest income are shown in the table below.\n\n## Net premiums and claims\n\n|                                          | For the year ended   | For the year ended   |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)           | October 31   2023    | October 31   2022    |\n| Gross premiums                           | $ 5,428              | $ 4,913              |\n| Premiums ceded to reinsurers             | (297)                | (260)                |\n| Net premiums                             | $ 5,131              | $ 4,653              |\n| Gross claims and benefits (1)            | $ 3,960              | $ 1,741              |\n| Reinsurers' share of claims and benefits | (261)                | (273)                |\n| Net claims                               | $ 3,699              | $ 1,468              |\n\n## Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities\n\nAll actuarial assumptions are set in conjunction with Canadian Institute of Actuaries Standards of Practice and OSFI requirements. The assumptions that have the greatest effect on the measurement of insurance liabilities, the processes used to determine them and the assumptions used as at October 31, 2023 are as follows:\n\nMortality and morbidity - Mortality estimates are based on standard industry insured mortality tables, adjusted where appropriate to reflect our own experience. Morbidity assumptions are made with respect to the rates of claim incidence and claim termination for health insurance policies and are based on a combination of industry and our own experience.\n\nFuture investment yield - Assumptions are based on the current yield rate, a reinvestment assumption and an allowance for future credit losses for each line of business, and are developed using interest rate scenario testing, including prescribed scenarios for determination of minimum liabilities as set out in the actuarial standards.\n\nPolicyholder behaviour - Under certain policies, the policyholder has a contractual right to change benefits and premiums, as well as convert policies to permanent forms of insurance. All policyholders have the right to terminate their policies through lapse. Lapses represent the termination of policies due to non-payment of premiums. Lapse assumptions are primarily based on our recent experience adjusted for emerging industry experience where applicable.",

The investment returns on these funds are passed directly to the policyholders. Amounts invested are at the policyholders' risk, except where the policyholders have selected options providing maturity and death benefit guarantees. A liability for the guarantees is recorded in Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities.\n\nSegregated fund net assets are recorded at fair value. All of our segregated fund net assets are categorized as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the segregated fund liabilities is equal to the fair value of the segregated fund net assets. Segregated fund net assets and segregated fund liabilities are presented on separate lines on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The majority of beneficiaries of the pension plans are located in Canada and other beneficiaries of the pension plans are primarily located in the U.S., the U.K. and the Caribbean. The pension arrangements including investment, plan benefits and funding decisions are governed by local pension committees or trustees, who are legally segregated from the Bank, or management. Significant plan changes require the approval of the Board of Directors.\n\nOur defined benefit pension plans provide pension benefits based on years of service, contributions and average earnings at retirement. Our primary defined benefit pension plans are closed to new members. New employees are generally eligible to join defined contribution pension plans. The specific features of these plans vary by location. We also provide supplemental non-registered (non-qualified) pension plans for certain executives and senior management that are typically unfunded or partially funded.\n\nOur defined contribution pension plans provide pension benefits based on accumulated employee and Bank contributions. The Bank contributions are based on a percentage of an employee's annual earnings and a portion of the Bank contribution may be dependent on the amount being contributed by the employee and their years of service.\n\nOur primary other post-employment benefit plans provide health, dental, disability and life insurance coverage and cover a number of current and retired employees who are mainly located in Canada. These plans are unfunded unless required by legislation.\n\nWe measure our benefit obligations and pension assets as at October 31 each year. All plans are valued using the projected unit-credit method. We fund our registered defined benefit pension plans in accordance with actuarially determined amounts required to satisfy employee benefit obligations under current pension regulations. For our principal pension plan, the most recent funding actuarial valuation was completed on January 1, 2023, and the next valuation is required no later than January 1, 2026.\n\nFor the year ended October 31, 2023, total contributions to our pension plans (defined benefit and defined contribution plans) and other post-employment benefit plans were $346 million and $80 million (October 31, 2022 - $427 million and $79 million), respectively. For 2024, total contributions to our pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans are expected to be $408 million and $86 million, respectively.\n\n## Risks\n\nBy their design, the defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans expose the Bank to various risks such as investment performance, reductions in discount rates used to value the obligations, increased longevity of plan members, future inflation levels impacting future salary increases as well as future increases in healthcare costs. These risks will reduce over time due to the membership closure of our primary defined benefit pension plans and migration to defined contribution pension plans.\n\nThe following table presents the financial position related to all of our material pension and other post-employment benefit plans worldwide, including executive retirement arrangements.\n\n|                                                             | As at                           | As at                                  | As at                           | As at                                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|                                                             | October 31, 2023                | October 31, 2023                       | October 31, 2022                | October 31, 2022                       |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)                              | Defined benefit   pension plans | Other post- employment   benefit plans | Defined benefit   pension plans | Other post- employment   benefit plans |\n| Canada                                                      |                                 |                                        |                                 |                                        |\n| Fair value of plan assets                                   | $ 13,704   $                    | -

The pension plans' investment strategy is to hold a diversified mix of investments by asset class and geographic location in order to reduce investment-specific risk to the funded status while maximizing the expected returns to meet pension obligations. Investment of the plan's assets follows an asset/liability framework as investment is conducted with careful consideration of the pension obligation's sensitivity to interest rates and credit spreads which are key risk factors impacting the obligation's value. Factors taken into consideration in developing our asset mix include but are not limited to the following:\n\n- GLYPH<129> the nature of the underlying benefit obligations, including the duration and term profile of the liabilities;\n- GLYPH<129> the member demographics, including expectations for normal retirements, terminations, and deaths;\n- GLYPH<129> the financial position of the pension plans;\n- GLYPH<129> the diversification benefits obtained by the inclusion of multiple asset classes; and\n- GLYPH<129> expected asset returns, including asset and liability correlations, along with liquidity requirements of the plan.\n\nTo implement our asset mix policy, we may invest in debt securities, equity securities, and alternative investments. Our holdings in certain investments, including common shares, debt securities rated lower than BBB and residential and commercial mortgages, cannot exceed a defined percentage of the market value of our defined benefit pension plan assets. We may use derivative instruments as either a synthetic investment to more efficiently replicate the performance of an underlying security, or as a hedge against financial risks within the plan. To manage our credit risk exposure, where derivative instruments are not centrally cleared, counterparties are required to meet minimum credit ratings and enter into collateral agreements.\n\nOur defined benefit pension plan assets are primarily comprised of debt and equity securities and alternative investments. Our equity securities generally have unadjusted quoted market prices in an active market (Level 1) and our debt securities generally have quoted market prices for similar assets in an active market (Level 2). Alternative investments and other includes cash, hedge funds, and private fund investments including infrastructure equity, real estate, private debt and private equity. In the case of private fund investments, no quoted market prices are usually available (Level 2 or Level 3). These fund assets are either valued by an independent valuator or priced using observable market inputs.\n\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2023, the management of defined benefit pension investments focused on increased allocation to risk reducing investments and strategies, improving diversification, while striving to maintain expected investment return. Over time, an increasing allocation to debt securities is being used to reduce asset/liability duration mismatch and hence variability of the plan's funded status due to interest rate movement. Longer maturity debt securities, given their price sensitivity to movements in interest rates, are considered to be a good economic hedge to risk associated with the plan's liabilities, which are discounted using predominantly long maturity bond interest rates as inputs.",

The derived curve is based on actual short and mid-maturity corporate AA rates and extrapolated longer term rates. The extrapolated corporate AA rates are derived from observed corporate A, corporate AA and provincial AA yields. For the International pension and other post-employment benefit plans, all future expected benefit payments at each measurement date are discounted at spot rates from a local AA corporate bond yield curve. Spot rates beyond 30 years are set to equal the 30-year spot rate. The discount rate is the equivalent single rate that produces the same discounted value as that determined using the entire discount curve. This valuation methodology does not rely on assumptions regarding reinvestment returns.\n\n## Rate of increase in future compensation\n\nThe assumptions for increases in future compensation are developed separately for each plan, where relevant. Each assumption is set based on the price inflation assumption and compensation policies in each market, as well as relevant local statutory and plan-specific requirements.\n\n## Healthcare cost trend rates\n\nHealthcare cost calculations are based on both short and long term trend assumptions established using the plan's recent experience as well as market expectations.",

The increase (decrease) in obligation in the following table has been determined for key assumptions assuming all other assumptions are held constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. The following table presents the sensitivity analysis of key assumptions for 2023.\n\n|                                                                      | Increase (decrease)   in obligation   | Increase (decrease)   in obligation      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)                                       | Defined benefit   pension plans       | Other post-   employment   benefit plans |\n| Discount rate                                                        |                                       |                                          |\n| Impact of 100 bps increase in discount rate                          | $ (1,228)   $                         | (149)                                    |\n| Impact of 100 bps decrease in discount rate                          | 1,536                                 | 184                                      |\n| Rate of increase in future compensation                              |                                       |                                          |\n| Impact of 50 bps increase in rate of increase in future compensation | 23                                    | -                                        |\n| Impact of 50 bps decrease in rate of increase in future compensation | (25)                                  | -                                        |\n| Mortality rate                                                       |                                       |                                          |\n| Impact of an increase in longevity by one additional year            | 289                                   | 18                                       |\n| Healthcare cost trend rate                                           |                                       |                                          |\n| Impact of 100 bps increase in healthcare cost trend rate             | n.a.                                  | 50                                       |\n| Impact of 100 bps decrease in healthcare cost trend rate             | n.a.                                  | (42)                                     |",

        "page_content": "## Restrictions on the payment of dividends\n\nWe are prohibited by the Bank Act (Canada) from declaring any dividends on our preferred or common shares when we are, or would be placed as a result of the declaration, in contravention of the capital adequacy and liquidity regulations or any regulatory directives issued under the Act. We may not pay dividends on our common shares at any time unless all dividends to which preferred shareholders are then entitled have been declared and paid or set apart for payment.\n\nCurrently, these limitations do not restrict the payment of dividends on our preferred or common shares.\n\n## Dividend reinvestment plan\n\nOur dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) provides common and preferred shareholders with a means to receive additional common shares rather than cash dividends. The plan is only open to shareholders residing in Canada or the U.S. The requirements of our DRIP are satisfied through either open market share purchases or shares issued from treasury. During the second, third and fourth quarters of 2023, the requirements of our DRIP were satisfied through shares issued from treasury. During the first quarter of 2023 and the year ended October 31, 2022, the requirements of our DRIP were satisfied through open market share purchases.\n\n## Shares available for future issuances\n\nAs at October 31, 2023, 26.9 million common shares are available for future issue relating to our DRIP and potential exercise of stock options and awards outstanding. In addition, we may issue up to 38.9 million common shares from treasury under the RBC Umbrella Savings and Securities Purchase Plan that was approved by shareholders on February 26, 2009.\n\n## Note 21 Share-based compensation\n\n## Stock option plans\n\nWe have stock option plans for certain key employees. Under the plans, options are periodically granted to purchase common shares. The exercise price for the majority of the grants is determined as the higher of the volume-weighted average of the trading prices per board lot (100 shares) of our common shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange (i) on the day preceding the day of grant; and (ii) the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the day of grant. The exercise price for the remaining grants is the closing market share price of our common shares on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. All options vest over a four-year period, and are exercisable for a period not exceeding 10 years from the grant date.\n\nThe compensation expense recorded for the year ended October 31, 2023, in respect of the stock option plans was $11 million (October 31, 2022 - $8 million). The compensation expense related to non-vested options was $5 million at October 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 - $4 million), to be recognized over the weighted average period of 1.9 years (October 31, 2022 - 2.0 years).

        "page_content": "The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year ended October 31, 2023 was estimated at $11.51 (October 31, 2022 - $7.80). This was determined by applying the Black-Scholes model on the date of grant, taking into account the specific terms and conditions under which the options are granted, such as the vesting period and expected share price volatility estimated by considering the historic average share price volatility over a historical period corresponding to the expected option life. The following assumptions were used to determine the fair value of options granted:\n\n## Weighted average assumptions\n\n|                                                           | For the year ended   | For the year ended   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| (Canadian dollars per share except percentages and years) | October 31   2023    | October 31   2022    |\n| Share price at grant date                                 | $ 130.16             | $ 128.48             |\n| Risk-free interest rate                                   | 2.89%                | 1.25%                |\n| Expected dividend yield                                   | 3.79%                | 3.66%                |\n| Expected share price volatility                           | 14%                  | 13%                  |\n| Expected life of option                                   | 6 Years              | 6 Years              |\n\n## Employee savings and share ownership plans\n\nWe offer many employees an opportunity to own our common shares through savings and share ownership plans. Under these plans, the employees can generally contribute between 1% and 10% of their annual salary or benefit base for commission-based employees. For each contribution between 1% and 6%, we will match 50% of the employee contributions in our common shares. For the RBC Dominion Securities Savings Plan, our maximum annual contribution is $4,500 per employee. For the RBC U.K. Share Incentive Plan, our maximum annual contribution is \u00a31,500 per employee. For the year ended October 31, 2023, we contributed $139 million (October 31, 2022 - $128 million), under the terms of these plans, towards the purchase of our common shares. As at October 31, 2023, an aggregate of 36 million common shares were held under these plans (October 31, 2022 - 36 million common shares).\n\n## Deferred share and other plans\n\nWe offer deferred share unit plans to executives, certain key employees and non-employee directors of the Bank. Under these plans, participants may choose to receive all or a percentage of their annual variable short-term incentive bonus, commission, or directors' fee in the form of deferred share units (DSUs). The participants must elect to participate in the plan prior to the beginning of the year. DSUs earn dividend equivalents in the form of additional DSUs at the same rate as dividends on common shares. The participant is not allowed to convert the DSUs until retirement or termination of employment/directorship. The cash value of the DSUs is equivalent to the market value of common shares when conversion takes place.\n\nWe also offer unit awards for certain key employees within Capital Markets. The bonus is invested as RBC share units and a specified percentage vests on a specified number of anniversary dates each year. Each vested amount is paid in cash and is based on the original number of share units granted plus accumulated dividends, valued using the average closing price of RBC common shares during the five trading days immediately preceding the vesting date.\n\nWe offer performance deferred share award plans to certain key employees, all of which vest at the end of three years. Upon vesting, the award is paid in cash and is based on the original number of RBC share units granted plus accumulated dividends valued using the average closing price of RBC common shares during the five trading days immediately preceding the vesting date. A portion of the award under certain plans may be increased or decreased up to 25%, depending on our total shareholder return compared to a defined peer group of global financial institutions.\n\nWe maintain non-qualified deferred compensation plans for certain key employees in the U.S. These plans allow eligible employees to defer a portion of their annual income and a variety of productivity and recruitment bonuses and allocate the deferrals among specified fund choices, including a RBC Share Account fund that tracks the value of our common shares.\n\nThe following table presents the units granted under the deferred share and other plans for the year.\n\n## Units granted under deferred share and other plans\n\n|                                               | For the year ended            | For the year ended                         | For the year ended            | For the year ended                         |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n|                                               | October 31, 2023              | October 31, 2023                           | October 31, 2022              | October 31, 2022                           |\n| (Units and per unit amounts)                  | Units   granted   (thousands) | Weighted   average   fair value   per unit | Units   granted   (thousands) | Weighted   average   fair value   per unit |\n| Deferred share unit plans                     | 466                           | $ 130.61                                   | 469                           | $ 131.49                                   |\n| Capital Markets compensation plan unit awards | 4,231                         | 110.32                                     | 3,794                         | 125.22                                     |\n| Performance deferred share award plans        | 2,362                         | 131.41                                     | 2,220                         | 129.65                                     |\n| Deferred compensation plans                   | 103                           | 126.81                                     | 92                            | 135.44                                     |\n| Other share-based plans                       | 1,506                         | 130.12                                     | 1,083                         | 128.50                                     |\n|                                               | 8,668                         | $ 120.79                                   | 7,658                         | $ 127.48                                   |\n\nOur liabilities for the awards granted under the deferred share and other plans are measured at fair value, determined based on the quoted market price of our common shares and specified fund choices as applicable. Annually, our obligation is increased by additional units earned by plan participants, and is reduced by forfeitures, cancellations, and the settlement of vested units. In addition, our obligation is impacted by fluctuations in the market price of our common shares and specified fund units. For performance deferred share award plans, the estimated outcome of meeting the performance conditions also impacts our obligation.",

        "page_content": "The tax loss and tax credit carryforwards amount of deferred tax assets primarily relates to losses and tax credits in our Canadian, U.S., and Caribbean operations. Deferred tax assets of $261 million were recognized at October 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 - $322 million) in respect of tax losses and tax credits incurred in current or preceding years for which recognition is dependent on the projection of future taxable profits. Management's forecasts support the assumption that it is probable that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the deferred tax assets. The forecasts rely on continued liquidity and capital support to our business operations, including tax planning strategies implemented in relation to such support.\n\nAs at October 31, 2023, unused tax losses and tax credits of $417 million and $18 million (October 31, 2022 - $429 million and $130 million) available to be offset against potential tax adjustments or future taxable income were not recognized as deferred tax assets. There are no unused tax losses that will expire within one year (October 31, 2022 - $nil), or in two to four years (October 31, 2022 - $nil) and there are $417 million of unused tax losses that will expire after four years (October 31, 2022 - $429 million). There are no tax credits that will expire in one year (October 31, 2022 - $nil), or in two to four years (October 31, 2022 $93 million) and there are $18 million that will expire after four years (October 31, 2022 - $37 million).\n\nThe amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates and interests in joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized in the parent bank is $22 billion as at October 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 - $26 billion).\n\n## Government of Canada Budget 2022\n\nOn December 15, 2022, Bill C-32, Fall Economic Statement Implementation Act, 2022 (the Bill), tabled by the Government of Canada, received royal assent. The Bill amends the Income Tax Act (Canada) to implement a CRD and a permanent increase in the Canadian corporate tax rate on banks and life insurer groups.\n\nThe CRD is a one-time 15% tax for 2022 determined based on the average taxable income above $1 billion for taxation years 2020 and 2021 and payable in equal installments over five years. The CRD resulted in an increase in income taxes of $1.2 billion for the year ended October 31, 2023, of which $1 billion was recognized in net income and $0.2 billion was recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe permanent increase in the Canadian corporate tax rate is 1.5% on taxable income above $100 million and applies to taxation years that end after April 7, 2022, resulting in an increase in the Canadian statutory tax rate from 26.2% to 27.7% for the year ended October 31, 2023.\n\n## Tax examinations and assessments\n\nDuring the year, we received proposal letters (the Proposals) from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) in respect of the 2018 taxation year, which suggested that Royal Bank of Canada owes additional taxes of approximately $228 million as they denied the deductibility of certain dividends. On November 28, 2023, we received a reassessment in respect of the 2018 taxation year, consistent with the Proposals received during the year. The reassessment received is consistent with the reassessments received for taxation years 2012 to 2017 of approximately $1,628 million of additional income taxes and the reassessments received for taxation years 2009 to 2011 of approximately $434 million of additional income taxes and interest in respect of the same matter. These amounts represent the maximum additional taxes owing for those years.\n\nLegislative amendments introduced in the 2015 Canadian Federal Budget resulted in disallowed deduction of dividends from transactions with Taxable Canadian Corporations including those hedged with Tax Indifferent Investors, namely pension funds and non-resident entities with prospective application effective May 1, 2017. The dividends to which the reassessments relate include both dividends in transactions similar to those which are the target of the 2015 legislative amendments and dividends which are unrelated to the legislative amendments.\n\nIt is possible that the CRA will reassess us for significant additional income tax for subsequent years on the same basis. In all cases, we are confident that our tax filing position was appropriate and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.\n\n## Note 23 Earnings per share\n\n|                                                                             | For the year ended   | For the year ended   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)          | October 31   2023    | October 31   2022    |\n| Basic earnings per share                                                    |                      |                      |\n| Net income                                                                  | $ 14,866             | $ 15,807             |\n| Dividends on preferred shares and distributions on other equity instruments | (236)                | (247)                |\n| Net income attributable to non-controlling interests                        | (7)                  | (13)                 |\n| Net income available to common shareholders                                 | $ 14,623             | $ 15,547             |\n| Weighted average number of common shares (in thousands)                     | 1,391,020            | 1,403,654            |\n| Basic earnings per share (in dollars)                                       | $ 10.51              | $ 11.08              |\n| Diluted earnings per share                                                  |                      |                      |\n| Net income available to common shareholders                                 | $ 14,623             | $ 15,547             |\n| Weighted average number of common shares (in thousands)                     | 1,391,020            | 1,403,654            |\n| Stock options (1)                                                           | 1,483                | 1,918                |\n| Issuable under other share-based compensation plans                         | 26                   | 462                  |\n| Average number of diluted common shares (in thousands)                      | 1,392,529            | 1,406,034            |\n| Diluted earnings per share (in dollars)                                     | $ 10.50              | $ 11.06              |",

Our clients generally have the right to request settlement of, or draw on, our guarantees and commitments within one year. However, certain guarantees can only be drawn if specified conditions are met. These conditions, along with collateral requirements, are described below. We believe that it is highly unlikely that all or substantially all of the guarantees and commitments will be drawn or settled within one year, and contracts may expire without being drawn or settled.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\n## Financial standby letters of credit\n\nFinancial standby letters of credit represent irrevocable assurances that we will make payments in the event that a client cannot meet its payment obligations to the third party. For certain guarantees, the guaranteed party can request payment from us even though the client has not defaulted on its obligations. These guarantees generally have a term of five to seven years.\n\nOur policy for requiring collateral security with respect to these instruments and the types of collateral security held is generally the same as for loans. When collateral security is taken, it is determined on an account-by-account basis according to the risk of the borrower and the specifics of the transaction. Collateral security may include cash, securities and other assets pledged.\n\n## Commitments to extend credit\n\n## Backstop liquidity facilities\n\nBackstop liquidity facilities are provided to ABCP conduit programs administered by us and third parties as an alternative source of financing in the event that such programs are unable to access commercial paper markets, or in limited circumstances, when predetermined performance measures of the financial assets acquired or financed by these programs are not met. We also provide backstop liquidity facilities to certain third-party commercial mortgage securitization vehicles. The average remaining term of these liquidity facilities is approximately four years.\n\nThe terms of the backstop liquidity facilities do not require us to advance money to these programs in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency and generally do not require us to purchase non-performing or defaulted assets.\n\n## Credit enhancements\n\nWe provide partial credit enhancement to multi-seller ABCP programs administered by us to protect commercial paper investors in the event that the collections on the underlying assets together with the transaction-specific credit enhancements or the liquidity facilities prove to be insufficient to pay for maturing commercial paper. Each of the asset pools is structured to achieve a high investment grade credit profile through credit enhancements required to be provided by the third-party sellers related to each transaction. The average remaining term of these credit facilities is approximately three years.\n\n## Documentary and commercial letters of credit\n\nDocumentary and commercial letters of credit, which are written undertakings by us on behalf of a client authorizing a third party to draw drafts on us up to a stipulated amount under specific terms and conditions, where some are collateralized based on the underlying agreement with the client and others are collateralized by cash deposits or other assets of the client.\n\n## Other commitments to extend credit\n\nCommitments to extend credit represent unused portions of authorizations to extend credit in the form of loans, reverse repurchase agreements, bankers' acceptances or letters of credit where we do not have the ability to unilaterally withdraw the credit extended to the borrower.",

        "page_content": "## Note 24 Guarantees, commitments, pledged assets and contingencies (continued)\n\n## Other credit-related commitments\n\n## Securities lending indemnifications\n\nIn securities lending transactions, we act as an agent for the owner of a security, who agrees to lend the security to a borrower for a fee, under the terms of a pre-arranged contract. The borrower must fully collateralize the security loaned at all times. As part of this custodial business, an indemnification may be provided to securities lending customers to ensure that the fair value of securities loaned will be returned in the event that the borrower fails to return the borrowed securities and the collateral held is insufficient to cover the fair value of those securities. These indemnifications normally terminate without being drawn upon. The term of these indemnifications varies, as the securities loaned are recallable on demand. Collateral held for our securities lending transactions typically includes cash, securities that are issued or guaranteed by the Canadian government, U.S. government or other OECD countries or high quality debt or equity instruments.\n\n## Performance guarantees\n\nPerformance guarantees represent irrevocable assurances that we will make payments to third-party beneficiaries in the event that a client fails to perform under a specified non-financial contractual obligation. Such obligations typically include works and service contracts, performance bonds, and warranties related to international trade. The term of these guarantees can range up to three to seven years.\n\nOur policy for requiring collateral security with respect to these instruments and the types of collateral security held is generally the same as for loans. When collateral security is taken, it is determined on an account-by-account basis according to the risk of the borrower and the specifics of the transaction. Collateral security may include cash, securities and other assets pledged.\n\n## Sponsored member guarantees\n\nFor certain overnight repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions, we act as a sponsoring member to eligible clients to clear transactions through the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC). We also provide a guarantee to FICC for the prompt and full payment and performance of our sponsored member clients' respective obligations under the FICC rules. The guarantees are fully collateralized by cash and securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nIn the normal course of our operations, we provide indemnifications which are often standard contractual terms to counterparties in transactions such as purchase and sale contracts, fiduciary, agency, licensing, custodial and service agreements, clearing system arrangements, participation as a member of exchanges, director/officer contracts and leasing transactions. These indemnification agreements may require us to compensate the counterparties for costs incurred as a result of changes in laws and regulations (including tax legislation) or as a result of litigation claims or statutory sanctions that may be suffered by the counterparty as a consequence of the transaction. The terms of these indemnification agreements vary based on the contract. The nature of the indemnification agreements prevents us from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount we could be required to pay to counterparties. Historically, we have not made any significant payments under such indemnifications.\n\n## Uncommitted amounts\n\nUncommitted amounts represent undrawn credit facilities for which we have the ability to unilaterally withdraw the credit extended to the borrower at any time. These include both retail and commercial commitments. As at October 31, 2023, the total balance of uncommitted amounts was $398 billion (October 31, 2022 - $363 billion).\n\n## Other commitments\n\nWe invest in private companies, directly or through third-party investment funds, including venture capital funds, private equity funds, Small Business Investment Companies, real estate funds and Low Income Housing Tax Credit funds. These funds are generally structured as closed-end limited partnerships wherein we hold a limited partner interest. For the year ended October 31, 2023, we have unfunded commitments of $1,832 million (October 31, 2022 - $1,421 million) representing the aggregate amount of cash we are obligated to contribute as capital to these partnerships under the terms of the relevant contracts.\n\n## Pledged assets and collateral\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we pledge assets and enter into collateral agreements with terms and conditions that are usual and customary to our regular lending, borrowing and trading activities recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following are examples of our general terms and conditions on pledged assets and collateral:\n\n- GLYPH<129> The risks and rewards of the pledged assets reside with the pledgor.\n- GLYPH<129> The pledged asset is returned to the pledgor when the necessary conditions have been satisfied.\n- GLYPH<129> The right of the pledgee to sell or re-pledge the asset is dependent on the specific agreement under which the collateral is pledged.\n- GLYPH<129> If there is no default, the pledgee must return the comparable asset to the pledgor upon satisfaction of the obligation.\n\nWe are also required to provide intraday pledges to the Bank of Canada when we use a real-time electronic wire transfer system that continuously processes all Canadian dollar large-value or time-critical payments throughout the day. The pledged assets earmarked for our Canadian dollar large-value or time-critical payments are normally released back to us at the end of the settlement cycle each day. Therefore, the pledged assets amount is not included in the following table. For the year ended October 31, 2023, we had on average $1 billion of assets pledged intraday to the Bank of Canada on a daily basis (October 31, 2022 - $2 billion). There are infrequent occasions where we are required to take an overnight advance from the Bank of Canada to cover a settlement requirement, in which case an equivalent value of the pledged assets would be used to secure the advance. There were no overnight advances taken on October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022.",

We are and have been subject to a variety of legal proceedings, including civil claims and lawsuits, regulatory examinations, investigations, audits and requests for information by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities in various jurisdictions. Some of these matters may involve novel legal theories and interpretations and may be advanced under criminal as well as civil statutes, and some proceedings could result in the imposition of civil, regulatory enforcement or criminal penalties. We review the status of all proceedings on an ongoing basis and will exercise judgment in resolving them in such manner as we believe to be in our best interest. In many proceedings, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or to reliably estimate the amount of any loss. This is an area of significant judgment and uncertainty and the extent of our financial and other exposure to these proceedings after taking into account current provisions could be material to our results of operations in any particular period though we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any such matter will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition. The following is a description of our significant legal proceedings. Based on the facts currently known, except as may otherwise be noted, it is not possible at this time for us to predict the ultimate outcome of these proceedings or the timing of their resolution.\n\n## London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) litigation\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada and other U.S. dollar panel banks have been named as defendants in private lawsuits filed in the U.S. with respect to the setting of U.S. dollar LIBOR including a number of class action lawsuits which have been consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaints in those private lawsuits assert claims against us and other panel banks under various U.S. laws, including U.S. antitrust laws, the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act, and state law. On December 30, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued an opinion affirming in part and reversing in part certain district court rulings that had dismissed a substantial portion of the consolidated class action on jurisdictional grounds and lack of standing. The Second Circuit remanded the matter to the district court for further proceedings consistent with its decision.\n\nOn July 21, 2023, Royal Bank of Canada and several other defendants executed a settlement agreement resolving one of the LIBOR class actions brought on behalf of certain plaintiffs that purchased U.S. dollar LIBOR-based instruments. The settlement was preliminarily approved on August 1, 2023 and remains subject to final court approval.\n\n## Royal Bank of Canada Trust Company (Bahamas) Limited proceedings\n\nOn April 13, 2015, a French investigating judge notified Royal Bank of Canada Trust Company (Bahamas) Limited (RBC Bahamas) of the issuance of an ordonnance de renvoi referring RBC Bahamas and other unrelated persons to the French tribunal correctionnel to face the charge of complicity in estate tax fraud relating to actions taken relating to a trust for which RBC Bahamas serves as trustee. RBC Bahamas believes that its actions did not violate French law and contested the charge in the French court. On January 12, 2017, the French court acquitted all parties including RBC Bahamas and on June 29, 2018, the French appellate court affirmed the acquittals. The acquittals were appealed and on January 6, 2021, the French Supreme Court issued a judgment reversing the decision of the French Court of Appeal and sent the case back to the French Court of Appeal for rehearing. The retrial before the Court of Appeal commenced on September 18, 2023 and has concluded. The Court of Appeal's decision is expected to be issued on March 5, 2024.",

        "page_content": "## Note 25 Legal and regulatory matters (continued)\n\nOn October 28, 2016, Royal Bank of Canada was granted an exemption by the U.S. Department of Labor that allows Royal Bank of Canada and its current and future affiliates to continue to qualify for the Qualified Professional Asset Manager (QPAM) exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act despite any potential conviction of RBC Bahamas in the French proceeding for a temporary one year period from the date of conviction. We expect the Department of Labor to publish a technical correction to the prior one-year exemption in advance of the Court of Appeals decision. The anticipated technical correction will reflect the fact that the decision will be rendered by an appellate court, and not the district court. In addition, the Department of Labor has proposed amendments to the QPAM exemption. If the amendments are finalized as proposed, it is unclear how they would affect Royal Bank of Canada's ability to obtain relief beyond the one-year temporary exemption period.\n\nRBC Bahamas continues to review the trustee's and the trust's legal obligations, including liabilities and potential liabilities under applicable tax and other laws.\n\n## Foreign exchange matters\n\nBeginning in 2015, putative class actions were brought against Royal Bank of Canada and/or RBC Capital Markets, LLC in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Brazil. These actions were each brought against multiple foreign exchange dealers and alleged, among other things, collusive behaviour in global foreign exchange trading. By May 2023 all of the U.S., Canadian and U.K. actions were settled or dismissed, and while the Brazilian actions have not been resolved, our exposure to these actions is de minimis to Royal Bank of Canada.\n\n## U.S. communications recordkeeping inquiry\n\nIn October 2022, our subsidiary RBC Capital Markets, LLC received a request for information and documents from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concerning compliance with records preservation requirements relating to business communications exchanged on electronic channels that have not been approved by RBC Capital Markets, LLC. RBC Capital Markets, LLC is cooperating with the SEC's inquiry. As has been publicly reported, the SEC is conducting similar inquiries into recordkeeping practices at multiple other financial institutions.\n\n## U.K. Competition and Markets Authority investigation\n\nIn November 2018, the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) started an investigation of Royal Bank of Canada and RBC Europe Limited relating to alleged anti-competitive conduct between 2009 and 2013, involving U.K. government bonds and related derivatives. In May 2023, the CMA issued a statement of objections to Royal Bank of Canada and RBC Europe Limited, and certain other financial institutions. Royal Bank of Canada and RBC Europe Limited are contesting the CMA's case.\n\nIn June 2023, RBC Europe Limited and RBC Capital Markets, LLC, among other financial institutions, were named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the U.S. by plaintiffs alleging anti-competitive conduct in the U.K. government bonds market. In September 2023, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.\n\n## Vacation pay class action\n\nOn December 29, 2022, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice certified a class in an action against RBC Dominion Securities Limited and RBC Dominion Securities Inc. (together, RBC DS). The action commenced in July 2020, asserting claims relating to statutory vacation pay and public holiday pay for investment advisors, associates and assistants in our Canadian Wealth Management business, with the exception of those employed in Alberta and British Columbia.\n\n## Other matters\n\nWe are a defendant in a number of other actions alleging that certain of our practices and actions were improper. The lawsuits involve a variety of complex issues and the timing of their resolution is varied and uncertain. Management believes that we will ultimately be successful in resolving these lawsuits, to the extent that we are able to assess them, without material financial impact to the Bank. This is, however, an area of significant judgment and the potential liability resulting from these lawsuits could be material to our results of operations in any particular period.\n\nVarious other legal proceedings are pending that challenge certain of our other practices or actions. While this is an area of significant judgment and some matters are currently inestimable, we consider that the aggregate liability, to the extent that we are able to assess it, resulting from these other proceedings will not be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\n\n## Note 26 Related party transactions\n\n## Related parties\n\nRelated parties include associated companies over which we have direct or indirect control or have significant influence and post-employment benefit plans for the benefit of our employees. Related parties also include key management personnel (KMP), the Board of Directors (Directors), close family members of KMP and Directors, and entities which are, directly or indirectly, controlled by or jointly controlled by KMP, Directors or their close family members.\n\n## Key management personnel and Directors\n\nKMP are defined as those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling our activities, directly or indirectly. They include the senior members of our organization called the Group Executive (GE). The GE is comprised of the President and Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Officers and Group Heads, who report directly to him. The Directors do not plan, direct, or control the activities of the entity; they oversee the management of the business and provide stewardship.",

We have no Stage 3 allowance or provision for credit losses relating to these loans as at and for the years ended October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022. No guarantees, pledges or commitments have been given to KMP, Directors or their close family members.\n\n## Joint ventures and associates\n\nIn the normal course of business, we provide certain banking and financial services to our joint ventures and associates, including loans, interest and non-interest bearing deposits. These transactions meet the definition of related party transactions and were made on substantially the same terms as for comparable transactions with third parties.\n\nAs at October 31, 2023, loans to joint ventures and associates were $217 million (October 31, 2022 - $251 million) and deposits from joint ventures and associates were $77 million (October 31, 2022 - $20 million).

        "page_content": "## Note 27 Results by business segment\n\n## Composition of business segments\n\nFor management purposes, based on the products and services offered, we are organized into four business segments: Personal & Commercial Banking, Wealth Management, Insurance, and Capital Markets. Effective the first quarter of 2023, we simplified our reporting structure by eliminating the Investor & Treasury Services segment and moving its former businesses to existing segments. We moved our Investor Services business to our Wealth Management segment, and our Treasury Services and Transaction Banking businesses to our Capital Markets segment. Effective the fourth quarter of 2023, we moved the Investor Services lending business from our Wealth Management segment to our Capital Markets segment. From a reporting perspective, there were no changes to our Personal & Commercial Banking and Insurance segments. Comparative results have been revised to conform to our new basis of segment presentation.\n\nPersonal & Commercial Banking provides a broad suite of financial products and services to individual and business clients for their day-to-day banking, investing and financing needs through two businesses: Canadian Banking and Caribbean & U.S. Banking. In Canada, we provide a broad suite of financial products and services through our large branch network, ATMs, and mobile sales network. In the Caribbean and the U.S., we offer a broad range of financial products and services in targeted markets. Non-interest income in Personal & Commercial Banking mainly comprises Service charges, Mutual fund revenue and Card service revenue.\n\nWealth Management serves high net worth and ultra-high net worth individual and institutional clients with a comprehensive suite of advice-based solutions and strategies as well as personalized banking relationships through our lines of businesses in Canada, the U.S., the U.K., Europe and Asia, including Canadian Wealth Management, U.S. Wealth Management (including City National), Global Asset Management, International Wealth Management, and Investor Services. Non-interest income in Wealth Management mainly comprises Investment management and custodial fees, Mutual fund revenue and Securities brokerage commissions.\n\nInsurance has operations in Canada and globally, operating under two business lines: Canadian Insurance and International Insurance, providing a wide range of advice and solutions for individual and business clients including life, health, wealth, property & casualty, travel, group benefits, annuities, and reinsurance. In Canada, we offer our products and services through a wide variety of channels, comprised of mobile advisors, advice centres, RBC Insurance \u00ae stores, and digital platforms as well as through independent brokers and partners. Outside Canada, we operate in reinsurance and retrocession markets globally offering life, critical illness, disability and longevity reinsurance products. Non-interest income in Insurance is comprised of Insurance premiums, and investment and fee income.\n\nCapital Markets provides expertise in advisory & origination, sales & trading, lending & financing and transaction banking to corporations, institutional clients, asset managers, private equity firms and governments globally in our two main business lines: Corporate & Investment Banking and Global Markets. In North America, we offer a full suite of products and services which include equity and debt origination and distribution, advisory services, and sales & trading. Outside North America, we have a targeted strategic presence in the U.K. & Europe, Australia, Asia & other markets aligned to our global expertise. In the U.K. & Europe, we offer a diversified set of capabilities in key industry sectors of focus. In Australia and Asia, we compete with global and regional investment banks in targeted areas aligned to our global expertise, including fixed income distribution and currencies trading, secured financing, as well as corporate and investment banking. Non-interest income in Capital Markets mainly includes Trading revenue, Underwriting and other advisory fees and Credit fees.\n\nAll other enterprise level activities that are not allocated to these four business segments, such as certain treasury and liquidity management activities, including amounts associated with unattributed capital, and consolidation adjustments, including the elimination of the Taxable equivalent basis (Teb) gross-up amounts, are included in Corporate Support. Teb adjustments gross up income from certain tax-advantaged sources from Canadian taxable corporate dividends and U.S. tax credit investments recorded in Capital Markets to their effective tax equivalent value with the corresponding offset recorded in the provision for income taxes. Management believes that these Teb adjustments are necessary for Capital Markets to reflect how it is managed and enhances the comparability of revenue across our taxable and tax-advantaged sources. Our use of Teb adjustments may not be comparable to similarly adjusted amounts at other financial institutions. The Teb adjustment for the year ended October 31, 2023 was $559 million (October 31, 2022 - $572 million). Gains (losses) on economic hedges of our U.S. Wealth Management (including City National) share-based compensation plans, which are reflected in revenue, and related variability in share-based compensation expense driven by changes in the fair value of liabilities relating to these plans are also included in Corporate Support as this presentation more closely aligns with how we view business performance and manage the underlying risks.\n\n## Geographic segments\n\nFor geographic reporting, our segments are grouped into Canada, the U.S. and Other International. Transactions are primarily recorded in the location that best reflects the risk due to negative changes in economic conditions and prospects for growth due to positive economic changes. This location frequently corresponds with the location of the legal entity through which the business is conducted and the location of our clients. Transactions are recorded in the local currency and are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations with respect to the movement in the Canadian dollar.\n\n## Management reporting framework\n\nOur management reporting framework is intended to measure the performance of each business segment as if it were a standalone business and reflects the way that the business segment is managed. This approach is intended to ensure that our business segments' results include all applicable revenue and expenses associated with the conduct of their business and depicts how management views those results. We regularly monitor these segment results for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. These items do not impact our consolidated results.",

        "page_content": "The expenses in each business segment may include costs or services directly incurred or provided on their behalf at the enterprise level. For other costs not directly attributable to one of our business segments, we use a management reporting framework that uses assumptions and methodologies for allocating overhead costs and indirect expenses to our business segments and that assists in the attribution of capital and the transfer pricing of funds to our business segments in a manner that consistently measures and aligns the economic costs with the underlying benefits and risks of that specific business segment. Activities and business conducted between our business segments are generally at market rates. All other enterprise level activities that are not allocated to our four business segments are reported under Corporate Support.\n\nOur assumptions and methodologies used in our management reporting framework are periodically reviewed by us to ensure that they remain valid. The capital attribution methodologies involve a number of assumptions that are revised periodically.\n\n|                                                                   | For the year ended October 31, 2023   | For the year ended October 31, 2023   | For the year ended October 31, 2023   | For the year ended October 31, 2023   | For the year ended October 31, 2023   | For the year ended October 31, 2023                     | For the year ended October 31, 2023   | For the year ended October 31, 2023   | For the year ended October 31, 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)                                    | Personal &   Commercial   Banking     | Wealth   Management   Insurance       |                                       | Capital   Markets  (1)                | Corporate   Support  (1)              | Total                                                   | Canada                                | United   States                       | Other   International                 |\n| Net interest income (2)                                           | $ 16,074  $                           | 4,495  $                              |                                       | -

and Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) ratios for deposittaking institutions in Canada. We are required to calculate our capital ratios using the Basel III framework. Under Basel III, regulatory capital includes Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital mainly consists of common shares, retained earnings and other components of equity. Regulatory adjustments under Basel III include deductions of goodwill and other intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, defined benefit pension fund assets, investments in banking, financial and insurance entities, the shortfall of provisions to expected losses, prudential valuation adjustments, prepaid portfolio insurance assets, non payment and non delivery of trades and equity investment in funds subject to the fall-back approach. Tier 1 capital comprises predominantly CET1 and Additional Tier 1 items including non-cumulative preferred shares and LRCNs that meet certain criteria. Tier 2 capital includes subordinated debentures that meet certain criteria, certain loan loss allowances and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries' Tier 2 instruments. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. External TLAC instruments comprise predominantly senior bail-in debt, which includes eligible senior unsecured debt with an original term to maturity of greater than 400 days and remaining term to maturity of greater than 365 days. TLAC available is defined as the sum of Total capital and external TLAC instruments.\n\nRegulatory capital ratios are calculated by dividing CET1, Tier 1, Total capital and TLAC available by risk-weighted assets. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by an exposure measure. The exposure measure consists of total assets (excluding items deducted from Tier 1 capital) and certain off-balance sheet items converted into credit exposure equivalents. Adjustments are also made to derivatives and secured financing transactions to reflect credit and other risks. The TLAC leverage ratio is calculated by dividing TLAC available by the leverage ratio exposure.",

For derivative contracts and repurchase and reverse repurchase arrangements, this is generally achieved when there is a market mechanism for settlement (e.g., central counterparty exchange or clearing house) which provides daily net settlement of cash flows arising from these contracts. Margin receivables and margin payables are generally offset as they settle simultaneously through a market settlement mechanism.\n\nAmounts that do not qualify for offsetting include master netting arrangements that only permit outstanding transactions with the same counterparty to be offset in an event of default or occurrence of other predetermined events. Such master netting arrangements include the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreement or certain derivative exchange or clearing counterparty agreements for derivative contracts, global master repurchase agreement and global master securities lending agreements for repurchase, reverse repurchase and other similar secured lending and borrowing arrangements.\n\nThe amount of financial collateral received or pledged subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements that do not qualify for offsetting refers to the collateral received or pledged to cover the net exposure between counterparties by enabling the collateral to be realized in an event of default or the occurrence of other predetermined events. Certain amounts of collateral are restricted from being sold or re-pledged unless there is an event of default or the occurrence of other predetermined events.",

As warranted, we manage the liquidity risk of various products based on historical behavioural patterns that are often not aligned with contractual maturities.
