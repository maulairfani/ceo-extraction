This has enabled it to distinguish itself through remarkable performance and social commitment. This resilience is built on the many qualities undergirding our business model. It relies above all on the people who make up Air Liquide. I would like to express my immense pride to each and every one of them.\n\nThe individual and collective contributions of our employees are all the more admirable given the simultaneous challenges facing our environment, and thus the Group, such as climate change, geopolitical tensions, inflation and rising energy prices. Their commitment has helped us move forward and, thanks to unique innovation capacities, lead the way in many areas, from the energy transition - particularly in the fields of hydrogen and carbon capture - to creating value in healthcare with more personalized solutions, and\n\n## \u00ab The future will bring unprecedented opportunities.\n\nI firmly believe that our Group will seize these opportunities with determination and boldness. \u00bb\n\nbolstering our leadership in electronics. At the same time, we have continued to support progress in a wide range of industrial sectors, such as chemicals, glass and food, where our low-carbon solutions are making a difference. We have also paved the way for new markets, such as metal 3D printing or electric batteries.\n\nAnother reason for our satisfaction is the efficient and fully operational collaboration between the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee since our new governance structure was introduced in 2022. The partial replacement of the Board of Directors through the appointment of new independent directors strengthened our Group's positive momentum. With the wide-ranging expertise of its members, the collegial nature of its deliberations, and the diverse views and opinions it represents, the Board provides the Group's executive management and Executive Committee with an enlightened and informed view of the economy, the world and its prospects.\n\nThe future will undoubtedly be full of challenges as well as unprecedented opportunities. I firmly believe that our Group will seize these opportunities with determination and boldness. Our ability to plan for the future, the commitment of our teams around the world, our close relationship with our customers and patients, and the full confidence of our Shareholders make me more confident than ever. The Board of Directors and I have faith in the Group's ability to grow and progress every day, thanks to the commitment of each and every employee, as we continue to invent the future.",

How would you describe the Group's performance?\n\n2023 was another year of solid performance for Air Liquide! Once again, this reflects the resilience and quality of our business model, along with our teams' remarkable dedication. Despite the continued complexity of the global environment, all indicators are positive: sales growth increased by +3.7% (1) , revenue reached 27.61 billion euros, our operating margin increased to reach 18.4%, recurring net profit (2) rose by +13.3% (3) and investment decisions reached their highest level, amounting to 4.3 billion euros in 2023.\n\nThis gives us confidence in our ADVANCE strategy to such an extent that we have decided to go further by doubling our initial ambition for improving the Group's operating margin. In two years, we have almost achieved our initial ambition, which was an increase in operating margin of +160 basis points. Consequently, we are going to double our ambition for the duration of the plan to reach +320 basis points (that is +3.20%) in four years. We are also maintaining our other financial objectives for sales growth and return on capital employed, along with our target in terms of investment decisions.\n\nLikewise, from an extra-financial standpoint, thanks to our numerous decarbonization initiatives, we are confident in our ability to combine growth in our business with a reduction in our CO2 emissions in absolute value from 2025.\n\nIn short, I would say that the Group's performance in 2023 confirms the relevance of our ADVANCE strategic plan and our teams' ability to provide our customers with specific solutions with high added value to address their challenges, both now and in the future.",

        "page_content": "## \u00ab What all our developments have in common is their impact and their contribution to society.\n\nThat is what our innovative approach, which we are constantly developing, is all about. \u00bb\n\n## The decarbonization of industry is a hot topic right now and you have announced a number of related projects. How would you assess the Group's action in this area?\n\nDecarbonization, both ours and that of our customers, is at the heart of our strategy. I strongly believe that the Group can be a driving force in the creation of a low-carbon industry. This challenge is now a global priority and we are having a tangible impact, thanks to our portfolio of technological solutions and services. Our partnerships with industry giants in Europe, where projects are rapidly gaining momentum, are proof of this.\n\nFor instance, our agreement with TotalEnergies to provide their Gonfreville refinery in Normandy with renewable and low-carbon hydrogen is an example of the development of a sustainable hydrogen industry to decarbonize the entire industrial basin in Normandy. The renewable hydrogen that will be supplied will be produced by our PEM (4) electrolyzer, Air Liquide Normand'Hy, the largest electrolyzer ever built, and will feature latest-generation equipment manufactured by our Berlin gigafactory, a joint venture with Siemens Energy. In the Netherlands, we are involved in major electrolyzer projects that are supported by the government and we are also going to develop a large-scale CO \u2082 capture unit on our hydrogen plant in Rotterdam. These developments will make a significant contribution to the decarbonization of industry in the Netherlands and neighboring countries.\n\nThings are also gathering pace in the United States. We are thrilled to have been chosen by the American Department of Energy as a strategic partner of six out of seven regional hydrogen hubs. Our solutions are making a difference in Asia as well. In Japan, our autothermal reforming technology has been chosen for a pilot project for the large-scale production of low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia. We are also working with ENEOS, Japan's leading energy company, to develop the low-carbon hydrogen market; this partnership will cover the entire hydrogen value chain.\n\nAlthough these projects underline hydrogen's key role in decarbonizing the industry, the solution will lie in a combination of different options. As such, we use other technologies to help our customers on their decarbonization journeys, including oxy-combustion, biomethane and carbon capture with our Cryocap\u2122 solution. Indeed, Holcim has chosen this technology; we are going to work with the company to decarbonize their new cement plant in Belgium.\n\nWe owe this major and tangible progress to the efficiency of our technologies, our ability to devise and provide innovative solutions for our customers and our ability to bring together key players for large-scale, forward-looking projects. Because today, it is clear that we must work with industry as a whole and with the support of government authorities to collectively develop integrated ecosystems to accelerate the energy transition.\n\n## Innovation is at the heart of the ADVANCE program. What progress has been made in this field?\n\nInnovation has always been part of our DNA, from technology to the way we act and serve our customers. In practice, this has led to significant progress in growth markets this year, including semiconductors, with investments in new manufacturing centers for advanced materials in Taiwan and South Korea. These new production capacities will support the acceleration in the manufacture of high-tech chips. These chips are vital for next-generation electronics applications in artificial intelligence, the automotive industry and cloud computing (5) .\n\n2023 also saw many innovations in terms of mobility. For instance, we launched new joint ventures with Groupe ADP and TotalEnergies that will help accelerate the development of hydrogen, from airport infrastructure to heavy vehicles. But I am also thinking of our industrial customers, be they traditional or positioned in new markets, such as the food, glass and metal industries. We supply them with innovative solutions with a reduced carbon footprint that enable them to reduce their CO2 emissions.",

We have launched a new service so that hospitals no longer need to manage their supply of medical gases. The aim is to enable staff to focus more on patient care. This approach was inspired by the personalized care pathways for patients treated at home that was launched in 2021 and that we are continuing to develop.\n\nWhat all these developments have in common is their impact and their contribution to society. That is what our innovative approach, which we are constantly developing, is all about.\n\n## In a few months, France will welcome the world for the Olympic and Paralympic Games Paris 2024. Air Liquide is an Official Supporter of this event for hydrogen. What is the reasoning behind this partnership?\n\nIn addition to the similarities between our values and those of Paris 2024, this is a particularly significant partnership because we can draw on our expertise to provide the event with decarbonized mobility solutions. We are going to provide hydrogen of renewable origin to power several hundred Toyota Mirai cars that will make up part of the Games' official fleet. This is a real source of pride for me and our teams because these cars will contribute to a reduction in carbon emissions during this major sporting event. I firmly believe that this real-world use of hydrogen for mobility at an event of this magnitude will be a powerful force for accelerating the sustainable decarbonization of transport, creating longterm infrastructure and uses beyond Paris 2024. Acting as a champion of climate solutions means providing support for the ambitious environmental objectives of major events like the Olympic and Paralympic Games Paris 2024. I would like to commend the work of our teams, who are committed to ensuring that this partnership is a collective victory!\n\nLastly, this partnership is about more than just climate it is also about embodying the values of diversity and inclusion that are so important to us. As such, the Group is supporting at least 6 athletes and para-athletes in their bid to qualify for the Olympic and Paralympic Games Paris 2024. We are very proud to support them and their endeavors and we wish them every success!\n\n## What is your outlook for 2024?\n\nThe world has never faced so many challenges. From sovereignty to security, from climate change to energy independence and demographic shifts, we must contend with this new, uncertain world, just as our customers are doing. As is the case with any challenge, there are opportunities. Indeed, there have never been so many opportunities and we must seize them. We must work together to perform better than ever and ensure we have the means to respond effectively to the major challenges of the energy transition, changing healthcare systems and global competition in high-tech development. As the Group's expertise has never been more pertinent to address global challenges, this is also a unique opportunity to improve existing services and offerings and develop new ones, as we always have, so we can provide the world with tangible and practical solutions. Although the short-term future will undoubtedly have its share of surprises, I feel confident and energized because I know that I can count on truly extraordinary teams. They and I are more committed than ever to serve our customers and patients and, in so doing, provide useful and tangible solutions to create a more sustainable world.",

This  was  one  of  the  reasons  why Air Liquide set its sites internationally early on, building numerous production  units  abroad.  Development  was  rapid  in  Europe (1906),  Japan  (1907),  Canada  (1911)  and  the  United  States (1916).\n\n## LISTING ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE\n\nThe  critical  role  played  by  Shareholders  became  evident  in  the first  years  of  the  Company's  development.  Listed  on  the  Paris Stock Exchange in 1913, the share celebrated its hundredth year of  listing  in  2013.  During  these  100  years,  Air  Liquide  has endeavored to forge a strong and privileged relationship with its Shareholders  based  on  exceptional  stock  market  performance, with an average annual increase in its share price of +11.9%.\n\n## REVOLUTIONARY DISTRIBUTION METHODS\n\nIn  the  1950s  Air  Liquide  put  in  place  new  ways  to  distribute industrial gases.\n\nStoring gas in liquid form in cryogenic tanks allows vast quantities to be transported by road or rail within a radius of approximately 200-250 km from the production site.\n\nBy  delivering  gas  to  several  customers  through  pipelines, Air Liquide adopted a network strategy for the first time, linking its gas  production  units  to  one  another.  The  Group  increased  its production capacity to meet soaring demand from large industries: firstly, for oxygen in the steel industry, and secondly, for nitrogen in  chemicals.  This  marked  the  start-up  of  the  Large  Industries business.\n\n## 1960-2000\n\n## SPACE INDUSTRY\n\nConvinced of the industrial potential of cryogenics, Jean Delorme, Chairman  &  CEO  of  Air  Liquide,  decided  to  create  a  research center dedicated to these technologies. This center was founded in  1962  near  Grenoble  in  France.  The  first  applications  were rapidly integrated in the space industry and ever since Air Liquide has been a key partner of the space adventure.\n\n## A TRADITION OF INVENTIONS\n\nThe  Claude  Delorme  Research  Center,  located  on  the  Saclay plateau and now called the Innovation Campus Paris, was created in 1970. The research center's work is focused on enhancing gas production  technologies  and  their  applications.  It  is  evidence  of the Group's desire to better understand the industrial processes of its  customers and develop new gas applications to better satisfy their requirements.  Today,  the  Group  also  has  Innovation Campuses  in  Europe  (Germany,  France),  North America  (USA) and Asia (China, Japan).\n\n## A NEW MARKET: ELECTRONICS\n\nIn  Japan,  the  Group  began  in  1985  to  supply  ultra-high  purity gases to the semiconductor industry: this involves carrier gases, mainly nitrogen, used to transport the specialty gases and keep the chip production tools inert, and specialty gases that are used directly in the  manufacturing  of  semiconductors.  In  1987, Air  Liquide  inaugurated  the Tsukuba  Research  Center  in  Japan, which is dedicated to the electronics industry.\n\n## MAJOR ACQUISITION\n\nThe  Group  acquired  Big  Three  in  the  United  States  in  1986,  a Large Industries business with a significant pipeline network along the Gulf Coast.\n\n## EXTENDED OFFERING: HYDROGEN AND STEAM\n\nIn  addition  to  oxygen  and  nitrogen,  Air  Liquide  extended  its offering to hydrogen and steam in the 90s. To ensure the success of this new offering, the Group used its business model, which is behind the success of its air gas business, and deployed from the beginning a basin strategy.\n\n## HEALTHCARE\n\nOriginally  an  oxygen supplier to hospitals, Air Liquide became a specialist in the healthcare sector. The Group launched its Home Healthcare business in the 1990' and set up a dedicated network of  specialist  teams.  Medical  gases  were  progressively  classified as  drugs  and  manufacturers  were  required  to  file  market authorizations.  The  Group  also  launched  research  programs  in therapeutic gases, used for resuscitation and pain relief.",

        "page_content": "## 2000-2020\n\n## INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION\n\nThe  Group  invested  massively  in  China  in  the  early  2000s;  the country has been a major growth market for industrial gases and Air Liquide entered into numerous air gas contracts.\n\nThe  Group  acquired  part  of  Messer  Griesheim's  activities  in Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n## ORGANIZATION BY BUSINESS LINE\n\nThe Air Liquide growth drivers for the coming decades are based on changing lifestyles: industrial growth of developing economies, increasing energy needs and environmental challenges, healthcare and high technology. To capture this growth, the Group created  a  new  organizational  structure  based  on  four  World Business  Lines.  They  combine  the  technical  and  operational expertise  which  are  specific  to  each  of  the  businesses  of  the Group  -  Large  Industries,  Industrial  Merchant,  Healthcare  and Electronics - and centralize the specific market expertise.\n\nConscious of the strategic dimension of Engineering & Construction capabilities, the Group acquired Lurgi in 2007. This company provides Air Liquide with major proprietary technologies, notably hydrogen and carbon monoxide production units, adding to the Group's historical competencies in cryogenics.\n\n## RESILIENCE IN AN UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS\n\nAffected by a global economic crisis of unprecedented magnitude in 2008  and  2009,  the  Group  focused  its  efforts  on  the management  of  its  cash,  costs,  and  investments  (capital expenditures). Having tested the solidity of its long-term contracts, Air  Liquide  demonstrated  the  relevance  and  resilience  of  its business  model.  In  a  context  of  global  recession,  the  Group showed itself to be an exception, posting a stable net profit while preserving the strength of its balance sheet.\n\n## INNOVATION AND HYDROGEN\n\nInnovation is central to Air Liquide's strategy. In 2013, Air Liquide launched  two  initiatives  to  promote  open  innovation:  i-LAB (innovation Lab) and ALIAD, the Group's capital venture entity to take  minority  investments  in  innovative  technology  start-ups.  In 2014,  the  Group  decided  on  new  investments  such  as  the modernization  of  the  Research  Center  near  Versailles,  on  the Saclay plateau, and the launch of a technical center of excellence for cryogenic production technologies.\n\nIn addition, on a worldwide scale, Air Liquide actively contributes to the development of the hydrogen energy activity by supporting automotive manufacturers launching Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles on the market. Air Liquide contributes to the construction of hydrogen refueling  stations  (United  States,  Japan,  France,  Germany, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Korea, China, etc.).\n\n## AIRGAS ACQUISITION BY AIR LIQUIDE AND NEOS PROGRAM\n\nOn  May  23,  2016,  Air  Liquide  completed  the  acquisition  of  the American  company  Airgas  and  took  a  new  dimension.  This acquisition was complementary to the Group's businesses in the United  States  and  enabled Air  Liquide  to  be  present  across  all market  segments  both  upstream  of  and  downstream  to  the  US market; this integration has created significant value.\n\nIn addition to the 300 million US dollars of synergies targeted by the  Group  through  this  acquisition, Air  Liquide  believes  that  the Airgas model, in terms of products, digitization of businesses, and business model, may be applied outside the United States.\n\nWith  this  acquisition,  Air  Liquide  strengthens  its  position  in  the United  States,  the  largest  industrial  gas  market  worldwide.  This market  also  enjoys  the  strongest  growth  among  advanced economies.\n\nFollowing this acquisition Air Liquide published its new mid-term Company  program,  NEOS,  on  July  6,  2016.  Its  strategy  for profitable growth over the long term is that of a customer-centric transformation.  It  is  based  on  operational  excellence  and  the quality  of  its  investments,  on  open  innovation  and  the  network organization already implemented by the Group worldwide.\n\n## CREATION OF THE GLOBAL MARKETS & TECHNOLOGIES BUSINESS\n\nTo  step  up  the  development  of  offerings  in  new  markets,  the Group  created  in  2016  the  Global  Markets  &  Technologies business, responsible for developing new activities in the field of energy transition and deep tech, by leveraging technologies.\n\n## REFOCUSING ON GAS & SERVICES BUSINESSES\n\nFollowing the divestiture of its Aqua Lung (diving) and Air Liquide Welding (welding) subsidiaries in 2017, Air Liquide focused on its Gas & Services businesses. After these divestitures, the share of Gas & Services revenue in Group sales increased from 90% in 2015 to 96% in 2018.\n\n## ENERGY TRANSITION AND CLIMATE OBJECTIVES\n\nFor  many  years  now,  Air  Liquide  has  been  committed  to sustainable growth aimed, in particular, at limiting its CO2 emissions and  those  of  its  customers.  On  November  30,  2018,  Air  Liquide announced its climate objectives, in particular a 30% reduction in its carbon intensity between 2015 and 2025, with a global approach that includes its assets, its customers, and its ecosystems. These objectives are the most ambitious in the sector and are in line with the NEOS company program. In this respect, the Global Markets & Technologies  activity  is  stepping  up  sales  to  energy  transitionrelated  markets,  driven  by  the  biomethane  sector  and  the  first developments in the hydrogen mobility.\n\n## FINALIZATION OF THE INTEGRATION OF AIRGAS AND STRENGTHENING OF THE GROUP'S EFFICIENCY PROGRAM\n\nAt  the  beginning  of  2019,  Air  Liquide  reached  its  target  of 300  million  US  dollars  in  synergies,  thanks  to  the  integration  of Airgas,  more  than  a  year  before  initially  planned.  With  the integration complete, Airgas joined the Group's efficiency program and  contributes  to  increasing  the  annual  target  for  efficiencies. The Group efficiencies target was initially set at 300 million euros and was revised up, to more than 400 million euros, as of 2019. Moreover, a program aimed at promoting the sharing of the Airgas model  has  allowed  close  to  100  Group  managers  to  immerse themselves in Airgas operations, and to step up the sharing of its best practices with other Group regions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group invested in a hydrogen production and liquefaction unit for the west coast of the United States and worked with its Steel customers to decarbonize steel production using hydrogen.\n\n## 2020-2023\n\n## MOBILIZATION OF THE GROUP AGAINST COVID-19\n\nThe  Healthcare  teams  were  highly  mobilized  to  cope  with  the increasing demand for medical oxygen, supply equipment such as ventilators  for  hospitals,  ensure  stabilized  patients  can  return home and guarantee chronic patients are continually monitored.\n\nIn a context of global health and economic crisis, the Group has once again proven its resilience. This crisis has also highlighted the contribution of the Group's activities to society as well as the commitment of its employees.\n\n## ACT FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE\n\nIn  March  2021,  the  Group  strengthened  all  of  its  sustainable development goals by detailing them around three axes.\n\nFirst,  to  ACT  for  a  low-carbon  society,  in  line  with  the  Paris Agreement, by setting a target of carbon neutrality by 2050, with two major  intermediate  steps:  the  start  of  the  reduction  of  its  CO2\n\nemissions in absolute value around 2025 and a -33% decrease in its CO2 emissions from Scopes 1 and 2 by 2035 compared to 2020. Air  Liquide  acted  for  climate  in  2021,  by  initiating  projects  and partnerships  for  the  decarbonization  of  industrial  and  mobility activities,  and  by  announcing  its  participation  in  the  largest  fund dedicated to clean hydrogen infrastructure. The Group also acquired Sasol air separation units in South Africa and a TotalEnergies steam methane reformer in France while committing to a very significant decrease of their CO2 emissions.\n\nSecond,  CARE  for  patients  by  improving  the  quality  of  life  of patients with chronic  diseases  in  mature  economies  and facilitating  access  to  medical  oxygen  in  low-  and  middle-income countries. Already in place in Senegal, the initiative allows access to  medical  oxygen  to  rural  communities  and  its  deployment  has started in South Africa.\n\nAnd third, TRUST as the base to engage with employees and to build the best-in-class governance.\n\n## LAUNCH OF THE NEW STRATEGIC PLAN: ADVANCE\n\nIn  March 2022, Air Liquide presented ADVANCE (see page 38), its new strategic plan for 2025. It placed sustainable development at  the  heart  of  its  strategy  and  combined  financial  and  extrafinancial  performance.  With  a  strong  business  model  which  has proven  its  resilience,  with  its  innovation  capacity  and  its technological know-how, the Group is particularly well positioned to  continue  its  growth  trajectory  while  contributing  to  respond efficiently to major economic,  environmental  and  societal challenges.",

Description of activities\n\nThe  Group  classifies  its  activities  as  follows:  Gas  &  Services, Engineering & Construction, Global Markets & Technologies, and all  serve  one  unique business, that of industrial gases. The four business  lines  comprising  the  Gas  &  Services  activities  are closely tied by a strong industrial mindset where proximity is key. The diagram on page 25 illustrates the sharing of production or distribution assets between the different business lines for a given geographic  region.  This  efficient  industrial  network  and  its proximity with its customers allow Air Liquide to:\n\n- \u25a0 improve reliability;\n- \u25a0 optimize energy consumption, costs and logistics flow;\n- \u25a0 anticipate customers' needs;\n- \u25a0 understand changes in the markets;\n- \u25a0 and offer innovative solutions.\n\nThe synergies enjoyed by all of the Group's businesses are not limited  to  the  industrial  aspect,  but  also  include  scientific  and technological  expertise,  the  innovation  approach,  as  well  as Human  Resources  and  financial  management.  The  strong integration  of  the  various  World  Business  Lines  thus  allows  the Group  to  create  synergies,  become  stronger  and  to  grow  while creating long-term value.\n\n## 2023 GROUP REVENUE BY ACTIVITY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.1.

Therefore,  Air  Liquide  gas  production  units  are  located throughout  the  world  and  can  supply  many  types  of  customers and  industries  with  the  relevant  volumes  and  services  required. Air  Liquide's  structure  is  made  up  of  a  base,  in  Paris,  and  four hubs: Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East and Africa. These hubs draw on the Group's expertise and presence in these geographic regions.\n\n- Large Industries supplies industrial gases by operating major production units. It serves customers in the metals, chemicals, refining and energy sectors where high gas volumes call for a dedicated  plant  or  the  development  of  a  pipeline  network. Large Industries also supplies the Group's other business lines with  gases  which  are  then  packaged  and  delivered  to  their respective customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25a0 Industrial Merchant supplies a wide range of different gases, application  equipment  and  associated  services.  It  serves industries  and  professionals  that  require  smaller  quantities than  Large  Industries'  customers.  Gas  can  be  distributed  in bulk, in liquid form, or in cylinders, in gaseous form, for smaller quantities.  Finally,  small  production  units  can  be  installed locally for customers with larger gas needs, or in remote areas.\n- Healthcare supplies  medical  gases,  equipment  and  services to hospitals and also directly to patients in their homes. It also produces  and  distributes  healthcare  specialty  ingredients  for the cosmetics, pharmaceutical, vaccine and nutrition markets.\n- Electronics supplies  gases,  materials  (complex  molecules) used  in  manufacturing  processes,  as  well  as  equipment  and services mainly used for the production of semiconductors, but also flat screens and photovoltaic panels.",

Business overview\n\nThe  Large  Industries  business  line  supplies  gas  and  energy solutions  to  customers  in  the  metals,  chemicals,  refining  and energy  industries,  which  are  essential  for  their  own  core businesses,  to  improve  process  efficiency  and  to  make  their plants  more  environmentally  friendly.  The  Large  Industries business  line  provides  oxygen,  nitrogen,  argon,  hydrogen  and carbon monoxide through its plants and its pipeline network. The Group also operates cogeneration plants to supply customers with steam and electricity.\n\nThe world leader in this sector, Air Liquide benefits from dedicated in-house  development  and  engineering  teams,  differentiating proprietary  technologies  and  rigorous  processes  for  selecting investments  and  carrying  out  projects.  The  largest  Large Industries  customers  are  looked  after  by  key  account  managers who have in-depth knowledge of customers' businesses, as well as of their projects, industrial processes and global structure. This allows  Large  Industries  to  maintain  close  contact  with  its customers,  thus  improving  the  Group's  responsiveness  and competitiveness in terms of meeting their needs.\n\n## 2023 LARGE INDUSTRIES REVENUE BY PRODUCT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 30% of Gas & Services revenue. *\n\n## b. Business model\n\nThe supply of gas is generally contracted for 15 years. For certain projects,  this  can  be  extended  to  20  years  and  beyond.  The signing  of  new  contracts  for  new  industrial  customers'  sites  is  a strong  predictor  of  future  growth.  Within  these  contracts,  the Group guarantees long-term service continuity and a high level of reliability  with  respect  to  the  gas  supply  via  a  high-performing industrial  solution.  In  return,  long-term  gas  supply  contracts include guaranteed  minimum  volumes  through  take-or-pay clauses,  as  well  as  the  indexation  to  variable  costs  (mainly  for electricity and natural gas) and to inflation.\n\nThe  use  of  industrial  gases  is  critical  for  the  various  industrial processes of Large Industries' customers. As any discontinuity in supply translates into an interruption of the customer's production operations,  supply  reliability  and  safety  are  crucial.  However, although vital, gas supply generally represents a very small part of total production cost for the customer.\n\nThe  Large  Industries  are  at  the  heart  of  the  energy  transition, which creates major growth opportunities with the supply of lowcarbon gases as well as new modes of process and solutions for the customers' CO2 emissions reduction.\n\n## c. Large Industries industrial processes\n\nThe raw materials necessary for the production of industrial gases vary  according  to  the  type  of  gas  and  the  location  of  the production unit. The production of oxygen and nitrogen requires air and a large quantity of electricity. Cogeneration units consume natural gas and water. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide production units mainly consume natural gas and little electricity. In 2021, the Group also inaugurated the world's largest electrolysis  facility  in Canada  that  uses  water  and  renewable  hydroelectricity  to produce low-carbon hydrogen. The energy and capital intensity of these industrial processes is generally high.\n\n## Air gases production (ASU: Air Separation Unit)\n\nAn Air Separation Unit (ASU) compresses, liquefies and distills air in order to separate it into its different components: 78% nitrogen, 21%  oxygen,  1%  argon  and  noble  gases  (neon,  krypton  and xenon). Only certain large ASUs can produce noble gases. The ASUs  do  not  emit  directly  CO2  but  electricity  consumption  is significant. A simplified diagram of an ASU operation is presented on page 35.\n\n## Hydrogen and carbon monoxide production through steam reforming (SMR: Steam Methane Reformer)\n\nBy steam reforming natural gas, an SMR produces hydrogen and carbon  monoxide.  The  most  significant  raw  material  is  natural gas;  electricity  and  water  consumption  is  modest.  A  simplified diagram  of  hydrogen  production  by  reforming  is  presented  on page  36.  Air  Liquide  has  developed  a  portfolio  of  CO2  capture solutions  adapted  to  SMR,  allowing  to  very  significantly  reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Hydrogen production through electrolysis\n\nHydrogen  production  through  electrolysis  is  based  on  the dissociation of water molecules (H2O) using electricity, to extract hydrogen  and  oxygen  molecules.  This  process  produces hydrogen  without  using  or  emitting  carbon-based  molecules.  It can  be  used  to  produce  low-carbon  hydrogen  for  industry  and mobility,  as  well  as  for  energy  storage.  A  simplified  diagram  of hydrogen production through electrolysis is presented on page 35.\n\n## Cogeneration\n\nCogeneration consists of simultaneously and efficiently producing electricity  and  steam  generally  by  consuming  natural  gas  and water. The electricity is used by an Air Liquide plant or sold on the local  network.  The  steam  is  required  for  certain  industrial processes. This type of units directly emits CO2.",

Based  on  cryogenic  distillation, adsorption, absorption, or separation membranes, these technologies are used to capture the carbon dioxide generated by Air Liquide's industrial  processes and those of its customers. Air Liquide proposes to its customers CO2 capture as a service on a typical Large Industries  contract  basis.  These  solutions  can  be  installed,  for  example,  at  hydrogen  production  units,  petrochemical  facilities,  or cement plants. Captured carbon dioxide is then permanently sequestered in a geological storage or used in the customer's processes, such as the treatment of alkaline water, or used by Industrial Merchant customers, to produce carbonated beverages, to package food in a protective atmosphere, or to prepare welding gas mixtures.\n\n## 2.

CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS\n\nThe  chemicals  industry uses  mainly  oxygen,  hydrogen  and carbon  monoxide  in  its  manufacturing  processes,  as  well  as nitrogen to inert its installations.\n\nThe refining industry requires hydrogen to desulfurize fuels and crack heavy hydrocarbons. The demand for hydrogen is growing steadily  due  to  more  stringent  legislation  aimed  at  reducing emissions  and  the  use  of  increasingly  heavier  hydrocarbons  in fuel production.\n\nIn  the  metals  industry, Air  Liquide  supplies  large  volumes  of oxygen to steel producers notably, the use of which improves their energy performance and reduces significantly their CO2 emissions. The majority  of  new  projects  are  currently  located  in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY POINTS\n\nThe Large  Industries business  line  depends  on  long-term  contracts  (15  to  20  years)  which  include  take-or-pay  clauses,  offer considerable  visibility  of  future  revenue  and  protection  in  the  event  of  a  significant  fall  in  customer  volume  consumption  (below  the minimum take-or-pay level). Sales prices in Large Industries contracts are indexed, in particular, to energy and inflation costs. The long investment cycle and high capital intensity require a solid balance sheet. The signing of new contracts is a strong predictor of future growth.\n\nAir Liquide is developing a pipeline network strategy in the industrial basins in order to provide customers with greater supply reliability while optimizing operating costs. This strategy allows to mutualize production assets and generate savings, notably on energy, on the overall Air Liquide network as well as for its customers.\n\nBy  developing  its  capacity  to  deliver  low-carbon  industrial  gases  to  its  clients  and  other  Group  businesses,  by  allowing  industrial processes decarbonization, and by offering carbon capture as a service, the Large Industries is crucial for the energy transition and the Group's decarbonization strategy.\n\ndeveloping  economies.  The  Group  is  also  partnering  with  steel industry  customers  to  develop  innovative  solutions  involving renewable or low-carbon hydrogen for Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) production plants and carbon capture technologies.\n\nNumerous  industries  linked  to  energy  or  chemicals  use  large quantities  of  oxygen  to  transform  coal,  natural  gas,  or  liquid hydrocarbons into syngas for the production of chemical products, synfuel, or electricity.\n\nTo  meet  customer  requirements,  the  supply  of  large  quantities  of gas is critical. Air Liquide supplies its customers directly by pipelines from  a  dedicated  plant  or  different  plants  linked  by  a  network. Air Liquide has built its pipeline networks progressively over the last 40  years.  With  a  total  length  of  more  than  9,700  kilometers (6,000 miles), these networks stretch, for example, across Northern Europe,  from  Rotterdam  through  to  Dunkirk,  and  along  the  Gulf Coast in the United States from Lake Charles (Louisiana) to Corpus Christi  (Texas)  as  well  as  along  the  Mississippi  river  in  Louisiana. Many other  mid-size  local  networks  have  also  been  built  in  other significant  and  fast-developing  industrial  basins  in  Germany,  Italy, Singapore, and, more recently, China.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Business overview\n\nThe  Industrial  Merchant  business  line  is,  by  its  nature,  a  highly local  business,  which  provides  more  than  two  million  customers with  industrial  gases,  equipment,  hardgoods,  and  associated services.\n\nIndustrial  Merchant  provides  gas  using  the  supply  mode  best adapted to customers' needs: either via a small on-site production unit  for  customers  with  major  volume  requirements,  or  in  liquid form  distributed  by  trucks  for  medium-scale  quantities,  or  in cylinders  for  smaller  volumes  and  use  on  construction  sites. Around  95%  of  Industrial  Merchant's  customer  base  is  small customers  who  favor  simplicity,  flexibility  and  quality  of  service: they mainly order cylinder gas and hardgoods.\n\nThe Industrial Merchant activity serves a wide variety of markets, often essential to life. It constantly invents new applications for its molecules  that  address  the  challenges  of  energy  transition  but also the challenges of new uses and markets and that contribute to  improving  the  operational  efficiency  of  its  customers.  The Industrial  Merchant  business  manages  a  significant  amount  of data  from  the  large  number  of  assets  used  in  operations  along with the diversity of markets and customers. Digital transformation and data analysis, therefore, play a predominant role in improving operational  efficiency,  price  management,  and  the  quality  of  the services provided to the customers.\n\n## 2023 INDUSTRIAL MERCHANT REVENUE BY END-MARKET\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * 45% of Gas & Services revenue.\n\n## b. Business model\n\nA large share of Industrial Merchant sales is covered by contracts with terms of up to five years for cylinders and liquid gas supply and  up  to  15  years  for  small  on-site  gas  generators.  These contracts  generally  include  gas  supply,  the  reliable  and  safe delivery of products and the provision by the Group of equipment at  customers'  sites,  the  provision  of  a  service,  as  well  as  the indexation of the sales price to different variables such as inflation and  energy  prices.  The  provision  of  cylinders  or  tanks  at\n\ncustomers'  sites  is  covered  by  a  fixed  monthly  fee.  The  wide range of markets, customers, and regions in which the Group is present reinforces the resilience of this business line.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Industrial  Merchant  (IM)  business  line  is  integrated  in  the industrial  basins  and  firmly grounded  in  local  economic  life. This  local  base  is  strengthened  by  economic  constraints  which limit the radius of gas distribution to some 250 kilometers around a production site. One of the strengths of Industrial Merchant is to be  able  to  identify  high-potential  areas  and  establish  a  site  by developing synergies with Large Industries'  network  of  plants  or by  investing  in  dedicated  units.  While  permeating  the  local economy, the Industrial Merchant business line has expanded its operations internationally in about 60 countries, thus strengthening the business line's resilience. This regional diversity is  based  on  a  strategy  of  targeted  investments  and  the  regular optimization of portfolios.\n\nA permanent focus on geographic density within the industrial basins  is  a  key  success  factor  thanks  to  the  synergies  that  this generates,  in  particular  in  terms  of  logistics.  In  addition  to  the business  development  of  a  basin,  the  acquisition  of  local distributors  and  their  portfolio  of  customers  also  helps  improve this density, in particular in markets that are still fairly fragmented such as the United States and China.\n\n## c. Supply methods\n\nOn  page  30,  the  diagram  shows  the  different supply  modes used  in  Industrial  Merchant .  Strong operational  discipline is applied  across  the  value  chain  (supply,  packaging,  distribution) and is an essential part of Air Liquide's integrated model. Coupled with  new  digital  tools  including  the  IBO  ('Integrated  Bulk Operations'),  this  allows  the  Group  to  optimize  the  use  of  its resources in real-time (plants, trucks, energy, etc.) to improve the competitiveness  of  its  products  and  services  for  customers  and reduce  its  CO2  emissions.  Air  Liquide's  quest  for  continuous improvement  helps  ensure  the  safety  of  its employees, customers,  and  service  providers  and  optimize  their  costs  while offering a seamless customer experience.",

Thanks in particular to the contributions  of  Airgas  in  terms  of  customer  culture  and excellence in operational service, Industrial Merchant continues to develop a multi-channel approach to sales which notably includes e-commerce  and  telesales  to  better  support  the  uses  of  its customers.\n\n## A MULTI-CHANNEL SALES APPROACH\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DATA AND DIGITAL WORKING FOR THE CUSTOMER AND IMPROVING GROUP PERFORMANCE\n\nThe Industrial Merchant business line manages a significant amount of data from the large number of assets used in operations and the diversity of markets and customers. Digital transformation and data analysis, therefore, play a predominant role in improving operational efficiency, the quality of the services provided to the customers, and new offerings. Thanks to this data analysis, the Industrial Merchant teams  are  able  to  drive  the  performance  of  operations  in  real-time  and  optimize  price  management  in  a  fair  and  dynamical  way depending on markets and costs. The digitalization of assets on customer sites also enables the uploading of utilization data, which is then analyzed to create new services, offerings, or business models.\n\n## b. A strategic positioning on markets with optimized product portfolios\n\nThanks to their proximity to customers and the Group's presence in a large number of markets, the Industrial Merchant teams foster a large and in-depth knowledge of the latter and of their industrial processes. Moreover, Air Liquide collects a large amount of data from these markets and the economy in general. This allows the Group  to  identify  major  trends,  assess  growth  prospects  and anticipate  future  opportunities.  By  closely  analyzing  this  market data and its value chains, the Group has developed a selective\n\napproach  and  dynamic  market  management to  focus  its resources on areas of higher potential growth. The diversity of the markets,  customers  and  geographical  regions  resulting  from strategic targeting strengthens the resilience of the business line.\n\nThe level  of  profitability  of  the  Industrial  Merchant  business  line varies according to product and supply mode. By optimizing this product mix , the business increases its profitability, captures new volumes and diversifies its customer base.\n\n<!-- image -->",

GLOBAL MARKETS & TECHNOLOGIES\n\nTo  accelerate  Air  Liquide's  sustainable  growth,  the  Global Markets  &  Technologies  (GM&T)  World  Business  Unit  delivers technological solutions - molecules, equipment and services - to support the dynamic markets of energy transition and deep tech .\n\nThe  GM&T  World  Business  Unit  invests  in  and  operates biomethane production units to recover agricultural, household or industrial  waste  as  part  of  a circular  economy  approach . Biomethane can be used to replace natural gas of fossil origin: in grids  for  domestic  use,  for  heavy  mobility  (trucks,  buses,  ships, etc.)  or  for  various  industrial  applications,  in  particular  the production of low-carbon hydrogen .\n\nIn hydrogen ,  Air  Liquide  masters  the  entire  supply  chain,  from production  to  storage,  to  distribution  and  the  development  of applications  for industrial  markets  and  heavy-duty  mobility . The Group thus contributes to the wider use of hydrogen as an energy  vector.  GM&T  designs  hydrogen  refueling  stations  to support  the  mobility.  To  date,  the  Group  has  assembled  and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY POINTS\n\nThe Global Markets & Technologies World  Business Unit relies on proprietary disruptive technologies to open up new deep tech markets and develop new business models within the fields of energy transition with a circular economy approach.\n\n## 3.3.  ENGINEERING & CONSTRUCTION\n\nTo provide customers with the gases required for their industrial production,  Air  Liquide  engineers  have  developed innovative proprietary  technologies .  The  Group  designs  and  constructs gas  production  units,  from  the  feasibility  study  stage  through  to the delivery of the complete installation, for its own use or for sale to  customers  who  prefer  to  insource  their  gas  requirements. These  units  comply  with  the  increasingly  strict  safety,  reliability and competitiveness requirements.\n\nEngineering  &  Construction  development  for industrial  gas , energy  conversion , gas purification and CO2  capture technologies, as well as renewable and low-carbon hydrogen , enable customers to optimize the use of natural resources.\n\nIn  particular,  Engineering  &  Construction  teams  are  already offering the customers, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors, a full range of carbon capture proprietary technologies that enable them to decarbonize their operations.\n\nTo  cover  all  of  the  primary  industrial  markets  and  manage  its production  costs,  the  Engineering  &  Construction  business  has extensive  geographical  coverage  with  engineering  centers  and manufacturing  workshops  located  mainly  in  North  America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY POINTS\n\nThe Engineering & Construction business provides the Group with a genuine competitive edge, enabling it to offer turnkey solutions to its customers and to engage for its own purposes in a process of continuous improvement of industrial processes, reduction in the cost of its industrial assets and of the environmental footprint.\n\nConsolidated Engineering & Construction sales only reflect sales to third parties and do not include internal sales for the needs of the Group or the Gas & Services businesses. In order to cover all the major industrial markets and control its production costs, it has an extensive  geographical  presence  with  engineering  centers  and  manufacturing  workshops  established  in  particular  in  North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\n\nThe Group favors the development of its gas sales business over  equipment  sales.  Nonetheless,  Engineering  &  Construction has a strategic value for the Group, both internally and externally.\n\nInternally, the Group benefits from the strong competencies and engineering resources required for investment projects of its Gas &  Services  businesses.  It  provides  a  high  level  of expertise , crucial to the design of efficient units which specifically respond to the needs of the Group's Gas & Services customers.\n\nThe Engineering & Construction business also serves third-party customers , allowing  the  Group  to  constantly  assess  the competitiveness of its own technologies and commercial offering. In particular, Air Liquide is hence able to forge close relations with customers who produce their own gas and better understand their industrial  processes  and  investment  projects.  In  certain  cases, negotiations  initially  steered  toward  the  sale  of  equipment  were finalized  by  the  signing  of  a  long-term  industrial  gas  supply contract.  As  part  of  this  third-party  customer  business,  the strategy  consists  of  favoring  research  and  equipment  supply contracts  and  not  tolerating  construction  risks.  Accordingly, Engineering & Construction's contribution to consolidated revenue (sales  to  third-party  customers)  can  vary  significantly  from  year to year.\n\nIn 2023, published consolidated third-party sales for Engineering & Construction totaled 390 million euros .\n\ndelivered  more  than  200  hydrogen  refueling  stations  around  the world and is developing technologies and infrastructure required for the use of liquid hydrogen.\n\nFor  the maritime  industry ,  GM&T  develops  multimodal  and sustainable solutions to supply a comprehensive range of gases (air gases, carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, krypton, xenon, etc.) and support its customers to decarbonize their operations.\n\nTo  support deep  tech ,  GM&T  designs  and  develops,  with  its customers  and  ecosystems,  disruptive  technologies  notably  for the  launchers,  satellites,  international  research  projects  and  the quantum  computing.  Through  its  patented  technologies  and  its expertise in cryogenics, GM&T continues to push the frontiers of science and open up new markets.\n\n- \u25a0 858 millions euros of revenue in 2023\n- \u25a0 3 activities: Technologies, Biogas solutions and Maritime\n- \u25a0 26  biomethane  production  units  worldwide,  with  an  annual production capacity of 1.8 TWh\n- \u25a0 Over 200 hydrogen refueling stations sold",

In  the  case  of steam methane reforming (SMR) ,  this  mixture  passes  through catalyst-filled  tubes  inside  a  high-temperature  reformer  to  be transformed  into  syngas  (mainly  hydrogen,  carbon  dioxide  and monoxide).  This  syngas  is  then  cooled  (producing  steam)  and directed  inside  a  'shift'  reactor  which  increases  the  hydrogen content  that  can  then  be  purified  and  supplied  to  the  customer. The  off-gas  is  used  to  heat  the  reformer.  For  the  production  of carbon  monoxide  (not  shown),  the  cooled  synthesis  gas  is collected  and  then  purified  successively  by  carbon  capture  and cryogenic distillation processes.\n\n## CARBON CAPTURE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHydrogen\n\nIn the case of autothermal reforming (ATR) , the synthesis gas is produced in a single high pressure and high temperature reactor. This process requires oxygen. ATR is an efficient solution for the production of very large quantities of hydrogen.\n\nFinally, POX  (Partial  OXidation) ,  a  process  similar  to  ATR  but without  catalyst,  is  an  efficient  solution  when  the  main  gas produced is carbon monoxide.\n\nAir  Liquide  E&C  has  designed  and  built  numerous  SMRs  and more  than  40  ATRs  and  POXs  for  third-party  customers.  Air Liquide  Large  Industries  has  been  operating  mostly  SMRs  but also several ATRs and POXs.\n\nAir  Liquide  masters  a comprehensive  portfolio  of  carbon capture  solutions ,  based  on  the  different  technologies,  and operates hydrogen  production units equipped with these processes.  Carbon  capture  can  be  used  to  decarbonize  the Group's units as well as develop carbon capture as a service.\n\nIn particular, the Cryocap\u2122 process, which combines cryogenics with other technologies, makes  it possible to efficiently decarbonize  the  production  of  hydrogen,  steel,  chemicals  or cement.  The  Group  has  been  operating  an  industrial-scale Cryocap\u2122 unit since 2015 and two more are under construction.",

        "page_content": "## 4.   Competition\n\nAt  a  global  level,  the  industrial  gases  industry  comprises  three main  players:  Air  Liquide  and  Linde  Plc  (Ireland),  co-market leaders  with  sales  in  excess  of  25  billion  euros  each,  and  Air Products  (United  States)  with  revenue  which  is  more  than  two times  lower.  There  are  also  a  number  of  global  and  regional players,  such  as  Nippon  Sanso  Holdings  (Japan),  Air  Water (Japan),  Messer  (Germany),  Hangzhou  Oxygen  Plant  Group 'Hangyang' (China) and AirPower (China) - formerly Yingde and Baosteel Gases. Finally, numerous smaller-sized players are also present in local markets.\n\nIn  Large  Industries,  the  customer  can  choose  between  selfproduction  and  over-the-fence  gas  supply.  Self-production  is currently  estimated  to  account  for  90%  of  hydrogen  production and 60% of oxygen production globally, although with significant geographical disparities. Companies self-producing gas represent an  important  market  share  for  the  Group  to  address.  In  this respect,  the  potential  to  convert  self-production  into  over-thefence supply represents a major growth opportunity for the Large Industries  business.  The  level  of  self-production  varies  strongly depending  on  the  geographic  region,  type  of  industry  or  local culture.  In  advanced economies, the supply of oxygen is largely over-the-fence, while the supply of hydrogen for refining remains primarily in-house. In developing economies, while relatively new, over-the-fence supply is accelerating significantly. Air Liquide and Linde Plc, the world leaders in Large Industries, are in competition with the other major global players and local players.\n\nIndustrial  Merchant  is  a  local  business:  transport  costs  limit  the operating area to within 200 to 250 km of a production unit, except for  high  value-added  gases  such  as  argon  and  helium.  This market, which is highly diversified due to the size and activity of its customers, thus includes numerous small and medium-sized local competitors,  either  by  producing  and  distributing  gas  or  solely distributing gas.\n\nIn  Healthcare,  most  gas  industry  players  also  supply  hospitals with  medical  oxygen,  but  few  are  present  in  the  treatment  of chronic  diseases  at  home.  In  Home  Healthcare,  Air  Liquide  is\n\nnumber one in Europe (in number of patients), whereas Linde Plc has a larger presence in the United States. This market remains fragmented  in  almost  all  regions  with  a  multitude  of  small companies and associations. This fragmentation provides bolt-on acquisition opportunities.\n\nIn  Electronics,  a  business  in  which Air  Liquide  is  the  leader,  six companies play a major role: Air Liquide, Linde Plc, Merck KGaA (Germany),  Entegris  (United  States),  Air  Products  and  Nippon Sanso Holdings. In the advanced materials market, Air Liquide is a leader and is considered one of the 'first movers' focusing on growing  its  incumbent  position  and  developing  innovative  new molecules.  The  other  'first  movers'  in  this  specific  Electronics market are Merck and Entegris.\n\nIn  Engineering  &  Construction,  Air  Liquide  also  competes  with industrial gas players. In 'cryogenic' technologies used for air gas separation,  the  main  competitors  are  Linde  Plc,  Hangzhou Oxygen  Plant  Group  'Hangyang'  and  Air  Products.  Chinese competitors  are  gaining  ground  due  to  strong  demand  in  their country.  In  'non-cryogenic'  technologies  used  for  producing hydrogen  and  the  chemical  conversion  of  syngas,  the  largest competitors  are  Technip  Energies  (France),  Haldor  Topsoe (Denmark), Johnson Matthey (United Kingdom) and Linde Plc.\n\nGlobal  Markets  &  Technologies  is  growing  worldwide,  in  growth markets such as those relating to the energy transition and deep tech.  The  competitive  landscape  varies  greatly  from  market  to market,  with  companies  of  various  sizes,  from  multinationals  to start-ups.\n\nAir Liquide is well positioned to capture new growth opportunities relating to the energy  transition, notably low-carbon  and renewable hydrogen, thanks to its strategic positioning, operational experience and expertise in key technologies such as electrolysis, CO2 capture and hydrogen liquefaction.\n\n<!-- image -->",

DECARBONIZE THE PLANET\n\nWith  ADVANCE,  Air  Liquide  confirms  its leadership  in  the decarbonization  of  the  industry  and  in  the  emergence  of  a low-carbon society in which hydrogen and carbon capture play a decisive part.\n\nThe  reduction  of  CO2  emissions  is  a  major  challenge  for  large industrial  players  and  for  heavy  duty  mobility.  This  represents  a pool of opportunities for Air Liquide.\n\nThe Group has a large portfolio of technological solutions and services to accompany its Large Industries customers across the world  in  their  path  to  decarbonization.  Notably,  this  includes  the supply of low-carbon industrial gases , the transformation of its customers' industrial processes and CO2 management .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir  Liquide  recognizes  the  climate  emergency and  aims  to actively  participate  in  the  implementation  of  the  Paris Agreement ,  which  defines  a  global  framework  aimed  at  limiting global warming to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing  efforts  to  limit  it  to  1.5\u00b0C.  As  part  of  its  Sustainable Development objectives  presented  in  March  2021,  the  Group  is committed  to  achieving carbon  neutrality  by  2050. Air  Liquide intends to contribute to carbon neutrality by addressing the entire value  chain,  therefore  covering  direct  emissions  (Scope  1), indirect emissions  linked  to  electricity and  steam  supply (Scope  2),  as  well  as  Scope  3  emissions,  which  include  other reported indirect emissions.\n\nAir  Liquide's  trajectory  towards carbon  neutrality  in  2050 includes two major intermediate steps in 2025 and 2035:\n\n- \u25a0 to start reducing its absolute CO2 emissions around 2025 ;\n- \u25a0 to reach a -33% decrease of its Scope 1 & 2 CO2 emissions by 2035 compared to 2020.\n\nThe  Group  also  maintains  its  objective  to  reduce  by  -30%  its carbon intensity in kg CO2/\u20ac Ebitda in 2025, compared to 2015, in accordance with a commitment that was made in 2018.\n\nAware  of  the  importance  of  contributing  to  the  achievement  of carbon neutrality throughout its value chain, in 2022, Air Liquide worked on developing its 'Scope 3' emissions reduction strategy. The  value  of  its  customer  relationships  has  led  the  Group  to pledge  to  have  75%  of  its  50  largest  customers  committed  by 2025 to carbon neutrality and 100% by 2035.\n\nFor more information, see pages 319 to 333.",

Demand  will  increasingly  turn  to  low-carbon  gases,  in  line  with  changing regulations.\n- \u25a0 Solutions have already been implemented to decarbonize existing production units :\n- -for air gases (Scope 2 emissions) mainly by using low-carbon electricity : the deployment of actions in the 10 countries with the greatest potential will  significantly  reduce  Scope  2  emissions.  Since  2018, Air  Liquide  has  already  signed  20  renewable power purchase agreements for more than 3 TWh/year. More than 95% of air separation units are already electrified and do not require any specific investment for the transition;\n- -for hydrogen production units using methane reforming (Scope 1 emissions), by capturing CO2 . Air Liquide masters a complete portfolio of proprietary technologies for capturing CO2. The Group was recently selected for financing via European funds for two carbon capture projects on SMRs. The decarbonization of the Group's 10 largest SMRs will reduce Scope 1 emissions by more than 40% .\n\nThe demand for low-carbon gases at a higher price is  growing  and  allows  to remunerate the necessary investment for the decarbonization of  assets,  in  particular  for  the  production  of  hydrogen,  as  well  as  any  potential  overcosts  linked  to  the  supply  of renewable electricity. In addition, financing programs in the form of subsidies or tax credits are also being implemented in Europe and in the United States in order to support, during a transition period, the decarbonization of existing industrial assets and new production units.\n\n- \u25a0 Energy costs (electricity for air gases and natural gas for reforming units) and those related to CO2 emissions (e.g. ETS scheme in Europe)  are re-invoiced  to  the  customer in  the  frame  of  a  long-term  contract  (15  years  or  more).  The  Group  also  applies  this business model to the supply of low-carbon gas, so Air Liquide does not bear significant risks associated with energy and CO2 costs.\n- \u25a0 A client supplied in hydrogen by the Group is therefore facing an arbitration between:\n- -bear the cost of CO2 ; or\n- -buy low-carbon hydrogen from Air Liquide, the price of which includes the return on investment in a CO2 capture unit as well as operating and storage costs. The higher the value of CO2, the more the customer will be encouraged to choose the supply of low-carbon hydrogen , which will also contribute to the achievement of its own decarbonization objectives. A high carbon price is therefore favorable to accelerating the decarbonization of the Group assets .  The sensitivity study shows that,  depending on the geography and the context, a price starting from 80 to 200 euros per tonne of CO2 encourages the customer to decide toward the supply of low-carbon hydrogen. This  CO2 value can be explicit or integrated into regulatory obligations on the carbon footprint of end products.\n- \u25a0 Any new investment decision  by Air  Liquide  now  includes  the  constraint  of reducing CO2 emissions, in line with the Group's decarbonization objectives. The share of electrolyzers among hydrogen production units should therefore increase in the coming years. In 2023, Air Liquide has inaugurated the Electrolyzer manufacturing workshop built within the frame of the joint venture with Siemens Energy and has announced the decision to invest on a 200 MW electrolyzer.\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide is implementing a certain number of actions to take physical risks into account . They are reviewed during investment decisions, then taken into account during unit conception and covered by Group's insurances. Air Liquide carried out a study in 2023 aimed at consolidating and improving the physical risk management process according to 2 high-emission scenarios leading to a global warming of +2.7\u00b0C and +4.4\u00b0C by 2100.\n\nThe potential impacts of the risk related to the energy transition as well as physical risks were analyzed as part of the closing of the Group's  financial  statements  (see  note  31  to  the  Consolidated  financial  statements  -  page  282)  and no  significant  impact  was identified , mainly for the reasons mentioned above . The energy transition is above all a growth opportunity for Air Liquide, as the Group has the technologies to decarbonize the assets of its industrial customers .",

TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION TO OPEN NEW MARKETS\n\nWith ADVANCE, Air Liquide aims to contribute to the development of key sectors for the future, where it intends to reinforce its positions, leveraging on innovation and technology, two major assets of the Group.\n\nThe Group will focus on five key sectors of the future:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nElectronics ,  where  the  revolutions  in  regards  to digital, data and artificial intelligence represent a real development  opportunity  and  will  strengthen  the Group's leadership position;\n\nHealthcare , in which  Air  Liquide's  value-based approach,  which  improves  quality  of  life  for  the patient  at  the  best  cost  for  the  health  system, responds to major societal issues;\n\nIndustrial  Merchant , whose  growth  is  driven  by environmental  challenges  and  by  new  usages, notably digital;\n\n## HYDROGEN OBJECTIVES FOR INDUSTRY AND MOBILITY\n\nThe Group is deeply convinced that hydrogen will play a major role in the energy transition .  Hydrogen offers tremendous growth potential as a competitive low-carbon solution for many applications in the industry and mobility sectors. The Group intends to be a key enabler of the hydrogen society thanks to its assets, technology, expertise and strategic positioning built up over about 50 years. This is  why  in  these  new  hydrogen  markets, the  Group  masters  the  whole  value  chain  for  industry  and  mobility which  includes  the sourcing of low-carbon energies and renewables, the production of hydrogen, packaging by compression and liquefaction, delivery by truck and pipelines along with storage and distribution to the end customers. To this end, the Group is investing in new technologies to produce and distribute low-carbon hydrogen at large scale competitively, reliably and safely, such as electrolysis, capture of CO2 and hydrogen liquefaction.\n\nThe Group has confirmed the commitments made during the Sustainability Day in 2021 and will develop hydrogen as quickly as the ecosystem allows. Air Liquide plans to invest 8 billion euros in the field of low-carbon and renewable hydrogen and to triple its sales from  2  to  6  billion  euros  before  2035. In  addition,  in 2030 the electrolysis capacities  in  operation  or  under  construction  will reach 3 GW .\n\n## 2.4.

ORGANIZATION\n\nVarious  internal  structures  contribute  to  the  definition  and implementation  of  the  Group's  strategy.  Their  roles  are presented in Chapter 2 'Risk factors and control environment', page 71.\n\nRegular meetings are chaired by the CEO or by the Senior Vice President in charge of the Strategy depending on the subjects in order  to  review  the  Group's  strategy,  major  investments  and policies.  The  Executive  Committee  meets  very  regularly  to review the strategy and its implementation.\n\nMoreover, monthly meetings of the Group Performance Steering Committee are held to establish investment budgets and action plans to undertake or amend in order to achieve the annual or multi-annual objectives.\n\nInvestments are validated through the Resources and Investment  Committees  (RIC),  the  operation  of  which  is described on page 46 of this chapter.\n\nTaking environmental and societal challenges into account is an integral part of the Group's strategy. The  Sustainable Development  Department,  which  reports  to  a  Vice  President, member  of  the  Executive  Committee,  thus  contributes  to  the development of the strategy and defines the specific measures to  be  included  in  the  Company  program.  Moreover,  this  Vice President  takes  part  with  a  sustainable  development  focus  in meetings related to strategy and some RICs.\n\n## 3.2.   INVESTMENT PROCESS\n\nThe Group's steady long-term growth is largely due to its ability to invest  in  new  projects  each  year.  Investment  projects  in  the industrial  gas  business  are  spread  throughout  the  world,  highly capital  intensive  and  supported  by  long-term  contracts,  in particular  for  Large  Industries  and  Electronics.  Air  Liquide  has thus tailored  its  financing  to  the  nature  of  its  projects,  based  on the diversification of financing sources, the prudent management of  the  balance  sheet  and  innovative  financing  methods.  This financing  policy  is  fundamental  for  the  Group's  continued development.\n\nThe Group's investments reflect its growth strategy. They can be classified into two categories:\n\n- \u25a0 industrial  investments,  which  bolster  organic  growth  and guarantee the efficiency, replacement, maintenance and safety of installations;\n- \u25a0 financial  investments,  which  strengthen  existing  positions  or accelerate penetration into a new region or business segment through the bolt-on acquisition of companies or assets already in operation, as well as new technologies.\n\nThe nature of industrial investments differs from one World Business Line to another: from gas production units for Large Industries and Electronics, to filling centers, logistics equipment, storage facilities, medical devices and management systems for Industrial Merchant, Electronics and Healthcare. The nature of investments is also highly varied within Global Markets & Technologies. Capital intensity varies greatly from one business to another.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CLIMATE AND INVESTMENT DECISIONS\n\nAccording  to  the  Air  Liquide  business  model,  the  growth  of activities  requires  investments  in  new  production  units.  Thus, achieving decarbonization objectives necessarily involves aligning investment  plans  with  the  decarbonization  trajectory.  The investment  process  is  now  accompanied  by  the  allocation  and monitoring  of  an  annual  'CO2  budget'  allocated  to  the  Group's operations, in order to pilot the trajectory. Air Liquide has set up processes  to  measure  and  control  its  CO2  emissions  on  a quarterly basis.\n\nMoreover,  for  all  its  projects,  for  all  geographies,  even  those without  a  current  price  for  CO2,  Air  Liquide includes  a  carbon price in its investment decision process .  A sensitivity study to  this  aspect  is  performed  with  various  values  including a reference price of 50 euros per tonne , the local current price and a high value of 100 euros per tonne, or more ,  chosen in function of the geography and context. The study allows to assess the economic cost of greenhouse gas emissions and consequences on the project, even in the case of a strong carbon price  increase  in  the  long  term.  The  analysis ensures  the robustness  and  sustainability  of  the  customer  project,  the CO2  cost  being  contractually  invoiced  to  the  client. This analysis  also  makes  it  possible  to  validate  the  relevance  and viability  of  the  investment solution planned by Air Liquide and to propose low-carbon technological solutions.\n\n## 3.2.1.  Capital intensity\n\nCapital  intensity  is  the  ratio  of  capital  required  to  generate  one euro  of  supplementary  revenue  when  projects  or  businesses reach maturity. This capital is either invested in industrial assets (production  units,  storage  facilities,  logistics  equipment,  etc.),  or used  as  working  capital  to  finance  the  development  of  the activities.\n\nCapital intensity varies significantly from one business to another:\n\n- \u25a0 Large Industries:\n- -air  gas  production  has  a  capital  intensity  of  around  3.  It varies with the trend in electricity prices,\n- -hydrogen  production  has  a  capital  intensity  of  between  1 and  2,  due  to  the  high  proportion  of  natural  gas  or electricity (in the case of electrolyzers) in the cost of sales. This capital intensity, therefore, varies with the changes in natural gas and electricity prices;\n- \u25a0 Industrial Merchant capital intensity to launch the business in a new market is between 1.5 and 2;\n- \u25a0 Electronics  has  an  average  capital  intensity  between  2.5 and 3;\n- \u25a0 in  Healthcare,  capital  intensity,  excluding  acquisitions,  is around 1 depending on the product mix.\n\nThe  Group's  capital  intensity,  therefore,  continues  to  vary depending  on  the  business  mix,  project  type  and  prices  of  raw materials. It is much  higher  for  renewal  and  efficiency investments.\n\nWhatever the capital intensity, any project must enable the Group to achieve its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) objective over the  long  term.  Therefore,  for  the  same  level  of  return  on investment,  the  operating  margin  (OIR  to  revenue  ratio)  of  a project will depend on the capital intensity of the activity in which the project is carried out.",

        "page_content": "## 3.2.2. The theoretical lifespan of gas production unit contracts\n\nLong-term  development  is  one  of  the  key  characteristics  of  the Industrial Gas business. It is particularly evident in the investment cycle, where there is approximately a five-year span between the study  of  a  new  construction  project  for  a  Large  Industries customer  and  the  first  corresponding  industrial  gas  sales. Investment  cycles  in  other  business  lines  are  generally  shorter.\n\nMonitoring  the  lifespan  of  these  projects  is  essential  to anticipating the Group's future growth. The chart below provides details of each stage of this process based on the example of a Large Industries contract.\n\n## INVESTMENT CYCLE OF A LARGE INDUSTRIES CONTRACT\n\nApplying a theoretical capital intensity of 2, an investment of 100 million euros in a new project should generate 50 million euros of sales per annum, when fully ramped-up.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25a0 Opportunities and Negotiation phase : the project is included in the portfolio of investment opportunities and enters into the development  process.  Projects  exceeding  5  million  euros  of investment for Large Industries and exceeding 3 million euros for  other  business  lines  are  monitored  within  the  portfolio  of potential  opportunities  and  split  between  those  for  which  a decision is expected within 12 months and those for which the investment decision will take more than one year. Projects are then discussed and negotiated with the customer. Projects can be removed from the portfolio for several reasons:\n- 1. the contract is signed, it is removed from the portfolio and therefore becomes an investment decision;\n- 2. the project is abandoned by the customer;\n- 3. the customer decides against an over-the-fence gas supply or the project is awarded to a competitor;\n- 4. the  project  is  delayed  beyond  12  months:  it  is  removed from  the  12-month  portfolio  but  remains  in  the  long-term portfolio.\n- \u25a0 Signature  phase :  the  two  parties  reach  an  agreement.  The signing  of  a  long-term  contract  represents  an  investment decision  validated  by  the  internal  governance  bodies.  The project is removed from the portfolio of investment opportunities and is registered in current investments.\n- \u25a0 Construction  phase :  the  construction  of  the  unit  generally takes  around  24  months  and  sometimes  up  to  36  months depending  on  the  size  of  the  project.  This  is  the  capital expenditure period. The project remains in current investments.\n- \u25a0 Revenue phase :\n- 1. commissioning: this corresponds to the start-up of the unit. Sales reflect the needs of the customer with a guaranteed minimum  volume  at  the  take-or-pay  level,  guaranteeing minimum profitability from the beginning of the contract;\n\n- 2. ramp-up: this is the unit's ramp-up phase. Over the course of  the  contract  term,  volumes increase above the take-orpay  level  to  the  nominal  amount  defined  in  the  contract. Nominal capital intensity is achieved only at the end of this phase.\n\n## 3.2.3.  Governance of major growth projects\n\nThree Air Liquide entities are at the heart of major growth projects, from development through to its execution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  business  line  involved  ensures  the  global  customer relationship  is  monitored,  provides  the  required  know-how  and ensures  the  overall  consistency  of  the  project,  in  terms  of  both contract  and  technical  standards.  It  is  also  responsible  for  good internal governance practices.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is then  responsible  for  operations,  customer  relations  and  the project's financial profitability.\n\nEngineering  &  Construction  provides  the  technologies  and guarantees that they are competitive, both overall and specifically for each project thanks to a good industrial architecture solution. Engineering & Construction is responsible for the plant supply and works  with  local  Capital  Implementation  teams  (CI  within  the hubs) which are responsible for executing the project. The local CI team  is  supported  by  a  dedicated  CIG  (Capital  Implementation Group) composed of experts.\n\nPotential  projects  are  identified  well  in  advance,  based  on  good market  knowledge  and  a  strong  local  presence.  The  first  stage includes selecting the opportunities in which the Group would like to invest both commercial and technical resources, in line with its global strategy. This selection process is followed by a series of validation stages.\n\nDuring  the  development  stage,  the  project  is  submitted  for  the approval of the geographic region on which it depends. At the Group level,  three  major  bodies  validate  the  relevance  of  the  project:  the RIC  (Resources  &  Investment  Committee  -  see  below)  which  is responsible  for  assessing  and  validating  investment  requests,  the ERC  (Engineering  Risk  Committee)  which  is  responsible  for assessing  technical  and  execution  risk,  as  well  as  the  E-Enrisk (Energy  and  Emissions  Risks  Committee)  in  charge  of  taking  into account aspects related to energy and the environment.\n\nOnce the project has been decided on by Air Liquide and signed with the customer, it is executed by a team composed of representatives of  the  investing  subsidiary  and  Engineering  &  Construction,  under the supervision of the geographic hub.\n\nDuring  the  start-up  of  a  unit,  project  management  is  the responsibility of the local operational teams, under strict standards to ensure the site's security and integrity. The operational management of the unit is carried out by the local subsidiary, and the Group and hub's Operations Control monitors its financial performance.\n\n## ROLE OF THE RESOURCES & INVESTMENT COMMITTEE (RIC)\n\nThe purpose of these Resources and Investments Committees (RIC) is to assess and approve requests for investments that have been submitted, as well as medium and long-term contractual commitments and Human Resources requirements that may arise therefrom.\n\nThey meet regularly (usually once a month) for each hub (Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Middle-East & Africa) and each World Business Unit (Healthcare, Engineering & Construction, Innovation and Development Division (IDD), Headquarters).\n\nEach Committee meeting is chaired by a member of the Executive Committee in charge of the hub or of the World Business Unit involved and brings together managers of the region and business line concerned by the investment, as well as representatives of the Group Finance Department (who have a veto right), Engineering & Construction, and the Capital Implementation Group (CIG).\n\nThe Committee's decisions are reviewed by the CEO:\n\nThe  decision  is  based  on  a  rigorous  assessment  of  individual  projects  as  well  as  each  project's  expected  profitability.  The  following criteria are systematically reviewed:\n\n- \u25a0 the location of the project: the analysis will take into account whether the project is based in an industrial basin with high potential, whether it is connected to an existing pipeline network, or whether it is in an isolated location;\n- \u25a0 the competitiveness of the customer's site: based on size, production processes and particularly their environmental footprint, cost of raw materials and access to markets;\n- \u25a0 customer risk;\n- \u25a0 the green house gases emissions as well as their economic impact and solutions for reducing emissions;\n- \u25a0 the adequacy of the project with the Group's environmental objectives, including alignment with the decarbonization trajectory;\n- \u25a0 the other sustainable development criteria, such as water consumption, biodiversity and relations with local communities;\n- \u25a0 the physical risks related to climate change;\n- \u25a0 exposure to the risk of corruption;\n- \u25a0 contract clauses;\n- \u25a0 end products and the stability of future demand for these products;\n- \u25a0 quality and risk related to the technical solution;\n- \u25a0 country risk: evaluated on a case-by-case basis and can lead to changes in the financing policy and its supplementary insurance cover.\n\nFollowing approval by the RIC and signing with the customer, the project is transferred to the investment backlog.",

FINANCING\n\nThe  financing  policy  is  regularly  reviewed  to  provide  the  best possible  support  to  the  Group's  development  and  take  into account changes in financial market conditions while respecting a credit profile in line with Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Scope Ratings long-term minimum 'A' category rating.\n\nThe  Air  Liquide  Group  applies  the  following  principles  of prudence:\n\n- \u25a0 diversifying financing sources and spreading of debt maturities in order to minimize refinancing risk;\n- \u25a0 backing  commercial  paper  issues  with  confirmed  credit facilities;\n- \u25a0 hedging interest rate risk to ensure visibility of financing costs, in line with long-term investment decisions;\n- \u25a0 funding  investments  in  the  currency  of  the  operating  cash flows, to ensure a natural currency hedging;\n- \u25a0 a  permanent  centralization  of  funding  and  excess  cash through  Air  Liquide  Finance,  a  wholly-owned  entity  of L'Air Liquide S.A.\n\nFurthermore, the Air Liquide Group, as part of its growth strategy combining financial and extra-financial performance, is turning to the  opportunities  offered  by  the  finance  market  in  terms  of responsible and sustainable financial instruments.\n\n## 3.3.1.  Diversifying and securing financing sources\n\nAir Liquide diversifies its financing sources by accessing various debt markets: commercial paper, bonds and banks.\n\nFor  its  short-term  financing,  Air  Liquide  uses  the  short-term commercial  paper  market,  in  France,  in  the  form  of  short-term negotiable securities (NeuCP) through two programs of up to an outstanding maximum of 3 billion euros each, and in the United States through a US Commercial Paper program (USCP) of up to an outstanding maximum of 2 billion US dollars.\n\nFor its long-term financing, Air Liquide has a Euro Medium Term Note  (EMTN)  program  to  issue  long-term  bonds  of  up  to  an outstanding  maximum  amount  of  12  billion  euros.  This  program allows,  in  particular,  for  bonds  to  be  issued  in  the  principal currencies  (euro,  US  dollar,  Japanese  yen)  as  well  as  in  other currencies  (Chinese  renminbi,  Swiss  franc  and  pound  sterling). Air Liquide can also issue private placements.\n\nIn line with its environmental and social objectives, Air Liquide has established  a  Sustainable  Financing  Framework  to  cover  the following  instruments  to  finance  sustainable  projects  intended  to have  a  clear  benefit  to  the  environment  and  society.  This Framework  is  aligned  with  the  Sustainability  Bond  Guidelines 2018 (SBG), the Green Bond Principles 2018 (GBP), the Social Bond Principles 2020 (SBP) overseen by the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA), as well as the Social Loan Principles 2021 and the Green Loan Principles 2021 overseen by the Loan Market Association (LMA).\n\nThe Group also raises funds through bank debt (loans and credit facilities).\n\nTo avoid liquidity risk relating to the renewal of funding at maturity, and  in  accordance  with  the  Group's  internal  policy,  the  Group limits its short-term debt maturities to an amount that is covered from  its  core  banks  by  committed  credit  facilities,  syndicated  or bilateral.\n\n## 3.3.2.  Centralization of cash and funding, excess cash and hedging\n\nTo  benefit  from  economies  of  scale  and  facilitate  capital  markets financing  (bonds  and  commercial  paper),  the  Group  uses  a dedicated subsidiary, Air Liquide Finance. This subsidiary centralizes the vast majority of the Group's financing transactions. It  hedges  currency,  interest  rate  and  commodities  risk  for  the Group's subsidiaries in those countries where it is permitted by law.\n\nIn the countries where local regulations allow it, Air Liquide Finance also centralizes cash flow balances through direct or indirect daily cash pooling of these outstanding balances or through intra-group loans and borrowings. When daily international cash concentration is not possible, there exist, nonetheless, local cash poolings which allow periodic intercompany loans to Air Liquide Finance.\n\n## INTEGRATED REPORT\n\n<!-- image -->",

Following  the  definitions brought  by  EMIR  REFIT  and  according  to  its  status  'NFC-', Air Liquide  Finance  transferred  from  2021  the  responsibility  for reporting derivatives to its counterparties.\n\nFurthermore, in certain specific cases (e.g. regulatory constraints, high country risk, joint ventures, etc.), the Group may limit its risk through adapted management, by setting up specific financing in the local banking market, and by using credit risk insurance.\n\n## 3.3.3.  Staggering debt maturity\n\nTo  minimize  the  refinancing  risk  related  to  debt  maturity schedules, the Group spreads maturities over several years.\n\nDebt  maturity  schedules  are  regularly  reviewed  by  Finance Department and Executive Management during Finance Committee.\n\nRefinancing risk is also reduced by the regularity of the cash flow generated from Group activities.\n\n## 3.3.4.  Use of bank guarantees\n\nGroup  subsidiaries  require  from  time  to  time  bank  guarantees, mostly  in  favor  of  Healthcare,  Engineering  &  Construction  and Global  Markets  &  Technologies  clients,  either  during  the  tender period  (bid  bond),  or  after  contract  award,  during  contract execution until the end of the warranty period (advance payment bond, performance bond and warranty bond).\n\nThe most common bank guarantees are advance payment bonds and performance bonds and are extended to customers to secure contractual performance.\n\nIn  the  Group's  ordinary  course  of  business,  certain  subsidiaries are  required  to  provide  financial  payment  guarantees  to  secure rental or insurance obligations.\n\nThe  projects,  for  which  these  guarantees  are  granted,  are regularly reviewed by management and are subject to approval by the Board of Directors for guarantees which exceed 100  million  euros.  When  guarantee  payment  calls  become probable, the necessary provisions are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 3.4.   INNOVATION\n\nThe Innovation  and  Development  Division (IDD)  drives  the innovation  strategy  and  its  execution  for  the  Group's  Hubs  and Operations, with the strong support of the World Business Lines. It  contributes  to  the  operational  excellence  and  future  growth  of the  Group  by  creating  new  profitable  and  sustainable  offers  in both  its  traditional  and  new  businesses.  It  is  responsible  for imagining,  designing,  developing  and  incubating  new  solutions until  they  are  brought  to  market,  particularly  when  it  comes  to offers with high technological content.\n\nThe  Innovation  and  Development  Division  relies  both  on  its Innovation  Campuses  and  its  Campus  Technologies,  gathering the  experts  of  its  internal  ecosystem,  on  its  partnerships  with external  innovation  ecosystems,  as  well  as  on  the  engineering centers  of  the  Group.  Sales  to  end  customers  contribute  to  the industrialization of innovations.\n\nThe investment decisions and resources relating to innovation rely on the Group's governance bodies (Resources and Investment Committee - RIC, Risk Committee); their roles are described  on  page  87  of  the  present  Universal  Registration Document.\n\nResearch  &  Development projects  are  managed  by  the  R&D Program  directors  and  driven  by  the  World  Business  Lines  in order  to  ensure  the  alignment  of  the  projects  with  business strategies  and  to  anticipate  the  industrialization  and  rollout phases. The implementation of R&D projects for a cluster (group of countries), in line with the World Business Lines strategy, and the  annual  meetings  with  clusters,  are  also  helping  to  improve customer proximity and reduce the time to market of innovations.\n\nFurthermore, Technology  Roadmaps  (TRM) dedicated  in particular to the Hydrogen Energy, Global Markets & Technologies, Engineering & Construction and Digital & IT have been  defined  and  are  coordinated  by  the  Innovation  and Development Division's Chief Technology Officer, working hand in hand  with  R&D  and  the  business  lines.  Structured  around  the project maturity scale, these roadmaps constitute the steering tool of  the  Group's  technology  innovation  strategy.  The First-of-itsKind Committee (FOIK), created specifically to assess the risks related to industrial demonstration projects, carried out for the first time  by  the  Group,  and  to  the  implementation  of  innovative technologies on commercial units, meets every month. The digital projects  in  development  phase,  prior  to  deployment  (Minimum Viable Product - MVP) are subject to technological validation by the Corporate teams and are presented to the RIC.\n\nThe innovation strategy is also regularly reviewed by the Group's Executive Committee and the Board of Directors.",

Consolidated  revenue  from Engineering  & Construction was down -15.6% .  This excludes activities carried out  as  part  of  internal  projects  for  Large  Industries  and Electronics, which are growing.\n\nThe Group's revenue as published was down -7.8% ,  impacted by unfavorable energy (-7.6%) and currency (-4.2%) impacts, the significant perimeter impact being slightly positive at +0.3%. The latter corresponds to the re-invoicing of energy consumed by the 16 units taken-over in 2021 in South Africa, less the impact of the deconsolidation of businesses in Russia. The favorable impact on 2023 comparable sales growth of hyperinflation (1) in Argentina is estimated at approximately +0.6%.\n\n## Gas & Services\n\nGas & Services revenue totaled 26,360 million euros in  2023, an increase on a comparable basis of +4.2% .\n\nThe  two  growth  drivers  for  2023  were  the Industrial  Merchant business,  with  sales  up +8.5% ,  benefiting  from  a price  impact that  remained  high (+8.4%) and  resilient  volumes,  and  the Healthcare business (+8.4%) , bolstered by the dynamic development of Home Healthcare and the increase in the prices of  medical  gases  in  an  inflationary  environment.  Revenue  from Large Industries was down -1.8% over the year: following a low point in the 4 th quarter 2022 and a rebound in the 1 st quarter 2023, demand stabilized at a relatively low level. Sales in Electronics increased by +2.4% in  2023,  following  growth  of  +16%  in  2022, the  sharp  drop  in  demand  from  memory  manufacturers  having impacted sales from the 2nd quarter.\n\nRevenue  as  published in  the  Gas  &  Services  business  was down -7.7% ,  penalized by negative energy (-8.0%) and currency (-4.2%)  impacts,  while  the  significant  scope  effect  was  slightly positive at +0.3%.",

Large  Industries  sales  (-2.2%)  were impacted  by  customer  turnarounds  and  relatively  low  demand.  The Industrial Merchant business posted strong growth of +6.7%, boosted by  a  high  price  impact  (+6.3%)  and  slightly  positive  volumes.  In Healthcare,  the  rise  in  prices  in  proximity  care  in  the  United  States and the  dynamism of the  business  in  South America  contributed  to the strong increase in sales (+14.2%). Electronics revenue was down by -2.8% in a context of slowing demand from memory manufacturers impacting sales of materials.\n\n## AMERICAS GAS & SERVICES 2023 REVENUE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AMERICAS\n\n- \u25a0 Through  an  investment  of more  than  140  million  euros ,  Air  Liquide  announced  that  it  will  establish  in  B\u00e9cancour  (Canada),  a platform supplying low-carbon industrial gases. In addition to the PEM* electrolyzer already in operation, the new infrastructure will include a new air separation unit producing renewable oxygen and nitrogen and a local pipeline network. This new unit is part of the  industrial  and  port  zone's  decarbonization  initiative.  It  will  mostly  supply customers manufacturing battery components for electric vehicles via long term contracts.\n- \u25a0  Air  Liquide  is  a  partner in  a  record  six  out  of  seven  regional  Clean  Hydrogen  Hubs announced  by  the U.S. government  to accelerate low-carbon hydrogen development.\n- \u25a0  Air  Liquide  and Trillium  Energy  Solutions ,  a  leading  supplier  of  sustainable  fueling  infrastructure  in  the  U.S.,  have  signed  a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)  to  pursue  the  development  of  the  heavy-duty hydrogen fueling  market  in  the U.S. The ambition  through  this  partnership  is  to  initially  support  the  development  of 150  tonnes  per  day of  hydrogen  production  and  the refueling infrastructure capable of supplying more than 2,000 heavy-duty vehicles .\n- * PEM: Proton Exchange Membrane.\n\n- \u25a0 Sales in Large Industries were down -2.2% in 2023, impacted in particular by customer turnarounds and the divestiture of the activity in Trinidad and Tobago. Business was also marked by relatively low demand, in particular from customers in the Steel industry. Oxygen volumes for Chemicals in the United States increased slightly in the 4 th quarter,  supported notably by the start-up of a new unit.\n- \u25a0 In Industrial  Merchant ,  the  significant  increase  in  sales  of +6.7% in  2023  was  supported  by  a  strong price  impact of +6.3% , in an  inflationary  context  albeit  slightly  slowing sequentially  (+5.2%  in  the  4 th quarter).  Volumes  were  up slightly  over  the  year.  They  increased  in  the  1 st half-year,  in particular  those  of  bulk  gases.  In  the  2 nd half  of  the  year, hardgoods  volumes  were  down  but  gas  volumes  remained resilient. They  benefited  from  the  demand  increase  in particular in the Construction, Research, Energy and Aeronautics sectors.\n- \u25a0 In Healthcare ,  sales  increased  sharply,  by +14.2% in  2023. The  main  drivers  of  this  growth  were  price  increase  in proximity care in the United States, the development of sleep apnea  treatment  in  Canada  in  the  1 st half-year  and  the dynamism  of  the  Medical  Gases  and  Home  Healthcare businesses in Latin America.\n- \u25a0 Revenue  from Electronics was  down -2.8% over  the  year. Sales  of  specialty  and  advanced  materials  were  strongly impacted by the memory manufacturer production slowdown. Carrier gas revenue growth was solid, driven by the start-up of new  units.  Sales  of  Equipment  and  Installations  were  up, particularly in the 4 th quarter.",

Large  Industries  sales  were  slightly  down (-0.9%)  in  a  context  of  weak  demand  from  customers  in  the Chemicals  and  Steel  industries.  Revenue  from  the  Industrial Merchant  business  rose  sharply,  by  +12.3%,  driven  by  a  price impact  of  +14.0%  and  resilient  volumes  excluding  helium  and liquefied  CO2.  Healthcare  sales  increased  by  +5.8%,  benefiting from  the  dynamism  of  Home  Healthcare  and  the  increase  in medical gas prices in an inflationary context.\n\nEUROPE GAS & SERVICES 2023 REVENUE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EUROPE\n\n- \u25a0 On the occasion of the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding to supply the TotalEnergies refinery in Gonfreville, Normandy, France,  with renewable  and  low-carbon  hydrogen ,  Air  Liquide  announced  an  investment  of  over 400  million  euros for  the construction of its Normand'Hy electrolyzer . With a capacity of 200 MW , it will be the largest PEM* electrolyzer ever built and will integrate equipment manufactured by the joint-venture between Air Liquide and Siemens Energy. Connected to the Air Liquide local hydrogen network, this electrolyzer  will  contribute  to  the decarbonization of the industry and transportation .  Normand'Hy was recognized as an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) by the European Commission and received support from the French State for an amount of 190 million euros .\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide and Vattenfall signed a new Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for 115 MW of renewable installed power capacity. This second  PPA  of  such  scale  in Benelux ,  significantly  expands Air  Liquide's  overall  renewable  power  supply  in  the  region.  It reaffirms Air Liquide's commitment to lead the way in decarbonizing the European industry while lowering its own carbon footprint , in line with its Sustainable Development objectives.\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide has announced that it will build, own and operate a world-scale carbon capture unit in the industrial basin of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, leveraging its proprietary Cryocap\u2122 technology . The new unit will be installed at the Group's major hydrogen production  plant  located  in  the  port  of  Rotterdam  and  will  be  connected  to Porthos ,  one  of  Europe's  largest  carbon  capture  and storage infrastructure aiming at significantly reducing CO \u2082 emissions in this large industrial basin.\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide and Holcim signed a Memorandum of Understanding regarding a decarbonization project of the new Holcim cement factory in Belgium .  It  will  use  oxy-combustion  as  well  as  Air  Liquide's  innovative  proprietary  technology Cryocap\u2122 for  carbon capture. The joint funding application has been awarded by the Innovation Fund of the European Union .\n- * PEM: Proton Exchange Membrane.\n- \u25a0 Revenue  from Large  Industries was  slightly  down (-0.9%) over 2023. In the 1 st quarter of 2023, demand strengthened in a  context  of  decreasing  energy  prices  and  following  a  sharp drop  in  volumes  in  the  2 nd half  of  2022  due  to  the  record increase in energy prices. Demand from Chemicals and Steel customers  then  stabilized  at  a  low  level  until  the  end  of  the year.  Sales  of  cogeneration  units  were  down  in  2023, penalized  by  lower  electricity  prices  than  in  2022.  Hydrogen volumes for Refining increased compared to 2022, particularly in the 4 th quarter.\n- \u25a0 In  the Industrial Merchant business,  sales  growth  remained extremely  strong  at +12.3% ,  bolstered  by  a price  impact of +14.0% ,  in  addition  to  the  increase  of  +23.6%  in  2022.  This price impact gradually eased over the year, reaching +8.4% in the  4 th quarter.  Volumes  excluding  helium  and  liquefied  CO2, whose  supply  has  been  tight  for  several  months,  remained resilient,  particularly  in  the  Automotive,  Manufacturing  and Metallurgy markets.\n- \u25a0 Revenue  from Healthcare increased  by +5.8% in  2023. Diabetes  and  sleep  apnea  treatments  were  the  main contributors  to  the  strong  growth  in  Home  Healthcare  sales. Growth in Medical Gas revenue was driven by rising prices in an  inflationary  context.  Sales  of  specialty  ingredients  and equipment also increased.",

The Large Industries business (-5.5%) was impacted by weak demand and customer turnarounds. Sales in  the  Industrial  Merchant  business  were  up  sharply,  by  +9.9%, driven  by  a  high  price  impact  at  +7.3%  and  by  an  increase  in volumes, in China in particular. Growth in Electronics was +2.2% over  the  year:  very  dynamic  in  the  1 st quarter,  it  was  then impacted  by  lower  demand  from  memory  manufacturers  and  a very high basis of comparison in 2022.\n\n## ASIA-PACIFIC GAS & SERVICES 2023 REVENUE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ASIA-PACIFIC\n\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide and ENEOS Corporation, Japan's leading energy company, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to collaborate  on  accelerating  the  development  of low-carbon  hydrogen  in  Japan and  contribute  to  the energy  transition .  This partnership  intends  to  capitalize  on ENEOS'  strong  energy  infrastructure  and  market  presence  in  Japan as  well  as  on Air Liquide's expertise across the entire hydrogen value chain - from production, liquefaction, transport, storage and distribution to usages - as well as mastery of Carbon Capture.\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide is investing around 60 million euros in China to revamp two Air Separation Units (ASUs) so they can run on electrical power instead of steam produced from coal. This will allow to significantly reduce the CO2 emissions . This investment comes within the context of the renewal of a long-term industrial gases supply contract with Tianjin Bohua Yongli Chemical Industry Co., Ltd ('YLC').\n\n## Middle East and Africa\n\nRevenue in the Middle East & Africa region increased by +7.0% to 1,047 million euros in  2023. All  business lines grew. The sales growth in air gases in South Africa and Egypt explained the solid performance of Large Industries . In Industrial Merchant , a very high price impact of +9.9% and rising volumes made it possible to  achieve  strong  sales  growth,  despite  the  impact  of  the\n\ndivestiture  of  businesses  in  the  Middle  East.  In Healthcare the main drivers of dynamic sales growth were a solid price impact, the development of Home Healthcare in Saudi Arabia and strong activity  in  South  Africa  supported  by  the  contribution  of  an acquisition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\n\n- \u25a0 In  2023, Air  Liquide  and  Sasol have  signed  new  Power  Purchase Agreements  ( PPAs )  with  wind  and  solar  energy  suppliers  to provide renewable power to Sasol's Secunda site, in South Africa, where Air Liquide operates the largest oxygen production site in the world. All these PPAs announced in 2022 and 2023 represent a total installed renewable power capacity of 580 MW .  For Air Liquide, these contracts will contribute to the targeted reduction by 30% to 40% of the CO2 emissions associated with oxygen production in Secunda by 2031.\n\n- \u25a0 Sales in Large Industries were down by -5.5% over the year. They  were  penalized  by  weak  demand  in  the  region, particularly in air gases for the Steel industry in Japan, and in Chemicals.  Customer  turnarounds  in  China  also  impacted sales.\n- \u25a0 Industrial  Merchant revenue  was  up  sharply  by +9.9% in 2023. The price impact stood at a very high level of +7.3% , with particularly strong price increases in Japan and Australia. In China, following a wave of covid-19 at the start of the year, volumes rose sharply from March until the end of the year. The Manufacturing and Technology sectors supported the increase in volumes in the region, as well as new gas supply contracts for the production of battery materials.\n- \u25a0 Sales in the Electronics business were up by +2.2% in 2023. Following  a  double-digit  increase  in  the  1 st quarter,  revenue slowed  to  a  low  point  (-5.2%)  in  the  3 rd quarter,  before reaching a level stable compared to the 4 th quarter of 2022 by the end of the year. This evolution is explained by the sharp decline in production by memory manufacturers, which directly affected the volumes of specialty and advanced materials, and by  a  high  basis  of  comparison,  with  sales  growth  having  hit +18%  in  2022.  In  addition,  growth  in  carrier  gas  sales continued, driven by the start-up of new units.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consolidated revenue excludes activities carried out as part of internal projects for Large Industries and Electronics, which are growing.\n\nOrder intake amounted to 1,511 million euros for Group projects and third-party customers and hence exceeded 1 billion euros\n\nfor the third consecutive year .  For  the  Group,  these  include Air Separation Units, an industrial-scale pilot ammonia cracking unit, a Cryocap TM CO2  capture  unit  and  a  large  PEM  electrolyzer (200  MW).  Order  intake  for  third-party  customers  includes  large units for the production and liquefaction of hydrogen and air gases.\n\n## ENGINEERING & CONSTRUCTION\n\n- \u25a0 On November 8 th ,  2023, Air Liquide and Siemens Energy officially inaugurated their joint venture gigafactory in  Berlin. The mass production of PEM* electrolyzer components will allow the production of low-carbon hydrogen at industrial scale and competitive cost , and foster an innovative European ecosystem. The state-of-the-art gigafactory will ramp-up to an annual production capacity of 3 GW by 2025 . With two global leading companies in their field combining their expertises, this French-German partnership plays a pivotal role in the emergence of a sustainable hydrogen economy needed to forge the energy transition.\n- \u25a0 Air  Liquide,  through  its  Engineering  &  Construction  business,  will  work  with KBR to  offer low-carbon  ammonia  technological production solutions integrating its Autothermal Reforming ( ATR ) technology. Air Liquide is a world leader in ATR technology, one of the  most  suitable  solutions  for  large-scale  production  of  low-carbon  hydrogen  (H2),  which  is  then  combined  with  nitrogen  (N2)  to produce low-carbon ammonia (NH3). The solutions provided with KBR, the world leader in ammonia technology, will also contribute to the development  of  a  global  low-carbon  hydrogen  market as,  when  transformed  into  ammonia,  hydrogen  can  be  easily transported over long distances .\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide announced the construction of an industrial scale ammonia (NH3) cracking pilot plant in the port of Antwerp, Belgium . When transformed into ammonia, hydrogen can be easily transported over long distances. Using innovative technology, this plant will make it possible to convert, with an optimized carbon footprint, ammonia into hydrogen .\n- PEM: Proton Exchange Membrane. *\n\n## Global Markets & Technologies\n\nGlobal  Markets  &  Technologies  revenue  for  2023  was  down  by -1.0% compared to 2022, at 858 million euros . Organic growth reached +9.7% ,  excluding  the  divestitures  of  the  mobility  biogas distribution and the manufacture of small cryogenic tank businesses in  the  4 th quarter  2022.  Hydrogen  mobility  posted  very  dynamic growth,  boosted  by  the  ramp-up  of  a  hydrogen  liquefier  in  the United States. The increase in sales of technological equipment, in particular Turbo-Braytons, partially offset the decline in sales in the Biogas business, dragged down by lower energy prices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## GLOBAL MARKETS & TECHNOLOGIES\n\n- \u25a0 Air  Liquide  and Groupe ADP announced the creation of Hydrogen Airport ,  the  first engineering and consulting joint venture specializing in supporting airports integrating hydrogen projects within their infrastructures.\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide and TotalEnergies announced the creation of the equally owned joint venture TEAL , to develop a network of hydrogen stations ,  geared  towards heavy-duty  vehicles on major  European  road  corridors .  This  initiative  will  help  facilitate  access  to hydrogen, enabling the development of its use for goods transportation and further strengthening the hydrogen sector.\n- \u25a0 With the inauguration in June 2023 of Air Liquide's high-pressure hydrogen refueling station in Fos-sur-Mer (Marseille, France) and Iveco Group's readiness to deliver hydrogen trucks , the two companies are paving the way for hydrogen long-haul mobility in Europe .\n- \u25a0 In  May 2023, Future Proof Shipping (FPS) inaugurated the first hydrogen-powered river container ship .  'H2  Barge 1' carries cargo between the port of Rotterdam (Belgium) and the Antwerp region (Belgium) for sports equipment manufacturer Nike. Air Liquide contributed actively to this project through the supply of hydrogen and the development of a specific storage system .\n\nOrder  intake for  Group  projects  and  third-party  customers amounted  to 926  million  euros ,  up +5.8% compared  to  2022.

Purchases were  down -16.2%  excluding the  currency  impact ,  mainly  due  to  the  decrease  in  energy prices,  in  particular  natural  gas,  following  the  sharp  increase  in 2022. Personnel costs increased by +6.5% excluding currency impacts in  a  context  of  continued  inflation. Other  operating income  and  expenses increased  by +5.8%  excluding  the currency  impact and  included  in  particular  an  increase  in maintenance costs.\n\nThe efficiencies (2) amounted  to 466  million  euros in  2023,  a sharp  increase  of +23.2% compared  with  2022  and  significantly above  the  annual  target  of  400  million  euros. Industrial efficiencies represented  more  than  60%  of  efficiencies.  They included energy efficiency and production optimization projects in Large  Industries  and  supply  chain  improvements  in  Industrial Merchant.  The  Group's digital  transformation continued:  in Large Industries with the contribution of remote operation centers (Smart Innovative Operations, SIO), in Industrial Merchant and in Healthcare  with  the  implementation  of  tools  to  optimize  delivery routes  for  bulk  gases  and,  increasingly,  for  cylinders.  The continued  implementation  of shared  service  centers also contributed  to  efficiencies.  In  addition,  the  cross-functional program  of continuous  improvement actively  supported  the development of efficiencies, in particular through a digital platform that  has  already  facilitated  the  replication  of  more  than  200 projects.  Efficiencies  are  one  of  the  three  levers  for  improving performance,  with  price  management,  particularly  in  Industrial Merchant, and dynamic management of the asset portfolio.\n\nDepreciation  and  amortization amounted  to 2,482  million euros ,  up +4.1% excluding the currency impact ,  reflecting the impact of the start-up of new units.\n\nThe  Group's operating  income  recurring  (OIR) reached 5,068 million euros in 2023, an increase of +4.2% as published. It increased  by +11.4%  on  a  comparable  basis , which  is significantly  higher  than  the  comparable  sales  growth  of  +3.7%, highlighting a strong leverage effect.\n\nThe operating margin (OIR over revenue) as  published  stood  at 18.4%,  up  +220  basis  points  compared  to  2022.  Indeed,  energy costs,  which  are  contractually  passed  through  to  Large  Industries customers,  decreased  significantly  in  2023,  following  the  drop  in prices  after  the  sharp  increase  in  2022.  This  reduced  published sales, without affecting operating income recurring, and thus created an accretive effect on the published margin as a percentage of sales.\n\nExcluding the energy impact, the operating margin improved very  significantly  by  +80  basis  points .  Thus,  the  sum  of improvements in the operating margin excluding energy impact in 2022 and 2023 reached +150 basis points and compares to the +160  basis  points  expected  over  the  4-year  period  of  the ADVANCE plan. Consequently, the ambition for improvement in the  margin excluding  the  energy  impact  of  the ADVANCE strategic  plan is raised  to  +320  basis  points  over  4  years , which  reflects  an acceleration .  This  corresponds  to twice  the improvement  initially  planned .  Hence,  +170  basis  points  of improvement  are  expected  for  the  remaining  2  years  of  the ADVANCE plan.\n\n## Gas & Services\n\n## GAS & SERVICES 2023 OPERATING INCOME RECURRING\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Gas  &  Services  operating  income  recurring  totaled 5,271  million  euros , representing  an  increase  of  +4.1% compared  with  2022  and  up +10.8%  on  a  comparable  basis . The operating  margin stood  at  20.0%  as  published,  a  sharp increase of +70 basis points excluding the energy impact .\n\nThe price increase  of +8.4% in Industrial  Merchant in  2023 followed  the  record  increase  of  +14.7%  in  2022,  demonstrating the  Group's  ability  to  quickly  transfer  the  rise  in  costs  in  an inflationary environment.

The Industrial Merchant business contributed significantly to this improvement, as did  the  Healthcare  business,  albeit  to  a  lesser extent.  Higher  prices  and  significant  efficiency  gains,  particularly in the United States, were the main drivers of margin growth.\n\nOperating  income  recurring  for Europe totaled 1,723  million euros . Excluding the energy impact , the operating margin saw a +90 basis points increase compared with 2022. The Industrial Merchant business made a major contribution, with an increase in prices  and  high  efficiency  gains  supporting  the  rise  in  the operating margin.

Excluding the energy impact , the operating margin saw a growth of +150 basis points compared with 2022. The margin increased  in  all  businesses  and  in  particular  in  the  Industrial Merchant  business,  where  the  increase  in  prices  and  the  high level of efficiencies contributed significantly to the improvement of the margin. The Large Industries business margin benefited from the payment of an indemnity by a customer.\n\nOperating  income  recurring  for  the Middle  East  and  Africa reached 209 million euros . Excluding the energy impact ,  the operating margin was down by -350 basis points compared with 2022.  In  accordance  with  the  Large  Industries  business  model, the introduction of re-invoicing to the customer for the costs of the energy consumed by the 16 air separation units acquired at the Secunda  site  in  South Africa  had  a  highly  dilutive  effect  on  the margin (3) . Excluding  this  re-invoicing,  the  operating  margin increased.\n\n## Engineering & Construction\n\nOperating income recurring for Engineering & Construction was 43 million euros in 2023. The operating margin stood at 11.1% . It amounted to 9.3% in 2022.\n\n## Global Markets & Technologies\n\nOperating income recurring for the Global Markets & Technologies business stood at 143 million euros in 2023. The operating margin reached 16.7% , a sharp increase of +410 basis points compared  with  2022.  This  performance  was  notably boosted by the increase in volumes of hydrogen for mobility in the United States.\n\n## Corporate Costs and Research & Development\n\nCorporate  costs  and  Research  &  Development  expenses stood at 389 million euros ,  up +9.4% compared with 2022, due particularly to the increase in personnel expenses, the development of research and the strengthening of IT security.\n\n## NET PROFIT\n\nOther operating income and expenses showed a net balance of -497 million euros in  2023 compared with -571 million in 2022. Other operating income amounted to 242 million euros and mainly included  the  sale  of  the  Group's  stake  in  Hydrogenics  in  the 1 st half-year. Other operating expenses amounted to -739 million euros and included exceptional items, with no impact on cash, following a strategic review that led to the impairment of certain  assets  in  several  countries.  They  also  included  the impairment of assets held for sale (with no impact on cash) and restructuring costs in several countries and businesses.\n\nFinancial  income  and  expenses amounted  to -416  million euros , compared with -386 million euros in 2022. This included a net cost of debt of -266 million euros , down sharply by -19.5% excluding  currency  impact ,  mainly  due  to  the  decrease  in average outstanding debt and thanks to the exceptional proceeds generated by the early redemption of bonds in U.S. dollars in the 1 st half-year  and  in  euros  in  the  2 nd half-year.  The average net cost  of  debt at 3.4% ,  was  up  compared  with  3.0%  in  2022, mainly  due  to  the  increase  in  factoring  costs,  which  are  directly\n\nrelated to the rise in interest rates. Furthermore, the average net cost  of  debt  does  not  include  the  exceptional  income  related  to the  early  redemption  of  bonds. Other  financial  income  and expenses stood at -151 million euros compared  with -98  million  euros  in  2022.  This  sharp  increase  is  due  to  a provision for interest on arrears and the impact of the increase in interest rates on pension obligations.\n\nThe tax expense amounted to 972 million euros in 2023, hence an effective tax rate of 23.4% ,  a  sharp  decrease compared with 25.7%  in  2022.  Indeed,  in  2023,  the  Group  benefited  from  a reduced tax rate applicable to the capital gain on the divestiture of the  Group's  stake  in  Hydrogenics  and  the  recognition  of  tax credits in Italy, whereas the effective tax rate was higher in 2022, impacted by significant non-recurring and non-taxable items (4) .\n\nThe share of profit of associates amounted to 5 million euros . The share of minority interests in net profit totaled 110 million euros , down -23.9%, mainly due to the impairment of an intangible asset in a company with minorities and the purchase of minority interests.\n\nNet profit (Group share) stood at 3,078 million euros in  2023, showing strong growth of +11.6% as published and an increase of +21.0%  excluding  the  currency  impact .  It  exceeded  3  billion euros for the first time. Net profit recurring (Group share) (5) is obtained by excluding the proceeds from the sale of the Group's stake in Hydrogenics, the impairment of assets held for sale and those of other assets identified in particular following a strategic business review, as well as the restructuring costs of the Home Healthcare business in France. It stood at 3,320 million euros , up  by  +5.0%,  and +13.3%  excluding  currency  impact , compared with 2022 net profit recurring (Group share).\n\nNet  earnings  per  share ,  stood  at 5.90  euros and  were  up +11.7% as  published  compared  with  2022,  in  line  with  the increase  in  net  profit  (Group  share).  The average  number  of outstanding shares used for the calculation of 2023 net earnings per share was 522,110,068 .\n\n## CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES\n\n|                                       | FY 2022     | FY 2023     |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Average number  of outstanding shares | 522,069,020 | 522,110,068 |\n\n## DIVIDEND\n\nAt  the  General  Meeting  on  April  30,  2024,  the  payment  of  a dividend  of 3.20  euros  per  share will be  proposed  to shareholders for the 2023 fiscal year, representing an increase of +8.5% compared with the previous year. The total estimated payout  taking  into  account  share  repurchases,  share  cancellations and the exercising of stock-options would amount to 1,723 million euros , representing a pay-out ratio of 56% of the published net profit. The ex-dividend date has been set for May 20,  2024,  and  the  payment  is  scheduled  for  May  22,  2024. Moreover,  a free  share  attribution ,  on  the  basis  of  one  free share  for  every  10  shares  held,  as  well  as  the  application  of  a loyalty bonus, are planned for June 2024.",

Indeed,  cash  flows  from  operating activities after changes in working capital allowed to reduce the net debt  after  the  payment  of  over  3.4  billion  euros  in  industrial investments  and  1.6  billion  euros  in  dividends.  The  net  debt-toequity ratio stood at 36.8%, highlighting the strength of cash flows.\n\n## ROCE\n\nThe  return  on  capital  employed  after  tax  (ROCE)  was  9.8%  in 2023. The recurring ROCE (2) stood at 10.6 % ,  an improvement compared  to  10.3%  in  2022  and aligned  with  the  ADVANCE strategic plan's double-digit objective .\n\n## 4.

A new production unit is being built in Canada to supply manufacturers of battery materials with renewable air gases. In France, the first large electrolyzer (200 MW) will produce lowcarbon and renewable hydrogen. In the 4 th quarter, the Group decided  to  invest  in  a  Cryocap TM CO2  capture  unit  in  the Netherlands  to  decarbonize  one  of  the  Group's  largest hydrogen production units and meet the needs of customers in the  Benelux  network. This  unit  will  be  connected  to  Porthos, one of the largest carbon capture and storage infrastructures in Europe.\n- \u25a0 Development of the Electronics business  continued  in  2023 with investments in carrier gas production units in Asia, Europe and  America,  including  one  large  unit.  Decisions  also concerned  the  investment  in  a  new  advanced  materials production site in Asia.\n- \u25a0 In Industrial Merchant , for the 3 rd consecutive  year, investment  decisions  included  around  50  small  on-sites,  to serve customers in secondary Electronics or with applications related  to  the  energy  transition,  such  as  the  production  of battery materials.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INVESTMENTS\n\n- \u25a0 In  2023,  Air  Liquide  set  a new  record by  signing 62  new  small  on-site  production  units in  the Industrial  Merchant and Electronics businesses.  This  growth  reflects  the  increased  demand  for  these  solutions,  and  illustrates  our  capacity  to  meet customers' needs. These units offer real advantages: a continuous, reliable supply of gas, adapted to each client's production needs and helping to reduce carbon emissions.\n\n(2)\n\n- \u25a0 Investments  in  the Healthcare business  included  distribution equipment  to  support  the  growth  of  medical  gas  sales, particularly  in  South  Africa  and  Spain.  They  also  included investments in new innovative cylinders and efficiency projects.\n- \u25a0 Within  the Global  Markets  &  Technologies business,  the development  of  hydrogen  mobility  continued,  in  particular  in China,  Korea  and  Europe,  with  investment  decisions  in hydrogen  filling centers  and  their  logistics chain. The biomethane  activity  also  continued  to  grow  and  a  new investment  in  a  production  unit  in  the  United  States  was decided in the 4 th quarter.\n\nFinancial  investment  decisions totaled 94  million  euros in 2023 compared with 112 million euros in 2022. They included the acquisition  of  small  distributors  in  the Industrial  Merchant business  in  the  United  States,  Canada,  Italy,  India  and  China. These acquisitions  will  contribute  to  growth  and  also  strengthen the  density  of  the  Group's  local  presence,  thus  increasing  the efficiency of its activities. Decisions also included the acquisition of companies in Home Healthcare in Benelux and Sweden, and in Hydrogen  mobility in  Germany.  These  financial  investment decisions  did  not  include  142  million  euros  of  transactions  with minority shareholders and in particular the acquisition of minority shares in a subsidiary in the Middle East.\n\nThe investment backlog hit  a  record high of 4.4 billion euros in 2023,  a  sharp  increase  from  3.5  billion  euros  in  2022.  Its composition is balanced between Large Industries and Electronics . In Asia , ongoing  projects  mainly  concern  the Electronics business. The Americas and Europe saw similar levels of investment, with projects in Large Industries and Electronics.",

        "page_content": "## Start-ups\n\nThe  main  start-ups  in  2023  concerned  production  units  in  Large Industries  and  Electronics.  In Large  Industries , several  Air Separation Units were started up in Europe and the United States, with in particular the commissioning at the end of the year of a major unit connected to the Group's pipeline network in the Gulf Coast. In Electronics ,  it  was  mainly  carrier  gas  production  units  that  were started  up  in Asia,  the  United  States  and  Germany.  In  the Global Markets & Technologies activity, the Group's first biomethane unit in China was commissioned in the 3 rd quarter of 2023.\n\nThe additional contribution to sales of  unit  start-ups  and  rampups totaled 267 million euros in  2023.  Electronics  was  the  main contributor in Asia, while in the Americas and Europe it was Large Industries. Hydrogen mobility benefited from the ramp-up of a major hydrogen production and liquefaction unit in the United States.\n\nThe additional contribution to 2024 sales of unit start-ups and ramp-ups is expected to be between 270 and 290 million euros .\n\n## Investment opportunities\n\nThe portfolio of 12-month investment opportunities remained high,  at 3.4  billion  euros at  the  end  of  2023.  This  reflects  the dynamism of the development of projects in line with the energy transition ,  which represented more than 40% of the portfolio , particularly  in  Europe  and  the  United  States.  Opportunities  in Electronics are now spread across Asia, Europe and the United States  and  are  no  longer  predominantly  located  in  Asia.  The portfolio of opportunities beyond 12 months is at a very high level and  includes  major  projects  related  to  the  energy  transition  in Europe and North America.\n\n## 2023 FINANCING\n\n## 'A' Category financial rating confirmed\n\nSince  2023,  Scope  Ratings,  the  leading  European  credit  rating agency, is one of the rating agencies that evaluate Air Liquide. Air Liquide is thus rated by three rating agencies, Standard & Poor's, Moody's  and  Scope  Ratings.  The  long-term  ratings  from Standard  &  Poor's  and  Scope  Ratings  are  'A' and  from Moody's is 'A2' .  Moreover,  the  short-term  ratings  are  'A1'  for Standard & Poor's, 'S-1' for Scope Ratings and 'P1' for Moody's. Standard  &  Poor's  confirmed  its  ratings  on  December  15,  2023 and gave them a stable outlook. Moody's confirmed its long-term and short-term  rating  on  September  29,  2023  and  gave  them  a stable outlook.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FINANCIAL RATING AGENCY\n\n- \u25a0 Scope  Ratings , Europe's  first  credit  rating  agency , assigned  a 'A' issuer rate  to Air  Liquide,  as  well  as  a 'A' rating for its senior unsecured debt and an 'S-1' short-term rate for all debt instruments issued by Air Liquide SA and Air Liquide Finance. The outlook associated with the issuer rating is positive.\n\n## Diversifying and securing financial sources\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023, Group  financing  through  capital markets accounted for 85% of the Group's total debt , for a total amount of outstanding bonds of 8.9 billion euros including all types of bonds, and 0.4 billion euros of commercial paper.\n\nThe total amount  of  credit  facilities was increased to 3.8  billion  euros . The  syndicated  credit  facility  covers  an unchanged amount of 2.5 billion euros and matures in December 2025. Since 2019, this facility includes an indexation mechanism of financial costs on three of the Group's CSR targets in the areas of carbon intensity, gender diversity, and safety.\n\n## Issues and redemptions\n\nIn  September 2023, the Group issued  a  private  placement for an  amount  of 20  billion  Japanese  yen (128  million  euros equivalent) under the EMTN program, maturing in 8 years. At the end  of  2023, outstanding  bonds issued  under  the EMTN program amounted to 6.6 billion euros (nominal amount).\n\nAs  part  of  optimizing  the  management  of  its  debt  and  cash surpluses, Air Liquide Finance proceeded in 2023 to several early bonds redemption:\n\n- \u25a0 in March 2023, for a total of 383 million U.S. dollars (nominal amount), following a Tender Offering process for two series of bonds  in  U.S.  dollars,  the  first  maturing  in  2026  and  the second in 2046;\n- \u25a0 in  November 2023, for a total of 236 million euros (nominal amount), following a Tender Offering process for two series of bonds  maturing  in  2024  and  a  series  of  bonds  maturing  in 2025.\n\nIn addition, three bond issues were repaid at maturity in March and  September  2023  for  a  total  of 1,112  million  euros equivalent .\n\n## Sustainable financing\n\nWithin the context of its project to build two low-carbon hydrogen production units in the Shanghai Chemical Industrial Park (SCIP), a  subsidiary  of  Air  Liquide  signed  a bilateral  Green  Loan  of 500 million RMB (around 67 million euros). This green credit is in line  with  the principles  common to  the  green  taxonomies  of China and the European Union ,  which  define  strict  criteria  for the  production  of  hydrogen  with  an  emission  threshold  for  lowcarbon hydrogen.\n\nThis Green Loan is the first granted in the world to finance lowcarbon hydrogen production respecting the principles common to the green taxonomies of China and the European Union ('ChinaEU Common Ground Taxonomy').\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2023, net debt decreased in U.S. dollar and increased in euro and in  Taiwanese  dollar.  The  share  of  dollar  in  total  net  debt decreased in favor of these currencies.\n\n## Centralization of cash and funding\n\nIn 2023, Air Liquide Finance continued to pool the cash balances of Group entities.\n\nOn December 31, 2023, Air Liquide Finance had granted to Group subsidiaries,  directly  or  indirectly,  the  equivalent  of  12.3  billion euros in loans and received 3.1 billion euros in excess cash as deposits from them. These transactions were denominated in 24 currencies (mainly the euro, U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Chinese  renminbi,  Singapore  dollar,  British  pound). Approximately  400  subsidiaries  are  included  in  the  Group  cash pooling,  directly  or  indirectly  (including  subsidiaries  where  cash pooling is carried out locally before being centralized at Air Liquide Finance).\n\n## 5.   Performance indicators\n\nPerformance  indicators  used  by  the  Group  that  are  not  directly defined  in  the  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in accordance  with  the  AMF  position  2015-12  about  alternative performance measures.\n\nThe performance indicators are the following:\n\n- \u25a0 Currency, energy and significant scope impacts;\n- \u25a0 Comparable sales change and comparable operating income recurring change;\n- \u25a0 Operating margin and operating margin excluding energy;\n- \u25a0 Reported and restated CO2 emissions;\n\n## Debt maturity and schedule\n\nThe average  of  the  Group's  debt  maturity was 5.5  years at December 31, 2023, decreasing compared with December 31, 2022 (5.9 years). Due to the generation of net cash flow in 2023, bond issues reached maturity without the need for refinancing and early repayments of bonds were made possible.\n\nFinally, the single largest annual maturity represents approximately 12% of total debt and the debt maturing in the next 12 months is less than 2.3 billion euros.\n\n## DEBT MATURITY SCHEDULE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Bonds and private placements Bank debt\n- Commercial paper\n- \u25a0 Operating income recurring before depreciation and amortization  excluding  IFRS16  at  2015  exchange  rate  to calculate the carbon intensity;\n- \u25a0 Recurring net profit Group share;\n- \u25a0 Recurring net profit excluding currency effect;\n- \u25a0 Net profit excluding IFRS16;\n- \u25a0 Net profit recurring excluding IFRS16;\n- \u25a0 Efficiencies;\n- \u25a0 Return on Capital Employed (ROCE);\n- \u25a0 Recurring ROCE.\n\n## DEFINITION OF CURRENCY, ENERGY AND SIGNIFICANT SCOPE IMPACTS\n\nSince industrial and medical gases are rarely exported, the impact of currency fluctuations on activity levels and results is limited to euro translation impacts with respect to the financial statements of subsidiaries located outside the euro zone. The currency effect is calculated based on the aggregates for the period converted at the exchange rate for the previous period.\n\nIn addition, the Group passes on variations in the cost of energy (electricity and natural gas) to its customers via indexed invoicing integrated  into  their  medium  and  long-term  contracts.  This indexing can lead to significant variations in sales (mainly in the Large  Industries  Business  Line)  from  one  period  to  another depending on fluctuations in prices on the energy market.\n\nAn energy impact is calculated based on the sales of each of the main subsidiaries  in  Large  Industries. Their  consolidation  allows the determination of the energy impact for the Group as a whole. The foreign exchange rate used is the average annual exchange rate for the year N-1. Thus, at the subsidiary level, the following formula provides the energy impact, calculated for natural gas and electricity respectively:\n\nEnergy impact = Share of sales indexed to energy year (N-1) x (Average energy price in year (N) - Average energy price in year (N-1))\n\nThis  indexation  effect  of  electricity  and  natural  gas  does  not impact the operating income recurring.",

These changes in scope of consolidation are determined:\n\n- \u25a0 for  acquisitions  during  the  period,  by  deducting  from  the aggregates for the period the contribution of the acquisition;\n- \u25a0 for acquisitions during the previous period, by deducting from the aggregates for the period the contribution of the acquisition between January 1 of the current period and the anniversary date of the acquisition;\n- \u25a0 for  disposals  during  the  period,  by  deducting  from  the aggregates  for  the  previous  period  the  contribution  of  the disposed entity as of the anniversary date of the disposal;\n\n## INTEGRATED REPORT\n\n## Performance\n\nNote:  exceptionally,  the  acquisition  of  Sasol  production  units  in 2021  had  an  impact  in  2  steps  on  Group  sales.  After  the acquisition  of  the  assets  in  July  2021  (1 st step),  devices  were installed  on  the  units  in  2022  in  order  to  measure  the  energy consumed  which,  from  October  2022  (2 nd step),  could  be  reinvoiced  to  the  customer  according  to  the  standard  Large Industries  contractual  frame.  For  the  sake  of  transparency  in financial  communication,  sales  related  to  energy  consumed  and contractually re-invoiced to the customer are identified within the significant scope and are therefore excluded from the comparable growth.  This  element  has  thus  been  accounted  for  in  the significant scope during 12 months from October 2022.\n\n- \u25a0 for disposals during the previous period, by deducting from the aggregates  for  the  previous  period  the  contribution  of  the disposed entity.\n\n## CALCULATION OF PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (YEAR)\n\n## Comparable sales change and comparable operating income recurring change\n\nComparable  changes  for  sales  and  operating  income  recurring exclude  the  currency,  energy  and  significant  scope  impacts described above .\n\n| (in millions of euros)     | FY 2023   | FY  2023/2022  Published  Growth   | Currency  impact   | Natural  gas  impact   | Electricity  impact   | Significant  scope  impact   | FY 2023/2022  Comparable  Growth   |\n|----------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Revenue                    |           |                                    |                    |                        |                       |                              |                                    |\n| Group                      | 27,608    | -7.8%                              | (1,255)            | (1,765)                | (503)                 | 97                           | +3.7%                              |\n| Impacts in %               |           |                                    | -4.2%              | -5.9%                  | -1.7%                 | +0.3%                        |                                    |\n| Gas & Services             | 26,360    | -7.7%                              | (1,225)            | (1,765)                | (503)                 | 97                           | +4.2%                              |\n| Impacts in %               |           |                                    | -4.2%              | -6.2%                  | -1.8%                 | +0.3%                        |                                    |\n| Operating Income Recurring |           |                                    |                    |                        |                       |                              |                                    |\n| Group                      | 5,068     | +4.2%                              | (318)              | -                      | -                     | (25)                         | +11.4%                             |\n| Impacts in %               |           |                                    | -6.6%              | -                      | -                     | -0.6%                        |                                    |\n| Gas & Services             | 5,271     | +4.1%                              | (311)              | -                      | -                     | (24)                         | +10.8%                             |\n| Impacts in %               |           |                                    | -6.2%              | -                      | -                     | -0.5%                        |                                    |\n\n## Operating margin and operating margin excluding energy\n\nThe  operating  margin  is  the  ratio  of  the  operating  income recurring divided by revenue. The operating margin excluding the energy impact corresponds to operating income recurring (which is not impacted  in  absolute  value  by  the  energy  costs contractually  re-invoiced  to  Large  Industries  customers)  divided by  revenue  restated  for  the  energy  impact  to  which  the corresponding currency impact is attached. The ratio of operating\n\nincome recurring divided by revenue (whether restated or not for the energy impact) is calculated with a one decimal place rounded number.  The  variation  between  2  periods  is  calculated  as  the difference  between  these  rounded  ratios,  which  can  result  in positive  or  negative  differences  compared  to  a  more  precise calculation, due to rounding.\n\n|                            |                | FY 2023   | Natural gas  impact  (a)   | Electricity  impact  (a)   | FY 2023,  excluding  energy impact   |\n|----------------------------|----------------|-----------|----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Revenue                    | Group          | 27,608    | (1,776)                    | (514)                      | 29,898                               |\n|                            | Gas & Services | 26,360    | (1,776)                    | (514)                      | 28,650                               |\n| Operating Income Recurring | Group          | 5,068     |                            |                            | 5,068                                |\n|                            | Gas & Services | 5,271     |                            |                            | 5,271                                |\n| Operating Margin           | Group          | 18.4%     |                            |                            | 17.0%                                |\n|                            | Gas & Services | 20.0%     |                            |                            | 18.4%                                |",

Extra-financial performance\n\nADVANCE , the Group's strategic plan 2022-2025 announced in March 2022, places sustainable development at the heart of the strategy and combines financial and extra-financial performance .\n\nThe  extra-financial  indicators  monitored  by  the  Group  as  part  of  the  ADVANCE  strategic  plan  are  detailed  in  the  Integrated  Report included below (Chapter 1).\n\nThe Extra-financial Performance Declaration is presented in Chapter 5 of this Universal Registration Document. Cross-reference tables which show the relationships between the recommendations from TCFD/ISSB and GRI and the Air Liquide various initiatives and actions taken by Air Liquide are available in Chapter 5 of the present Universal Registration Document - pages 366 to 369.\n\n## 6.1.   ENVIRONMENT\n\nTo achieve its objective of decarbonizing its activities, Air Liquide has adopted procedures to measure and control its CO2 emissions on a quarterly basis. To each geographical zone is allocated an annual carbon budget, and each new project is assessed against the Group's overall decarbonization trajectory.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir Liquide's Scope 1 & 2 CO2 emissions reduction target for 2035 has been validated by the Science Based Targets (SBTi) initiative as being compliant and in line with climate science ( a) . The Group was the first in its industry to obtain this validation from the SBTi.\n\n- (a) Air Liquide announced its greenhouse gas emission reduction objectives for Scopes 1 and 2 in March 2021 on a 2020 baseline. Following the acquisition of the Sasol air separation units in South Africa on June 24, 2021, Air Liquide submitted to SBTi a target on a 2021 baseline in order to integrate this significant change in scope (see page 323).\n\nThe  Group's Scopes  1  and  2  CO2  emissions in  2023  totaled 37.6  million  tonnes  of  CO2  equivalent (1) .  They  were  down -4.7% compared with 2022 and -4.9% compared with the 2020 baseline .  In  a  context  of  soft  demand  from  Large  Industries customers,  the  Group's  main  actions  driving  this  improvement were  the increase  of  voluntary  low-carbon  energy  supplies and  to  a  lesser  extent  the energy  efficiency  projects .  This decrease  of  emissions  was  however  slightly  penalized  by  a deterioration  in  the  electricity  networks  carbon  footprint (2) , especially in Europe.\n\nActions performed in 2023 will contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions in the coming years. Thus, in order to accelerate the decarbonization of its production units , the Group announced in 2023 the signature of long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) ,  for  more  than 1.5  TWh  per  year aiming  to  reduce  its annual  emissions  of  CO2  by around  -1.2  million  tonnes .  Air Liquide  also  decided  on  the  construction  of  a  large  scale (200  MW)  PEM electrolyzer ,  on  the  installation  of  a carbon capture unit  on  one  of  the  Group's  largest  hydrogen  production\n\nunits  and  on  an  industrial  scale  ammonia  cracking  pilot  plant  to further  develop  its  low-carbon  hydrogen  production  portfolio  of solutions. These projects will contribute to the decarbonization of the  Group's  assets  after  the  commissioning  of  these  renewable electricity sources and the start-up of the production units.\n\nWith  these  achievements, Air  Liquide  is  confident  to  achieve  its ADVANCE near term goal of emissions inflection in 2025 .\n\nThe  Group  also  offers  efficient  solutions  to decarbonize  its customers  production  plant and  actively  participates  in  their deployment. Hence, the European Commission granted subsidies to  two  new  carbon  capture  projects  in  Germany  and  in  Belgium which use Air Liquide solutions. This will allow the Group's clients in the cement and lime sectors to decrease their CO2 emissions by  -2.6  million  tonnes  per  year.  In  addition,  Air  Liquide  actively contributes  to  the decarbonization  of  mobility ,  in  particular through  joint  ventures  dedicated  to  hydrogen  distribution  in Europe and Asia.",

Climate solutions\n\nThe  innovation  capacity  and  technological  know-how  of  Air Liquide's  teams  enable  the  Group  to  offer cleaner  and  more sustainable solutions to reduce its own emissions and those of its  industrial  customers,  and  are  helping  to  meet  the  Group's objective to be carbon neutral by 2050 (see page 40).\n\nWith  60  years  of  unique  expertise  across  the  hydrogen  value chain, Air Liquide is working to decarbonize industry and heavy mobility worldwide . In 2023, Air Liquide and Siemens Energy inaugurated  an electrolyzer  gigafactory in  Berlin,  Germany, which  will  enable  the large-scale  production  of  low-carbon hydrogen and promote the emergence of an innovative European ecosystem.  At  the  same  time,  the  two  Groups  have  signed  a development  agreement to  competitively  produce  the  next generation of electrolyzers.\n\nIn  France,  the  hydrogen  refueling  station  network  is  expanding, with eight  new-generation  hydrogen  refueling  stations  sold by the Group in 2023 to HysetCo, a pioneer in hydrogen mobility, which  will  be  able  to  refuel  around 600  vehicles  a  day in  the Paris area. Four new-generation stations have also been sold in Germany and South Korea.\n\nfor heavy-duty  mobility .  In  collaboration  with  H2FLY,  the  first piloted  electric  flight  powered  by  liquid  hydrogen  took  place  in 2023  in  Slovenia.  The  Group designed,  manufactured  and integrated a liquid hydrogen tank and the technologies required to maintain the hydrogen cryogenically at -253\u00b0C on board. This enabled the aircraft to double its maximum range.\n\nAir  Liquide  also  announced  the  enhancement  of  its  hydrogen solutions'  portfolio,  using ammonia conversion  into  hydrogen with new cracking technology . An innovative industrial scale pilot unit in  the  Port  of Antwerp (Belgium) will be operational in 2024.  Ammonia,  composed  of  hydrogen  and  nitrogen,  can  be produced with a low carbon footprint and easily transported over long  distances.  End  users  can  convert  it  to  hydrogen  locally, contributing to the decarbonization of industry and mobility .\n\nCarbon  capture  and  sequestration (CCS)  is  an  efficient technology for capturing the large volumes of CO2 emitted by the sectors that are the highest emitters and hard to abate, thereby reducing  short-  and  mid-term  emissions.  With  its innovative proprietary carbon capture technology , Cryocap\u2122, Air Liquide is  contributing  to  the  decarbonization  of  its  industrial  customers' activities,  particularly  in  the  cement  and  lime  sectors,  with five projects financed by the European Innovation Fund in 2023.\n\nAir  Liquide  continues  to  develop  and  implement  a liquid hydrogen distribution chain ,  which  has  significant  advantages\n\n## 7.2.2.  Digital, data and AI to transform industry and healthcare\n\n## 3.5 billion data points\n\ncollected each day at Air Liquide sites worldwide\n\nTo optimize its own energy consumption , Air Liquide integrates innovative digital solutions into  its  offerings,  enabling  a  better customer,  patient  and  employee  experience,  while  fostering operational excellence .\n\nWith  eight  operational  centers  managing  more  than  200  plants remotely  all  around  the  world,  the Smart  &  Innovative Operations (SIO)  program  relies  on  cutting-edge  data  analysis and  predictive maintenance  technologies  to improve  the reliability of gas production plants while optimizing their energy consumption.  The Integrated  Bulk  Operations  program (IBO) which aims to optimize the end-to-end liquid gas supply chain by digitally  connecting  assets  -  from  production  sites  to  delivery trucks to tanks on customers' sites - continued its development in 2023, collecting and analyzing data to improve the customer experience, operational performance and reduce CO2 emissions across the supply chain.\n\nDigital  is  also  a  powerful  tool  for  home  Healthcare  activity  and allows to accelerate the Value-Based Healthcare approach (see page  31).  Based  on  the  analysis  of  monitoring  data  from thousands of patients living with sleep apnea and their profile, an algorithm can predict the risk of non-adherence of a patient equipped with a connected device, enabling to set up the most appropriate personalized support for this patient profile. Then, the use of a digital solutions such as kairin ,  combining a patient application  designed  to  encourage  their  involvement,  and  a platform promoting exchanges between  Air Liquide and healthcare  professionals,  is  made  available  to improve  the quality of life of patients with a chronic disease. In 2023, 22,000 patients living with sleep apnea have been able to start benefiting from  personalized  support,  particularly  in  Europe,  South  Korea,\n\n## More than 500 projects\n\nusing data and AI\n\nBrazil  and  Australia.  In  2023, more  than  125,000  patients suffering from chronic pathologies in seven countries (in Europe and South Korea) have been using the digital channels developed by Air Liquide.\n\n## 7.2.3.  Advanced materials in Electronics\n\nAir Liquide continues to develop its offer of advanced materials with unique properties ,  marketed  under  the  enScribe\u2122 brand, while respecting the highest quality standards of the semiconductor  industry.  In  2023,  the  use  of  enScribe\u2122  range materials  allowed  etching  at  a  nano-scale, avoiding  the emission  of  162,000  tonnes  of  CO2  equivalent .  To  meet  the challenges of reducing the carbon footprint in the manufacture of integrated circuits , Air Liquide is participating in the Sustainable  Semiconductor  Technologies  and  Systems (SSTS) program, created as part of an Apple initiative and led by IMEC.  The  Electronics  and  Innovation  teams  based  at  the Innovation  Campuses  Tokyo  and  Delaware  collaborate  closely with  the  IMEC's  teams  in  order  to  develop  low  eCO2  etching processes that are proven on IMEC's state-of-art equipment.\n\n## 7.2.4.  Deep tech\n\nJT60-SA,  the  world's  largest  superconducting tokamak (an experimental machine designed to harness the energy of fusion), co-funded by the European Union and Japan, went operational in December  2023.  Air  Liquide designed,  manufactured  and installed  the  cryogenic  equipment needed  to  operate  all  the magnets at a temperature of -269\u00b0C, in collaboration with CEAIrig, and thus advance knowledge in the field of nuclear fusion to harness this low-carbon energy in the future .",

The  Group's performance  was  characterized  by  an increase  in  sales on  a  comparable  basis, a  further  improvement  in  its  operating  margin excluding the energy impact and an accelerating investment momentum , particularly in decarbonization projects.\n\nIn particular, the Group has practically reached, in two years , the margin ambition targeted for 2025 as part of its ADVANCE strategic plan. As a consequence, it is announcing today a doubling of its initial ambition .\n\nAir  Liquide  also  confirms  its  ADVANCE  financial  objectives,  related  to  sales  growth  on  a  comparable  basis  and  Return  on  Capital Employed, as well as its investment decision ambition. In addition, on the extra-financial level, the many decarbonization initiatives give the Group confidence in its objective to combine growth in its business with a reduction in its CO2 emissions in absolute value from 2025.\n\nRevenue reached 27.61 billion euros, an increase of +3.7% on a comparable basis in 2023. On a published basis, it stood at -7.8%, due to the drop in energy prices - energy costs being contractually passed through to Large Industries customers - as well as negative currency impacts. The Gas & Services business, which represented 95% of the Group's revenue, was up +4.2% on a comparable basis. Within  this  activity, all  regions  saw  growth ,  in  particular  the Americas and Europe ,  driven  notably  by Industrial  Merchant and Healthcare .\n\nIn  line  with  its ADVANCE strategic  plan, Air  Liquide  continued  to  improve  its  operational  performance.  The  Group  generated  record efficiencies of 466 million euros , up +23% despite an inflationary context unfavorable to savings on procurement, and continued the dynamic management of its business portfolio. Its ability to provide its customers with value-added offerings allows it to adjust its prices in Industrial Merchant. As a result, the operating margin increased further, by +80 basis points in 2023 excluding the energy impact, and therefore  the  sum  of  improvements  in  the  operating  margin  excluding  energy  impact  in 2022  and  2023 reached +150 basis points . Having practically reached its margin target halfway through ADVANCE which was at +160 basis points, Air Liquide now aims for a +320 basis points increase, twice its initial ambition, over the duration of the plan .\n\nNet profit (Group share) amounted to 3.08 billion euros, up +11.6% as published. Net profit recurring (1) increased by +13.3% excluding the currency impact . Cash flow (2) grew by +12.8% excluding the currency impact. The balance sheet is strong with a net debt to equity ratio of 36.8%. At 10.6% at end-December, recurring ROCE (3) remained well above 10%, in line with the objectives of ADVANCE, despite the increase in investments. Reflecting Air Liquide's confidence in the future, the dividend that will be submitted to the shareholders' vote in April amounts to 3.20 euros per share , i.e. an increase of +8.5% . In addition, a free share attribution is scheduled for June 2024, on the basis of one share for every 10 shares held.\n\nThe investment dynamic of the Group is accelerating, supported in particular by its projects in the energy transition and electronics. The backlog is historically high at 4.4 billion euros. Investment decisions reached a record level of 4.3 billion euros in 2023.\n\nIn  2024,  Air  Liquide  is  confident  in  its  ability  to  further  increase  its  operating  margin  and  to  deliver  growth  in  Net  profit recurring, at constant exchange rates (4) .",

The most pertinent risks are identified in order to be addressed as a matter of priority through the drafting of prevention, mitigation or remedial measures ('Vigilance Plan' section of this chapter - page 90);\n- \u25a0 the EFPD presents the Group's main extra-financial risks and associated mitigation policies. Some of these risks, which meet the requirements of Prospectus Regulation III, are included in the 'Risk factors and management measures' section of this chapter.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES\n\nThe Group identifies the risk factors to which it is exposed using a formal  risk  management  approach.  This  presentation  of  risk factors  and  related  management  measures  is  based  on  the reference framework of the internal control and risk management system, developed under the supervision of the French financial markets authority (AMF). It was prepared with contributions from several departments (particularly Finance, Sustainable Development, Group Control and Compliance, Legal, Safety and Industrial Systems).\n\nThe  risks  presented  below,  at  the  date  of  this  Universal Registration  Document,  are  the  risks  that  the  Group  considers may have a significant  negative  impact  on  its  business,  results, outlook, or reputation, should they occur. The list of these risks is,\n\nhowever, not exhaustive and other risks, unknown at the date of this  document,  could  occur  and  have  a  negative  effect  on  the Group's business.\n\nAs part of its risk management approach, the Group is committed to  regularly  assessing  the  risks  and  reducing  the  likelihood  that they will  occur  or  their  potential  impact  by  implementing  internal control  and  risk  management  procedures,  as  well  as  formalized and  specific  action  plans.  These  procedures,  as  well  as  the Group's  codes  and  policies,  are  included  in  a  global  reference manual,  called  the BlueBook ,  which  is  the  cornerstone  of  the Group's internal control system and risk management.\n\n## Impacts related to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine\n\nDue to the changing geopolitical context and local constraints, the Group's  businesses  in  Russia  are  no  longer  controlled  nor consolidated since September 1, 2022.\n\nNevertheless, at this time Air Liquide remains the owner of nonconsolidated securities. As a result, the Company may bear any risks related to its status as a shareholder. Air Liquide continues to\n\ntake steps to transfer its activities in Russia in the form of a MBO (Management Buy-out), which has been the subject of a letter of intent.  However,  the  project  has  not  yet  been  approved  by  the Russian  authorities,  which  is  a  necessary  step  before  it  can  be finalized.",

In  each  category,  the  most significant risk factors are presented first (in bold).\n\nAlthough  the  risk  categories  have  not  been  listed  in  order  of importance,  the  two  most  significant  specific  risks  for  the  Air Liquide Group are both related to its business: these are industrial risks and industrial investment-related risks.\n\n| Risk categories                          | Risk factors                                                      |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                          | Industrial risks                                                  |\n|                                          | Industrial investment-related risks                               |\n|                                          | Energy sourcing-related risks                                     |\n| Business-related risks                   | Risks relating to the design and construction of production units |\n|                                          | Innovation-related risks                                          |\n|                                          | Human Resources management-related risks                          |\n|                                          | Customer risks                                                    |\n|                                          | Counterparty and liquidity risks                                  |\n| Financial risks                          | Foreign exchange risks                                            |\n|                                          | Interest rate risks                                               |\n|                                          | Tax risks                                                         |\n| Digital risks                            | Digital risks                                                     |\n|                                          | Climate risks: greenhouse gas emissions                           |\n|                                          | Climate risks: physical impact on operations                      |\n| Environmental and societal risks         | Water management risk                                             |\n|                                          | Societal risks (discrimination-related)                           |\n| Geopolitical, regulatory and legal risks | Geopolitical risks                                                |\n|                                          | Regulatory and legal risks                                        |\n\n## 1.   Business-related risks\n\nThe  industrial  gas  business  is  characterized  by  a  significant technology content (both in the design phase and the construction of  production units),  local  production  units,  high  capital  intensity, and substantial energy requirements.\n\nVarious  risks  are  associated  with  these  characteristics.  They  are mitigated  by  various  factors,  including  primarily  the  diversity  of industries  and  customers  served  by  the  Group,  the  multiple  gas applications  that  it  offers  them,  as  well  as  the  large  number  of geographies in which it operates. In addition, a significant share of business  is  subject  to  contracts,  a  strict  investment  project authorization and management process, and a tailored energy policy.\n\n## 1.1.   INDUSTRIAL RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nIndustrial  risks  are  linked  to  the  various  industrial  products, processes  and  distribution  methods  implemented  by  the  Group. They are distributed over a large number of local production sites.\n\nOver and above the usual risks inherent in all industrial activities, Air Liquide's businesses entail more specific risks relating to:\n\n- \u25a0 products: the intrinsic properties of industrial gases manufactured, transformed or packaged by the Group classifies them  in  the  dangerous  materials  category;  the  use  of  these industrial gases  requires  specific  means  of  control  and protection in order to prevent risks such as:\n- -anoxia, associated with inert gases,\n- -over-oxygenation  or  fires,  associated  with  oxygen  and oxygen mixtures or flammable gases,\n- -the toxicity associated with certain specialty gases;\n- \u25a0 processes and their operation:\n- -cryogenics is used to separate gases by distillation, store them  and  transport  them.  This  very  low-temperature\n\ntechnique is connected with a risk of cryogenic burns from liquefied gases,\n\n- -likewise,  high-temperature  techniques,  which  are  used  in particular  in  the  production  of  hydrogen,  are  particularly exposed to risks of burns, fire or explosions,\n- -in  addition,  pressure  is  central  to  the  Group's  processes. Pressurized  equipment  must  be  designed  with  safety devices  which  limit  the  risk  of  accidents  caused  by  an uncontrolled increase of pressure,\n- -for some of these processes, the constantly growing needs of the  Group's  customers  may  require  the  use  of increasingly large equipment or capacity: in certain cases, additional  safety  measures  have  to  be  implemented  to prevent the level of risk from increasing,\n- -lastly,  the  energy  transition  is  driving  the  Group  to  deploy new  technologies,  such  as  PEM  (Proton  Exchange Membrane)  electrolyzers, carbon capture equipment, autothermal  reforming  (ATR)  equipment.  Each  of  these technologies  undergoes  a  prior  in-depth  risk  analysis  in order to define the most appropriate control and protection elements, in close collaboration with the partners that may be involved in the manufacturing of this equipment;\n- \u25a0 logistics and transportation: each year, delivery vehicles, sales staff and technicians travel hundreds of millions of kilometers. Non-compliance with traffic  regulations  or  the  lack  of  regular maintenance  of  vehicles  would  expose  drivers  and  third parties  to  increased  risks  of  accidents.  In  addition,  industrial sites use a lot of motorized lifting equipment, which presents specific  risks  (collision,  falling  cylinders,  etc.).  Training  and certification are thus required to operate them;\n- \u25a0 engineering  and  construction:  industrial  risks  are  factored  in and  must  commence  at  the  design  phase  of  future installations. During the construction phase, the lack of a strict accident  prevention  framework  would  affect  the  coordination among the various stakeholders and expose teams to risks of accidents;\n\n<!-- image -->",

The IMS is based on:\n\n- \u25a0 the  accountability  of  the  departments  of  the  various  Group entities for the implementation of this system;\n- \u25a0 the  issue  of  key  management  and  organizational  procedures that aim to ensure:\n- -compliance with standards and regulations,\n- -competence management (training, qualifications if necessary, etc.),\n- -process risk management,\n- -occupational health, safety and environmental management,\n- -road safety management,\n- -industrial emergency management,\n- -management of change,\n- -management of maintenance,\n- -control of products and services from providers,\n- -management of installation projects,\n- -product development management,\n- -management of production and service provision,\n- -incident reporting and investigation,\n- -management of industrial audits,\n- -deployment of shared technical standards within the Group entities.\n\nThe IMS document base is continuously updated and enriched.\n\nThe Safety and Industrial System Department and the Industrial Departments of the World Business Lines, under the supervision of  a  member of the Executive Committee, supervise and control the implementation of the IMS, by notably relying on:\n\n- \u25a0 various dashboards designed to monitor performance in terms of safety;\n- \u25a0 process  audits  to  verify  the  implementation  conditions  and compliance of operations with IMS requirements;\n- \u25a0 thorough  safety  reviews  prior  to  the  start-up  of  any  new production unit to prevent any accidents due to a construction defect;\n- \u25a0 technical  audits  to  ensure  the  compliance  of  operations  with Group rules.\n\nThe  evolution  of  safety  performances  of  operations  and  of  their level of compliance with IMS requirements are regularly monitored by the Executive Committee as well as by the Environment and Society Committee.\n\n## 1.2.   INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENT-RELATED RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe  Group  may  be  exposed  to  risks  related  to  its  industrial investments.  The  profitability  of  each  investment  project  can  be affected by different factors, related on the one hand to strategic aspects of the project, namely geographical location, assessment of the local context including the economic environment (inflation), customer  quality  and  the  competitiveness  of  its  site  and  the environmental or societal impact of the project; and on the other hand to the proper control of the execution of the project, which includes in particular the relevance of the design, the maturity of the  cost  estimate,  and  lastly  the  quality  and  respect  of construction deadlines and budgets.\n\nMoreover,  in  new  emerging  markets  such  as  those  related  to energy transition, the Group may be exposed, in addition to the above-mentioned risks, to risks related to the degree of maturity of certain technologies and the speed at which these new markets will grow.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe  BlueBook's  Operations  control  policy  sets  out  the  control principles for the Group's industrial investments, the implementation  of  which  is  set  out  in  the  investment  decisions procedure. The latter includes in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 a  detailed  process,  within  the  Resources  and  Investment Committees  (described  in  paragraph  3  of  the  Strategy  and objectives section of Chapter 1 - page 46), for the review and approval  of  investment  requests  based  on  strict  assessment criteria  that  include  in  particular  medium-term  contractual commitments,  as  well  as  consideration  of  the  environmental impact of projects;\n- \u25a0 control of investment decisions through the specific follow-up of  authorizations  granted  as  well  as  contributions  expected and seen during the initial years. In addition, the subsidiaries are  obliged  to  report  (above  certain  thresholds)  all  budget overruns  and  implement  corrective  action  plans  aimed  at ensuring  the  profitability  of  the  investments  concerned;  they are supported by teams of experts ('Group Capital Implementation'  teams)  in  order  to  secure  good  preparation and execution, in particular for the largest projects;\n- \u25a0 more  in-depth  analysis  of  the  profitability  of  certain  major investments  (comparative  analysis  prior  and  subsequent  to completion).\n\n## 1.3.   ENERGY SOURCING-RELATED RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nElectricity  and  natural  gas  are  the  main  raw  materials  used  by production units. Their availability is thus essential to the Group. When  the  local  market  permits,  Group  subsidiaries  secure  the energy sourcing through medium-to long-term supply commitments  and  competitive  bidding  scenarios  with  local suppliers  with  the  objective  of  achieving  the  most  reliable  and competitive energy costs, with a low-carbon footprint, available on the market.",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors and management measures\n\nRisks to which the Group is exposed when sourcing energy and raw materials relate to:\n\n- \u25a0 the supply of energy and raw materials (access and reliability, in particular counterparty risk, etc.);\n- \u25a0 volumes  (non-compliance  with  obligations  and  commitments on volumes, etc.);\n- \u25a0 prices (volatility, competitiveness, etc.);\n- \u25a0 compliance  with  current  regulations  (market  transparency rules, Sapin 2 Law, etc.);\n- \u25a0 changes in local regulations on energy and its deregulation;\n- \u25a0 their carbon footprint.\n\nFinancial risk relating to raw materials is described in note 25.1 to the consolidated financial statements on page 278.\n\nMoreover, and in addition to energy and raw materials, the Group may  be  temporarily  exposed  to  supply  shortages  for  certain molecules which are only produced at a limited number of sites, in particular with worldwide reach, such as helium and rare gases.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nDue  to  the  geographic  spread  of  Group  activities,  its  supply contracts are diversified.\n\nThe management of exposure to specific energy-sourcing risks is described in the Group's Energy management policy and is based on two principles:\n\n- \u25a0 energy purchasing must exclusively cover internal production needs ('own-use');\n- \u25a0 entities pass on energy cost fluctuations to their customers via indexed  invoicing  integrated  into  their  long-term  gas  supply contracts (15 years and more). The risks of supplier shortages/ default are also covered by Force Majeure clauses in customer contracts.\n\nThe Group works to maintain these principles in the context of the supply  of  low-carbon  industrial  gases  produced  from  renewable energy (for which new risks must be taken into account: long-term commitment, fixed price, intermittency, management of environmental certificates, etc.).\n\nThe  'E-Enrisk'  Group  Energy  &  Emissions  Risk  Management Committee reviews the energy sourcing strategies of the entities, examines  the  most  significant  commitments  submitted  to  it  and ensures that commitments made are consistent with the Group's climate  strategy  (both  upstream  of  investment  decisions  and  for existing assets).\n\nThe  composition  of  the  'E-Enrisk'  Committee  is  detailed  in paragraph  5  of  this  chapter  Monitoring  of  control  systems page 88.\n\nMoreover,  risks  relating  to  the  sourcing  of  certain  molecules produced at  a  limited  number  of  sites  with  worldwide  reach  are managed by a strategy of diversifying sources, storing molecules and securing procurement through long-term contracts.\n\n## 1.4.   RISKS RELATING TO THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF PRODUCTION UNITS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nAir  Liquide's  engineering  team  designs  and  builds  production units worldwide which are primarily intended for Group investments, but also for third-party customers.\n\nAs these projects  generally  extend  over  several  years,  they  are exposed,  at  their  various  stages,  to  risks  relating  to  design,\n\npurchasing,  transport  or  construction  and  more  generally  the overall  quality,  schedule  and  costs.  Risks  relating  to  these projects  are  often  greater  during  the  construction  phase,  in particular for turnkey projects:\n\n- \u25a0 the quality and delivery times for critical equipment, on the one hand,  and  on-site  construction  costs  and  deadlines  on  the other  may  give  rise  to  project  start-up  setbacks  and  impact project profitability;\n- \u25a0 unexpected  technical  difficulties  may  also  arise,  in  particular when a new innovative process is implemented;\n- \u25a0 certain projects are located in regions of the world that may be a source of political or economic risks.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nEngineering and project management teams have implemented a risk management system for the development and execution of all its projects (of varying size and complexity and which use different types of technology), which is described in the document specific to this activity, the 'Playbook'.\n\nThis system relies in particular on an Engineering Risk Committee and an Execution Review Board for the project management part. It aims to ensure a good risk assessment throughout the life of the projects as well as the implementation of appropriate management measures:\n\n- \u25a0 during the development stage: by identifying potential threats (but  also  opportunities)  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the project's  objectives  during  the  forthcoming  execution  stage, thus allowing adequate decisions to be made;\n- \u25a0 during the execution stage: by continuing to regularly assess and mitigate already-identified risks which could change, occur or disappear, but also by identifying and dealing with any new threats  which  could  have  an  impact  on  the  contractual commitments (suppliers and third parties), technical integrity or performance of the project right through until its completion.\n\n## 1.5.   INNOVATION-RELATED RISKS\n\n## 1.5.1.  Technology-related risks\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe  Group  operates  in  a  fast-moving  environment,  with  the emergence of new products, new players, new business models and  new  technologies,  thus  creating  a  strong  need  for technological  developments  in  its  main  markets,  such  as hydrogen energy or even healthcare. These changes may impact the  Group's  activities  or  its  position  in  a  market.  The  Group's growth possibilities, therefore, depend on its ability to respond to this change over time.\n\nIn  terms  of  digital  technologies,  the  Group  is  facing  remarkable transformation  challenges  with  possible  impacts  on  its  business model,  its  organization  and,  ultimately,  its  competitiveness.  The risk  to  which  the  Group  is  exposed  is  linked  in  particular  to  the rapid increase in the nature and volume, availability, security and quality  of  data,  whether  from  customers  and  patients  or  its  own assets.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe  Group  has  introduced  a  dedicated  structure  to  roll  out  its innovation strategy which focuses on two objectives: contributing to  its  operational  excellence  and  long-term  performance,  based on new offerings, technologies and services. The Innovation and Development  Division  (IDD)  therefore  steers  the  innovation strategy on behalf of the Group's hubs, World Business Lines and operations, and contributes to the Group's sustainable growth.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To  do  this,  it  relies  in  particular  on  the  strong exploration capacity of the Group's R&D, its organization as close as  possible  to  its  customers  with  six  Campuses  on  three continents, and its integration in innovation ecosystems.\n\nThe Group continually adapts its innovative approach and invests each year in Research & Development and digital technology. In recent years, it has strengthened its open innovation approach, in particular with  the  signing  of  long-term  joint  development agreements with key partners, regarding:\n\n- \u25a0 the  energy  transition  and  preservation  of  the  planet  (a significant  portion  of  the  innovation  spend  is  allocated  to  the elaboration of new processes which consume less energy and allow CO2 emissions to be reduced);\n- \u25a0 healthcare;\n- \u25a0 digital, data and artificial intelligence;\n- \u25a0 deep  tech  (disruptive  technologies):  cryogenic  equipment, space exploration, etc.\n\nFive  Innovation  Campuses  and  one  Technologies  Campus, located  across  the  globe,  aim  to  create  a  connected  network which  is  open  to  its  innovation  partners  -  universities  and technology  institutes,  suppliers,  customers  and  start-ups;  the Group thus  relies  on  an  ecosystem  made  up  of  more  than  400 external partners.\n\nThe  Group  has  put  in  place  a  robust  innovation  governance process,  from  idea  to  market.  In  particular,  it  reviews  initiatives whose results are not at the expected level (see paragraph 3.4 of the Strategy and objectives section in Chapter 1 - page 48), and prioritizes initiatives with the highest impact each year.\n\nThe  Group  is  introducing  digital  solutions,  data  and  artificial intelligence into its internal operations and as part of its offerings, to  improve  efficiency  and  in  particular  help  steer  its  industrial activities with greater speed and agility. For example, the rollout of Smart & Innovative Operations Centers which facilitate the remote management of production at its sites, by drawing on predictive data  analysis  and  artificial  intelligence  is  one  illustration  of  this. Moreover, the rollout of the Integrated Bulk Operations digitization program,  aimed  at  digitizing  the  liquid  products  supply  chain, provides  Industrial  Merchant  customers  around  the  world  with access to a service that guarantees greater reliability and safety, while  improving  the  Group's  efficiency  and  reducing  its  carbon footprint.\n\n## 1.5.2.  Intellectual property-related risks\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe  global  environment  shows  particular  interest  in  intellectual property as well as, in certain jurisdictions, greater attention to the protection  of  trade  secrets.  The  Group's  business  is  not significantly dependent on technologies patented by third parties; it relies mainly on technologies, processes, designs and software developed  internally,  in  particular  by  its  Innovation,  Digital  &  IT, Engineering & Construction teams, its World Business Lines, and Operations  teams.  Innovation  is  also  increasingly  achieved  in partnership  with  third  parties;  the  Group  develops  certain innovative  businesses  through  partnerships,  buying  shares  in innovative entities, or acquisitions.\n\nLimitations on the Group's ability to protect, retain or enforce its intellectual property rights, including its trade secrets, could result in  a  loss  of  revenue  and  any  competitive  advantage  that  the Group  holds.  Third  parties  may  also  be  able  to  develop  an independent  technology  similar  to  that  of  Air  Liquide  without infringing  its  intellectual  property  rights  or  having  access  to  its trade secrets, which could harm the Group's financial position or profitability.\n\nAir  Liquide,  through  its  technologies,  processes,  designs  and software,  always  makes sure to respect the intellectual  property rights of others. If a third party claims otherwise and in the event of litigation, regardless of the merits, such claims generally result in  significant  legal  costs,  including  potential  damage  to  the Group's reputation. Risks may also arise in the treatment of third parties  confidential  information,  including  trade  secrets,  in  the Group's  day-to-day  operational  activities  or  in  the  context  of collaborations.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nGovernance  relating  to  intellectual  property  and  related  risk management  principles  are  set  out  in  the  Group  Policy  and procedures aimed at:\n\n- \u25a0 ensuring  the  protection  of  the  Group's  intellectual  assets,  by protecting  the  Group's  inventions,  designs,  brands  and software;\n- \u25a0 ensuring  that  Air  Liquide  complies  with  all  valid  intellectual property rights of third parties in all its areas of activity;\n- \u25a0 in  the  case  of  partnerships  and  collaborations  with  third parties,  supporting  stakeholders  within  the  Group  to  manage risks related to intellectual property;\n- \u25a0 raising  awareness  among  employees  of  the  risks  relating  to intellectual property.\n\nTo  this  end,  the  Group  relies  on  an  Intellectual  Property Department  whose  employees  are  based  at  the  Group's  head office and in the main geographic regions.\n\nTo  the  Group's  knowledge,  there  are  no  legal  or  arbitration proceedings  relating  to  intellectual  property,  either  current  or threatened, which may have or have had, in the past 12 months, significant impacts on the Group's financial situation or profitability.\n\n## 1.6.   HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT RELATED RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe long-term performance of the Air Liquide Group is driven, in particular,  by  the  quality  of  its  employees,  their  skills  and  their commitment.\n\nIn its businesses, the Group aims to:\n\n- \u25a0 attract and maintain the required skills at the right time and in the  right  place,  in  particular  in  markets  where  the  Group  is expanding  its activities, or in geographies  where  the employment market is strained;\n- \u25a0 monitor  and  ensure  the  availability  of  technical  and,  if necessary,  certified  skills  to  guarantee  the  continuity  of  the Group's activities;\n- \u25a0 develop  skills,  in  particular with the digitization of its businesses and the emergence of new skills (data science and artificial intelligence, etc.) and new professions (Hydrogen).",

The Group, therefore, identifies and  applies  the  applicable  laws  and regulations,  in  particular  in  terms  of  working  conditions  and freedom of association.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe Group is committed to identifying, attracting and developing the necessary scientific, technical and digital skills required for its growth, the efficient working of its operations and innovation. The Human Resources policy defines the main rules, together with the roles and  responsibilities  of  the  different  parties  in  their implementation, with respect to, among others:\n\n- \u25a0 acquisition  and  sustainability  of  the  necessary  skills. Training is  provided  under  the  Air  Liquide  University  brand  with,  in particular, reinforced e-learning courses followed by more than 48,805 users in 2023 in a wide range of domains (ethics and anti-corruption, industrial safety, competition law, digital security,  management,  sustainable  development,  etc.).  In 2023, Air Liquide continued to roll out Workday, its new Human Resources  management  tool.  Training  is  therefore  mainly managed in Workday Learning for most geographies;\n- \u25a0 support for employees  in  their individual development throughout their careers, notably through Workday Talent, the new career and skills management tool;\n- \u25a0 changes in working methods  within the Group. The organization  of  work  must  therefore  not  only  meet  the demands  and  expectations  of  today's  employees  and  of  Air Liquide, but also those of tomorrow, while being based on the Group's  fundamentals.  The  result  of  a  co-creation  bringing together more than 700 employees, the Group thus deployed its BeActEngage  model,  which  allows  its  employees  to develop in a safe, ethical and engaging environment to deliver long-term performance;\n- \u25a0 measuring and recognizing the performance and contributions of  all  employees.  In  addition  to  employee  remuneration  and loyalty policies (regular capital increases reserved for employees),  specific  provisions  aimed  at  promoting  and sustaining  certain  skills,  such  as  inventor  and  innovator recognition  programs,  the  technical  expertise  development scheme  (Technical  Community  Leaders)  in  a  wide  range  of fields  such  as  industrial  operations,  industrial  safety  and digital.\n\nMore generally, the Group ensures the building of a performancefocused,  attractive  and  collaborative  professional  environment while  also  safeguarding  the  health  and  well-being  of  Group employees in their workplace. The measurement and monitoring of  the  commitment  of  employees  are  carried  out  using  an employee  feedback  tool  called  'My  Voice'.  Operations  and support  functions  use  the  results  from  My  Voice  to  define  and implement tailored action plans.\n\n(1)\n\nThe growth in working from home has increased the use of digital tools to ensure business continuity. Employees' adjustment to this new way of working was facilitated by the existence of a digital and  collaborative  environment  that  had  already  been  rolled  out within the Group several years ago, as well as the development of virtual  training  courses  covering  remote  working  and  team management. In this context of changing organizational models, the Group has rolled out a global project called 'Next Normal', to support the transformation of work organization.\n\n## 1.7.   CUSTOMER RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe primary customer risk is the risk of bankruptcy or closure of a customer's production site. More generally, the business of some of the Group's customers may be interrupted following natural or man-made  disasters,  including  those  resulting  from  changes  in weather  conditions,  pandemics,  climate  change,  or  following major political events.\n\nThe  amount  of  operating  receivables  as  well  as  provisions  for doubtful receivables are shown in note 17 'Trade receivables' to the consolidated financial statements on page 257.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe  diversity  of  the  Group's  geographic  presence  across 72 countries (1) ,  as  well  as  the  industries  and  sectors in which it works, helps distributing customer risk. The Group's entities serve a  very  large  number  of  customers  (more  than  two  million worldwide)  in  a  broad  range  of  industries:  chemicals,  steel, metals,  refining,  food,  pharmaceuticals,  automotive,  healthcare, electronics, photovoltaics, research laboratories, etc.\n\nThe  Group's  largest  customer  represents  less  than  2%  of revenue, the Group's top 10 customers represent around 12% of sales and the top 50 customers represent around 30% of sales.\n\nA  significant  part  of  the  Industrial  Gas  business  is  covered  by customer  contracts,  with  commitment  periods  specific  to  the relevant business line:\n\n- \u25a0 the  Large  Industries  business  and  a  third  of  the  Electronics business  mainly  rely  on  15-  to  20-year  take-or-pay  secured contracts,  ensuring  a  guaranteed  minimum  revenue  and offering strong future cash flow predictability;\n- \u25a0 the  contracts  in  the  Industrial  Merchant  business,  generally with  a  duration  of  one  to  five  years,  also  include  services relating to storage and cylinders over the lifetime of the supply contract;\n- \u25a0 in  the  Healthcare  business,  positions  vary  between  health systems,  with  certain  countries  awarding  one  to  five-year contracts  on  a  regional  and  pathology  basis  following invitations to tender.\n\nFinally, the impact on the Group of the risks of customer business interruption following major climatic or political events is limited by the  wide  diversity  of  countries  in  which  it  operates.  This  impact can be offset by the necessary recourse to gases or equipment manufactured  by  the  Group  in  critical  situations.  Gases  are needed  to  secure  industrial  or  chemical  facilities  (inert  gases), maintain local industrial activity (essential to industrial processes) or even sustain life (medical gases and equipment). The Group's businesses are therefore often protected or prioritized depending on the situation.",

Financial risks\n\nThe Group's financial policy sets out the management principles for  the  financial  risks  to  which  its  business  is  exposed.  In  this context, the Group has defined and regularly reviews the terms of the  financial  procedures  which  forbid  speculative  transactions notably on financial instruments.\n\nFinancial decision-making governance is the responsibility of the two  Finance  Committees  (Strategic  Finance  Committee  and Operational  Finance  Committee),  with  the  former  considering issues relating to the financing strategy and the latter dealing with the practical methods of its implementation.\n\n## 2.1.   COUNTERPARTY AND LIQUIDITY RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nCounterparty risk primarily relates to trade receivables, outstanding  amounts  on  short-term  investments  and  derivative hedging instruments, and to credit facilities contracted with each bank.\n\nTrade receivables risks relate to receivables on the balance sheet that may remain unpaid in the long term, in particular in the event of the financial hardship of a customer.\n\nShort term Investment and deposit risk is mainly related to shortterm  deposits  in  the  event  that  one  of  the  Group's  key  banks defaults and, to a lesser extent, an impairment loss due to the use of monetary funds for a portion of the portfolio.\n\nHedging  derivative  risk  relates  to  the  positive  market  value  of transactions which would be lost in the event of the default of one or  more  counterparties,  and  the  need  to  substitute  new  hedges under potentially less favorable conditions.\n\nFinally, the main risk related to credit facilities is that the facility is unavailable in the case of a drawdown.\n\nNote  25.1  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  describes counterparty  and  liquidity  risk  for  the  year  ended December  31, 2023 (page 276).\n\nNotes  17.1  and  17.2  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements provide a breakdown of trade and other operating receivables and provisions for doubtful receivables on page 257.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nWith  industrial  projects  and  acquisition  transactions,  customer counterparty  risk  is  one  of  the  key  elements  assessed  by  the Resources and Investments Committees.\n\nFor long-term contracts, an assessment of a potential customer's credit  profile  is  carried  out  before  any  contact  is  made.  This assessment  is  then  taken  into  account  in  the  payment  terms proposed to customers.\n\nFor  the  Group's  major  customers  (in  2023,  169  customers, generating around 40% of sales), counterparty risk is monitored on  a  monthly  basis  using  ratings  provided  by  financial  rating agencies,  or  via  an  internal  financial  rating  when  an  explicit published rating does not exist. The actual structure of contracts, in particular for Large Industries and Electronics, reduces risks in that  these  medium  to  long-term  contracts  include  safeguarding clauses for the Group.\n\nIn certain cases (mainly Europe and the United States), the risk of losses  on  certain  trade  receivables  is  transferred  to  the  banks through non-recourse factoring programs.\n\nMoreover,  to  reduce  risks  relating  to  the  default  of  a  financial counterparty, the Group has adopted a conservative approach to its short-term investments and only works with leading banks and financial institutions rated at least A or A2 by Standard & Poor's or Moody's,  over  the  long  term,  except  in  exceptional  and  justified circumstances.\n\nInvestments must therefore be made with key banks (i.e. leading banks  selected  according  to  their  financing  resources,  their geographical and product coverage, ESG performance, as well as their financial stability), with maturities of less than three months, be highly liquid and have low volatility. The ratings of key banks and risk indicators  available  on  the  markets  are  monitored  on  a daily basis using real-time financial information services.\n\nCash pooling with the help of international cash pooling (a daily leveling  system  towards  Air  Liquide  Finance)  and  the  policy  of annual  extraction  of  subsidiaries'  dividends  also  helps  limit  the amount of local cash in each country.\n\nTo  minimize  the  risk  relating  to  the  market  value  of  hedging derivatives  used  to  manage  currency  and  interest  rate  risk  and that of fluctuations in raw material and energy prices, the Group works  with  its  key  banks  on  one  hand,  while  also  ensuring  it diversifies  its  transactions.  These  transactions  are  governed  by Framework contracts ( F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Bancaire Fran\u00e7aise or International  Swaps  and  Derivatives Association  contracts).  The Group has decided not to use a collateralization mechanism due to  the  low  average  duration  of  these  derivatives  and  the  cash fluctuations that may result from margin call mechanisms.\n\nLastly,  in  terms  of  financing,  to  ensure  its  development  and independence, the Group sees that it has permanent liquidity, i.e. sufficient financing capacities with a wide and diversified panel of key banks and money and bond markets, including a responsible and  sustainable  financing  framework  (Sustainable  Financing Framework  making  it  possible  to  issue  green  bonds)  that  is available at any time and at the lowest cost.\n\n## 2.2.   FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe Group, due to its international presence, is naturally exposed to  foreign  currency  fluctuations  with,  on  one  hand,  a  transaction risk and, on the other hand, a risk relating to the translation of its financial statements into euros (the Group's reporting currency).\n\nForeign  exchange  transaction  risk  relates,  on  one  hand,  to  the foreign currency commercial cash flows of operating entities and, on  the  other  hand,  cash  flows  arising  from  royalties,  technical support and dividends.\n\nTranslation risk relates to the publication of the Group's financial statements in euros from the entities' financial statements in local currencies,  without  an  impact  on  the  profitability  of  the  Group's businesses.\n\nNote  24.5  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  presents  net debt by currency on page 273 and note 25.1 to the consolidated financial  statements  on  pages  274  to  278  describes  the  foreign exchange  risk  management  process,  as  well  as  the  derivative hedging  instruments  used  and  sensitivity  to  foreign  currency exchange rates.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nSince industrial and medical gases are not transported over long distances, most products are manufactured in the country where they  are  sold.  The  Group  considers  that  its  activities  and  its profitability have a low level of exposure to currency fluctuations.",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors and management measures\n\nThe Group has nevertheless defined methods for hedging its main foreign  exchange  risks,  whether  this  is  borne  by  the  holding companies  or  the  operating  entities,  in  terms  of  authorized hedging  instruments,  the  decision  process  and  the  execution  of transactions.\n\nThese  measures  are  supplemented  by  management  rules adapted  to  local  circumstances,  which  are  aimed  at  ensuring compliance and security of transactions and optimizing management.\n\nThe application of this financial policy is controlled by the Finance Department. The majority of transactions are executed directly on a  centralized  basis  with  the  subsidiaries  and  over-the-counter markets, which is completed by consolidated reports provided by various Group entities on a monthly or quarterly basis, depending on the type of risk.\n\nThe  activities  are  managed  on  the  basis  of  highly  separated duties, using a multilateral negotiation platform, cash management  software,  and  a  communication  platform  linked  to the  international  banking  communication  network  'SWIFT'.  An independent  auditor  was  commissioned  in  2021  to  conduct  an annual  assessment  of  the  Group's  level  of  compliance  with  the Swift  Customer Security Program. The assessment showed that the  ecosystem  and  internal  security  procedures  are  in  line  with Swift requirements.\n\nFurthermore, the Group provides a natural hedge and reduces its exposure  to  exchange  rate  fluctuations  by  raising  debt  in  the currency  of  the  cash  flows  generated  to  repay  the  debt.  Thus, financing is raised either in local currency or, when sales contracts are  indexed  in  euros  or  US  dollars,  in  hard  currencies  (EUR  or USD).\n\n## 2.3.   INTEREST RATE RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe interest rate risk  is  mainly  linked  to  the  fluctuation  of  future cash flows on debt when the rate is variable.\n\nIn  addition,  in  the  case  of  a  significant  increase  in  interest  rates upon future renewals of bonds, the Group may find itself obliged to  devote  a  more  significant  portion  of  cash  flows  from  its operational activities to service its debt.\n\nNote 24.3 to the consolidated financial statements - page 271 presents  the  fixed-rate  portion  of  debt  and  note  25.1  to  the consolidated financial statements - pages 274 to 278 - describes the  sensitivity  of  the  Group's  financial  expenses  to  interest  rate fluctuations and the interest rate repricing schedule for fixed-rate debt and interest rate risk hedging instruments.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe Group's strategy is to maintain, over a medium to long-term period, a majority of total debt at fixed rates, notably by using firm or option hedges.\n\nCentralized interest rate hedging methods have also been defined for each major currency in which debt is held (in particular EUR, USD,  JPY,  and  CNY,  which  represent  around  85%  of  total  net debt) including:\n\n- \u25a0 the  selection  of  authorized  tools,  in  particular  swaps  and interest rate options;\n- \u25a0 hedging decision processes;\n- \u25a0 methods of executing transactions.\n\nFor debt in other currencies, rules have been defined in order to ensure  that  the  transactions  initiated  to  hedge  interest  rate  risk are consistent with Group objectives.\n\nMoreover,  pre-hedging  transactions  for  future  highly  probable issues are regularly implemented to protect the Group against an increase in interest rates.\n\nWith  few  exceptions,  all  interest  rate  transactions  are  centrally processed by Air Liquide Finance, and regularly valued using both internally designed tools and an independent specialized firm.\n\n## 2.4.   TAX RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe  Group  is  exposed  to  tax  risk  in  certain  countries,  due  to changes in applicable regulations, which may have an impact on its activities or its results. This risk may arise from:\n\n- \u25a0 unfavorable changes in local or international regulations;\n- \u25a0 challenges  in  the  application  of  current  regulations  or standards;\n- \u25a0 errors when completing tax returns;\n- \u25a0 regular audits by  tax  authorities  which  could  lead  to disagreements over the interpretation of facts.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nAs far as tax is concerned, the Group focuses on complying with laws  and  regulations.  Modifications  of  laws  and  regulations  are followed  and  monitored  by  its  Tax  Department  and  its  local Finance Departments.\n\nThe Group's tax Charter supports its ambition to remain a leader in its sector by acting in a responsible manner, consistent with the Group's  long-term  growth  strategy.  Air  Liquide  has  defined  the following  principles  which  govern  its  tax  policy,  in  line  with article L. 22-10-36 of the French Commercial Code:\n\n- \u25a0 Group entities must respect the laws and regulations in force, as  well  as  the  international  standards  that  affect  it  such  as those  of  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and Development (OECD), in particular on transfer prices;\n- \u25a0 Group  entities  ensure  that  tax  returns  and  payments  are completed in compliance with local regulations. They complete the required tax returns according to the jurisdictions in which the Group operates;\n- \u25a0 the Group is committed to acting with integrity in all tax-related matters. It aims to operate in a transparent manner and build constructive, long-term relationships with the tax authorities;\n- \u25a0 the  Group  deals  with  tax-related  matters  by  banning  tax havens and does not make use of shell corporations without economic or commercial substance;\n- \u25a0 the  Group  protects  value  for  its  Shareholders  by  taking measures to minimize double taxation phenomena. Furthermore, it acts to minimize fiscal risk. Its tax strategy is in line  with  the  Group's strategy and complies with the Code of Conduct.\n\n## Tax policy followed by the Group\n\nAir  Liquide  applies  a  tax  compliance  and  transparency  policy, guaranteed by the presence of qualified and dedicated teams of tax  experts  who  are  up  to  date  with  the  latest  tax  reforms  and respect the Group's values. The Group is committed to acting with integrity  in  all  tax-related  matters.  In  the  countries  where  it operates, the Group maintains transparent, constructive and longterm relationships with the tax authorities, providing them with the information  they  need  within  a  reasonable  period  of  time.  L'Air Liquide  S.A.,  on  its  own  behalf  and  on  behalf  of  its  integrated French  subsidiaries,  is  the  first  company  to  sign  the  'Fiscal Partnership'  with  the  French  tax  authorities.  By  signing  this partnership in March 2019, L'Air Liquide S.A. and its subsidiaries have  entered  a  trust-based,  transparent  relationship  with  the French  tax  authorities.  This  commitment  continues  without interruption.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  does  not  use  structures  that  lack  economic  or commercial substance.\n\nIt  applies  the  arm's  length  principle  to  transfer  pricing  and  does not  use  transfer  pricing  as  a  tax  planning  tool.  As  the  Group's organizational structure is decentralized, its intra-group transactions are very limited and do not represent more than 15% of total sales. The Group applies an intra-group cash flow policy that complies with the OECD principles.\n\nAir Liquide complies with the \"Country-by-Country Reporting\" (CBCR) obligations.\n\n## Organization and governance of the tax function\n\nThe subsidiaries' tax affairs are the responsibility of their Finance Departments.  Due  to  their  size,  some  subsidiaries  have  a specialized Tax Department reporting to the Finance Department, such as in France, the United States, Germany, China, Canada, Italy,  Benelux  and  Spain.  In  some  cases,  a  geographic  hub Tax Department reporting to the hub's Finance Department has been\n\n## 3.   Digital risks\n\n## 3.1.   DIGITAL RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe Group's activities, expertise and, more generally, its relations with all the stakeholders (suppliers, customers, banks, communities of  experts,  etc.)  depend  on  increasingly  dematerialized  and digitized  operations.  These  operations  are  based  on  information systems  and  interdependent  communication  networks  to  be secured  to  preserve  their  integrity,  availability,  security  and confidentiality  of  data,  sometimes  subject  to  specific  regulations. Given  the  Group's  global  markets,  industrial  sites  and  the  still significant level of cyber threats, this risk is considered high for Air Liquide and addressed accordingly by the organization.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe  Digital  Security  Policy  describes  the  digital  security  issues, sets  the  basic  rules  governing  the  handling  of  associated  risks, and  outlines  the  roles  and  responsibilities  in  this  area.  It  is accompanied by:\n\n- \u25a0 codes  outlining  principles  to  be  respected  by  users  and  IT administrators;\n- \u25a0 procedures  describing,  in  particular,  how  to  secure  data  and applications, detect and deal with incidents.\n\nThe Digital Security Department, attached to the General Control and Compliance Department, defines the main areas of focus in a multi-year  operational  program,  and  specifies  the  short-term action  plans,  in  the  light  of  a  risk  analysis  updated  annually.  It coordinates  them  in  collaboration  with  the  Digital  &  IT  teams, among  others,  and  deploys  them  by  relying  on  dedicated resources in the hubs, clusters, World Business Lines and World Business Units. The main lines of work revolve around:\n\n- \u25a0 risk prevention and awareness raising for employees regarding issues such as fraud and the theft of personal and confidential\n\nset  up  to  coordinate  taxation  in  several  countries,  such  as  in South-East Asia and Africa/Middle East.\n\nAll  these  country  or  regional Tax  Departments have a functional link with the Group's Tax Department, which is based at the Head Office.  The  latter  coordinates  the  network  of  tax  teams,  in particular  through  regular  meetings  to  identify  significant  issues, provide  the  appropriate  technical  support  and  the  necessary guidance.  As  the  Group's  businesses  make  it  a  significant contributor  to  the  tax  revenues  of  the  countries  in  which  it operates,  and  since  the  Group  is  faced  with  a  high  number  of taxes  and  duties,  and  certain  countries  have  unstable  tax regimes, the Tax Departments conduct a tax watch.\n\nThe  Group  Tax  Department  is  part  of  the  Group's  Finance Department. It maintains links with the various financial, legal and other  organizations  in  order  to  keep  abreast  of  the  Group's operations.  It  participates  in  the  Finance  Committee,  an  internal Group committee, to ensure the tax position complies with the Tax Charter. The Department presents the Group's main tax risks to the  Audit  and  Accounts  Committee  at  least  once  a  year.  In addition, given the importance of the negotiations underway at the OECD  to  develop  the  so-called  Pillar  1  and  Pillar  2  rules,  the Group's  Tax  Department  joined  since  2021  the  OECD  working groups and will participate constructively in this work for as long as necessary.\n\ndata,  with  teaching  tools  such  as  e-learning  courses  on information  protection  (notably  personal  or  sensitive  data)  or the  use  of  IT  tools  and  phishing  campaigns  (with  a  focus  on employees who have been repeatedly tricked). Risk prevention  measures  in  the  event  of  remote  working  have been strengthened, in particular in the management of remote access to IT systems;\n\n- \u25a0 protection  of  critical  applications,  of  the  most  sensitive information,  of  industrial  assets,  as  well  as  taking  digital security  into  account  from  the  project  design  phase,  as  an intrinsic dimension of any digital solution;\n- \u25a0 monitoring of digital threats, information leaks and major cyber incidents that could affect the Group's activities: this involves penetration  testing  (which  is  increasingly  automated),  the implementation of a system to report information leaks as well as monitoring of Group applications that are exposed on the Internet;\n- \u25a0 implementing regulatory compliance for the organization using specific projects or programs such as respecting the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); for the latter, a framework agreement  was  drafted  governing  sharing  of  personal  data within  the  Group,  and  a  mechanism  for  the  handling  and processing of complaints was introduced; now deployed in all businesses  and  geographies,  annual  controls  (supplemented by occasional audits) ensure its sustainability. Other regulations have also required specific local action plans (for example the 'Personal Information Protection Law' in China);\n- \u25a0 the  Group's  resilience  through  the  department  in  charge  of incident  detection/reaction,  crisis  simulation  exercises  (at  the base  and  hub  levels),  and  implementation  of  a  business continuity plan in the event of an interruption of IT systems.",

Climate risks: greenhouse gas emissions\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nAir  Liquide's  business model is based on the outsourcing of the industrial gas needs of its customers who often emit greenhouse gases  themselves,  in  particular  in  the  metals,  chemicals  and refining  industries.  This  outsourcing  is  justified  by  Air  Liquide's expertise which allows them to optimize the energy consumption of  production  tools  and  favor  low-carbon  energy  procurement. However,  it  leads  to  the  transfer  of  a  portion  of  the  customer's greenhouse gas emissions to the Group.\n\nNearly  85%  of  Air  Liquide's  large  production  units  are  Air Separation  Units  (ASU),  which  do  not  use  any  combustion processes and therefore do not emit CO2. The only raw material they use is air, with the energy required to separate the air being consumed almost exclusively in the form of electricity. Electricity used by the Group to power these units generate CO2 emissions at  electricity  suppliers;  such  emissions  are  classified  as  indirect emissions (Scope 2).\n\nThe Group's two other main CO2-emitting activities are hydrogen production by steam reforming and co-generation. These account for  nearly  15%  of  large  production  units  and  use  combustion processes emitting CO2, known as direct emissions (Scope 1).\n\nIn  this  respect,  the  climate  risk  (greenhouse  gas  emissions)  is closely  linked  to  the  implementation  by  public  authorities  of greenhouse gas emission reduction policies such as, for example, the  introduction  of  a  carbon  price  or  more  stringent  regulations, that may impact:\n\n- \u25a0 either  the  Group's  plants  (direct  impact  on  the  operational scope),  resulting  in  increased  production  costs,  which  by contract would be transferred to the customers, and the need for new investments;\n- \u25a0 or those of its suppliers, resulting in suppliers price increases;\n- \u25a0 or customers (indirect impact on the value chain), impacting for instance their market, processes and industrial gases needs.\n\nAir  Liquide  is  present  in  regions  across  the  globe  that  have implemented or are in  the  process  of  implementing  greenhouse gas emissions trading schemes. If the share of emissions covered by  free  allowances  decreases,  the  Group  may  be  required  to introduce compensatory measures. It should be noted that longterm contracts foresee a transfer of CO2 costs to customers.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nTo reinforce the climate objectives announced in November 2018 which  set  the  framework  under  which  the  Group  takes  active measures for the climate in its operations, with its customers and ecosystems  by  offering low -carbon solutions, Air Liquide announced new sustainable development objectives on March 23, 2021. In line with the Paris Agreement, and to face the urgency of taking  climate  change  and  energy  transition  into  account,  Air\n\nLiquide has shown its commitment by setting itself the ambition of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, with two major intermediate milestones:\n\n- \u25a0 the start of reduction of absolute CO2 emissions around 2025;\n- \u25a0 a -33% reduction in Scopes 1 and 2 CO2 emissions (1) by 2035, compared  with  a  'market-base'  2020  Scopes  1  and  2 baseline (2) .\n\nThe  objective  of  reducing  carbon  intensity  by  -30%  by  2025 relative to 2015 emissions (3) has been maintained.\n\nA  Climate  Policy  published  in  the  BlueBook  in  2022  aims  to consolidate  the  principles  governing  Climate  risk  management within the Group, as well as across the entire value chain.\n\nThe monitoring and achievement of the Group's climate objectives are based on:\n\n- \u25a0 the  internal  greenhouse  gas  emission  monitoring  procedure, which  sets  out  the  monitoring  of  current  greenhouse  gas emission  regulatory  obligations  with  which  the  Group  must comply;  the  methodology  for  calculating  Scopes  1  and  2 emissions, as well as the reporting scope and frequency;\n- \u25a0 integration of the monitoring of the CO2 trajectory performance in  the  Group's management process, in particular the budget process, which now includes the allocation of a carbon budget to the various geographies, as well as quarterly monitoring by geography  and  business  line  at  the  Executive  Committee level;\n- \u25a0 a review of investment decisions, taking climate factors - and in  particular  a  CO2  price  -  into  consideration,  along  with  an analysis of the opportunities and risks associated with energy transition.  For  all  its  projects,  for  all  geographies,  and  even those  without  a  current  official  price  for  CO2,  Air  Liquide integrates  a  CO2  price  sensitivity  study  into  its  investment decision  process.The  Group's  investment  policy  described  in the BlueBook requires this analysis to be carried out using a price of \u20ac50 per ton of CO2, the current local price, as well as a high  value  of  \u20ac100  or  more  per  ton,  chosen  according  to geography and context;\n- \u25a0 the  roll  out  of  the  'Climate  Champions'  network  and  the regular  review  of  the  decarbonization  plan  of  each  cluster (group of countries);\n- \u25a0 the assumption of the introduction, in the regions in which the Group  operates,  of  public  policies  aimed  at  stepping  up  the transition  toward  a  low-carbon  economy that  is  in  line  with  a 'well below 2\u00b0C' trajectory, validated in 2022 by SBTi (Science Based Targets Initiative).\n\nIn  addition,  access  to  renewable  energy  is  a  key  factor  in  the management of the Group's climate risk.\n\nFinally, information regarding the European Union (EU) 'Taxonomy Regulation'  is  available  in  section  5  of  the  Extra-Financial Performance Declaration section of Chapter 5 - page 355.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Climate risks: physical impact on Operations\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nAir  Liquide  operates  in  certain  regions  of  the  world  exposed  to changes (in severity  or  frequency)  in  exceptional  meteorological phenomena due to climate change. These phenomena can slow down  or  interrupt  the  Group's  operations  or  make  them  more expensive. Its  suppliers  and  customers  are  also  confronted  with this same issue.\n\nThese can be broken down into:\n\n- \u25a0 acute risks triggered by events such as natural disasters, the frequency  and  severity  of  which  are  increasing:  storms, hurricanes, flooding, etc. These risks may relate to Air Liquide sites located near the coast for example, or in regions affected by hurricanes (the US Gulf Coast, South Asia, etc.);\n- \u25a0 chronic  risks  related  to  more  long-term  changes  in  climate models and rising temperatures: rising sea levels, chronic heat waves in certain regions, changes in rainfall patterns and an increase  in  their  variability,  the  disappearance  of  certain resources, etc.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nPhysical  risks  (water  availability,  frequency  of  extreme  events, etc.)  are  appraised  during  the  review  of  investment  requests,  in the same way as financial criteria, to ensure that the associated risk  management  measures  are  adapted,  for  example  in  the design of equipment.\n\nIn  addition,  Group  operations  that  are  regularly  exposed  to  the acute  risks  described  above  have  risk  management  systems  in place aimed at adopting suitable preventive operational measures and  managing  these  crises  by,  first  and  foremost,  protecting individuals and the production facilities in close cooperation with customers. These systems are regularly updated and improved.\n\nChronic risks are taken into account, particularly in the design of production units, in the same way, and to the same extent as their energy efficiency and carbon footprint.\n\nIn 2023, Air Liquide carried out a study to identify the risks linked to the physical impacts of climate change according to two highemission  scenarios  (SSP2-4.5  used  as  'business  as  usual' leading  to  +2.7\u00b0C  by  2100  and  the  SSP-5.8  or  'worst  case scenario'  leading  to  +4.4\u00b0C  by  2100)  and  to  consolidate  and improve  the  physical  risk  management  process.  In  2024,  this study will be continued in order to refine the analysis.\n\nPhysical risks and the risks of greenhouse gas emissions are also taken into account in the preparation of the financial statements (note 31 - page 282).\n\n## 4.1.3.  Water management risk\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe  Group  depends  on  water  for  its  activities.  Its  water consumption is related to the loss of water by evaporation in the process  of  cooling  rotating  machines,  particularly  for  the production  of  air  gases,  or  its  use  as  a  raw  material  for  the manufacturing of products such as hydrogen.\n\nAir  Liquide  pays  particular  attention  to  water  management, especially in areas of water stress. The main water management risk for Air Liquide's activities is the possible unavailability of water which could result in a slowdown or shutdown of a production unit.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nTo  manage the risks  associated  with  water  withdrawal  and  use, a water management policy has been published in the BlueBook in 2021.\n\nThis policy identifies the impact of Air Liquide's activities on water availability. The policy defines the principles of risk management based  on  a  specific  assessment  of  the  situation  at  each  site. Finally,  it  describes  the  actions  to  be  implemented  to  ensure appropriate water management.\n\nIn 2023, following the rollout of the water management policy, Air Liquide focused on the following objective, defined for the Group in 2021: implementing a documented water management plan by 2025 aimed at reducing water withdrawal and use risks for waterintensive operations in areas of high water stress.\n\n## 4.2.   SOCIETAL RISKS (DISCRIMINATIONRELATED RISKS)\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nAir Liquide operates businesses in a large number of countries with different  cultures.  It  is  therefore  exposed  to  discrimination  risks related  among  other  things  to  gender  mix  (gender  disparity, particularly  in  technical  and  expert  professions),  diversity  (skin color, ethnic origin, religion, sexual orientation, age, disability, etc.).\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe Group's Principles of Action and the Code of Conduct reaffirm the  Group's  values  and,  more  specifically,  a  culture  based  on diversity,  openness,  transparency,  respect  for  others  and  the rejection  of  all  forms  of  discrimination.  These  values  are  also included in the Human Resources policy and must be promoted by all  Group employees, with the support of Human Resources, through  awareness-raising,  training  and  alert  tools  and  the monitoring of progress indicators.\n\nMoreover, for several years, Air Liquide has been a signatory of the  United  Nations  Global  Compact,  for  which  one  of  the principles  aims  to  contribute  to  the  elimination  of  all  forms  of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n\nTo this end, actions are regularly taken to promote gender mix (for example to increase the number of women among managers and professionals  to  35%  by  2025),  nationality  mix  (Air  Liquide's senior  executives  are  now  of  34  different  nationalities),  and inclusion  (in  particular,  the  review  of  the  policy  relating  to employees  with  disabilities).  Details  of  the  Group's  actions  are indicated  in  paragraph  2.3  of  the  Extra-Financial  Performance Declaration in Chapter 5 - pages 346 to 349.",

GEOPOLITICAL RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nConsidering the changing international climate, including increasing  tensions  between  (or  within)  some  countries  and  the persistence  of  terrorist  threats,  the  Group  may  be  exposed  in certain countries to economic or financial risks, as well as to risks affecting  the  safety  of  its  employees  (on-site  or  during  business travel) and the security of its facilities.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nWhen investment requests are reviewed, the geopolitical context of  a  project  (in  both  safety  and  economic  terms)  is  part  of  the criteria  examined  before  any  approval:  country  risk  is  thus assessed on a case-by-case basis and may lead to adjustments to financing strategy and supplementary insurance cover, or even the rejection of the project.\n\nMoreover, all countries in which the Group operates are subject to monitoring and regular analysis of the geopolitical context.\n\nFinally,  the  Safety  and  Industrial  System  Department  uses awareness-raising  and  training  tools  to  protect  employees, travelers  and  expatriates  who  are  potentially  exposed  in  certain geographies or when  traveling for business: e-learnings, interventions  from  experts  on  certain  specific  risks  (health, hygiene,  pollution,  kidnapping,  etc.).  Other  measures  are  also implemented  locally  to  secure  products  and  sites  that  are  most exposed to an external threat.\n\n## 5.2.   REGULATORY AND LEGAL RISKS\n\n## 5.2.1.  Risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nIn  all  the  countries  where  the  Group  operates,  its  entities  are exposed to the risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations. In  an  increasingly  complex  context  due  to  a  continuously  rising number of standards, they must monitor changes to the legal and regulatory  framework  notably  in  terms  of  the  specificities  of  the businesses that they conduct.\n\nThe Healthcare business line, in particular, is subject to specific regulations for the products that it sells (medical devices, drugs), the research activities that it carries out, and for the processing of patients' personal healthcare data.\n\nThe Group must face, in all regions in which it operates, the risks of non-compliance with:\n\n- \u25a0 competition law;\n- \u25a0 provisions aimed at combating corruption;\n- \u25a0 international sanctions;\n\n- \u25a0 regulations restricting exports of certain products or relating to destinations under sanctions;\n- \u25a0 regulations  on  the  transfer  of  personal  data  (see  paragraph 3.1. Digital risks of this section - page 80);\n- \u25a0 the duty of vigilance.\n\nGroup entities are also exposed to the risk of non-compliance with contractual obligations (of their own or those of their contractual counterparties).\n\nLiabilities and  contingent  liabilities  related  to  disputes  are described  in  notes  22  and  30  of  the  consolidated  financial statements - pages 262 and 282.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nChanges to legal and regulatory requirements are monitored with particular  vigilance  and  are  accompanied  by  the  implementation of  procedures  aimed  at  improving  teams'  knowledge  of  these changes and related risks and providing them with tools to ensure compliance with obligations in the following fields, through:\n\n- \u25a0 Group  Codes  on  how  to  behave  in  order  to  comply  with competition laws, accompanied by surprise audits and training that includes e-learning;\n- \u25a0 a corruption prevention program in which General Management  and  management  are  closely  involved;  this program relies in particular on the mapping of corruption risks, the  updated  Code  of  Conduct,  a  full  set  of  training  and awareness-raising  actions  for  those  exposed  to  corruptionrelated risks, a third-party assessment mechanism, accounting controls  and  a  whistleblowing  system.  This  program  is regularly updated to take into account new regulatory and legal requirements  under  the  coordination  of  the  Group's  Ethics Officer, who relies on a network of ethics correspondents and the  support  of  the  Operational  Departments  in  the  hubs  and businesses; it is regularly audited;\n- \u25a0 a  guidance  document  for  export  control  and  international sanctions, as well as a tool and procedures for verifying third parties;  particular  attention  is  dedicated  to  compliance  with international  sanctions  against  Russia,  and  the  associated import/export control regimes;\n- \u25a0 various  contract  guides  (for  Large  Industries,  Industrial Merchant, Electronics, Engineering & Construction and Financing) and Codes of Good Practices (for Healthcare);\n- \u25a0 the  establishment  of  a  specific  department  to  deal  with  the legal challenges of the law on the duty of vigilance.\n\nTo  the  Group's  knowledge,  there  are  no  governmental,  legal  or arbitration  proceedings,  either  current  or  threatened,  which  may have or have had, in the past 12 months, significant impacts on the Group's financial situation or profitability.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Organization\n\nThe  Group  is  organized  and  based  on  a  consistent  Group strategy.  It  is  supported  by  a  method  of  management  which centers on mid-term objectives that are categorized by business, as  well  as  a  steering  process  for  activities  based  on  annual budgetary objectives,  which  are  further  categorized  down  to  the individual plan level. As part of the ADVANCE corporate program, the  Group  continued  to  rely  on  a  network  organization  that promotes communication and shortens decision-making circuits.\n\nThe organization breaks down into:\n\n- \u25a0 hubs  which  ensure  the  presence  and  representation  of  the Group in the main global regions. With the Base (L'Air Liquide S.A. head office), they are responsible for defining the Group's operational strategy and  its global performance.  They accommodate the representatives  of  the  Corporate  functions and World Business Lines who ensure that the Group strategy is properly implemented locally;\n- \u25a0 entities,  grouped  in  clusters  (groups  of  countries)  for  better pooling of resources, which provide operational management of  their  activities  and  implement  the  Group  strategy  in  those countries where the Group has a presence;\n- \u25a0 the World Business Lines, which:\n- -with the hubs and Strategy Department, prepare the mediumterm strategic goals for the businesses they represent,\n- -have responsibility for strategic marketing, the transformation  of  their  respective  businesses,  industrial policy  and  the  suitability  of  skills  in  their  specific  areas  of business;\n- \u25a0 the  World  Business  Units  specific  to  certain  businesses (Global Markets & Technologies, Engineering & Construction);\n- \u25a0 the Innovation and Development Division (IDD), which brings together all the research and innovation resources, technology development,  Digital  &  IT  (La  Digital  Factory,  ALIZENT, network  infrastructure  and  more),  the  Intellectual  Property Department,  the  venture  capital  structure  ALIAD  and  the Global Markets & Technologies (GM&T) World Business Unit (WBU) mentioned above.\n\nThis  organization  also  includes  the  Corporate  functions,  which notably comprise the three key control departments that report to General Management:\n\n- \u25a0 the Finance Department, which is responsible for:\n- -the reliability of accounting and financial information,\n- -the Group's financial and tax risk management,\n- -the drafting of Group  objectives  and  monitoring  of performance by operations control, based on financial data prepared by the accounting teams, analysis conducted by the financial teams of the various entities as well as certain operational data;\n- \u25a0 the Group Control and Compliance Department, which:\n- -provides  expertise  and  assistance  to  entities  in  their  risk management  approach  (see  below)  and  builds  a  Group synthesis,\n- -helps Group entities ensure compliance with and promotion of  both  the  Group's  ethical  values,  particularly  through training and awareness-raising measures and the treatment  of  fraud  and  deviations  (all  these  measures, organizations,  and  tools  are  presented  in  detail  in  the Extra-financial  Performance  Declaration  -  page  318),  as well  as  compliance  with  duty  of  vigilance  measures  and with international trade regulations,\n- -verifies  the  effective  application  of  internal  control  and  risk management procedures through audits carried out according to  a  defined  program  presented  to  the  Group's  Audit  and Accounts Committee. This program, developed and based on the  risk  analysis,  is  regularly  monitored  by  the  Audit  and Accounts  Committee  in  liaison  with  the  Environment  and Society  Committee  (for  environmental  and  societal  issues). Audit  reports  are  systematically  supplemented  by  corrective action  plans,  which  are  supervised  by  a  member  of  the Executive Committee. These reports, as well as subsequent follow-up reports, are the subject of various communications and periodic discussions with the Statutory Auditors,\n- -provides  guidance  to  Group  entities,  through  the  Digital Security  Department,  which  reports  directly  to  the  Group Control  and  Compliance  Department,  on  the  identification and protection of their data, systems and digital applications  (definition  of  rules,  rollout  expertise  and advice, control of proper implementation);\n- \u25a0 the  Legal  Department,  which  identifies  legal  risks,  issues internal guidelines and Codes, and then oversees their proper implementation.  It  monitors  the  development  of  the  main disputes. It manages insurance.\n\nMoreover,  the  Group  has  an  ethics  whistleblowing  system covering  all  its  entities,  enabling  any  deviations  from  the  Group Code  of  Conduct  or  applicable  legislation  to  be  reported anonymously  to  an  independent  external  service  provider.  This system  is  open  to  all  the  Group's  internal  and  external stakeholders (customers, patients, suppliers, subcontractors and their staff, local communities, facilitators, etc.).\n\nAll alerts recorded are treated confidentially under the supervision of the Group Ethics Officer. This system is an alternative solution to  the  usual  process  for  reporting  incidents  within  the  entities through managers and the Human Resources teams. It helps to accelerate  the  processing  of  reports  received,  and  thus  to minimize their potential impact on individuals and the organization. The principle of whistleblower protection is guaranteed by the Group and reiterated in the Code of Conduct. No  sanctions  or  retaliatory  measures  are  allowed  against  any person who lodges an alert in good faith.\n\nThe  description  of  the  whistleblowing  system  and  details  of  the indicators relating to the reports and alerts received are available in  paragraph 3 of the Extra-financial Performance Declaration of Chapter 5 - page 350.\n\nFinally,  this  organization  relies  on  a  framework  of  authorizations and delegations:\n\n- \u25a0 to members  of  the  Executive  Committee  and  certain departments and services in order to define their commitment and  payment  powers  for  commercial  transactions  (sales  or purchasing);\n- \u25a0 to certain executives in charge of entities or sites in France in particular, in order to ensure the prevention and management of industrial risks in terms of hygiene and safety;\n- \u25a0 to certain financial executives, in order to ensure the security of transactions and financial flows.\n\nThe  managers  of  the  various  Group  subsidiaries  exercise  their duties  under  the  control  of  the  Boards  of  Directors  and  in accordance with laws and regulations applicable in the countries where they operate.",

        "page_content": "## 2.   Risk management\n\nTo ensure the continued development of its activities, the Group must  actively  pursue  an  approach  to  prevent  and  manage  the risks  (especially  industrial  and  financial  risks)  to  which  it  is exposed.\n\nIn  terms  of  the  Group's  business  activities,  industrial  risk management  must  essentially  focus  on  prioritizing  safety  and security while maintaining a permanent focus on the reliability of facilities.\n\nFinancial risk management requires strict control over investments,  combined  with  prudent  and  rigorous  practices regarding the accounting and financial aspects of the activities.\n\nThe Group's formal risk management approach aims to ensure:\n\n- \u25a0 the  regular  identification  of  the  different  forms  of  risk (industrial,  financial  and  other)  encountered  by  the  Group during  the  pursuit  of  business  activities,  which  are  assessed according to both potential impact and  probability of occurrence;\n- \u25a0 the assessment of the level of maturity of the management of each risk based on a common scale with respect to the quality of policies, organizational structures, processes and controls in place;\n- \u25a0 the progress of the main corrective action plans undertaken to mitigate  these  risks,  by  focusing  monitoring  activities  on  a limited number of priorities.\n\nThis  three-phase  risk  management  process  (mapping,  maturity level  assessment,  mitigation  plans)  covers  more  than  90%  of consolidated Group revenue.\n\nThe Risk Management Department within the Group Control and Compliance Department leads this approach using:\n\n- \u25a0 resources  dedicated  by  the  hubs,  World  Business  Units  and World  Business  Lines  to  manage  the  approach  in  their respective  scopes  of  responsibility  (under  the  supervision  of the  Boards  of  Directors  of  the  entities  concerned)  and  to provide a summary thereof;\n\n## 3.   Internal control\n\nIn addition to the Principles of Action (https://www.airliquide.com/ sustainable-development/ethics/groups-principles-action), which reaffirm the Group's values with particular reference to stakeholders (shareholders, suppliers and customers, employees, etc.),  the  Group's  policies,  Codes,  and  procedures  are  grouped together in a Global Procedures Manual, the BlueBook, which is available to employees on the Intranet. The BlueBook constitutes a set of internal control and risk management documents, which must  be  implemented  by  each  entity  included  in  the  Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe BlueBook is the cornerstone of the Group's internal  control system, which aims to ensure that:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group's activities and the conduct of its employees:\n- -comply  with  laws  and  regulations,  internal  standards  and applicable best practices,\n- -comply  with  the  objectives  defined  by  the  Company, especially  in  terms  of  risk  prevention  and  management policies,\n- -contribute to safeguarding the Group's assets;\n- \u25a0 all  financial  and  accounting  information  communicated  either internally or externally gives a true and fair view of the situation and  activity  of  the  Group  and  complies  with  prevailing standards.\n\n- \u25a0 the work of members of the Risk Committee that it coordinates (described paragraph 5 of this section - page 87).\n\nThe  Audit and  Accounts  Committee  reviews  Group  risk management based on presentations covering:\n\n- \u25a0 the progress of the approach (on an annual basis);\n- \u25a0 each  major  risk  management  system  based  on  a  multi-year program structured according to the challenges;\n- \u25a0 internal audit summaries of these risk management systems.\n\nEnvironmental and societal risks are reviewed by the Environment and  Society  Committee  (three  meetings  per  year),  which  also meets once a year in a joint  session  with  the Audit  Committee. During  this  joint  session,  the  two  Committees  may  review  the trajectory of climate objectives.\n\nIn  order  to  have  a  broader  approach,  each  year,  the  Risk Management  Department  presents  a  hypothetical  identification and positioning of emerging risks at a Risk Committee meeting. A review is also performed on the timing of the emergence of these risks,  and  the  necessary  anticipatory  actions  are  suggested. According to the International Risk Governance Council (IRGC), an  emerging  risk  is  a  new  risk  or  an  existing  risk  that  could materialize  in  a  new  context  or  in  a  context  not  yet  known. An emerging risk is potentially impactful but its characteristics are not yet fully identified.\n\nFinally, an  annual  summary  of  risk  management  actions undertaken by the Group is presented to the Board of Directors; each  year  it  validates  the  Audit  and  Accounts  Committee's provisional program which is presented to it beforehand, as well as  a  list  of  subjects  of  strategic  interest  or  with  particular relevance that will be presented in a more specific manner.\n\nUnder  the  guidance  of  the  Group  Internal  Control  Department, awareness-raising and training actions on internal control issues are regularly carried out, in particular through participation in the virtual training campuses offered by Air Liquide University twice a year. These are structured around eight themes: management & leadership, sales & marketing, operational excellence, innovation, digital  &  information  systems,  inclusion  &  diversity,  climate  & energy transition and HR professionals.\n\nGenerally, the Group's internal control system should help better master  its  activities,  the  efficiency  of  its  operations  and  the efficient  use  of  its  resources.  It  also  aims  to  prevent  errors  and frauds.\n\nAs with other 'assurance systems', it cannot provide an absolute guarantee that the Group's objectives will be met.\n\nIn  2023,  the  Group  pursued  the  actions  undertaken  in  previous years, with all material Group entities and shared service platforms (representing over 90% of consolidated Group revenue), reviewing the appropriateness of their internal control system in relation to the Reference  Framework  for  internal  control  and  risk  management systems.  These  entities  also  implemented  actions  aimed  at improving their control system in terms of annual guidelines defined at the beginning of the year by the hubs and World Business Units, the  Group  Control  and  Compliance  Department  and  the  Finance Department. The  latter  two  together  organize  these  improvement measures  and  report  on  their  progress  to  the  Group's  General Management then to the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are regularly brought to the attention of General Management, the Ethics and Compliance Committee and the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\n## 4.   Financial and accounting information\n\nIn  order  to  guarantee  the  quality  and  reliability  of  financial  and accounting information produced, the Group primarily relies on a set of accounting principles and standards, as well as a consistent accounting and management reporting system and feeds both the Group  statutory  consolidation  process  and  the  management analysis that is under the responsibility of independent departments, which report to the Finance Department.\n\nThe Group accounting manual, which includes the Group financial policy, defines the accounting rules and principles as well as the consolidation methods  applicable and states the formats applicable for reporting financial and accounting information. This manual  is  regularly  updated  by  the  Finance  Department  in accordance with amendments to IFRS or their interpretations.\n\nManagement and accounting reports are each prepared under the responsibility  of  independent  but  interactive  departments  that follow identical methods and principles:\n\n- \u25a0 this  independence allows for the enhancement of information and analysis through the use of complementary indicators and data, particularly those which are specific to each business;\n- \u25a0 the  fact  that  these  bodies  are  interactive  provides  for  better control  of  the  reliability  of  information  through  the  systematic and regular reconciliation of data.\n\nThe reports primarily include:\n\n- \u25a0 monthly management reporting, known as the 'Monthly Flash Report',  that  provides  information  on  revenue  and  the  main financial indicators: income  statement,  cash  flow  from operating  activities,  net  debt  and  the  amount  of  investments authorized and committed;\n- \u25a0 quarterly  reporting,  known  as  the  'Management  Control Report',  which  provides  details  of  the  primary  items  of  the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement;\n- \u25a0 a  quarterly  'variance'  analysis  report  to  assess  the  various components of the change in operating income recurring.\n\nThese three documents are compiled by each management entity according to a predefined yearly timetable. They are systematically accompanied by comments on activities drawn up under the supervision of the entity's Chief Executive Officer, and are  consolidated  at  Group  level  with  a  breakdown  for  each  hub and business:\n\n- \u25a0 quarterly reporting for accounting consolidation is compiled by each  reporting  entity  which,  in  addition,  must  provide  (on  a semi-annual basis) information on off-balance sheet commitments that include in particular:\n- -energy purchasing,\n- -financial guarantees and deposits,\n- -all other contractual commitments.\n\nAccounting  consolidation  statements  and  monthly  reporting  are escalated to the Central Consolidation Department. This department  prepares  the  consolidated  data  and  works  in conjunction with the Operations Control Department, whose duty it  is  to  analyze and comment on the results, identify and explain any  differences  with  respect  to  forecasts,  and  update  said forecasts. Meetings are organized each month with the heads of hubs and clusters (groups of countries) to clarify these analyses.\n\nAs part of the scope of the monthly Group Performance Steering Committee,  a  rolling  forecast  for  the  rest  of  the  current  year  is systematically presented by the Finance Department, in order to identify,  when  applicable,  any  differences  with  respect  to  yearly targets and take the necessary steps.\n\nThrough  regular  controls,  the  Finance  Department  ensures  the effective application of accounting methods and principles in the various Group entities. The most complex accounting standards, particularly those relating to employee benefits (IAS 19), methods of  consolidation  (IFRS  10/11),  the  classification  of  major  Large Industries' contracts and methods for recognizing revenue (IFRS 15/16), derivative financial instruments (IAS 32, IFRS 7, IFRS 9) as  well  as  the  implementation  of  new  standards  are  subject  to greater support and tighter controls or to direct treatment by the Finance Department.\n\nIt  also  relies  on  audits  carried  out  by  the  Group  Control  and Compliance Department, with which it has regular contact.\n\nThe  Group  takes  into  account  climate  risks  in  its  closing assumptions and incorporates their potential impact in its financial statements.  In  particular,  climate  risks  are  taken  into  account when carrying out closing procedures, in particular the analysis of the  useful  lives  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  used  for calculation  of  depreciation  and  amortization,  the  review  of  the estimates and assumptions concerning assets' impairment tests, and the risk assessment to determine the amount of provisions for contingencies and losses.\n\nThe quality and reliability of financial and accounting information is also based on high-performance transactional systems (such as Enterprise Resource Planning - ERP), coupled with modern and secure  Group  consolidation  and  Business  Intelligence  tools. These tools enable financial and operational data to be analyzed, made available and displayed to all employees and management.\n\nThe project, which aims to further harmonize ERPs, continues on the  basis  of  the  definition  of  an  accounting  and  financial framework tailored to the various Group businesses.",

        "page_content": "## OTHER COVERAGE SYSTEMS\n\nThe Group covers its main risks through international insurance programs with leading insurers. This concerns in particular damage to property, civil and environmental liability, cyber risk, civil liability of corporate officers, etc. The two largest programs are detailed below.\n\n## 1.   Property damage and business interruption\n\nGroup property and business interruption are covered by property and casualty insurance policies underwritten in each country in which the Group operates. Almost all of these policies are integrated into an international program.\n\nThese policies, which are generally of the 'All Risks' form, cover fire, lightning, water damage, explosions, vandalism, impact, machinery breakdown, theft and, depending on the country and in limited amounts, natural disasters.\n\nBusiness interruption following a claim for damage is covered by insurance for most production sites under these same policies. The coverage  period  for  business  interruption  is  6  to  24  months.  Deductible  amounts  are  correlated  to  the  activity  of  the  sites.  Insurers conduct regular visits at the main industrial sites for risk prevention purposes.\n\n## 2.   Civil liability\n\nIn terms of civil liability, the subsidiaries have local liability policies that cover damage to third parties due to their activities (operational risk) and their products (product risk). The amount insured for each subsidiary in its policy depends notably on the amount of its revenue and on its activities.\n\nIn addition to local policies, the Group has comprehensive coverage for damage to third parties covering all of its activities in the form of umbrella insurance taken out in France, which covers both the Company and its subsidiaries. The Group's insurance policy also covers adverse impacts on the environment, ecological harm and environmental damage.\n\nThe coverage amount underwritten exceeds 500 million euros. Coverage is built on several overlapping insurance lines. Each line has been underwritten for a given amount with several insurers sharing the risk. Beyond the first line, the upper lines pick up the excess risk from the lower lines.\n\n## 3.   Captive reinsurance\n\nA  portion  of  property  damage  and  business  interruption  risk  is  kept  by  the  Group  via  a  captive  reinsurance  company,  which  also participates among other things in the coverage of the Group's civil liabilities as well as in the coverage of goods transported.\n\nThis captive reinsurance company covers, for the 2023 fiscal year, claims of up to a maximum of 54 million euros with sub-limits per claim adapted to the nature of the claim. Beyond these amounts, risks are transferred to third-party insurers. Their management is entrusted to a captive manager approved by the competent authorities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  Plan  must  include 'reasonable vigilance measures to identify the risks and prevent severe  impacts  on  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms, health and safety of persons and on the environment' which may result  from  the  activities  of  the  Group  and  its  subsidiaries,  and those of suppliers or subcontractors with whom Air Liquide has an established  commercial  relationship. This  obligation  is  based  on five measures:\n\n- \u25a0 risk mapping (identification, analysis, prioritization);\n- \u25a0 procedures  to  regularly  assess  the  situation  of  subsidiaries, suppliers and subcontractors;\n- \u25a0 appropriate actions to mitigate risks or prevent severe impacts;\n- \u25a0 an alert mechanism that collects reporting of potential or actual risks;\n- \u25a0 a monitoring scheme  to  follow  up  on  the  measures implemented and assess their effectiveness.\n\nAir Liquide complies with the requirements of the Law on the Duty of  Vigilance  by  issuing  a  Vigilance  Plan,  whose  content  is disclosed  below,  and  which  presents  the  various  measures implemented  for  each  stake:  human  rights  and  fundamental freedoms  (paragraph  2,  page  96),  the  health  and  safety  of individuals  (paragraph  3,  page  103),  and  the  environment (paragraph  4,  page  111).  As  specific  measures  apply  to  the management  of  suppliers and subcontractors, the risks, procedures and measures implemented in this regard are set out in paragraph  5,  page  120.  Two  measures,  risk  mapping (paragraph 1, page 95) and the setup of a whistleblowing system and  alerts'  collection  and  treatment  (paragraph  6,  page  124), apply  transversally  to  all  three  stakes  and  are  presented independently to facilitate their reading. The effective implementation  report  for  the  year  2023  is  integrated  into  the Vigilance Plan, in particular through the overview of the year and of key  indicators (page  93),  operational  illustrations and monitoring schemes.\n\nAir Liquide strives to invent a sustainable future. Through the engagement, innovation capacity and technological know-how of its 67,800 employees in 72 countries (1) , Air Liquide is particularly well positioned to continue its growth trajectory while contributing to  an  efficient  response  to  major  economic,  environmental  and societal challenges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis  Vigilance  Plan  applies  to  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  and  all  Group subsidiaries.\n\n## GOVERNANCE OF THE STEERING OF THE DUTY OF VIGILANCE\n\nThe  Duty  of  Vigilance  and  Societal  Responsibility  Department oversees the implementation of Air Liquide's vigilance approach. It is part of the Group Control and Compliance Department, which is supervised  by  the  Group  General  Secretary,  member  of  the Executive  Committee.  The  Duty  of  Vigilance  and  Societal Responsibility  Department  is  responsible  for  coordinating  (i)  the implementation  of  due  diligence  processes  to  guide  the  various departments involved and (ii) drafting the Vigilance Plan to better meet the expectations of the Group's stakeholders.\n\nThe  Procurement,  Group  Control  and  Compliance  (including Ethics,  Risk  Management  and  Digital  Security),  Sustainable Development, Legal, Human Resources and Safety and Industrial System Departments are involved in the rollout of actions and the drafting of this Vigilance Plan.\n\nThe departments responsible for duty of vigilance stakes (Human Resources,  Digital  Security,  Safety  and  Industrial  System, Sustainable  Development,  Procurement)  have  their  own  internal management bodies, including operational representatives. These bodies  meet  regularly  to  monitor  the  actions  implemented  and performance through indicators.\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Committee is the internal control body for  the  duty  of  vigilance.  It  brings  together  the  Heads  of  Group Control  and  Compliance,  Sustainable  Development,  Legal,  and two  members  of  the  Group  Executive  Committee:  the  Vice President,  Group  Human  Resources  and  the  Vice  President, Europe Industries hub representing the operational functions. The Committee  meets  at  least  twice  a  year  and  more  often  if necessary. In 2023, it continued to review the progress of stakes relating to the duty of vigilance.\n\nThe Environment and Society Committee is one of the Board of Directors'  specialized  committees  dedicated  to  societal  and environmental  responsibility  issues.  It  includes  three  members and  meets  at  least  three  times  a  year.  In  2023,  it  continued  to supervise the rollout of the Vigilance Plan.\n\n(1)",

Air  Liquide  is  committed  to  its  customers  and patients,  Shareholders,  employees,  local  communities,  suppliers and  business  partners.  The  Group  is  also  committed  to environmental protection and sustainable development.\n\nTo  supplement  these  Principles  of  Action,  the  Group  has  also adopted  a  Code  of  Conduct.  It  is  available  on  the  Air  Liquide website  in  28  languages  (https://www.airliquide.com/sustainabledevelopment/ethics). The Code's main areas of focus are covered in the following three chapters:\n\n- \u25a0 'Acting with Care' , which deals with the themes of protection of  people  and  assets  (e.g.  safety  and  security,  equality, diversity and the prevention of harassment and the protection of personal data);\n\n- \u25a0 'Acting  with  Integrity  and  Transparency' which  illustrates the  expected  behavior  in  terms  of  prevention  of  corruption, respect  for  fair competition  rules  and  transparency  of information communicated to the public;\n- \u25a0 'Acting Responsibly' which affirms the commitments of the Group  and  its  employees  to  protect  the  environment  and human rights and about their contribution to the community.\n\nThis Code provides employees with a framework for reflection and tools  to  adopt  the  expected  behaviors.  Internally,  the  Code  of Conduct  is  shared  through  various  communication  methods (information meetings, posters, articles, etc.). An annual e -learning dedicated to the Code of Conduct must be followed by all  Group  employees.  Each  year,  the  topics  addressed  are renewed.  In  2023,  the  module  covered  topics  related  to  the prevention of harassment and discrimination, gifts, invitations and conflicts  of  interest,  and  human  rights.  98%  of  employees  took part in this training. During the e-learning, each employee renews their adherence to the Code of Conduct and their commitment to comply with its provisions on an annual basis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group's growth model is now based on the  principle  of  a  global  performance  that  combines economic  performance  and  sustainability . Among  the  four priorities  of  the  strategic  plan, Air  Liquide  affirms  its  commitment  to decarbonize the planet and act for all.\n\nThe Sustainable Development program and ADVANCE contribute to  the  prevention  and  mitigation  of  the  risks  identified  in  the mapping (paragraph 1, page 95) and are more fully described in this  Vigilance  Plan  (in  particular  in  paragraphs  2.2.3,  2.4.3  and 4.1.3, pages 98, 102, 114).\n\nAir Liquide adheres to several initiatives contributing to the duty of vigilance  stakes.  Since  2014,  the  Group  has  been  committed  to the corporate responsibility initiative of the United Nations Global Compact  and  its  Ten  Principles  in  the  areas  of  human  rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption. Every year, Air  Liquide  issues  a  Letter  of  Commitment,  signed  by  the  Chief Executive Officer, as well as a Communication on Progress with respect to the strategic and operational implementation of these Ten  Principles,  which  is  available  on  the  UN  Global  Compact website (https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/participants/ 39281).  Within  the  Global  Compact  France  local  network, Air Liquide participates in the human rights working group which allows  its  members,  of  all  sizes  and  from  all  sectors,  to  share experiences  and  expertise  on  the  management  of  human  rights risks.\n\nThe Group is also a signatory  of  the  Responsible  Care \u00ae Global Charter,  an  initiative  of  the  International  Council  of  Chemical Associations (ICCA, https://icca-chem.org/wp-content/uploads/ 2020/09/Signatories-of-RC-Global-Charter.pdf) which aims to improve global performance in the chemical industry in terms of health, safety and the protection of the environment. As such, two Air  Liquide  employees  are  members  of  the  Responsible  Care Committee of France Chimie. The purpose of this committee is to engage  companies  in  the  chemical  sector  in  concrete  and operational initiatives related to sustainable development, particularly in the areas of sustainable procurement, well-being at work, energy management and product safety.\n\nAir  Liquide  also  takes  part  in  several  initiatives,  such  as associations  or  working  groups,  relating  to  a  specific  stake contributing to the duty of vigilance.\n\nSince  2021,  the  Group  has  been  a  member  of  the  multisector association  Businesses  for  human  rights  ( Entreprises  pour  les droits de l'Homme , https://www.e-dh.org/en), which brings together  26  French  companies  operating  internationally.  This association aims to be a forum for reflection and exchange of best practices  for  a  better  understanding  and  integration  of  human rights issues in the policies and practices of companies.\n\nWith respect to the environment, and more specifically to climate change, Air  Liquide  is  involved  in  several  initiatives  at  different levels. The Group is a member of the association Enterprises for the  Environment  (EpE,  https://www.epe-asso.org/)  and  is  a signatory  of  the  French  Business  Climate  Pledge  (https:// frenchbusinessclimatepledge.fr/).  Air  Liquide  also  contributed  to the  Assessing  Low  Carbon  Transition\u00ae  initiative  (ACT,  https:// actinitiative.org/) with the aim of developing tools to evaluate lowcarbon strategies in the chemical sector. Furthermore, in 2019 the Group joined the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a label created  by  a  coalition  of  players  committed  to  environmental issues. Air  Liquide  continues  the  dialog  with  the  SBTi  and  other stakeholders,  in  order  to  contribute  to  the  development  of methodologies for the chemicals and industrial gases sector, and to  adequately  represent  the  value  of  its  actions  in  favor  of  the climate,  both  in  terms  of  its  own  emissions  and  the  resulting environmental benefits for its customers.\n\nThe  Group  is  a  member  of  the  French  Observatory  for Sustainable  Procurement  (ObsAR,  https://www.obsar.asso.fr/). Air Liquide has been part of the working group on climate change launched by ObsAR since 2021, and monitors its work with a view to continuous improvement.\n\nLastly, through its activities, its engagement and its environmental and societal actions, the Group contributes to certain Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that the United Nations has set up to eradicate poverty, protect the planet and guarantee prosperity for all  by  2030.  To  illustrate  the  Group's  contribution,  the  due diligence  measures  implemented  to  mitigate  the  salient  risks identified, described in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, pages 96, 103 and 111, are associated with the corresponding SDGs.",

At the end of 2023, 78% of employees of the Group are covered by the common basis of care coverage, which guarantees a life insurance,  health  coverage  as  well  as  a  minimum  of  14  weeks paid maternity leave. This year, significant progress was made by different geographies, notably Europe, Asia-Pacific and Americas, to reach the objective of 100% employee coverage by 2025. 2023 also  marks  the  signature  of  an  amendment  to  the  European Works  Council  founding  agreement  after  more  than  a  year  of meetings and exchanges of opinions. This amendment integrates the  best  practices  in  favor  of  social  dialog  developed  within  the instance. Finally, Air Liquide rolls out its HandivAirsity roadmap for the  inclusion  of  employees  with  disabilities,  notably  in  France where  the  Disability  agreement  is  being  implemented  over  the 2023-2025 period. The objective of this agreement is to increase the direct employment rate of people with disabilities to 6% by the end of 2025, compared to 4.46% in 2022.\n\nSafety  and  security  are  fundamental  values  of  Air  Liquide.  The Group's  preventive  measures  for  subcontractor's  safety  at  work are  reflected  in  the  -16%  decrease  in  the  number  of  lost-time accidents  for  this  population  in  2023.  This  year,  the  behavior  of Air  Liquide's  drivers  and  its  subcontractors  was  honored  in several  geographies.  The  rollout  of  the  road  safety  program continued  and  approximately  60%  of  the  heavy  vehicles  fleet  is now equipped with technology to assist or protect drivers. In terms of security, the Group launched a systemic review of incidents in 2023 to better understand the type, frequency and level of impact on its operations.\n\nAs part of the prevention of environmental risks, Air Liquide led in 2023 a study to assess the vulnerability of the Group's activities to climate risks related to the physical impact. This study identified the  main  perils  relevant  at  the  Group  level,  which  include  high temperatures, drought and fires. Mitigation plans will be drawn up, if  necessary,  at  vulnerable  sites.  Air  Liquide  also  continues  the rollout of its water management objectives. In 2023, a part of the 76 water-intensive sites in areas of high water stress was audited and  integrated  in  the  water  risk  management  processes. Moreover,  the  technical  standard  for  the  sustainable  monitoring and  control  of  industrial  wastewater  is  being  rolled  out  since September 2023.\n\nIn  2023,  the  methodology  for  identifying  Sustainability-Critical Suppliers  was  reviewed  to  remove  dependency  of  suppliers  on Air  Liquide  from  the  criteria,  because  this  risk  is  taken  into account  individually  during  supplier  qualification.  In  addition,  the Group has strengthened its expectations towards its suppliers by updating the Supplier's Code of Conduct. In particular, it includes additional  articles  on  conflict  minerals  and  the  whistleblowing system. As part of the 'Procure to Neutrality' climate roadmap, the Group  Procurement  Department  launched  a  specific  training module for buyers in 2023 so that they can engage suppliers on actions  to  measure  their  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  climate objectives and the reduction of their impacts. 45% of the buyers completed this module\n\nThe  ethics  whistleblowing  system,  Ethicall,  available  for  all  of Air  Liquide's  stakeholders,  enables  a  rapid  and  structured handling of alerts and an objective and confidential treatment. The Group Whistleblowing Policy defines the alerts treatment process and  the  principles  for  the  protection  of  whistleblowers.  Urgent situations in terms of health, safety or security, or the most serious accidents  are  treated  through  an  internal  reporting  process  in order to ensure a rapid treatment depending on the severity. For personal  data, Air  Liquide  has  deployed  specific  tools  to  collect requests for the exercise of rights and to report possible violations of personal data.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 1.   Risk mapping - Methodology for the assessment of the Group's operations\n\nThe risk mapping methodology for the duty of vigilance across the scope of Air Liquide's activities is based on principles advocated by international standards: the United Nations Guiding Principles on  Business  and  Human  Rights  and  the  Organization  for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance  for  Responsible  Business  Conduct.  The  risk  mapping for  Air  Liquide's  suppliers  and  subcontractors  is  subject  to  a specific  methodology  (paragraph  5.1,  page  120).  These  two mappings  are  complementary  to  the  Group's  risk  management approach  (page  72).  The  procedures  for  identifying  risks  for Air Liquide and for the duty of vigilance are interconnected insofar as  some  of  the  salient  risks,  namely  those  that  have  the  most severe  negative  impacts  for  people  or  the  environment,  may correspond  to  material  risks  for  the  Group.  Thus,  in  terms  of human rights, the risks related to the discrimination of people are identified as societal risks for the Group (page 82). Industrial risks for Air  Liquide (page 73) may have negative impacts on people, the  most  salient  of  which  are  identified  in  the  duty  of  vigilance mapping.  The  environmental  risks  relating  to  the  risks  of greenhouse  gas  emissions  resulting  from  its  activities,  the physical  impact  of  weather  phenomena  due  to  climate  change, and risks  related  to  water  management  are  identified  as  having potential  negative  impacts  on  both  the  environment  and  people, as well as the Group (page 81).\n\nWith regard to the salient risks falling within the scope of the duty of vigilance, the first step is to define a risk universe by identifying the  potential  negative  impacts  that  Air  Liquide's  activities  could cause to people and the environment. The Duty of Vigilance and Societal Responsibility Department determined this risk universe, in collaboration with the functions responsible for duty of vigilance stakes:\n\n- \u25a0 by  referring  to  the  internationally  recognized  human  rights  in the  International  Bill  of  Rights  and  the  International  Labour Organization (ILO) fundamental conventions;\n- \u25a0 by structuring issues related to human rights and fundamental freedoms and the health and safety of persons around types of potentially affected individuals: Air Liquide employees, external staff  present  on  its  sites  (e.g.  employees  of  subcontractors), local  and  neighboring  communities,  customers  and  their employees, patients, consumers and end-users, Shareholders and lastly, other third parties such as road users; and\n- \u25a0 by  giving  indications  on  the  potential  materialization  of  each risk identified.\n\nThe risk universe used in the risk mapping for the duty of vigilance covers the following human rights issues:\n\n- \u25a0 fundamental  rights  and  principles  at  work:  freedom  of association and the right to collective bargaining, elimination of forced or compulsory labor, abolition of child labor, elimination\n\nof  discrimination  in  respect  of  employment  and  occupation (e.g.  women  representation,  equal  pay),  a  safe  and  healthy work environment;\n\n- \u25a0 other  rights  at  work:  work  organization,  wages  and  benefits, well-being and quality of life at work (e.g. absence of violence and  moral  or  sexual  harassment,  transformation  of  the  work environment),  respect  for  privacy,  provision  of  facilities  (e.g. dining areas, restrooms, housing);\n- \u25a0 the rights of local communities, including indigenous peoples: access  to  natural  resources  (e.g.  water),  land  acquisition, lease and use (e.g. property rights and free, prior and informed consent), health, safety and security of local communities.\n\nThe second step consists of periodically analyzing and prioritizing all risks in order to determine the most salient ones, that is to say the  most  severe  potential  negative  impacts  that  Air  Liquide's activities  could  cause  to  people  and  to  the  environment.  This assessment  is  carried  out  with  regard  to  two  analytical  prisms: Air  Liquide's  activities  and  the  countries  in  which  the  Group operates. Two analysis criteria determine the salient nature of the risks:\n\n- \u25a0 the  severity,  by  determining  which  impacts  would  be  most significant in terms of scale, scope and irremediability;\n- \u25a0 the  probability,  by  assessing  the  likelihood  of  the  risk materializing.\n\nThe analysis of these two criteria is supplemented by monitoring (e.g. public indicators, external stakeholder assessments) to take into  account  possible  aggravating  factors  that  may  increase  the risks  in  certain  countries  or  business  sectors.  This  assessment also considers the most vulnerable groups of individuals: women, children and young people, indigenous peoples, migrant workers, people  with  disabilities,  LGBTQ+  people,  ethnic,  religious  or cultural minorities.\n\nThe  risk  mapping  exercise  for  the  duty  of  vigilance  across  the scope of the Group's activities is reviewed annually and updated as  necessary.  This  mapping  relies  on  previously  completed exercises and in particular, a collaborative approach to identifying salient risks with employee representatives of L'Air Liquide S.A., the  adaptation  to  the  German  Supply  Chain  Act,  and  the identification of specific risks related to Electronics and Engineering & Construction activities and to Seppic.\n\nIn  2023,  the  review  of  the  risk  mapping  results  for  the  duty  of vigilance  did  not  reveal  any  new  salient  risks.  Forced  and  child labor  are  taken  into  account  during  the  analysis  but  were  not identified  as  salient  risks  on  the  overall  scope  of  Air  Liquide's activities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Human rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nAir  Liquide  is  committed  to  respecting  and  promoting  human rights  in  its  operations  around  the  world.  The  Group  strongly believes  that  all  persons  should  be  treated  with  respect  and dignity and that companies should play a role in protecting these fundamental rights. Air Liquide shares the principles laid down in the International Bill of Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles  and  Rights  at  Work,  the  United  Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as well as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These promote an ethical and responsible approach by companies in their activities by encouraging the implementation of human rights due diligence procedures.  Moreover,  the  commitments  of  Air  Liquide  and  its employees to human rights are affirmed in its  Code  of  Conduct and on its website (https://www.airliquide.com/sustainabledevelopment/human-rights).\n\nParagraphs  2.1  to  2.4,  pages  96-102,  address  risks  for employees,  which  are  managed  by  the  Human  Resources functions.  The  Group  Human  Resources  Department,  under  the direct  supervision  of  a  member  of  the  Executive  Committee, determines the strategy deployed by the operational departments. The Human Resources Management Committee, comprising the Group's largest operational departments, meets approximately six times a year to monitor measures implemented and assess their effectiveness.\n\nParagraph 2.5, page 102, deals with the risks related to personal data  protection  for  employees,  patients  and  Shareholders  and details  the  associated  governance.  The  Data  Protection  Officer and the Group's Digital Security Department rely on a network of 150  correspondents  for  the  operational  implementation  of personal data protection actions. The Digital Security Committee and  the  Ethics  and  Compliance  Committee  oversee  activities related to personal data protection.\n\n## 2.1.   RISKS RELATED TO LABOR RELATIONS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.1.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nAir  Liquide  contributes  to  economic  and  social  growth  in  the 72 countries (1) where it operates through its technical, industrial, medical and economic activities. Aware of the disparities between countries  in  the  risks  related  to  labor  relations,  the  Group identifies the applicable laws and regulations locally, in particular with regard to working conditions and freedom of association.\n\n## 2.1.2.  Regular assessment procedures\n\nOne of the pillars of Air Liquide's Human Resources strategy aims to create an engaging employee experience based in particular on open, continuous and  constructive social dialog between employees, social partners and Management.\n\nIn light of local regulations, situation and needs, each Group entity defines,  in  agreement  with  the  employee  representative  bodies, where  they  exist,  the  work  organization  that  will  promote engagement  and  performance.  Each  year,  the  share  of employees  who  have  access  to  a  dialog  structure  with  the management is reported by the entities. Formal dialog structures (e.g. employee  representative  bodies), equivalent informal structures, or other forms of direct dialog with the management of the entity are taken into account in this assessment.",

        "page_content": "## 2.1.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\nAir Liquide is committed to meaningful labor relations in all of its subsidiaries.  This  comes  in  different  forms  according  to  local regulations. Air Liquide uses in particular information, consultation and  negotiation  processes  with  employees  or  social  partners, depending  on  the  local  context.  The  Group  or  the  entities  also organize information meetings open to all employees to present the results, strategy or any other matters that concern them and to answer their questions. For example, in 2023, at Group level, the Sustainable  Development  Day  was  an  opportunity  to  inform employees about the Group's strategy and results for 2022 during various online sessions.\n\nIn  Europe,  the  European  Works  Council  of  Air  Liquide  has  29 employee  representatives  from  12  countries.  It  was  renewed  in 2021 for a term of four years. In 2023, two plenary meetings were held  under  the  chairwomanship  of  a  member  of  the  Executive Committee.  In  addition,  the  Council  Board,  composed  of  five members elected in plenary session, met twice to be informed of and discuss several transnational projects and topics of interest to employees in Europe, in accordance with the founding agreement of the European Works Council.\n\nIn  the  first  half  of  2023,  the  Board,  enlarged  to  include  French representatives at the European Works Council, held exceptional meetings  relating  to  the  Group  project  for  the  transformation  of Human Resources processes  and  organization.  The  purpose  of these  meetings  was  to  prepare  the  information-consultation process  concerning  the  reorganization  of  Human  Resources business services centers in  France.  Further  to  the  consultation process  on  the  Group  project  in  2022,  the  European  Works Council, in plenary, delivered an opinion in 2023 on the project in France,  while  dialog  continued  at  local  level  in  accordance  with applicable laws.\n\nIn 2023, the following topics, among others, were presented and discussed  at  European  Works  Council  meetings  thanks  to  the support and direct participation of the relevant internal stakeholders:\n\n- \u25a0 the 'Know Our Safety Risks' initiative;\n- \u25a0 hydrogen mobility projects;\n- \u25a0 the remote and operation and optimization SIO centers (Smart and Innovative Operations);\n- \u25a0 R&D results and vision;\n- \u25a0 Human Resources transformation project;\n- \u25a0 monitoring of Care & Perform initiatives (paragraph 2.3.3, page 101);\n- \u25a0 results of the My Voice engagement survey;\n- \u25a0 learning organization;\n- \u25a0 digital security.\n\nEvery  year,  the  Chairwoman  of  the  European  Works  Council issues  a  report  on  various  topics  relating  to  the  Group's businesses.  The  Group's  annual  results,  and  more  specifically those  in  Europe  and  the  results  related  to  extra-financial performance  (e.g.  safety,  reliability,  staff  turnover  rate,  training, diversity) have been presented to the European Works Council.\n\nIn  2023,  after  more  than  a  year  of  meetings  and  exchanges  of opinions  at  the  level  of  the  European  Works  Council  and  its Board,  an  amendment  to  the  Council  founding  agreement  was voted  and  signed  at  the  November  plenary  session.  This  latest amendment integrates the best practices in favor of social dialog developed  within  the  body  through  the  joint  recognition  by Management  and  employee  representatives  of  the  value  of effective labor relations.\n\nThe  progress  of  the  2022  Vigilance  Plan  was  presented  at  the plenary meeting of the European Works Council in 2023, as well as at the employee representation bodies of the Group in France and of L'Air Liquide S.A.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IN ARGENTINA, AIR LIQUIDE ACTS FOR SOCIAL DIALOG IN VARIOUS FORMS\n\nIn Argentina, Air Liquide implements various social dialog actions structured  by  a  labor  relations  manager  for  the  Latin  America cluster (group of countries). In addition to annual negotiations with trade  unions  taking  place  at  the  national  level,  Air  Liquide Argentina deploys two initiatives to better inform employees and listen to their needs:\n\n- \u25a0 communication with employees is based on several channels ensuring  optimal  coverage.  In  addition  to  the  use  of  the Intranet  portal  for  wide  distribution  or  sending  emails  to  a target population, Air Liquide Argentina has 26 communication ambassadors  at  the  various  sites  in  the  country.  These ambassadors  are  local  and  privileged  points  of  contact  for everyday matters. They also meet with the Human Resources Department once a month to report information and the needs of employees on the sites;\n- \u25a0 Air  Liquide  Argentina  has  created  an  Employee  Assistance Program, that allows its employees to consult an expert on any psychological,  economic,  legal  or  social  issues.  In  addition, this  program  makes  it  possible  to  organize  regular  Wellness Talks on subjects relating to well-being.\n\n## 2.1.4.  Monitoring of measures implemented and the assessment of their effectiveness\n\nThe Group ensures that labor relations are encouraged and, as part  of  this,  87%  of  Group  employees  had  access  to  a  dialog structure in 2023.\n\n|                                                       | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Share of employees with  access to a dialog structure | 82%    | 86%    | 87%    |\n\n## 2.2.   RISKS RELATED TO DISCRIMINATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.2.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nAir Liquide carries out activities with high technological content in a large number of countries with different cultures. Risks related to different types of discrimination, including with regard to gender diversity  (gender  disparity,  in  particular  in  technical  or  expert occupations),  disability,  race,  origin,  religion,  sexual  orientation and gender identity or age could affect the Group's employees.\n\n## 2.2.2.  Regular assessment procedures\n\nOne of the pillars of Air Liquide's Human Resources strategy aims to  create  an  engaging  employee  experience,  in  particular  by fostering  Inclusion  and  Diversity.  The  latter,  sources  of  strength and  drivers  of  innovation  and  performance,  are  among  the priorities  of  the  Group's  Human  Resources  policy.  Inclusion  and Diversity are fundamental elements of the organization, in terms of both businesses and employees, and drive Air Liquide's longterm performance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At  Group  level,  the  objectives are to increase diversity within the managerial population and to improve the balance between women and men in order to ensure the availability of talents everywhere Air Liquide operates. At entity level, the objective is to have teams who represent the country in which they operate. Each entity is responsible for assessing the situation and implementing action plans specific to their country of operations and its legal framework.\n\n## Gender equal pay\n\nEach  year, Air  Liquide  assesses  the  gender  pay  gap  in  France and at Group level.\n\nIn  France,  in  accordance  with  the  law  of  September  5,  2018 known as the 'loi Avenir  professionnel', Air  Liquide  calculates  a Professional Equality Index for the 22 companies with 50 or more employees, based on five indicators defined by law. This index is presented  to  the  relevant  Social  and  Economic  Committee  and declared  to  the  French  administration.  In  2023,  the  weighted average  Professional  Equality  Index  for  all  22  companies  was 86.7/100 and that of L'Air Liquide S.A. reached 89/100. The slight decline in the latter index is exclusively due to the circumstantial effect  of  the  pre-retirement  leave  taken  by  two  members  of  the governing body.\n\nAt  Group  level,  Air  Liquide  assesses  the  gender  pay  gap  in entities with more than 200 employees using an internal equality index adapted to its international presence. It makes it possible to identify  the  gaps  in  certain  entities,  to  then  analyze  them  and undertake  action  plans  if  necessary.  This  index  is  calculated  on the basis of the weighting of four criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 pay gap, using the median fixed and variable salary, per job grade;\n- \u25a0 fixed and variable wage increase gap, per job grade;\n- \u25a0 percentage  of  employees  having  received  a  salary  increase after a maternity leave;\n- \u25a0 gender diversity among the 10 highest remunerations.\n\n## 2.2.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\nA  team  within  the  Group's  Human  Resources  Department  is responsible  for  determining  the  Inclusion  and  Diversity  roadmap and for coordinating related projects and initiatives at the global level. This roadmap is based on three pillars, detailed below:\n\n- \u25a0 tracking objectives for all entities;\n- \u25a0 mitigating  bias  in  talent  discussions  and  improving  Human Resources processes;\n- \u25a0 promoting a culture of inclusion.\n\n## Tracking objectives for all entities\n\nWith  its  Sustainable  Development  program  and  its  ADVANCE strategic  plan  for  the  2022-2025  period,  Air  Liquide  affirms  its ambition to act for all and its commitment to promoting Inclusion and Diversity. The first pillar of Air Liquide's Inclusion and Diversity roadmap is thus tracking objectives for all entities. As Air Liquide's activities are based on technical and expert occupations, in which there  are  disparities  between  women  and  men,  the  Group  has defined  objectives  for  gender  diversity.  In  this  respect,  local entities  carried  out  an  assessment  of  the  current  situation  to define  an  objective  at  the  cluster  (group  of  countries)  level  and thus contribute to the overall objective.\n\n## 2025 OBJECTIVES\n\nAir Liquide's objectives for 2025 are:\n\n- \u25a0 reach  a  35%  share  of  women  in  the  'Managers  and Professionals' population;\n- \u25a0 reach a 25% share of women in Executive positions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## THE INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT DIVISION LAUNCHES THE M[ ]RE INITIATIVE TO ACHIEVE ITS GENDER DIVERSITY GOALS\n\nLaunched  in  April  2023,  M[  ]RE  is  the  new  gender  diversity program  of  the  Innovation  and  Development  Division  (IDD), contributing to the Group's objective for women among 'Managers and Professionals'. It is based on three main actions:\n\n- \u25a0 equal opportunities recruitment: every manager ensures hiring as many men as women. The application of this principle takes into account the specificities of each market and is framed in a medium to long-term perspective;\n- \u25a0 the  cooptation  program:  each  employee  is  encouraged  to recommend  external  profiles  to  the  Group,  and  can  benefit from a doubled cooptation bonus for hiring a female profile, in compliance with the rules in force in their entity;\n- \u25a0 the TomorroW program: a set of initiatives dedicated to women at  the  beginning of their careers to support their professional development and facilitate their access to a first management position.\n\nAs  part  of  the  TomorroW  program,  80  mentoring  relations  have been  formed,  and  meetings  organized  with  Group  entity managers.  Moreover,  two  webinars  on  the  theme  of  personal development have been offered in 2023 to all employees on the topics  of  'Women in Leadership' and 'Challenging inappropriate conversations at work'.\n\nEach hub, business and entity implements its own roadmap and action  plans  promoting  Inclusion  and  Diversity,  taking  the  local context  and  regulations  into  consideration.  Thus,  other  diversity objectives,  such  as  nationality,  disability  and  ethnic  origin,  are monitored  at  local  level.  By  way  of  illustration,  in  France,  on  a scope  covering  around  6,000  employees,  Air  Liquide  and  the trade unions have signed a sixth company agreement in favor of the employment of people with disabilities from 2023 until 2025. Its objective aims to strengthen the actions already carried out to increase the direct employment rate to 6% by the end of 2025. In 2022, this rate, calculated in April 2023, was 4.46%.\n\n## Mitigating bias and improving Human Resources processes\n\nThe  Group  provides  guidance  that  helps  entities  achieve  their Inclusion  and  Diversity  objectives  throughout  the  employee journey  (recruitment,  career  management,  wages  and  benefits, professional development, etc.). Moreover, the deployment of the new  Human  Resources  management  tool  launched  in  2022 ensures that talent and performance management processes are standardized and fair, thereby limiting the risks of discrimination. The  Human  Resources  functions  in  each  hub  and  business analyze processes and practices to identify potential biases and implement  corrective  measures  ('nudges')  to  limit  these  biases. Thus,  during  the  regular  reviews  of  talents  with  high  potential, Air Liquide takes the diversity of profiles into account, with the aim of continuing to increase diversity in the Group's key positions.",

Numerous  global  and  local  initiatives  are underway to support inclusion at Air Liquide.\n\nFirstly, the Group promotes awareness-raising and training for its employees.  The  annual  training  on  the  Code  of  Conduct, mandatory for all employees, regularly includes modules related to  the  prevention  of  discrimination  and  harassment.  In  addition, the  Group  makes  training  resources  on  Inclusion  and  Diversity issues available permanently, such as the '#ILoveLearning' selfservice package (e.g. 'Bias in decision-making') and e-learnings.\n\nEvery  year, Air  Liquide  organizes  a  Diversity Awareness  Month, during  which  Inclusion  and  Diversity  are  promoted  in  several awareness-raising  sessions  open  to  all  employees.  This  event addresses the topics of cognitive biases and their mitigation and offers  sessions  dedicated  to  different  forms  of  diversity  (e.g. cultural, generational and gender diversity, disability and LGBTQ+ people).  In  2023,  these  sessions  brought  together  nearly  660 employees.  During  this  Diversity  Awareness  Month,  employees participating in the third edition of the Movement for Inclusion, a program designed to conduct experiments over several months to introduce  new  practices  to  promote  inclusion  in  their  entities, shared the results and lessons of the 30 or so projects conducted in 2023.\n\nAt local level, the entities also develop training materials adapted to their business  and  context.  For  example,  the  Human Resources Department of Air Liquide U.S. has created a Diversity &  Inclusion  toolbox  ('D&I  Learning  On  Demand  Toolkit') containing  topics,  in  a  variety  of  formats,  classified  by  level  of knowledge and target audience.\n\nSecondly, Air Liquide encourages and implements initiatives that aim  to  share  experiences  and  support  the  professional  and personal  development  of  employees  in  a  culture  of  inclusion. These  may  be  promotion  actions,  programs  for  the  managerial population, mentoring or networks and communities of interest for different groups.\n\nAt  Group  level,  the  ' Inspiring  Air  Liquide  Women '  project highlights the paths of women working within the Group from all walks of life, all geographies and all professional backgrounds to inspire other female employees, with the aim of encouraging them to dare  to  achieve  their  ambition  and  objectives both personally and professionally. 'Inspiring Air Liquide Women' is a way to celebrate the many female achievements within the Group. These stories of 120 women from 43 different nationalities were published on a dedicated website (https://inspiringwomen. airliquide.com/about) to celebrate Air Liquide's 120 th anniversary.\n\n## IN ASIA PACIFIC, AIR LIQUIDE SUPPORTS MANAGERS TO PROMOTE GENDER DIVERSITY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  2023,  the  'I  Advance  Women  Managers  &  Professionals' initiative  was  launched  in  Asia  Pacific  to  support  managers towards the achievement of gender diversity objectives by 2025. Men and women employees committed to diversity led interactive workshops  to  work  directly  with  600  managers  on  barriers  and obstacles  to  gender  diversity.  At  the  end  of  the  sessions,  they made  individual  commitments  and  set  up  an  action  plan  to remove  these  barriers.  In  addition  to  awareness-raising,  this initiative  aims  to  generate  individual  responsibility  in  creating  an inclusive  environment  where  everyone  thrives.  Furthermore,  the hub  Asia  Pacific,  has  created  and  made  available  to  the operational entities a catalog of resources and actions in favor of Inclusion and Diversity, based on previous experience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt European level, the HandivAirsity initiative aims to encourage diversity  by  integrating  people  with  disabilities  in  teams.  The slogan 'Our differences make our performance', carries a strong conviction  which  is  fully  in  line  with  the  Inclusion  and  Diversity roadmap of Air  Liquide. The  Group  is  committed  to  researching and implementing solutions allowing for the successful inclusion of people with disabilities throughout their professional career.\n\nAir  Liquide  makes  organizational  and  material  adjustments, reviewed in case of change, to adapt the working situation to the disability, such as:\n\n- \u25a0 schedule adjustments, additional remote working and workload adjustment;\n- \u25a0 ergonomic studies and specific equipment and tools;\n- \u25a0 adaptations to facilitate access to work premises;\n- \u25a0 specific training and individual support services;\n- \u25a0 transportation and moving assistance.\n\nFurthermore, the Group raises awareness of its employees about the  inclusion  of  disabilities  in  order  to  facilitate  the  recruitment, welcoming and professional integration of workers with disabilities in the company.\n\nIn France, the deployment of HandivAirsity rests on a network of key  players:  the  National  Disability  Mission,  in  charge  of coordinating  the  implementation  of  the  Disability  policy  and supporting  entities,  and  referents  who  notably  coordinate  a network  of  ambassadors.  Each  French  subsidiary  organizes  an annual  activity  plan  to  inform  its  employees  and  fight  against prejudice, in particular during the European Disability Employment Week (EDEW) or the DuoDay (2) . In addition, managers in France attended a specific training in 2023 for a successful inclusion of people  with  disabilities  within  teams,  to  remove  barriers  to recruitment  and  to  support  them  in  their  questions.  Now ambassadors  to  their  peers,  they  contribute  through  their testimonials to mobilizing everyone around inclusion.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is particularly the case in the United States, where communities in networks known  as  'Business Resource Groups' (BRGs) have been created for women, veterans, AfricanAmericans, LGBTQ+ people, Hispanic and Asian Americans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IN THE UNITED STATES, AIR LIQUIDE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE INCLUSION OF LGBTQ+ PEOPLE\n\nIn  2023,  Air  Liquide  United  States  received  for  the  fourth consecutive year the 'Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality' distinction awarded by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, which rewards companies that implement policies and procedures that  promote  equality  of  LGBTQ+  people  at  work. The  Group  is committed to ensuring the well-being of all its employees and will therefore  continue,  like  employees  in  the  United  States,  to promote a culture of Inclusion and Diversity.\n\n## 2.2.4.  Monitoring of measures implemented and the assessment of their effectiveness\n\nIn  terms  of  gender  equality,  Air  Liquide  has  created  its  own procedure to define its reporting methods for Human Resources indicators. This procedure  includes  all  of  the  definitions, measurement  procedures  and  collection  methods  for  this information. Each month, the subsidiaries update the indicators in the Group's reporting tool.\n\n## Gender equality\n\n|                                                          | 2025  objectives   | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Share of women  among 'Managers  and Professionals'  (a) | 35%                | 31%    | 31.5%  | 32.0%  |\n| Share of women in  Executive positions                   | 25%                | 24%    | 24.8%  | 24.7%  |\n\n- (a) The share of women among 'Managers and Professionals' is rounded off in increments of 0.5%.\n\n## Gender equal pay\n\n|                                             |   2021 |     |   2022 |     | 2023   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|-----|--------|-----|--------|\n| Professional Equality  Index in France  (a) |   86.5 |     |   90.5 |     | 86.7   |\n| Internal equality index  for the Group  (b) |   75   | (c) |   77   | (d) | -      |\n\n- (c) Results for 2021 calculated in 2022 on a scope representing 74% of the Group's workforce.\n- (d) Results for 2022 calculated in 2023 on a scope representing 81% of the Group's workforce.\n\nThe  result  of  the  2022  internal  equality  index  for  the  Group, calculated  in  2023,  was  77/100  for  a  coverage  of  81%  of  the Group's  workforce,  whereas  the  result  of  the  2021  index  was 75/100  for  a  scope  covering  74%  of  the  workforce.  An improvement actions are rolled out on a yearly basis:\n\n- \u25a0 part  of  the  'Merit  Increase'  budget  was  allocated  to  filling wages gaps;\n- \u25a0 awareness workshops on the index criteria were organized for the Human Resources functions and the managers.\n\n## 2.3.   RISKS RELATED TO THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE WORK ENVIRONMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.3.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nThe  work  environment  is  characterized  by  the  accelerated evolution  of  society  and  the  economy  with  digitization,  rapid technological development and new business models. An intense workload can create psychosocial risks such as stress, work-life imbalance  and  thus  affect  the  well-being,  health  and  level  of engagement of Group employees.\n\n## 2.3.2.  Regular assessment procedures\n\nEmployee  engagement  is  one  of  Human  Resources'  priorities. Air  Liquide  is  conducting  a  program  to measure  engagement , My Voice, which aims to improve the experience and well-being of employees.  It  is  based  on  a  simple  concept:  listen,  understand and  act.  Each  year,  the  Group  sends  a  questionnaire  to  all employees, asking about their experience at Air Liquide in order to better  understand  their  expectations,  identify  and  implement appropriate actions and thus significantly improve their engagement.",

    {
        "page_content": "The  questionnaire  addresses  around  20  topics  and  allows comments  to  be  made.  The  questions  relate  to  several dimensions  of  the  employee  experience,  both  at  the  personal level  (e.g.  work-life  balance,  inclusion,  respect,  empowerment, career and development opportunities) and the functioning of the organization  (e.g.  safety,  continuous  improvement,  procedures, decision-making  and  team  collaboration).  The  responses  are anonymized  to  ensure  that  employees  are  free  to  express  their thoughts.  Results  are  collected  in  real  time,  aggregated  and analyzed by means of a shared system for the entire Group. Once the survey is completed, each manager has access to their team's results  -  if  the  thresholds  guaranteeing  the  confidentiality  of  the responses are reached - to help them in their mission and enable them to share the results with their team.\n\n## 2.3.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\nOne of the pillars of Air Liquide's Human Resources strategy aims to  create  an  engaging  employee  experience.  The  Group  thus strives to pursue  the  transformation,  in  particular  through continuous feedback (My Voice), to foster greater mental health at work and to adapt to new ways of working whilst maintaining a sense of belonging.\n\nWith  the  My  Voice  program,  Air  Liquide  strives  to  offer  all employees  a  successful  professional  experience,  that  promotes listening and dialog, at every stage of their career with the Group. Paying close attention to the employee experience is a key factor in attracting, retaining and developing employees.\n\nEach  year,  following  the  collection  of  feedback  and  precise analysis of the results, targeted actions are launched at different levels in the organization: with managers and their employees to improve  team  dynamics,  at  the  level  of  the  entities  by management teams and at the Group level. In 2023, the survey period took place in September, instead of April in previous years. At  the  end  of  2023,  the  process  of  identifying  and  deploying actions  based  on  the  results  of  the  survey  was  therefore  still ongoing, both at the level of team managers and at higher levels within the Group.\n\nIn 2019, the Group partnered with the European Works Council to develop  the  'Care  and  Perform'  initiative,  whose  purpose  is  to prevent psychosocial risks. This initiative led to the drawing up of a  charter  based  on  principles  co-constructed  with  the  European social partners of action relating to improvement of organization, workload and the work-life balance of employees. The content of this  charter  facilitated  the  signing  of  company  agreements  with social  partners  in  order  to  offer  new  services  to  employees.  In several European countries, agreements have been concluded to meet  specific  needs  and  support  the  transition  toward  new working  conditions,  in  particular  on  the  right  to  disconnect  and remote working.\n\nMore  generally,  within  the  context  of  changes  to  organizational models and ways of working, the Group launched a global project in  2020  called  'Next  Normal'  to  support  this  shift  in  working methods.With  this project, the entities can provide their employees with:\n\n- \u25a0 a working framework including team management;\n- \u25a0 a structured remote working policy;\n- \u25a0 reorganization of workspaces;\n- \u25a0 a framework for rethinking customer and patient interactions;\n- \u25a0 a new framework for a responsible travel policy at Air Liquide.\n\n(3)\n\nTo  facilitate  the  rollout  of  the  project,  Air  Liquide  developed  a reference  guide  in  2021.  First  shared  with  managers,  the  guide helps  the  entities  to  set  up  new  working  methods  based  on  the initial  global  experiments.  Working  groups  were  then  organized with  employees  in  the  entities  to  validate  the  commitments.  As part  of  the  'Next  Normal'  project,  the  European  Works  Council drafted  a  reference  document  in  2022  sharing  in  particular guidelines for social dialog in European entities and New Design of Offices attention points.\n\n## 2.3.4.  Monitoring of measures implemented and the assessment of their effectiveness\n\n|                              | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Response rate for the annual |        |        |        |\n| My Voice survey              | 83%    | 77%    | 81%    |\n\nSince  its launch, the My  Voice  program  has  confirmed Air Liquide's strengths which contribute to employee engagement and  identified  opportunities,  particularly  in  a  demanding  and dynamic international  and  economic  context,  in  order  to  provide appropriate  responses  as  quickly  as  possible  (paragraph  2.3.3, page 101).\n\n## 2.4.   RISKS RELATED TO DISPARITIES IN CARE COVERAGE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.4.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nWhile  all  Air Liquide employees  have  care  coverage  in accordance  with  local  regulations,  disparities  between  countries could create inequitable situations within the Group. Furthermore, local standards may not, in some cases, be sufficient to provide adequate and fair social protection for employees.\n\n## 2.4.2.  Regular assessment procedures\n\nThe risks  are  linked  to Air  Liquide's  presence  in  72  countries (3) with a variety of social protection systems .\n\nIn  2020,  a  project  was  launched  within  the  Human  Resources Department to organize a survey among its correspondents in all the  entities.  The  form  containing  about  10  questions  was designed to better understand the level of care coverage existing in the entities.\n\nIn 2021, an in-depth assessment was performed in addition to the survey to:\n\n- \u25a0 map the existing social benefits;\n- \u25a0 identify the contrasting situations between countries;\n- \u25a0 assess the deviations from market standards and thus define a common basis of care coverage to best meet the concerns of employees.\n\nFollowing this assessment, Air Liquide decided to offer a common basis of care coverage to employees.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\n## 2025 OBJECTIVE\n\nWith  its  Sustainable  Development  program  and  its  ADVANCE strategic  plan  for  the  2022-2025  period,  Air  Liquide  affirms  its ambition to act for all by committing to offer a common basis of care  coverage  for  100%  of  employees  by  2025.  This  care coverage guarantees:\n\n- \u25a0 a  life  insurance  policy  with  an  indemnity  equivalent  to  one year's salary;\n- \u25a0 health coverage that includes inpatient and outpatient care;\n- \u25a0 a minimum of 14 weeks paid maternity leave.\n\nFrom May to September 2021, entities were grouped by country so that gaps in their current coverage could be assessed and a plan could be devised to phase in upgrades by 2025.\n\nA  special  team  was  set  up  within  the  Human  Resources Department to  oversee  the  plan's  rollout  and  measure  progress within  the  Group  on  an  annual  basis.  In  addition,  in  2022,  each hub has drawn up a 2023-2025 roadmap to achieve the objective.\n\n## 2.4.4.

RISKS RELATED TO THE VIOLATION OF PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n## 2.5.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nPersonal  data  can  be  used  dishonestly  in  order  to  violate  the privacy,  rights  and  property  of  individuals,  or  for  purposes  of discrimination.  The  people  most  likely  to  be  exposed  to  these risks in the context of Air Liquide's activities are the 2 million home healthcare patients treated by Air Liquide, the 800,000 individual Shareholders and the 67,800 Group employees.\n\n## 2.5.2.  Regular assessment procedures\n\nThe level of risk of violation of the privacy of individuals varies according  to  the  nature,  sensitivity  and  scope  of  personal  data entrusted  to  and  necessary  to  Air  Liquide  in  the  course  of  its activities.\n\nOperating entities describe the personal data they own or use and the appropriate protection measures. The assessment of this risk and the corresponding security measures are validated during the creation of or implementation of major changes to the processing of  personal  data  (in  particular  when  revising  the  operational processes or IT tools supporting them).\n\nThe points assessed include in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 the nature of the personal data (e.g. patient health data, asset and financial data of Shareholders, family or financial data of employees);\n- \u25a0 the purposes of personal data processing activities;\n- \u25a0 the functions that process personal data within Air Liquide;\n- \u25a0 third  parties  to  whom  personal  data  may  be  entrusted  or transferred outside the Group;\n- \u25a0 the  possible  transfer  of  personal  data  outside  the  European Union.\n\nThis information as well as the protective measures are grouped together in the record of personal data processing activities.\n\n## 2.5.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\nIn  May  2018,  Air  Liquide  adopted  and  had  the  European  data protection  authorities  approve  Binding  Corporate  Rules  (BCR) which  embody  the  Group's  commitment  to  the  protection  of personal data. Considering European regulations to be among the most  protective  in  the  world,  Air  Liquide,  through  the  BCR, provides the same level of protection in all of its operating entities.\n\nThe BCR provide for:\n\n- \u25a0 the adoption of a personal data protection policy accessible to all  on  the  Group's  website  (https://www.airliquide.com/sites/ airliquide.com/files/2021/05/04/air-liquide-bcr-global-privacypolicy.pdf);\n- \u25a0 the appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who relies on  a  network  of  more  than  150  regional  or  local  Information Protection  Coordinators  (IPC)  spread  throughout  the  Group (by hub, cluster - group of countries - business or operating entity) to steer and coordinate actions to protect personal data;\n- \u25a0 the  signing  of  contracts  between  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  and  its subsidiaries which formalize the commitment of the subsidiaries to the BCR;\n- \u25a0 and the rollout of tools such as:\n- -records of personal data processing activities,\n- -initial employee training accompanied every two years by a reminder during training sessions on the Code of Conduct,\n- -taking  into  account  the  protection  of  personal  data  by default and from the design stage of the processing,\n- -risk analyses regarding the protection of personal data,\n- -various  means  available  to  contact  the  DPO  and  IPC  to allow internal or external natural persons to make a request to exercise their rights as specified in the Group's personal data protection policy (Rule no. 6) or to report any personal data protection violations (paragraph 6.2.2, page 125).",

The  Group,  as  a  responsible industry player, is therefore committed to efficiently and under all circumstances reducing the exposure of its employees, subcontractors, customers, patients, suppliers and local communities to professional, industrial and health risks.\n\nSafety  and  security  refer  to  the  measures  and  practices implemented to preserve the life, health and physical integrity of individuals.  Safety  is  achieved  by  controlling  industrial  process, road,  occupational  and  product  risks.  Security  is  achieved  by protecting  sites  and  operations,  notably  against  malicious  acts, and by controlling business travel.\n\nThe  safety  results  for  the  past  30-plus  years  illustrate  the  longterm effectiveness of the Group's actions in this area.\n\nActivities related to the protection of personal data as well as the results of these various measures are presented internally to the Digital  Security  Committee,  and  the  Ethics  and  Compliance Committee, as well as to the Audit and Accounts Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nLastly,  the  Group's  Internal  Audit  Department  includes  the protection  of  personal  data  in  the  planned  audits  of  entities  or conducts audits specific to the protection of personal data as part of the internal audit plan or at the request of the DPO.\n\n|                                                              | 2021       | 2022       | 2023       |     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|-----|\n| Exercise of rights  and alleged violations  of personal data | 56         | 50         | 124        | (a) |\n| Number of  subsidiaries adhering  to the BCR  (b)            | 341 of 375 | 342 of 379 | 380 of 385 | (c) |\n| Maturity  assessment  (d)                                    | 2.74       | 3.01       | 3.20       |     |\n| Number of audits  carried out                                | 2          | 7          | 3          | (e) |\n\n- (a) The number of people exercising their rights has increased significantly in the Americas with the growing awareness of their rights by people in the Americas.\n- (b) The  number  of  subsidiaries  adhering  to  the  Binding  Corporate  Rules (BCR) is measured in relation to the number of subsidiaries concerned, that is to say the subsidiaries with employees.

A FRAMEWORK FOR SAFE AND RELIABLE OPERATIONS\n\nIndustrial  risks  are  linked  to  the  various  products,  industrial processes  and  distribution  methods  implemented  by  the  Group. They are distributed over a large number of local production sites.\n\nTo assess and manage these risks, the Group has an Industrial Management System (IMS), which is applicable in all Air Liquide subsidiaries. The IMS is based on:\n\n- \u25a0 the  accountability  of  the  departments  of  the  various  Group subsidiaries for the implementation of this system;\n- \u25a0 issuance  of  key  organizational  and  management  procedures relating respectively to:\n- -compliance with standards and regulations,\n- -competence management (training, qualifications if necessary, and more),\n- -process risk management,\n- -occupational health, safety and environmental management,\n- -road safety management,\n- -industrial emergency management,\n- -management of change,\n- -management of maintenance,\n- -control of products and services from providers,\n- -management of installation projects,\n- -management of product development,\n- -management of production and service provision,\n- -incident reporting and investigation,\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  IMS  document library aims to document the Group's knowledge and requirements  to  ensure  the  safe  and  reliable  operation  of  its industrial processes. It is continuously updated and enriched.\n\nAs the Group's businesses grow, the level of requirements of its customers  increases  and  Air  Liquide's  commitment  to  societal responsibility  is  strengthened,  new  challenges  and  opportunities arise.  Thus,  building  on  the  experience  acquired,  a  project  was carried  out  to  adapt  the  IMS.  While  maintaining  the  strong fundamentals  established  since  2005,  the  procedure  was simplified, roles and responsibilities made clearer and governance strengthened, making the IMS easier to apply to daily operations and therefore even more effective.\n\nThe Safety and Industrial System Department and the Industrial Departments of the World Business Lines, under the supervision of  a  member of the Executive Committee, supervise and control the implementation of the IMS, by notably relying on:\n\n- \u25a0 various dashboards designed to monitor performance in terms of safety;\n- \u25a0 process  audits  to  verify  the  implementation  conditions  and compliance of operations with IMS requirements;\n- \u25a0 thorough  safety  reviews  prior  to  the  start-up  of  any  new production unit to prevent any accidents due to a construction defect;\n- \u25a0 technical  audits  to  ensure  the  compliance  of  operations  with Group rules.\n\nA regular assessment of industrial risks that may affect individuals covers  all  Group  activities  in  all  geographies.  The  frequency  of these  assessments  is  adapted  to  each  subject:  for  example, monthly  safety  performance  reviews  or  an  annual  review  of technical audits. Other topics require assessments at an ad hoc pace.\n\nThe  Industrial  Management  System,  IMS,  institutionalizes  the methodical 'Plan - Do - Check - Act' approach which is essential for process safety. The efforts made to carry out risk assessments are bearing fruit and the lessons learned from incidents are being used  to  strengthen  the  safety  barriers  of  the  installations,  thus preventing the recurrence of incidents.\n\nThe IMS defines the industrial audit process, its governance and its  implementation.  This  audit  process  makes  it  possible  to periodically analyze and assess the compliance of the activities of each subsidiary with its own industrial management system, the effectiveness of this system and its compliance with the Group's Industrial  Management  System.  Following  an  industrial  audit, action  plans  are  implemented  based  on  the  opportunities  for improvement identified, and best practices are shared.\n\nSubsidiaries regularly report all safety and security events in the Group's  reporting  tool.  Each  month,  every  event  reported  is reviewed  by  a  team  of  experts.  The  most  serious  events  are analyzed  in  detail,  the  corrective  action  plan  is  reviewed  and approved  at  the  appropriate  management  level,  and  lessons learned  are  shared  with  Group  entities  potentially  affected  by similar situations.\n\nThe Industrial and Safety Committee is composed of the heads of the five Industrial Departments of the World Business Lines, the Group  Head  of  Safety,  as  well  as  a  representative  of  the Engineering  &  Construction  and  Global  Markets  & Technologies World  Business  Units.  Its  purpose  is  to  examine  industrial  risks and safety  performance,  as  well  as  monitor  the  progress  of  the main  improvement  measures,  in  particular  those  relating  to  the greatest  risks  and/or  cross-divisional  measures.  The  Committee meets six to eight times a year and is chaired by a member of the Group's Executive Committee.\n\nThe evolution  of  the  safety  performance  of  operations  and  their level of compliance with IMS requirements are regularly monitored by the Executive Committee as well as by the Environment and Society Committee.\n\n## 3.2.   RISKS RELATED TO WORKER SAFETY\n\n## 3.2.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nBeyond  the  usual  risks  inherent  in  all  industrial  activities, Air Liquide's businesses entail more specific risks that may affect individuals.  Industrial  processes  notably  expose  employees  and subcontractors  to  the  corresponding  risks  (paragraph  3.3,  page 106). Road transport, a major activity for transporting products to customers,  results  in  the  exposure  of  drivers  (employees  or subcontractors)  and  third  parties  to  the  risk  of  road  accidents (paragraph 3.4, page 107).\n\nIn  addition,  industrial  sites  use  numerous  motorized  lifting  gear which present specific risks in connection with handling (collision, falling packages, etc.). Training and qualification are thus required to operate them.\n\n## 3.2.2.  Regular assessment procedures\n\nA Job Hazard Analysis ensures a safe workplace for all, with the implementation of prevention measures adapted to the configuration  of  the  work  environment  and  the  needs  of employees.  Thus,  each  job  was  subject  to  risk  analysis  in accordance with the following steps:\n\n- \u25a0 identification of risks related to the tasks to be performed;\n- \u25a0 assessment of their severity and the probability of occurrence;\n- \u25a0 identification of critical points; and finally,\n- \u25a0 identification and implementation of prevention measures.\n\nWork  habits,  poor  postures,  access  routes,  etc.,  are  also  taken into account in these analyses.\n\nIn the course of its activities, Air Liquide may use subcontractors. In  this  event,  the  Group  ensures  that  the  level  of  safety requirements and rigor applicable to subcontractors is equivalent to that expected of the Group's employees. To this end, the Group includes a description of its security requirements in the contracts it  signs  with  subcontractors.  New  suppliers  are  subject  to  a technical assessment covering, in particular, safety and reliability issues.\n\n## 3.2.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\nAir Liquide relies on continuous actions to raise the awareness of its  teams  through  specific  training  related  to  the  knowledge  and the mitigation of industrial risks that may affect individuals. Each employee  working  on  an  industrial  site  receives  training  and qualification  courses  specific  to  their  job  and  is  equipped  with personal  protective  equipment  allowing  them  to  perform  their tasks  in  the  best  conditions.  Collective  protective  equipment  is also installed in the various workshops, if necessary.",

Since their creation in 2013, Air Liquide is committed to ensuring that its Life-Saving Rules are complied with at each site and at all times. Everyone working for Air Liquide, whether an employee or subcontractor, must know these rules, follow them and always intervene if there is a risk of unsafe behavior or conditions. The interpretation and meaning of each rule is widely shared within the\n\nGroup and with subcontractors. The Life-Saving Rules are in force in  all  countries  and  translated  into  at  least  ten  languages.  The Safety  and  Industrial  System  Department  provides  entities  with various communication, awareness-raising and training materials. Failure  to  comply  with  the  Life-Saving  Rules  by  any  person working at an Air Liquide site is a serious act that may result in appropriate disciplinary measures, up to and including exclusion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.

Previous editions made it possible to take a major step forward in improving the Group's safety culture. This 2023 edition of the 'European Safety Awards' was an opportunity to focus on knowledge and understanding of safety risks, a necessary prerequisite in Air Liquide's safety culture. The 'Safer together' theme enabled further work on raising awareness of security risks, as part of a proactive prevention approach, and highlighted certain initiatives deployed by European entities on the knowledge and management of safety risks among customers and patients, subcontractors and employees.\n\nWhen Air Liquide uses subcontractors as part of its activities, the contracts include safety clauses and the Group communicates to the subcontractors  the  safety  values,  standards  and  regulations  in  force  that  must  be  respected.  Safety  instructions  are  widely  shared, understandable and detailed in the organization of work with subcontractors, who are supervised during the execution of services. Finally, Air Liquide assesses the safety performance of subcontractors once the task has been completed and encourages sharing in the form of feedback.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PRIVILEGED MOMENTS TO MEET SUBCONTRACTORS IN POLAND\n\nEach year, Air  Liquide  Poland  organizes  a  Safety  Week  in  September.  This  is  an  additional  opportunity  to  meet  the  subcontractors, carriers and the main customers with whom the Group works on a daily basis. This makes it possible to instill a different dynamic on the subject  of  safety,  which  is  part  of  the  regular  training  programs.  This  week  was  punctuated  by  numerous  activities,  including  the simulation of a fall from height and the extinguishing of a simulated fire, a simulation of working at height, another one using virtual reality glasses to simulate driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs, and consultations with a physiotherapist. This approach ensures that safety,  a  fundamental  value  of Air  Liquide,  is  shared  with  its  business  partners,  because  only  together  can  this  safety  culture  benefit everyone.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Monitoring of measures implemented and the assessment of their effectiveness\n\nThe lost-time accident frequency rate is one of the safety performance review indicators. As illustrated in the chart below, this frequency rate has steadily improved over the years for Air Liquide employees and subcontractors.\n\n## LOST-TIME ACCIDENT FREQUENCY RATE (a) OF AIR LIQUIDE EMPLOYEES AND SUBCONTRACTORS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a) Number of accidents with at least one day's absence per million hours worked.\n\nThe lost-time accident frequency rate of Air Liquide employees and temporary  workers  slightly  increased  by  +4%  and  tends  towards 1.0 at the end of 2023, compared to 0.9 at the end of 2022.\n\nThe  Group  has  made  and  will  continue  to  make  every  effort  to analyze  the  accidents  that  have  occurred  in  order  to  learn  from them and thus prevent them from happening again. To achieve a significant and lasting reduction in lost-time accidents, Air Liquide must remain vigilant at all times, continue to raise awareness and take all preventive actions to reinforce the safety culture within its teams.\n\nWith  regard  to  subcontractors,  over  the  long  term,  the  lost-time accident  frequency  rate  has  improved.  In  2023,  the  number  of lost-time accidents of subcontractors decreased  by  -16% significantly reducing the corresponding frequency rate. However, efforts  still  need  to  be  made  to  further  reduce  the  number  of accidents  for  subcontracted  operators  and  drivers  and  thus achieve  a  level  of  safety  performance  similar  to  the  one  of  the Group employees.\n\nAir  Liquide  is  aware  that  managing  risks  for  subcontractors  is  a challenge:  the  subcontractor  management  process  includes several phases involving different stakeholders and their 'market profile'  may  create  unfavorable  conditions  (e.g.  a  high  driver turnover  rate,  a  limited  choice  of  subcontractors,  a  weak  local safety culture). In order to improve the safety performance of its subcontractors,  the  Group  identified  the  main  areas  of  work  in 2020 (types  of  contracts,  business  lines,  geographies,  etc.)  and best practices (internally and thanks to external benchmarks), and improvement actions are gradually being implemented (paragraph 3.2.3, page 104).\n\n## 3.3. RISKS RELATED TO PROCESS SAFETY\n\n## 3.3.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nIndustrial risks must be factored in at the design phase of future installations.  During  the  construction  phase,  the  lack  of  a  strict accident  prevention  framework  would  affect  the  coordination among  the  various  stakeholders  and  expose  teams  to  risks  of accidents.\n\nBased on the risk prevention work carried out by Air Liquide for many years, the salient risks related to industrial processes are:\n\n- \u25a0 exposure to hazardous energy sources, fluids and emissions, such as electricity, pressure, steam, hot water, high or very low temperatures;\n- \u25a0 fires  resulting,  in  particular,  from  flammable  products  and materials or electrical installations; and\n- \u25a0 exposure of people to dust and hazardous chemicals through inhalation, ingestion or skin contact.\n\n## 3.3.2.  Regular assessment procedures\n\nLike all production (primary production and packaging), distribution and research activities, the Group and its subcontractors are exposed to risks related to process safety.\n\nRisks  related  to  process  safety  are  analyzed  using  various methods,  in  particular  the  HAZOP  (HAZard  and  OPerability analysis) methodology. A multidisciplinary team contributes to the comprehensiveness of the identification of credible scenarios that could lead to a critical situation, taking into account the unwanted events  identified  through  the  analyses  of  process  and  HSE (Health  Safety  Environment)  risks.  On  this  basis,  each  Group subsidiary is required to implement measures to prevent the risks identified at each of its industrial sites.",

        "page_content": "In addition to generic risks, each subsidiary, under the supervision of its Managing Director, regularly identifies specific risks related to  its  production  and  packaging  activities.  The  objective  is  to identify  the  hazards  globally  and  for  each  facility,  in  order  to assess  the  risks  and  implement  the  necessary  preventive measures.\n\n## 3.3.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\nProcess safety is a complex issue as, although rare, incidents can lead to very serious consequences with multiple fatalities. In order to  ensure  that  operations  efficiently  take  this  risk  into  account, Air  Liquide  has  introduced  specific  action  plans,  the  purpose  of which  is  to  control  the  most  severe  risks  relating  to  industrial processes.  They  have  been  assigned  the  necessary  resources (expertise and budgets) and follow a roadmap.\n\n## Management of industrial emergencies\n\nIn  the  event  of  an  emergency,  the  primary  responsibility  of  the entity's  Managing  Director  is  to  analyze  its  nature,  assess  both the severity of the situation and the potential impacts on the basis of the risks previously identified, and take all necessary measures to  ensure  the  safety  of  people.  A  24/7  on-call  system  receives emergency calls and contacts the people responsible for setting up an appropriate response at local level.\n\nA  business  continuity  plan  adapted  to  each  entity  describes  the previously  defined  sequence  of  actions  that  will  allow  the continuation or restoration of operational functions, IT resources, networks and facilities in the event of an unexpected disruption to the service. The aim of this plan is to protect people and property and to limit the impact of the disruption on the entity's activities.\n\nExercises are regularly carried out on a variety of scenarios, and the  results  and  lessons  learned  are  documented, thus informing the business continuity plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AN INTERNAL OPERATION PLAN RETHOUGHT AT CASTRES' SITE (FRANCE) THANKS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES\n\nBeing well prepared for emergencies is essential in order to react appropriately  and  limit  the  impacts.  An  Internal  Operation  Plan (IOP)  that  is  regularly  updated  is  key  in  anticipating  such incidents. In Seppic Castres, a upper-tier Seveso site, this IOP is tested at least once a year during an exercise carried out jointly with  firefighters.  Each  month,  Seppic's  second  response  team, which  supports  firefighters,  undergoes  on-site  training,  thus putting into practice one of the scenarios provided for in the IOP. In  2023,  the  site  rethought  its  IOP  to  make  it  even  more operational  by  taking  advantage  of  the  availability  of  new  tools and  technologies  (e.g.  semi-automatic  staff  counting  solution before the assembly point, mobile weather station, communication screens, skills matrix for training the Seppic response team).\n\n(1)\n\n## 3.3.4.  Monitoring of measures implemented and the assessment of their effectiveness\n\nAs  with  the  safety  of  employees  and  subcontractors,  the subsidiaries regularly report all events related to process safety in the  Group's  reporting  tool.  Each  month,  every  event  reported  is reviewed  by  a  team  of  industrial  processes  experts.  The  most serious events are analyzed in detail, presented to the Industrial and  Safety  Committee  (paragraph  3.1,  page  103),  and  lessons learned  are  shared  with  Group  entities  that  could  be  potentially affected by similar situations.\n\nThe progress of specific action plans aimed at bringing the most serious  risks  related  to  industrial  processes  under  control  is regularly monitored by the Group's General Management.\n\nThe  industrial  process  risk  management  process  is  subject  to regular audits by the Group's Industrial Audit Department.\n\n## 3.4.   RISKS RELATED TO ROAD SAFETY\n\n## 3.4.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nAir Liquide delivers products to its customers and patients by road in  72  countries (1) .  Each  year,  delivery  vehicles,  sales  staff  and technicians  travel  hundreds  of  millions  of  kilometers.  Noncompliance  with  traffic  regulations  or  the  lack  of  regular maintenance of vehicles would expose drivers and third parties to increased risks of accidents.\n\n## 3.4.2.  Regular assessment procedures\n\nAir Liquide relies on a structured program to mitigate risks on the road. This program was strengthened in 2020 by the update of the internal  requirements  procedure.  Operations  are  assessed  and audited regularly to ensure compliance with this procedure.\n\n## 3.4.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\nThe  road  safety  program  is  based  on  several  mitigation  and prevention actions, the main ones being:\n\n- \u25a0 equipping vehicles with technologies to assist drivers, to warn them in the event of danger or to protect them in the event of an accident. This is a rapidly changing field and Air Liquide is committed  to  providing  the  best  technologies  possible  to  its own  fleet  of  vehicles,  as  well  as  those  of  transport professionals  working  on  its  behalf.  Around  60%  of  the vehicles are already equipped, and the aim is to reach 80% in the coming years;\n- \u25a0 regularly raising awareness among professional and occasional drivers on safe behavior on the road;\n- \u25a0 developing the role of master drivers (in driving  and  loading/ unloading  operations)  who  mentor  new  drivers  and  serve  as role models within their organization. Identified on the basis of technical  criteria,  these  master  drivers  actively  contribute  to forging the driver's safety mindset and participate in improving training and qualification processes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The system deployed in the South-East Asia cluster (group of countries) makes it possible to collect, visualize and analyze the behavior of each driver. Close collaboration between drivers, master drivers and managers is the key to success. The combination of these technological elements with the sharing of best practices between the entities in  the  road-related  risk  prevention  program  has  enabled  Air  Liquide  Indonesia  to  significantly  improve  road  safety.  In  addition  to technology, root cause analysis and driver well-being are key elements of this progress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IN AMERICA, AIR LIQUIDE HONORS ITS DRIVERS AND PROMOTES ROAD SAFETY\n\nIn the United States, Airgas organizes the National Driver Recognition Week each year. This campaign encourages management and teams to show their recognition of the work done by Airgas drivers by honoring them locally. It promotes the continuous efforts of drivers to  deliver  products  to  customers  safely  and  on  time  and  their  overall  contribution  to  the  safety  of  roads  and  highways.  Drivers  are committed  to  giving  prevention  advice  and  reminding  everyone  of  their  responsibilities  on  the  road.  These  behaviors  reinforce  the message of the Air Liquide Group program: 'Together, make the roads safer because we care.'\n\nIn  2023,  Air  Liquide  Argentina  organized  its  road  safety  week  with  the  support  of  its  management,  Procurement  and  Logistics Departments, commercial activities, master drivers and managers from all its carriers. Throughout the week, the webinars and activities organized involved employees, subcontractors and drivers. The week ended with a moment of recognition for the best drivers of the transport  partners,  with  their  families  present.  The  best  suggestions  for  improvement  raised  during  this  week  will  be  taken  up  and implemented in all Latin American countries from 2024.\n\n## 3.4.4.  Monitoring of measures implemented and the assessment of their effectiveness\n\n## ROAD SAFETY: FREQUENCY OF PREVENTABLE SERIOUS ACCIDENTS WITH INJURIES (a)\n\n(a) Per million km driven by trucks of over 3.5 metric tonnes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.5.   RISKS RELATED TO PRODUCT SAFETY\n\n## 3.5.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nThe intrinsic properties of industrial and medical gases manufactured, transformed or packaged by the Group classify them in the hazardous materials category. Their use is safe, provided that good practices and recommendations are complied with.\n\nWith regard to risks related to road safety, the year 2023 shows a slight  decline  in  performance  compared  to  the  previous  year  It was  marked  by  the  death  of  a  truck  employee  driver  in  a  road accident.  In  addition,  several  accidents  involving  an  Air  Liquide vehicle, unfortunately resulted in the death of third parties.\n\nThe  analysis  of  road  accidents  in  recent  years  has  highlighted certain  recurring  causes,  such  as  fatigue  or  distraction  while driving.  Air  Liquide's  2021-2025  program  seeking  to  implement digital  driving  assistance  and  fatigue  prevention  technologies  is being  pursued  as  well  as  its  support  for  changes  in  driving behavior in all the geographies where the Group operates. These initiatives are gradually improving transport safety on the road.\n\nBeyond  the  risks  inherent  to  the  intrinsic  properties  of  gases, other risks must also be considered, such as:\n\n- \u25a0 the  risk  of  faults  in  the  systems  supplying  gas  to  customers and  patients,  which  could  lead  to  a  disruption  to  supply,  in terms  of  quality  or  volumes,  which  could  notably  have  an impact on a patient's health;\n- \u25a0 the  risk  of  possible  failure  to  comply  with  specific  standards and  regulations,  in  particular  in  Healthcare,  with  the  risk  of non-compliance of products and services provided to patients.",

Regular assessment procedures\n\nThe  regulatory  watch  process  integrated  in  the  Industrial Management System (IMS) in place in each Air Liquide subsidiary (paragraph 3.1, page 103) ensures product compliance with any regulatory changes applicable to them.\n\nLikewise,  the  IMS  procedure  on  the  management  of  product development includes  the  analysis  of  associated  risks,  from  the moment the products are designed, including the need for them to be used safely.\n\n## 3.5.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\nIn compliance with regulations in force, each gas storage device is equipped with a label showing, among other things, the name of the product and the associated risks.\n\nIn the particular case of gas cylinders, the color of the shoulder is different  depending  on  the  main  risk  of  the  gas  it  contains.  The safety data sheets present the risks of each of these gases. The cylinders are fitted with a cap protecting the valve which must be operated by hand and whose connections differ depending on the gas  in  order  to  avoid  any  incorrect  connection.  Their  storage  is regulated and must be done in a dedicated place.\n\n## 3.5.4.  Monitoring of measures implemented and the assessment of their effectiveness\n\nAir Liquide customers are invited to report to the Group Customer Service any incidents related to the use of Air Liquide's products.\n\nIn the context of Healthcare activities, specific processes such as pharmacovigilance (for products with drug status) and materiovigilance  (for  products  with  Medical  Device  status)  are defined  to  ensure  the  reporting  of  incidents  concerning  these products from healthcare professionals or patients:\n\n- \u25a0 the  purpose  of  pharmacovigilance  is  to  monitor,  assess, prevent and manage the risk of adverse effects resulting from the use of drugs. The system set up within Air Liquide Sant\u00e9 International has global coverage and thus makes it possible to  constantly  monitor  and  assess  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of medical  gases.  As  pharmacovigilance  is  a  science  that  is highly  regulated  by  the  health  authorities,  Air  Liquide  Sant\u00e9 International  also  conducts  a  regulatory  watch.  This  activity aims  to  identify  and  analyze  the  applicable  texts  (laws,  best practices,  etc.)  in  order  to  ensure  these  operations  are conducted in compliance with the defined standards;\n- \u25a0 the purpose of materiovigilance is to avoid the (re)occurrence of  incidents  and  risks  of  serious  incidents  involving  medical devices,  by  taking  appropriate  preventive  and/or  corrective measures. Air Liquide has specialized teams in its subsidiaries to analyze and deal with any event or risk of incident occurring during the use of medical devices or reported by manufacturers or health authorities. These specialists assess the  risk  and  systematically  inform  the  supplier  and  health authorities when necessary, while remaining in contact with the various stakeholders until the closure of the alert.\n\n## 3.6.   RISKS RELATED TO THE SECURITY OF INDIVIDUALS\n\nThe  security  of  individuals  is  one  of  the  Group's  priorities.  It embodies the Group's fundamental principle of responsibility. The security  teams  have  a  duty  to  relay  this  principle.  This  is  an alignment  with  the  Group's  values  that  promote  the  overall integration  of  employees  and  external  stakeholders  such  as customers,  suppliers  and  subcontractors,  visitors,  as  well  as neighboring communities or Shareholders.\n\n## 3.6.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nIn  addition  to  endogenous risks, i.e. those generated by its own activity  (occupational  accidents,  industrial  accidents,  etc.),  the Group may also be faced with widespread exogenous risks (not generated by its own activity and which come from outside).\n\nThe  exposure  of  employees  and  the  external  stakeholders mentioned above to these threats may take the form of verbal or physical  assault,  theft,  or  even  minor  or  major  crises  (e.g.  the military conflict between  Russia  and  Ukraine,  the  indirect consequences of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict). Therefore, it is essential for Air Liquide to properly identify these risks and threats, to analyze and understand them and to put in place security systems that protect employees, whether they are at  their  usual  workplace  or  they  are  traveling  to  a  high-risk country.\n\nThe generic mapping of risks related to the security of individuals is based on three types:\n\n- \u25a0 political and security risk;\n- \u25a0 risk related to terrorism;\n- \u25a0 risk related to criminality.\n\n## 3.6.2.  Regular assessment procedures\n\nThe  Group  is  attentive  to  the  geopolitical  environment  of  the countries  in  which  it  operates.  This  is  an  important  criterion  in investment decisions. A good understanding of the environments in which the Group operates enables it to adopt a security posture in accordance with its requirements and its duty to protect.\n\nThe  Group  Security  Department  establishes  a  classification  of security  risks  for  the  countries  in  which  its  employees  work  and travel. It is based in particular on the official rating of five countries (France,  the  United  Kingdom,  Canada,  the  United  States  and Australia),  coupled  with  an  assessment  by  the  global  security service  provider  for  the  Group.  On  a  scale  of  four  risk  levels,  it enables  the  Group  to  determine  and  implement  the  appropriate level  of  security  measures  corresponding  to  the  level  of  threat identified. The occurrence of serious or repetitive events results in the  review  of  a  country's  risk  level.  The  country  manager  must approve the level of security risk determined for the country.\n\nIn 2023, for the countries in which Air Liquide is present, four are classified  as  very  high  risk  (Burkina  Faso,  Mali,  Nigeria  and Ukraine)  and  ten  are  high  risk.  The  others  are  split  between moderate and low risk.\n\nIn  parallel  with  this  classification,  Air  Liquide  sets  up  a  threat monitoring.  The  ability  to  collect,  sort  and  analyze  information makes  it  possible  to  understand  the  specific  environments  in which  employees  work  by  identifying  threats  and  anticipating possible incidents, crises or changes in the structural or economic environment of the countries in which the Group operates. Where necessary, Air Liquide updates the security and travel rules to limit the  exposure of  its  employees  and  adopts  conservative  security postures to protect those most exposed.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is important to detect, analyze and understand these in order to better protect employees and reduce the risk of occurrence.  In  2023,  the  Group  launched  a  systemic  review  of incidents  in  order  to  better  understand  the  type,  frequency  and level of impact on its operations.\n\nIn  all  its  subsidiaries,  the  Group  has  security  officers  who  are regularly  trained  to  adopt  the  appropriate  security  posture  and implement the security measures that protect employees.\n\n## 3.6.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\nBased  on  the  risk  assessment,  the  Group  Security  Department defines  and  coordinates  the  implementation  of  appropriate measures  to  limit  employee  exposure  to  potential  negative impacts during a crisis or incident. It has a range of measures that can be deployed, depending on the level of risk identified, in all subsidiaries  to  protect  employees  and  the  external  stakeholders listed above:\n\n- \u25a0 active  and  passive  security  systems  across  all  sites.  The fundamentals  of  our  site  protection  policy  include  secure fencing, a controlled access process, an adapted security and surveillance  system,  and  finally,  the  means  to  intervene  and respond in the event of an intrusion;\n- \u25a0 security  reviews  systematically  carried  out  by  the  Security Officers to ensure the proper level of protection of employees and sites;\n- \u25a0 crisis management and business continuity processes to deal with  crisis  environments  and  limit  the  impact  on  both employees and organizations;\n- \u25a0 an  analysis  of  the  most  serious  incidents  carried  out  by  the Group  Security  Department  in  collaboration  with  the  local entities  to  adapt  the  security  rules.  Surveillance  camera systems are set up to record the most critical points of a site and  the  recordings  are  viewed  after  the  event  in  order  to understand the origin of potential intrusions;\n- \u25a0 a series of measures intended to protect travelers, throughout their travel:\n- -security awareness training for employees traveling to the most  risky  countries  in  order  to  inform  them  of  potential threats and the measures to be applied,\n- -all travel reservations to very high-risk or high-risk country are  subject  to  a  validation  process  by  an  employee's manager, then by the Security Officer of the geography in question, who may even prohibit the trip,\n- -sending  of  alerts  to  travelers  to  make  them  aware  of  the most important incidents when they are away,\n- -a  dedicated  application  available  to  travelers  for  them  to inform  them  of  imminent  threats  and  thus  be  rescued  as quickly as possible;\n- \u25a0 e-learning  training  in  collaboration  with  Human  Resources  to familiarize  employees  with  new  environments.  Socio-cultural differences are important elements of integration that must be understood  and  assimilated  and  which  allow  for  better multicultural integration.\n\nIn very high-risk countries, these security measures  are strengthened.\n\nMore generally and as part of a responsible approach, the Group interacts  with  some  of  the  most  disadvantaged  surrounding communities  by  implementing  actions  to  benefit  them.  In  some townships, such as in Brazil or South Africa, local jobs are offered to  integrate  these  communities  and  reduce  the  risk  of  malicious acts, while promoting their integration.\n\nThe security function at Air Liquide is fundamentally part of a logic of goodwill through its positioning of anticipation, prevention and protection.  The  Group  Security  Department  acts  as  a  player aware of the duty of vigilance and respect for the Group's values in its day-to-day work.\n\n## 3.6.4.  Monitoring of measures implemented and the assessment of their effectiveness\n\nThe Group has an incident reporting system which, depending on the level of severity, triggers a review process for these incidents. In a singular way, this system makes it possible to understand the origin of malicious acts and to act locally on the security rules in place to protect employees and third parties.\n\nA  security  review  system  enables  assessment  of  the  level  of protection  of  a  subsidiary  in  terms  of  security  according  to  the level  of  threat  in  a  country  and  its  sensitivity  level.  This classification  makes  it  possible  to  assess  whether  the  security systems  are  properly  deployed  in  the  subsidiaries  in  order  to guarantee the appropriate level of protection for employees and subcontractors.\n\nThese systems are monitored by the Regional Security  Officers and the Group Security Director. They make it possible to adapt the security posture according to specific events or crises.",

Environment\n\nThe  Group  Sustainable  Development  Department,  under  the direct  supervision  of  a  member  of  the  Executive  Committee, defines the Group's strategy on environmental issues. It ensures the  rollout  of  the  latter  and  the  definition  and  monitoring  of  the associated key performance indicators. It is also responsible for internal  and  external  sustainable  development communication in order to highlight the Group's achievements, as well as regulatory communication for extra-financial information.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  Group's  global  Sustainable  Development approach,  employees  have  volunteered  to  implement  local initiatives  within  their  entities.  Known  as  the  'Sustainability Ambassadors', more than 600 members present in the Group's various  geographies  contribute  to  raising  employee  awareness, finding  solutions  to  protect  the  environment  and  sharing  best practices.\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY AMBASSADORS ACT FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\n\nThroughout  the  year  and  around  the  world,  initiatives  were organized by the voluntary network of Sustainability Ambassadors to promote  sustainable  development,  raise  awareness  and encourage action on these environmental issues. For example:\n\n- \u25a0 promoting  sustainable  development:  competition  for  the  best sustainable development initiatives in Latin America, calculation  of  the  carbon  footprint,  participation  in  workshops to reduce one's daily environmental footprint in Europe;\n- \u25a0 raising  awareness:  participation  in  external  and  internal conferences,  such  as  the  'Sustainability  Talk'  on  Taiwan island;\n- \u25a0 taking action: waste collection in France and Asia, tree planting activities in Canada, organization of a 'Sustainable Development Week' in several geographies and initiatives to recycle waste in Singapore.\n\n## 4.1.   RISKS RELATED TO CLIMATE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.1.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nAs a responsible company, Air Liquide recognizes the importance and urgency of addressing climate issues. The Group intends to contribute  to  carbon  neutrality  by  addressing  the  entire  value chain,  covering  direct  greenhouse  gas  emissions  (Scope  1), indirect  emissions  linked  to  the  supply  of  electricity  and  steam (Scope 2) as well as emissions of Scope 3, where other indirect emissions are reported.\n\nIn order to address climate change, Air Liquide takes into account the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), as expressed in assessment reports, of which the sixth  was  published  in  2021,  and  special  reports.  The  Group\n\nintends to play an active role in achieving the targets set out in the Paris  Agreement,  which  defines  a  global  framework  to  avoid dangerous  climate  change  by  limiting  global  warming  to  well below 2\u00b0C compared with pre-industrial levels, and by continuing efforts  to  limit  it  to  1.5\u00b0C.  The  IPCC  Special  Report  'Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C' published in 2018 indicates that achieving the Paris Agreement's objective of keeping the average temperature rise below 1.5\u00b0C requires reaching carbon neutrality, on a global scale, by 2050.\n\nThe greenhouse gas emissions associated with its activities and exceptional  weather-related  phenomena  due  to  climate  change can impact the environment and people.\n\n## Climate risks related to Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions\n\nThese risks can have the following consequences on people and the environment:\n\n- \u25a0 the  massive  development  of  renewable  energies  used  to reduce  GHG  emissions  may  have  an  impact  on  local communities;\n- \u25a0 due to their consequences on global warming, GHG emissions may have an impact on the environment, in particular on water resources or crop yields.\n\nThe transition towards a carbon-neutral economy encourages the Group to introduce new technologies and develop new markets. These changes, which mainly involve the creation of new jobs or the upgrading of existing ones, mean that employees' skills need to be upgraded in order to maintain their employability.\n\n## Climate risks related to the physical impact\n\nAir  Liquide  operates  in  certain  regions  of  the  world  exposed  to changes (in severity and/or frequency) in exceptional meteorological  phenomena  due  to  climate  change.  These phenomena can have a negative impact on people, which can be broken down into:\n\n- \u25a0 acute  risks  triggered  by  events  such  as  natural  disasters (storms,  hurricanes,  floods,  etc.),  whose  frequency  and severity are increasing, and which could endanger employees or neighboring  communities  when  sites  are  damaged, particularly those located near the coast or in areas that may be  affected  by  hurricanes  (the  Gulf  Coast,  North  America, South Asia, etc.);\n- \u25a0 chronic risks related to longer-term changes in climate models and rising temperatures that could lead to a deterioration in the working  conditions  of  employees  in  certain  geographies (chronic  heat  waves  in  certain  regions,  changes  in  rainfall patterns  and  increase  in  their  variability,  unavailability  of certain resources, etc.).\n\n## 4.1.2.  Regular assessment procedures\n\n## Climate risks related to Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions\n\nThe data relating to GHG emissions reported by the entities are consolidated  using  a  centralization  tool  at  Group  level  to determine Air Liquide's quarterly and annual carbon footprint.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Air Liquide follows this classification for the management of its carbon footprint.\n\nAir Liquide's GHG emissions balance sheet takes into account the 6 greenhouse gases highlighted by the Kyoto Protocol and is carried out in accordance with the GHG Protocol's carbon accounting method proposed by the World Resource Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.\n\n## SCOPE 1\n\nDirect emissions\n\ngenerated by all\n\nemission sources\n\nowned or controlled by Air Liquide.\n\nIndirect emissions related to the production of electricity or steam\n\nSCOPE 2\n\npurchased outside the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe data presented have been rounded up to the tenth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a) Reported emissions in millions of tonnes of CO2-equivalent using the 'market-based' methodology (see methodology for calculating scopes in paragraph 4.1.2 - page 113).

        "page_content": "## Scope 1\n\nAir  Liquide's  direct  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  result mainly from hydrogen production by methane reforming and cogeneration  of  steam  and  electricity.  These  activities  account  for nearly  15%  of  the  Group's  large  production  units  and  use combustion processes emitting CO2. Scope  1  emissions correspond  to  the  difference  in  carbon  content  between  the natural  gas  consumed by these units and the carbon content of their products. Air Liquide also records direct emissions from the combustion of fuel in its  truck  fleet,  as  well  as  gas  losses  in  its CO2 and nitrous oxide production units.\n\n## Scope 2\n\nAlmost  85%  of  Air  Liquide's  large  production  units  are  Air Separation Units, which use air as the sole raw material and do not  use  any  combustion  processes. Therefore,  they  do  not  emit greenhouse  gases  directly.  The  energy  needed  to  run  them, almost  exclusively  electricity,  generates  GHG  at  electricity suppliers'  level.  Scope  2  totals  the  indirect  GHG  emissions generated  by  the  production  of  electricity  and  steam  purchased outside the Group. Air Liquide adopts a 'market-based' reporting for its Scope 2, directly related to supply contracts, recommended by the GHG Protocol (1) . Hence, Air Liquide's initiatives in terms of electricity procurement, in particular the voluntary procurement of renewable electricity, are directly reflected in the reported Scope 2 emissions figures.\n\n## Scope 3\n\nThe Group reports other indirect GHG emissions under Scope 3 (categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11 and 13 of the GHG Protocol (2) ) which  concern  the  Gas  &  Services  businesses.  The  categories not  reported  represent  emissions  that  are  not  applicable  in Air Liquide's business model (8 and 14) or negligible (5, 9, 12 and 15).\n\n## Assessing employee competencies to maintain employability\n\nAs  part  of  the  development  by  Air  Liquide  of  key  solutions  for energy transition, two branches of activities are the most exposed to the emerging  need  for  employees  to  have  additional competencies  to  maintain  their  employability:  Engineering  & Construction  (E&C),  where  new  technologies  must  be  mastered (electrolysis, CO2 capture and liquefaction) and Large Industries, where these technologies will be deployed and operated.\n\nE&C  periodically  carries  out  an  assessment  of  technical competencies,  putting  into  perspective  the  business  skills  of employees  in  the  technical  fields  with  the  needs  identified  to support  E&C's  projected  activity.  The  World  Business  Unit  then determines action plans per area of expertise and per operation center to meet the development needs of key competencies.\n\nWithin Large  Industries, three professions  are  particularly exposed to a substantial change in their competences:\n\n- \u25a0 production and maintenance teams on sites, impacted by the digitalization and automation of industrial processes and by the setting up of Smart and Innovative Operations (SIO) centers in charge of remote control of production sites, which enable in particular energy consumption and purchasing to be optimized;\n- \u25a0 sales  teams  impacted  by  the  development  of  the  Group's offerings in particular of key solutions for energy transition;\n- \u25a0 teams  in  charge  of  energy  management  in  a  context  of increased purchases of renewable energy.\n\n## Climate risks related to the physical impact\n\nClimate risks related to the physical impact are assessed during the review of investment requests, in the same way as financial criteria, to ensure that the associated risk management measures are adapted, for example, in the design of equipment.\n\nThese risks  are  already  taken  into  account,  especially  in  (i)  the water  management  policy  (paragraph  4.2.3,  page  119),  which addresses, among other things, water-related risks for production units  for  which  this  risk  is  proven,  and  (ii)  Business  Continuity Plans  that  ensure  the  resilience  of  operations  in  the  event  of disruption, including extreme climatic events.\n\nIn  2021  and  2022,  Air  Liquide  experts  conducted  a  preliminary assessment based on the scientific literature. In 2023, the Group conducted  a  study  with  a  consulting  firm  to  assess  the vulnerability  of  the  Group's  activities  to  climate  risks  related  to physical impact. More specifically, this study made it possible to:\n\n- \u25a0 select two  climate  scenarios  developed  by  the  IPCC: SSP2-4.5, used as 'business as usual' leading to +2.7\u00b0C by 2100,  and  the  SSP5-8.5  scenario,  used  as  the  'worst  case scenario' leading to +4.4\u00b0C by 2100. The time horizon of 2040 was used because it corresponds to the lifetime of the majority of assets invested and operated by Air Liquide;\n- \u25a0 define  the  universe  of  climate  risks  related  to  the  physical impact.  To  this  end,  a  series  of  interviews  with  Air  Liquide's Industrial  Departments  was  carried  out  to  identify  the  most significant risks in the short, medium and long term;\n- \u25a0 analyze  the  exposure  of  the  Group's  sites  according  to  their location  on  the  basis  of  the  two  scenarios  and  thus  identify those likely to be exposed to the risks identified by 2040;\n- \u25a0 analyze the vulnerability  of  exposed  sites  by  determining  the main operational impacts for each of these sites.\n\nBased  on  this  study,  the  main  perils  identified  as  relevant  at Group  level  include  high  temperatures,  drought  and  fires. Mitigation plans will be drawn up, if necessary, at vulnerable sites. In  2024,  this  study  will  serve  as  the  basis  to  deploy  the corresponding risk management process.\n\n## 4.1.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\n## Climate policy and procedures\n\nThe  Climate  Policy,  available  in  the  BlueBook,  consolidates  the principles  governing  the  Group's  climate  risk  management, covering the entire value chain.\n\nThe monitoring and achievement of the Group's climate objectives rely on:\n\n- \u25a0 the  internal  greenhouse  gas  emission  monitoring  procedure, which sets out the monitoring of regulatory obligations in force in this area  with  which  the  Group  must  comply,  the standardized  methodologies  for  calculating  Scopes  1  and  2 emissions, as well as the reporting scope and frequency;\n\n<!-- image -->",

Each  month,  it  brings together the member of the Executive Committee overseeing the  Large  Industries  World  Business  Line  and  the  Group's Strategy  function,  the  Large  Industries  Vice  President,  the Large Industries Director of Markets and Energy Transition, the Director of Energy, the Group Finance and Treasury Director, the  Director  of  Accounting  Organization  and  Methods,  the Director  of  Sustainable  Development,  the  Director  of  Group Investments and the Director of Energy Transition Strategy for the Hydrogen Energy World Business Line.\n- \u25a0 the review of investment decisions, taking into account climate aspects, in particular a CO2 price, as well as an analysis of the opportunities and risks related to the climate transition. For all its  projects,  for  all  geographies,  even  those  without  a  current official  price  for  CO2, Air  Liquide  also  integrates  a  CO2  price sensitivity  study  into  its  investment  decision  process.  The Group's  investment  policy,  as  described  in  the  BlueBook, requires that this sensitivity study be carried out using a price of 50 euros per metric tonne of CO2, the current local price, as well  as  a  high  value  of  at  least  100  euros  per  metric  tonne depending on the geography and the context;\n- \u25a0 the rollout of the Climate Champions network and the annual review  of  the  clusters'  (groups  of  countries)  decarbonization plans. The  Climate  Champions,  contact  points  of  the Sustainable  Development  Department,  are  responsible  for managing the Group's CO2 emissions reduction objectives in the various clusters (groups of countries). They coordinate the development  of  a  roadmap  that  defines  all  the  operational measures required to achieve the objectives below. They are responsible for monitoring the indicators, the rollout of projects and  reporting  on  progress.  Decarbonization  plans  define  the projects to be implemented to contribute to the Group's climate objectives, such as the purchase of renewable energy, carbon capture at hydrogen production units using methane reforming, and energy efficiency or vehicle fleet conversion programs;\n- \u25a0 the  assumption  of  the  implementation,  in  the  geographies  in which the Group operates, of public policies aimed at stepping up the transition toward a low-carbon economy that are in line with a 'well below 2\u00b0C' trajectory.\n\nThe  potential  impact  on  local  communities  due  to  the  massive development of renewable energies (paragraph 4.1.1, page 111) is reviewed on a case by case and ad hoc bases, depending on sources and contractual structures of renewable energy sourcing. As Air  Liquide  scales  up  its  sourcing  of  renewable  energy,  the process  will  be  further  embedded  in  the  relevant  sourcing guidelines, in particular when sourcing from new built assets.\n\n## Group's Climate Objectives\n\nWith  its  Sustainable  Development  program  and  its  ADVANCE strategic  plan  for  the  2022-2025  period,  Air  Liquide  affirms  its ambition to decarbonize the planet. This approach integrates the Group's activities through three complementary axes:\n\n- \u25a0 taking  action  on  assets  by  committing  to  reduce  the  carbon impact of production, distribution and service activities;\n- \u25a0 taking  action  with  customers  by  innovating  for  a  cleaner industry;\n- \u25a0 taking action for ecosystems by contributing to the emergence of a low-carbon society.\n\nASSETS: REDUCING THE CARBON IMPACT OF ITS PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE ACTIVITIES\n\n## CLIMATE OBJECTIVES: SCOPES 1 AND 2 EMISSIONS\n\nIn  line  with  the  Paris Agreement, and to address the urgency of taking  climate  change  and  the  energy  transition  into  account, Air Liquide sets itself the ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 , with two major intermediate milestones:\n\n- \u25a0 the start of the reduction of absolute CO2 emissions (3) around 2025;\n- \u25a0 a  -33%  reduction  in  its  Scopes  1  and  2  CO2  emissions  by 2035, compared to the 2020 baseline (4) .\n\nThe Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) validated Air Liquide's target to reduce its Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 2035 in May 2022 as compliant with a well below 2\u00b0C trajectory (5) . The Group was the first in its industry to obtain validation from the SBTi.\n\nTo  date,  there  is  no  1.5\u00b0C  sector  trajectory  for  the  chemicals sector in general or for industrial gases in particular. Nevertheless, Air  Liquide  has  developed  its  climate  objectives  on  the  basis  of various  studies,  including  those  of  the  IPCC,  in  particular  the 1.5\u00b0C  report  and  those  of  the  International  Energy  Agency, including  the  Net  Zero  roadmap,  published  in  May  2021,  which presents levers and a trajectory for the industrial sector similar to that of the Group strategy.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Group  also  maintains  its  existing  objective, announced in 2018, to reduce its carbon intensity (6) by -30% by 2025, on the basis of 2015 emissions.\n\nThe  three  levers  identified  by  the  Group  in  order  to  reduce  the carbon  footprint  of  its  assets  are  based  on  Air  Liquide's technological  and  operational  expertise.  They  also  rely  on  the implementation  of  public  policies  and  regulatory  frameworks allowing,  in  particular,  the  rapid  and  massive  development  of decarbonized energies, which determine the speed at which these levers can be mobilized.",

        "page_content": "## RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENT\n\n## Lever 1: sourcing low-carbon energy.\n\nAir  Liquide's  ambition  to  achieving  carbon  neutrality  associated with its assets is usually supported by the sourcing of low-carbon electricity to power the Air Separation Units. Hydrogen production units  using  methane  reforming  can  be  adapted  to  operate  on renewable natural gas.\n\nTo  reduce  its  indirect  emissions  related  to  energy  purchases (Scope 2 emissions), Air Liquide adopts a proactive approach to purchase  renewable  and  low-carbon  electricity  using  several approaches  depending  on  local  conditions  allowing  access  to renewable  energy. The  main  one  is  the  conclusion  of  long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPA).\n\nHowever,  the  Group  may  purchase  certificates  such  as Guarantees of Origin that may or may not be bundled with power delivery  especially  when  integration  of  a  PPA  into  the  sourcing portfolio  is  uneasy  or,  in  areas  supplied  by  regulated  utilities, through 'green tariffs'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2023 ILLUSTRATIONS\n\nIn 2023, Air Liquide notably signed the following contracts:\n\n- \u25a0 two new Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) with TotalEnergies and its partner Mulilo for the long-term supply of a  total  capacity  of  260  MW  of  renewable  power  to  Sasol's Secunda site, in South Africa. This is the second set of PPAs signed  by Air  Liquide  and  Sasol,  after  the  PPAs  announced with Enel Green Power;\n- \u25a0 a new PPA with Vattenfall in Benelux for 115 MW of renewable installed  power  capacity.  Contracted  over  a  15-year  period beginning in 2026, the PPA will bring overall renewable power capacity  available  to  Air  Liquide  to  around  270  MW.  This capacity  will  provide  energy  representing  more  than  70%  of the Group's existing electricity consumption in Benelux. In all, the PPAs signed in the region will enable Air Liquide to reduce emissions  related  to  power  production  of  up  to  8.5  million tonnes  of  CO2  over  the  duration  of  the  contracts,  which  is comparable  to  the  emissions  generated  by  over  350,000 Dutch households.\n\n## Lever 2: improving the efficiency of assets.\n\nAir Liquide constantly improves the design of its production units and modernizes them thanks to the innovation efforts of Research & Development and Engineering & Construction teams, in order to improve  their energy  efficiency and  reduce  their  energy consumption.  The  Group  continues  to  roll  out  the  Smart  and Innovative  Operations  (SIO)  program  which  optimizes  energy consumption  and  procurement  through  centralized  operation centers.\n\nAir Liquide uses a large fleet of trucks for the supply of industrial gases  to  its  customers.  These  vehicles  contribute,  to  a  lesser extent,  to  the  Group's  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Air  Liquide therefore  takes  targeted  actions  to  reduce  logistics-related emissions  by  leveraging  digital  resources  to  optimize  deliveries, and by progressively converting its fleet to alternate fuels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2023 ILLUSTRATION\n\nAir Liquide will invest around 60 million euros to revamp two Air Separation  Units  (ASUs)  the  Group  operates  in  the  Tianjin industrial  basin,  in  China.  As  part  of  this  modernization  plan, Air  Liquide  will  adapt  these ASUs  so  they  can  run  on  electrical power  instead  of  steam.  This  project  will  avoid  the  emission  of 370,000  tonnes  of  CO2  per  year.  This  is  comparable  to  the equivalent  electricity-related  emissions  of  more  than  one  million Chinese households.\n\n## Lever 3: rolling-out innovative technologies.\n\nAir  Liquide  has  developed a portfolio of proprietary technologies such as Cryocap\u2122, which allow CO2 to be captured and reused or stored on hydrogen production units using methane reforming units for the production of hydrogen. Capture for CO2 valorization and  storage  is  thus  set  to  play  a  major  role  in  reducing  direct emissions from hydrogen production.\n\nAir Liquide is committed to producing low-carbon hydrogen on an industrial  scale  and  in  a  sustainable  manner. The  electrolysis  of water  is  one  of  the  key  solutions  to  produce  hydrogen  with  a minimal carbon footprint, when powered by low-carbon electricity. The  rollout  of  electrolyzer  units  therefore  plays  a  critical  role  to enable the production of low-carbon hydrogen on a large scale for industry and mobility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2023 LLUSTRATIONS\n\nAir Liquide will invest over 400 million euros for the construction of its Normand'Hy electrolyzer, with a capacity of 200 MW, located in Port-J\u00e9r\u00f4me  in  Normandy.  As  part  of  a  Memorandum  of Understanding with TotalEnergies, this electrolyzer will deliver to the  refinery  in  Gonfreville,  from  the  second  half  of  2026, renewable and low-carbon hydrogen equivalent to an electrolysis capacity  of  100  MW.  TotalEnergies  will  generate  renewable electricity to power the electrolyzer, volume corresponding to the hydrogen delivered. The remaining 100 MW will be dedicated to customers  in  the  Normandy  industrial  basin,  as  well  as  for  the development of low-carbon mobility. Air Liquide Normand'Hy will avoid up to 250,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year.\n\nAir Liquide has announced the construction of an industrial scale ammonia  (NH3)  cracking  pilot  plant  in  the  port  of  Antwerp, Belgium.  Thus,  Air  Liquide  will  further contribute to the development  of  hydrogen,  since  ammonia  -  a  molecule composed by hydrogen and nitrogen - can be transported over long  distances  before  being  locally  reconverted  into  hydrogen. The  innovative  pilot  plan,  which  combines  a  novel  efficient process with Air Liquide's proprietary technologies, is planned to be operational in 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Drawing  on  its  technological  expertise  and  its  capacity  for innovation, the Group offers them cleaner and more sustainable solutions to reduce their CO2 emissions.\n\n## SCOPE 3 COMMITMENT\n\nAware  of  the  importance  of  contributing  to  the  achievement  of carbon neutrality throughout its value chain, in 2022, Air Liquide worked  on  developing  its  Scope  3  greenhouse  gas  emissions reduction  strategy.  The  importance  of  the  relationship  with  its customers  has  led  the  Group  to  pledge  to  have  75%  of  its  50 largest customers committed to carbon neutrality by 2050 in 2025 and 100% in 2035.\n\nTo achieve this ambition, three levers have been identified.\n\n## Lever 1: reducing Air Liquide products' carbon footprint.\n\nAir Liquide relies on its expertise to offer its customers innovative solutions  to  support  them  by  outsourcing  their  needs  to  pool production  assets  and  thus  aim  for  greater  energy  efficiency. Air Liquide proposes to install units directly on its customers' sites in order to save on transportation or to provide a new generation of  lighter  cylinders,  and  thus  reduce  transport-related  CO2 emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2023 ILLUSTRATION\n\nOne of the leading companies for Autothermal Reforming (ATR), Air  Liquide's  technology  has  been  selected  for  Japan's  first demonstration  project  integrating  the  production  of  low-carbon hydrogen  and  ammonia  with  carbon  capture.  It  will  be  owned and operated by INPEX CORPORATION, a Japanese oil & gas exploration  and  production  company.  ATR  is  one  of  the  latest technologies utilized enabling the production of large-scale lowcarbon  hydrogen.  When ATR  is  combined  with  carbon  capture technology, customers can achieve higher energy efficiency and a  simplified  single  train  production  process  to  facilitate  carbon capture of up to 99%.\n\n## Lever 2: co-developing innovative processes with customers.\n\nAir  Liquide  supports  its  customers  in  the  fundamental  and essential transformation of their industrial processes, in particular in industrial sectors such as metallurgy and chemicals. The Group provides  technical  innovations  to  reduce  the  CO2  emissions associated with the conventional processes used in these sectors by employing new production processes, such as oxy-combustion for  cement  coupled  with  CO2  capture,  direct  reduced  iron  (DRI unit)  combined with submerged arc furnace for steel production, or new uses of materials such as hydrogen.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2023 ILLUSTRATION\n\nAir Liquide will build and operate for Verallia, the European leader and  the  world's  third  largest  producer  of  glass  packaging  for beverages  and  food  products,  a  new  generation  onsite  oxygen production unit in Pescia, Italy. The oxygen produced by this unit will  replace  the  air  usually  injected  into  the  furnace,  thereby allowing to melt the glass by oxy-combustion and to improve the efficiency  of  the  process.  In  addition,  the  Group  will  supply  its HeatOx\u2122 proprietary technology to recover the heat emitted by the glass furnace in order to further reduce the amount of energy needed  to  produce  glass.  The  global  solution  provided  by Air  Liquide  will  contribute  to  the  reduction  by  -18%  of  the  CO2 emissions  (Scope  1  and  2)  that  Verallia  targets  for  its  glass furnace in Pescia.\n\n## Lever 3: developing innovative carbon capture technologies.\n\nAir  Liquide's  presence  in  major  industrial  basins,  combined  with its  expertise  in  carbon  capture  and  liquefaction  technologies allows the Group to contribute to major global initiatives aimed at aggregating  large  streams  of  CO2  in  order  to  capture  them  for valorization or storage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2023 ILLUSTRATION\n\nAir Liquide  and  Holcim  have  signed  a  Memorandum  of Understanding to pursue a project to  decarbonize  Holcim's  new cement  production plant under development in Belgium. Air Liquide intends to build and operate a unit of its innovative and proprietary Cryocap\u2122 Oxy technology to capture and purify up to 95%  of  the  CO2  generated  from  Holcim's  production  unit  in Obourg. Thanks to Air Liquide's unique carbon capture innovative technology, Holcim will be able to reduce emissions by more than one million tons per year of CO2. The captured CO2 will then be handled  through Antwerp@C  CO2  Export  Hub where  it  will  be transported,  liquefied  and  loaded  onto  CO2  ships  for  onward permanent and safe offshore storage.\n\n## ECOSYSTEMS: CONTRIBUTING TO THE EMERGENCE OF A LOW-CARBON SOCIETY\n\nAir  Liquide  contributes  to  the  development  of  a  low-carbon society. To  this end,  the  Group  develops  hydrogen  and biomethane  for  industrial  and  mobility  applications.  These developments are expected to play a key role in the fight against climate change. The Group has therefore identified three levers.\n\n## Lever 1: promoting hydrogen (H2) for energy transition.\n\nHydrogen  is  an  essential  solution  for  the  energy  transition.  A competitive  and  low-carbon  solution,  it  represents  tremendous development potential thanks to its many applications in industry, energy and mobility. Deeply convinced that hydrogen will play a major role in the energy transition, the Group intends to be a key player  in  the  emergence  of  a  hydrogen  society  thanks  to  its assets,  its  technologies  and  its  expertise.  Air  Liquide  is  in particular one of the founding members of the Hydrogen Council, a  unique  global  initiative  that  brings  together  nearly  150 companies  in  2023  and  aims  to  define  a  common  ambition  for hydrogen  as  an  accelerator  for  the  energy  transition.  Around 8  billion  euros  will  be  invested  by  the  Group  in  the  low-carbon hydrogen value chain by 2035. Hydrogen sales are expected to triple to 6 billion euros by 2035.",

Air  Liquide  will  bring  its  expertise  along  the entire hydrogen value chain and apply its expertise in production, liquefaction,  distribution,  storage  and  end-use  technologies  to meet the specific needs of each region.\n\n## Lever 2: contributing to the development of clean mobility.\n\nAir Liquide is investing in the production of low-carbon hydrogen from  the  electrolysis  of  water,  as  well  as  in  hydrogen  mobility distribution networks. The  Group  is  also  developing  the biomethane chain from production to filling stations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2023 ILLUSTRATIONS\n\nAir  Liquide  and  Groupe  ADP  have  announced  the  creation  of Hydrogen Airport, the first engineering and consulting joint venture specializing in helping airports integrate hydrogen projects within their infrastructures. The range of services provided covers all the challenges  of  integrating  hydrogen  energy.  In  the  framework  of this  joint  venture,  Air  Liquide  brings  its  expertise  in  hydrogen, which  ranges  from  the  production  of  renewable  or  low-carbon hydrogen,  to  liquefaction,  storage,  and  the  distribution  of hydrogen for aircraft.\n\nAir  Liquide  and  TotalEnergies  have  announced  their  decision  to create  an  equally  owned  joint  venture  to  develop  a  network  of hydrogen stations, geared towards heavy duty vehicles on major European road corridors. This initiative will help facilitate access to  hydrogen,  enabling  the  development  of  its  use  for  goods transportation and further strengthening the hydrogen sector. The partners aim to deploy more than 100 hydrogen stations on major European  roads  -  in  France,  Benelux  and  Germany  -  in  the coming  years.  Air  Liquide  will  contribute  with  its  expertise  in technologies and its mastery of the entire hydrogen value chain.\n\n## Lever 3: contributing to the circular economy through the development and diversification of biomethane.\n\nAir Liquide  is  a  committed  stakeholder  across  the  entire biomethane value chain for sustainable transportation and for the development  of  the  circular  economy,  from  biogas  supply  and\n\npurification  for  the  production  of  biomethane  (which  can  be directly  injected  into  the  gas  network)  to  distribution  to  the  final customers.  In  2023,  Air  Liquide  has  26  biomethane  production units worldwide.\n\n## Employee skills and training\n\nAir  Liquide  has  created  various  training  modules  open  to  all employees  on  the  themes  of  climate  change,  energy  transition and  on  the  Group's  Sustainable  Development  program  and decarbonization strategy. Specific training courses were introduced  for  operational  teams  to  inform  employees  of  the operational  rollout  of  the  Group's  Sustainable  Development program.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AIR LIQUIDE CONTINUES THE TRAINING PROGRAM ON CLIMATE AND ENERGY TRANSITION\n\nIn 2023, Air Liquide University continued to organize the 'Climate &  Energy  Transition'  online  training.  The  objective  of  these sessions  is  to  share  the  Group's  vision  and  provide  knowledge and  behaviors  that  will  ensure  resilience  and  safeguard  growth opportunities associated with climate and energy transition. Topics addressed  cover  climate,  customers  and  technology.  The sessions are open to all employees and remain available after the event. In 2023, 40 sessions were organized on 17 different topics related  to  climate  and  energy  transition,  with  a  total  of  4,000 connections and around 1,900 participants.\n\nThe  shift  towards  a  sustainable  and  carbon  neutral  economy implies  a  transformation  of  skills,  in  particular  marginally  in  the Engineering  &  Construction  (E&C)  branch  and  in  the  Large Industries  (LI)  one  (paragraph  4.1.2.,  page  113).  In  the  Group, cross-functional  mobility  remains  the  preferred  way  to  develop rich career paths and strengthen the skillfulness and employability of teams. Hence, following an assessment of E&C technical skills, an Electrolysis product line integrating the entire value chain, from solution definition to project execution, was created in 2021 and integrated  employees  from  other  organizations  within  E&C.  In Large Industries, the support of the most exposed professions is mainly based on offering trainings tailored to their needs and the implementation of individuals development plans. For example, a training  curriculum  is  offered  to  facilitate  the  digitalization  of industrial  processes  and  'Energy  Managers'  had  access  to  a training on six key skills areas.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Description of salient risks\n\nAir  Liquide  respects  the  human  right  to  water  and  sanitation. Water  management  in  its  activities  can  have  two  main  types  of impact on people, related to the withdrawal and consumption of water  on  the  sites  where  the  Group  operates  or  related  to  the quality of water returned to ecosystems after usage.\n\n## Risks related to the withdrawal and use of water\n\nImpacts associated with water withdrawal may vary depending on the  location.  Areas  where  it  is  difficult  to  meet  human  and environmental needs for water due to poor availability, quality or accessibility  are  called  water  stress  areas.  In  these  areas, conflicts for water between different usages and users may arise.\n\n## Risks related to the quality of water returned to ecosystems\n\nThe quality and specifications of the water returned to ecosystems are important in assessing the impact of the Group's operations, either  because  of  the  presence  of  pollutants,  contaminants content  or  the  temperature,  which  can  induce  direct  or  indirect pollution and damages to ecosystems.\n\n## 4.2.2. Regular assessment procedures\n\n## Risks related to the withdrawal and use of water\n\nWater  consumption  is  measured  by  subtracting  water  discharge from water withdrawal by the Group in the course of its business. The difference is due to:\n\n- \u25a0 the loss of water through evaporation in the cooling process of rotating machines, particularly for the production of air gases; and\n- \u25a0 its use as a raw material for the manufacture of products such as hydrogen.\n\nWith regard to Air Separation Units (ASU), there are several types of cooling systems:\n\n- \u25a0 61% of these units have semi-open water circuits, where some of the water evaporates during cooling;\n- \u25a0 32% of these units have open circuits. Water runs through the plant for cooling purposes and all water withdrawn is returned. Both  types  of  units  require  continuous  water  top-ups  for cooling;\n- \u25a0 finally,  the  other  units  have  closed  systems,  which  do  not withdraw water from their surrounding environment. The latter no longer consume water after the initial filling.\n\nAir Liquide assesses the risks related to the water consumption of its sites by taking into account their specific data according to their location  in  relation  to  a  hydrological  basin,  groundwater  or  an administrative border. The Group also refers to the 'Aqueduct 3.0 Water  Risk  Atlas',  a  map  produced  by  the  World  Resources Institute  (WRI) (10) and  the  'business  as  usual'  climate  scenario (IPCC SSP2- 4.5). Each site is thus identified as belonging to an area of water stress or not (area defined according to the intensity of water conflict). This mapping also includes new units.\n\nIn  2022,  the  results  of  this  assessment  have  shown  that  there were 76 (11) water-intensive sites (facilities  with  water  withdrawal greater than 50,000 m 3 per  year)  located  in  areas  of  high  water stress.\n\n## Risks related to the quality of water returned to ecosystems\n\nMeasurements  and  analyses  of  discharged  water,  to  assess  its quality,  are  carried  out  at  a  frequency  consistent  with  and according to the requirements laid down in local regulations.\n\n## 4.2.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent serious impacts\n\n## Water management policy\n\nThe  water  management  policy,  available  in  the  BlueBook, identifies the impacts of Air Liquide's activities on water availability and quality and defines the principles of risk management based on  a  precise  assessment  of  the  situation  of  the  sites.  Finally,  it describes  the  actions  required  to  ensure  appropriate  water management.  Air  Liquide's  commitment  to  responsible  water management and the summary of its policy are available  on  its website since 2023 (https://www.airliquide.com/sites/ airliquide.com/files/2023-07/air-liquide-water-stewardship.pdf).",

The standardization  of  the  industrial  wastewater  discharge  quality monitoring  is  thus  reinforced  across  all  of  the  Group's activities.  No  body  of  water  or  associated  habitat  were significantly  affected  by  water  discharge  or  water  runoff  from the Group's units in 2023.\n\n## Water treatment solutions\n\nAir  Liquide  provides  its  customers  with  efficient  and  easy-toimplement  solutions  for  water  treatment  to  face  environmental challenges especially in the fight against water stress and scarcity.\n\nAir Liquide's 'Essential Small Molecules' (mainly O2, O3 and CO2) play  a  fundamental  role  in  drinking  water  and  wastewater treatment  processes.  These  gases  are  key  to  balance  mineral levels  in  desalination  of  water  plants  or  to  eliminate  pollutants from  surface  drinking  water.  For  industrial  players  seeking technologies  to  treat  and  recycle  water,  these  molecules  help boost  the  removal  of  organic  pollution  from  wastewater  and  to avoid corrosion or clogging in cooling systems.\n\n## 4.2.4.  Monitoring of measures implemented and the assessment of their effectiveness\n\n|                                                              |   2021 |   2022 |   2023 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Annual water withdrawal  (estimate  in millions of m 3 ) (a) |    950 |    973 |    944 |\n| Annual water consumption  (estimate in millions of m 3 ) (b) |     82 |     91 |     89 |\n\nIn 2023, Air Liquide withdrew 944 million m 3 of water from various sources.  88%  was  provided  by  customers,  4%  came  from freshwater  sources  such  as  rivers  or  lakes,  2%  from  municipal sources and the remaining 6% from various different sources. En 2023, the Group returned 855 million m 3 of this water. Air Liquide thus consumed 89 million m 3 , a -2% decrease compared to 2022, mostly related to the rollout of good water management practices.\n\nIn  2023,  more  than  87%  of  the  water  discharged  from  the Air  Liquide  facilities  has  been  reused  by  third  parties  (typically customers) for their own usage, after treatment if necessary. This usage  allowed  third  parties  not  to  withdraw  the  corresponding amount of water from the natural environment.\n\n## 5.   Suppliers and subcontractors\n\nAir Liquide has more  than  80,000  tier-1 suppliers and subcontractors  (hereinafter  'suppliers').  The  Group's  largest procurement  categories  are  energy,  technical  services,  gas products, and hardgoods and safety equipment\n\nTwo  levels  of  the  organization  are  involved  in  procurement activities for Air Liquide. The Group Procurement Department and the corresponding functions in the hubs and World Business Units are  responsible  for  the  main  procurement  categories,  with  the exception  of  energy  purchases.  The  latter  are  managed  by departments specialized in energy management. The Procurement  Department  defines  the  Sustainable  Procurement strategy  and  procedure,  revised  in  2023.  The  Sustainable Procurement function coordinates its rollout through the network of  Sustainable  Procurement  correspondents  in  each  hub  and World Business Unit.\n\n## 5.1.   RISK MAPPING\n\n## 5.1.1.  Methodology\n\nThe duty  of  vigilance  risk  mapping  methodology  for  suppliers  is based on identifying the suppliers most exposed to sustainability risks  (Sustainability-Critical  Suppliers).  In  2023,  Air  Liquide changed its methodology, retaining only three criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 annual spend;\n- \u25a0 the risk relating to the nature of the supplier's activity; and\n\nFrom 2023, the dependency of suppliers on Air Liquide has been removed  from  the  methodology  for  identifying  SustainabilityCritical  Suppliers.  This  criterion  constitutes  a  risk  individually taken  into  account  in  the  analysis  of  supplier  risks  during  their qualification  and  throughout  the  commercial  relationship,  in accordance  with  the  internal  supplier  relationship  and  risk management procedure.\n\nThe amount of annual spend is used to prioritize the suppliers and systematically include in the identification of Sustainability-Critical Suppliers those on whom the Group spends more than 200,000 euros per year.\n\nThe nature of a supplier's activity depends on its allocation to one of  17  procurement  categories,  which  are  subdivided  into  more than  400  procurement  sub-categories.  For  a  more  precise methodology,  each  procurement  sub-category  is  allocated  a global  sustainability  risk  level,  which  includes  in  particular  the environment,  human  rights  and  working  conditions,  on  a  threelevel scale (severe, high, low).\n\nThe risk relating to the supplier's country of operation is assessed based  on  a  weighting  of  recognized  public  indicators  on  the environment  (e.g.  Environmental  Performance  Index,  EPI),  the health and social situation (e.g. Human Development Index, HDI) and human rights (e.g. Global Slavery Index, ITUC Global Rights Index), on a three-level scale (severe, high, low).\n\n- \u25a0 the risk relating to the supplier's country of operation.",

Results in 2023\n\nThe  mapping  of  supplier-related  risks  is  updated  on  an  annual basis  by  a  working  group  composed  of  the  Sustainable Procurement  Department  at  Group  level  and  buyers  who  are specialized by category.\n\nIn 2023, based on the methodology described above, 1,076 suppliers were identified as Sustainability-Critical Suppliers. These  suppliers  represented  2.6  billion  euros  in  expenses  in 2023.\n\nThe  three  Procurement  categories  most  exposed  in  terms  of number  of  suppliers  concerned  are  transportation  services,  gas products,  and  energy. The 1,076  Sustainability-Critical  Suppliers are spread across all the geographies where the Group operates, as indicated in the table below.\n\n|                        | Sustainability-Critical Suppliers   | Sustainability-Critical Suppliers   |                              |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Geographies            | Number                              | %                                   | Spend (in millions of euros) |\n| Asia Pacific           | 599                                 | 56%                                 | 1,024.5                      |\n| Europe                 | 171                                 | 16%                                 | 853.2                        |\n| Middle East and Africa | 142                                 | 13%                                 | 329.9                        |\n| Americas               | 164                                 | 15%                                 | 403.4                        |\n| TOTAL                  | 1,076                               | 100%                                | 2,611.0                      |\n\n## 5.2.   REGULAR ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES\n\n## 5.2.1.  Supplier qualification\n\nIn  addition  to  the  Sustainable  Procurement  procedure,  the supplier  relationship  and  risk  management  procedure,  which applies  to  all  Group  entities,  aims  to  maximize  the  value  and minimize the risks of interactions with suppliers, while optimizing the  use  of  the  Group's  resources.  It  defines  the  supplier qualification  process,  which  ensures  that  the  supplier  is  able  to meet Air Liquide's requirements.\n\nIn terms of compliance with applicable laws and regulations and integrity  (fight  against  fraud  and  corruption,  respect  for  human rights  and  international  sanctions,  etc.),  this  procedure  requires that  a  new  supplier  be  subject  to  preliminary  checks  before  its qualification. These checks are based on the use of Dow Jones databases  including  in  particular  international  sanction  lists  and any  existing  adverse  media  articles  on  a  supplier.  In  2021,  Air Liquide  specified  its  method  for  analyzing  the  results  of  these checks  in  order  to  make  a  decision  on  the  qualification  of  a supplier. In 2023, almost 100% of the new suppliers created in the information system were subject to these preliminary checks.\n\n## 5.2.2.  Assessment methodology\n\nThe Sustainable Procurement procedure determines the assessment method for Sustainability-Critical Suppliers, which is mainly based on two types of questionnaire:\n\n- \u25a0 from  an external  platform (EcoVadis)  specialized  in  the assessment of CSR  (Corporate Social Responsibility) performance which deploys an online questionnaire based on the  ISO  26000  standard  to  assess  the  CSR  commitment  of suppliers.  The  questionnaire  assesses  suppliers  about  four main  themes:  the  environment,  human  rights  and  working\n\nconditions, ethics and the sustainable procurement procedures implemented  by  suppliers.  Suppliers  are  assessed  on  the following sustainability criteria:\n\n- -environment:  energy  consumption  and  greenhouse  gas emissions,  water,  biodiversity,  air  pollution,  raw  materials, chemicals and  waste,  product use and  end-of-life, consumer health and safety, promotion and environmental services,\n- -human rights and working conditions: employee health and safety, working conditions, labor relations, career management  and  training,  child  labor,  forced  labor  and human trafficking,  diversity,  equality  and  inclusion,  human rights at external stakeholders,\n- -ethics:  corruption,  anti-competitive  practices,  responsible information management,\n- -sustainable procurement: environmental and social practices of suppliers;\n- \u25a0 from Air Liquide, which has created an internal questionnaire, as  an  alternative  to  the  solution  offered  by  the  external platform.  This  questionnaire  is  sent  to  Sustainability-Critical Suppliers selected for the assessment campaign who refused to  reply  to  the  questionnaire  sent  by  the  external  platform.  It includes  10  questions  on  the  four  themes  used  by  the EcoVadis platform.\n\n## 5.2.3.  Assessment results\n\nAnswers provided in the questionnaires and supporting documentation  produced  by  the  suppliers  are  assessed  by  the experts  from  the  EcoVadis  external  platform  or  by  Air  Liquide buyers, on a scale of 100 points. The score obtained reflects the supplier's CSR performance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Procedures\n\nIn order to mitigate risks or prevent severe impacts relating to the duty  of  vigilance,  Air  Liquide  rolls  out  all  elements  of  the Sustainable  Procurement  procedure,  including  in  particular  the following prevention measures:\n\n- \u25a0 application  of  the Procurement Code of Conduct ,  which  is available  in  11  languages,  is  expected  from  all  Group employees engaged in Procurement activities;\n- \u25a0 the Supplier's  Code  of  Conduct ,  updated  in  2023,  aims  to promote and ensure that all suppliers respect notably human rights, ethics, environmental protection and safety. It is based\n\non the Group's Code of Conduct. The adherence of suppliers to the principles inscribed in the Supplier's Code of Conduct is a  prerequisite  to  all  commercial  relation  for  the  supply  of Air Liquide.  The  revision  aims  to  align  it  with  new  regulatory expectations and changes in practices. In particular, it includes additional articles on conflict minerals and the whistleblowing system. This Code of Conduct is available on the Air Liquide website  (https://www.airliquide.com/sustainable-development/ sustainable-procurement). Translations are done according to local needs and made available gradually;\n\n- \u25a0 a sustainability  contractual  clause (covering  compliance with  the  Supplier's  Code  of  Conduct,  safety,  and  the environment)  is  included  in  the  contract  templates  with suppliers, including those for framework agreements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 5.3.2.  Corrective action plans\n\nThe  Sustainable  Procurement  function  and  the  network  of Sustainable Procurement correspondents coordinate the implementation of corrective action plans. In accordance with the assessment procedure for Sustainability-Critical Suppliers (paragraph 5.2.2, page 121), suppliers needing improvement and non-compliant suppliers must establish a corrective action plan.\n\nDepending on the size of the company or the type of actions to be rolled  out,  these  plans  can  be  established  in  different  ways,  for example:\n\n- \u25a0 on  the  basis  of  the  improvement  areas  identified  during  the assessment  on  the  external  platform  or  in  the  internal questionnaire;\n- \u25a0 through  participation  of  the  suppliers  in  training  sessions organized by the Sustainable Procurement correspondents on sustainability-related topics.\n\nIn  some cases, despite all the efforts made by the Procurement teams  with  the  suppliers  concerned,  the  corrective  action  plans requested  are  not  carried  out.  When  constraints  specific  to  the Group's  business  so  require  (e.g.  public  energy  suppliers),  the Procurement  teams  develop  ad  hoc  due  diligence  measures. Subsequently,  the  decision  to  continue  with  the  suppliers concerned  is  made  by  local  management.  These  decisions  are formalized and monitored.\n\nThe environment, ethics, human rights and working conditions, and the sustainable procurement procedures implemented by suppliers.\n\nResponsible supplier.",

        "page_content": "## 5.3.3.  Training\n\nIn 2023,  Air  Liquide  organized  training  sessions  to  raise awareness among buyers of the Group's Sustainable Procurement approach and of the Procurement climate roadmap (paragraph 5.3.5,  page  123). Training  courses  are  organized  by subject and by geography. A total of 827 buyers were trained in 2023.\n\nBy educating buyers on the importance of sustainability and of its integration  into  purchasing  decisions,  Air  Liquide  can  exert influence on supplier behavior. Empowered buyers can effectively communicate  expectations and requirements to suppliers, fostering  a  culture  of  sustainability.  This  strategy  also  promotes long-term  partnerships  with  suppliers  committed  to  ethical  and environmentally  responsible  practices.  Ultimately,  investing  in buyer  training  yields  a  more  robust  and  enduring  framework  for climate strategy in sustainable procurement.\n\n## 5.3.4 . Inclusive procurement\n\nIn the process of promoting a culture of inclusion, Air Liquide has developed  relationships  with disability-inclusive  companies . Through  the  purchase  of  goods  and  services  from  these specialized  companies,  Air  Liquide  contributes  to  the  so-called 'indirect' employment of people with disabilities. These suppliers include organizations for the social and professional integration of people  with  disabilities  (ESAT),  self-employed  workers  with disabilities (TIH) as well as adapted enterprises (EA).\n\nIn  France, Air  Liquide  declared  in  2023  1.9  million  euros  spent with  disability-inclusive  companies  for  the  year  2022. The  social footprint  of  these  purchases  represented  90  jobs  created  or maintained in 2022 (1) .\n\nEach year, in France, Air Liquide organizes a 'Forum des Achats Inclusifs'  (Inclusive  Procurement  Forum),  bringing  together  Air Liquide's  key  players  and  companies  in  the  disability  sector  to promote procurement from them. In 2023, this  event,  co-hosted with  the  Handeco  association,  was  conducted  in  a  digital  and face-to-face format through a round table and testimonials. More than 200 Air Liquide employees took part in this event.\n\n## AIR LIQUIDE PROMOTES INCLUSIVE PROCUREMENT PLAYERS\n\nDuring  the  2023  Inclusive  Procurement  Forum,  the  round  table 'Air  Liquide's  social  footprint:  the  men  and  women  behind  our contracts  with  disability-inclusive  suppliers'  made  it  possible  to demonstrate the benefits of inclusive procurement with companies in  the  adapted  sector  for  Air  Liquide,  its  suppliers  and  their employees. This exchange of views illustrated the pride of each of the  stakeholders  in  participating  in  partnerships  that  also  meet high  standards  in  terms  of  performance,  quality,  innovation  and agility.\n\nTwo testimonials from the Procurement Europe organization and Campus Technologies Grenoble confirmed this growing maturity of inclusive procurement.\n\nIn addition, the Air Liquide Inclusive Procurement European Forum was organized for the third time in 2023. Nearly 200 participants from operations and procurement, as well as suppliers - attended the  meeting  and  round  table  with  the  Group  Chief  Procurement Officer  &  Transformation  and  the  Europe  Chief  Procurement Officer. Testimonials from Germany with HPZ (Heilp\u00e4dagogisches Zentrum)  and  the  United  Kingdom  with  Royal  British  Legion Industries were  shared  to  raise  awareness  and  promote relationships  with  companies  supporting  the  inclusion  of  people with disabilities and workshops in the protected sector in Europe.\n\n## 5.3.5.  'Procure to Neutrality', the Procurement climate roadmap\n\nIn its strategic  plan  ADVANCE  for  the  2022-2025  period, announced in March 2022, Air Liquide reaffirmed its ambition to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Procurement has a key role to play in supporting this objective throughout the supply chain of the Group's businesses, in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 by supporting its suppliers in the decarbonization of the goods and services that the Group purchases;\n- \u25a0 by helping to reduce the Group's emissions; and\n- \u25a0 by  contributing  to  the  development  of  low-carbon  solutions offered to its customers.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Group  Procurement  Department  initiated  a  climate roadmap, 'Procure to Neutrality' based on four pillars:\n\n- \u25a0 measure :  improve  the  greenhouse  gas  emission  calculation methodology (Scope 3), where relevant and feasible;\n- \u25a0 engage buyers, with the training of the procurement community;  engage  suppliers  of  the  Group  identified  on  the basis  of  a  mapping  as  the  most  significant  in  terms  of emissions;\n- \u25a0 leverage Procurement's contributions to reducing Air Liquide's Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions;\n- \u25a0 reduce :  define an objective, with the aim of aligning with the Group's carbon neutrality ambition.\n\nInternally, around 78% of the Procurement community has taken part  in  training  sessions  since  2022  on  key  concepts  for understanding  climate  issues,  carbon  accounting  methodologies and greenhouse gas emission reduction objectives. In addition, a specific  training  module  for  buyers  was  launched  in  2023  to enable  them  to  engage  suppliers  in  measures  to  assess greenhouse  gas  emissions,  climate  objectives  and  actions  to reduce the carbon footprint of products and services purchased. In 2023, 45% of buyers took this new module.\n\nIn 2022, Air Liquide launched an action with those of its suppliers most exposed to risks of greenhouse gas emissions. 75 of them had responded to a questionnaire. Actions continued in 2023 with 34 dedicated meetings organized with suppliers to engage them to  undertake  actions  on  the  measurement  of  emissions,  climate objectives and the reduction of their impacts.\n\nIn addition, in 2023, Air Liquide contributed to the training module on Sustainable Procurement developed by Axa Climate School by sharing a business case study on its TCO2 tool. This tool allows the climate maturity of suppliers and CO2 emissions related to the manufacture,  transport  and  use  of  equipment  to  be  integrated. This module is integrated into the selection criteria for suppliers of strategic equipment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

MONITORING OF MEASURES IMPLEMENTED AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS\n\nThe  implementation  of  the  Sustainable  Procurement  procedure, and in particular the results of the Sustainability-Critical Suppliers' assessments, is monitored by the Procurement Department.\n\nIn 2023,  of  the  1,076  Sustainability-Critical  Suppliers,  the assessment and action plans campaign addressed 560 of them:\n\n- \u25a0 461 suppliers were invited to answer a questionnaire (2) . 361 of them (78%) were assessed (43% by the external platform and 57% by Air Liquide using the internal questionnaire);\n- \u25a0 42  non-compliant  suppliers  were  invited  to  set  up  corrective action plans. All of them prepared and completed action plans.\n\nAt the end  of  the  2023  assessment  campaign,  769  of Sustainability-Critical  Suppliers  had  a  valid  score  (paragraph 5.2.2, page 121). Other suppliers are being monitored.\n\nThe results of the assessment by the external platform show that the  average  of  the  current  score  is  51/100  for  SustainabilityCritical  Suppliers.  The  two  themes  with  the  highest  scores  are human rights  and  working  conditions  and  the  environment,  with an average of 54/100. The lowest rating concerns the sustainable procurement  procedures  implemented  by  suppliers  with  an average of 45/100.\n\n- \u25a0 57  suppliers  needing  improvement  were  invited  to  set  up corrective action plans. 56 of them have prepared action plans;\n\n| Key indicators                                                                                             | 2023 Objectives   | 2023 Results   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| Share of Sustainability-Critical Suppliers addressed by the annual assessment campaign  who responded      | 72%               | 78%            |\n| Share of suppliers needing improvement who prepared a corrective action plan  (annual assessment campaign) | 86%               | 98%            |\n| Share of non-compliant suppliers who prepared and implemented a corrective action plan                     | 100%              | 100%           |\n\nFollowing  the  assessment  results  and  a  review  of  corrective action plans, Air Liquide suspended its sales relationship with two suppliers in 2023.\n\n## 6.   Whistleblowing system\n\n## 6.1.   ETHICS WHISTLEBLOWING SYSTEM\n\n## 6.1.1.  Collection and treatment of alerts\n\nAir  Liquide's  Whistleblowing  Policy,  updated  at  the  end  of  2022, defines  the  various  channels  that  the  whistleblower  can  use  to report a possible violation of the Group's ethics commitments and rules and the process for handling alerts by Air Liquide. Available for all employees in the BlueBook, it is accessible on the Group's website  for  external  stakeholders  (https://www.airliquide.com/ sustainable-development/ethics).  This  policy  is  progressively being  cascaded  down  through  local  entities  in  the  Group's entities.\n\nThe  whistleblowing  system,  EthiCall  (https://safecall.co.uk/en/ clients/ethicall/),  is  available  for  all  Group  entities  and,  after consultation  with  employee  representative  bodies  in  France  in 2021,  for  all  of  its  internal  and  external  stakeholders  (customers, patients, suppliers, subcontractors and their staff, local communities, facilitators, etc.). Airgas and its subsidiaries also have a similar platform, EthicsPoint  (https://secure.ethicspoint.com/ domain/media/en/gui/28723/index.html). Air  Liquide  communicates regularly  on  these  systems  to  its  employees  (e.g.  via  posters, Intranet, reminder in the annual and mandatory e-learning relating to  the  Code  of  Conduct,  managerial  communication,  induction training for new hires).\n\nAnyone can report an alert in their own language by telephone or via dedicated websites (alerts are collected by service providers). For  employees,  these  systems  come  in  addition  to  the  usual channels for  reporting  potential  incidents  within  the  entities  (line management, Human Resources Department, Ethics Correspondent, Group Ethics Officer). Third parties can also raise their concerns to their contact person within the Group.\n\n(2)\n\nThese  performance  indicators  and  their  progress  report  are regularly  presented  the  the  Group  Procurement  Management Committee,  which  bring  together  the  Hubs  and  the  World Business Units Procurement Directors.\n\nAlerts may notably relate to allegations of breaches of the Group's Code of Conduct, of internal policies and procedures or applicable laws,  and  to  any  incidents  related  to  human  rights,  health  and safety, or the environment.\n\nThe whistleblowing system enables rapid and structured handling of alerts received as well as objective and confidential treatment. Once  an  alert  has  been  registered,  the  treatment  procedure provides  that  an  acknowledgment  of  receipt  be  sent  to  the whistleblower  within  seven  days  after  the  initial  receipt.  The competent person within Air  Liquide  with  regard  to  the  category and geographic origin of the alert assesses the admissibility of the alert  in  accordance  with  internal  procedures  and  appoints  an investigator  if  necessary.  The  latter  conducts  an  investigation  to determine whether the reported facts are substantiated. They may call  on  external  resources  for  this  investigation.  If  the  facts  are substantiated, appropriate corrective measures and remedies are implemented. These measures may include:\n\n- \u25a0 the strengthening of Group policies, controls and processes;\n- \u25a0 Human  Resources  or  other  type  of  assistance  to  the whistleblower;\n- \u25a0 individual or collective awareness-raising;\n- \u25a0 disciplinary  sanctions,  up  to  and  including  dismissal,  in accordance  with  applicable  regulations  or  legal  proceedings where appropriate.\n\nFollow-up and feedback should be provided to the whistleblower during  processing  and  no  later  than  three  months  from  the acknowledgment  of  receipt  of  the  alert  (but  as  far  as  possible within  two  months).  In  certain  justified  cases  and  in  certain jurisdictions (for example, due to the nature or complexity of the alert),  a  longer  period  may be necessary (but this period should not exceed three additional months).",

The  most  serious  cases  are  reviewed  by  an  Ethics Committee at the relevant hub or World Business Unit level, or by the Group's Ethics and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe principles concerning the protection granted to whistleblowers (anonymity of the whistleblower, respect for the confidentiality of the  alert  treatment,  prohibition  of  any  form  of  retaliation)  are affirmed  in  the  Code  of  Conduct  and  the  Group  Whistleblowing Policy. The Group guarantees that any whistleblower who has in good  faith  reported  an  ethical  breach  or  misconduct  will  not  be subject  to  any  disciplinary  or  discriminatory  measures  or retaliation of any kind.\n\n## 6.1.2.

ADDITIONAL WHISTLEBLOWING MECHANISMS\n\n## 6.2.1.  Safety and security event reporting process\n\nUrgent situations in terms of health, safety or security, or the most serious accidents cannot be processed by the ethics whistleblowing system.  The  Safety  and  Industrial  System Department  has  an  internal  reporting  process  for  security  or safety incidents, which  makes  it  possible  to  inform  the management chain and the relevant security or safety managers of the subsidiary, cluster (group of countries), hub and Group very quickly,  depending  on  the  severity.  A  crisis  management  and incident  monitoring  process  is  therefore  implemented  to  ensure the best care of any victims, secure the situation and establish an investigation  team  which  is  both  qualified  and  adapted  to  the incident.  Subsidiaries  regularly  report  all  safety  and  security events in the Group's reporting tool.\n\n## 6.2.2.  Process for the protection of personal data\n\nFor  personal  data,  Air  Liquide  has  deployed  specific  tools  to collect  requests  for  the  exercise  of  rights  and  to  report  possible violations of personal data. A form is available on the Air Liquide website (https://contactprivacy.airliquide.com/) to be put in contact with  the  services  in  charge  of  personal  data  protection.  In addition,  Air  Liquide  has  signed  a  contract  with  a  company responsible  for  finding  and  reporting  personal  data  that  is illegitimately  accessible  via  the  Internet.  These  requests  and alerts  are  recorded  in  a  dedicated  register. Alleged  violations  of personal data are systematically analyzed and, if necessary, give rise to changes in management processes.\n\nIn addition, in 2023, Air Liquide recorded 124 requests throughout the  Group  for  the  exercise  of  rights  or  alerts  of  violations  of personal data.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Board of Directors confirmed that, in keeping with the Group's previous practices, the AFEP/MEDEF  Code  of  Corporate Governance for listed companies is the Code to which the Company voluntarily  refers.  This  Code  in  its  updated  version  is  available  on the website : https://afep.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ Afep\\_Medef\\_Code\\_revision\\_2022\\_version\\_EN\\_.pdf\n\nThe  Appointments and Governance Committee and the Remuneration  Committee  reviewed  current  practices  in  the Company with respect to the AFEP/MEDEF Code as amended in December  2022.  The  Company  considers  that  its  practices comply with the recommendations of the AFEP/MEDEF Code and no  points  appear  in  the  summary  table  (see  below,  paragraph 'Application  of  the  AFEP/MEDEF  Corporate  Governance  Code: summary  table'  -  page  154)  established  under  the  'Apply  or Explain'  rule  provided  for  by  article  L.  22-10-10  of  the  French Commercial  Code,  and  referred  to  in  article  28.1  of  the  AFEP/ MEDEF Code of December 2022.\n\nThe  Report  of  the Haut  Comit\u00e9  de  gouvernement  d'entreprise (French High Committee on Corporate Governance) of November 2023  and  the  French  financial  market  authority  ( Autorit\u00e9  des March\u00e9s  Financiers )  Report  on  Corporate  Governance  and  the remuneration of Executive Officers of listed companies published in  December  2023  were  reviewed  by  each  of  the  concerned Committees, which then made a report to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe principles governing the professional ethics of Directors, the diversity policy which applies to the Board of Directors, together with the composition, role and rules of operation of the Board and its Committees are defined in the internal regulations.

Governance structure: Separation of the functions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer\n\nAir  Liquide's  governance  is  historically  defined  by  an  effort  to remain relevant to the Group's challenges, to respect Shareholders' rights, balance of the powers and best practices.\n\nThe  governance  of  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  is  a  governance  with  a Board  of  Directors  with,  since  June  1,  2022,  separation  of  the functions  of  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  from  those  of Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe Board of Directors' meeting of May 4, 2022, at the close of the General Meeting, acting unanimously and in accordance with the  recommendations  of  the  Appointments  and  Governance Committee, chose to adopt this dissociated mode of governance, effective June 1, 2022, and to appoint Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow as the new Chief  Executive  Officer  and  renew  the  duties  of  Mr  Beno\u00eet Potier  as  Chairman of the Board of Directors. On this occasion, the  Board  of  Directors  also  decided  to  maintain  the  position  of Lead Director.\n\n## 2.1.   Powers of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nAs  an  Executive  Officer,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  who  alone oversees  and  manages  the  operations  of  the  Company,  is invested with the broadest powers to act in all circumstances in the Company's name subject to certain decisions to be submitted to  prior  authorization  of  the  Board  of  Directors  as  established  in the articles of association and described in the internal regulations (see below).\n\nMr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow is also a Director of L'Air Liquide S.A. In this capacity,  he  participates  in  the  discussions  and  deliberations  of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Limits on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nIn  accordance  with  article  13  of  the  articles  of  association, decisions subject to the prior authorization or information from the Board  of  Directors  are  defined  in  the  internal  regulations  of  the Board of Directors as follows:",

This number is reduced to two other terms of office for Company Officers.\n\nMoreover,  an  obligation  to  provide  information  on  the  terms  of office held in other companies, including their participation on the Board  Committees  of  such  companies,  is  provided  for  nonexecutive  Directors.

positions.\n\n## Changes to the Board for 2024:\n\nFor 2024, in view of the recent appointments of five Directors and taking  into  account  the  provisions  of  the  internal  regulations, which  stipulate  that  the  number  of  members  is  in  principle between  10  and  12  (excluding  Directors  representing  the employees), the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Appointments  and  Governance  Committee,  has  decided  not  to propose any new appointments to the General Meeting of April 30, 2024  and  to  ask  for  the  renewal  of  the  terms  of  office  of  two\n\nindependent  Directors,  Ms  Kim  Ann  Mink  and  Ms  Monica de Virgiliis, whose terms of office expire at the end of this Meeting.\n\nIf  the General Meeting adopts the resolutions proposed to it, the composition of the Board of Directors will remain the same as the composition as of December 31, 2023 (see table above) with 14 members (including 12 appointed by the General Meeting and two Directors representing the employees).",

INDEPENDENCE OF BOARD MEMBERS\n\nBased on the full definition of independence set out in the AFEP/ MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance, the internal regulations define  the  criteria  applied  within  the  Company  to  assess  the independence of a Board member.\n\n'A member of the Board of Directors is independent when he/she has no relationship of any kind with the Company, its Group or its management which may interfere with his/her freedom to exercise his/her judgment.\n\nIn this spirit, the criteria which may provide guidance to the Board in order to classify a member as independent will be as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 he/she is not and has never been an employee or member of the Executive Management of the Company;\n- \u25a0 he/she  does  not  hold  office  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman or member of the Management Board of a company in which the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or a Senior Executive Vice President of Air Liquide is a Director or member of the Supervisory Board;\n- \u25a0 he/she  must  not  have  any  business  relations  with  the  Air Liquide  Group  which  represent  a  significant  part  of  the business activities (i) of the company of which the Director is a member of the Executive Management or (ii) of Air Liquide;\n- \u25a0 he/she  does  not  have  any  close  family  links  with  the  Chief Executive Officer or a Senior Executive Vice President;\n- \u25a0 he/she must not have been an auditor of the Company during the previous five years;\n- \u25a0 he/she  must  not  have  been  a  member  of  the  Board  of Directors  (or  Supervisory  Board)  of  the  Company  for  more than 12 years.'\n\nEvery year, an assessment of the independence of the Directors appointed by the General Meeting and, as the case may be, of the candidates for such a position is included on the agenda of the Board.  In  reliance  on  the  work  of  the  Appointments  and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors reviews each of the criteria contained in the Board's internal regulations and in the AFEP/MEDEF  Code  for  assessing  the  independence  of  each Director.\n\nThe  Air  Liquide  Group  is  particularly  attentive  to  conflicts  of interest  and  even  potential  conflicts  of  interest.  To  determine whether  or  not  the  business  relationship  is  material,  for  each Director  or  candidate  for  these  positions,  criteria  such  as  the following are examined:\n\n- \u25a0 the  percentage  of  worldwide  business  volumes  between  the Air  Liquide  Group  and  each  group  in  which  an  Air  Liquide\n\nDirector  (or  candidate  for  the  position  of  Director)  holds  a corporate office or a management position. The percentage of business  volume  is  assessed  for  both  the Air  Liquide  Group and each group concerned;\n\n- \u25a0 the economic dependence;\n- \u25a0 the exclusivity;\n- \u25a0 the participation of the Director in the business relationship.\n\nThe Board relies on a summary table of the flows (purchases and sales) that took place during the past fiscal year between the Air Liquide Group and the group within which an Air Liquide Director appointed by the General Meeting (or a candidate proposed for these  functions)  also  holds  a  corporate  office  or  an  executive function  -  on  this  point,  see  the  information  relating  to  the positions  and  functions  held  by  the  Directors  on  pages  155  to 168).  Such figures are weighed against the total purchases and sales of each group to measure their significance.\n\nFor  the  2023  fiscal  year,  this  chart  shows  that  the  amounts  of sales by the Air Liquide Group to any of the relevant groups or of its purchases from any such groups do not exceed 1% of the total sales  or  purchases  by  the  Air  Liquide  Group  or  by  any  of  the relevant groups.\n\nBeyond the quantitative criteria mentioned above, the qualitative review conducted by the Board of Directors led to the conclusion that  neither  Air  Liquide  nor  the  groups  concerned  are  in  a relationship of economic dependence or exclusivity, as these are large international groups with very diversified activities.\n\nIn addition, in light of the highly decentralized organization of the Air Liquide Group, its size, the diversity of its businesses, which are, for the most part, extremely local, and its broad geographical presence,  the  relevant  Directors  do  not  become  involved  in business  relations  which  are  conducted,  within  the  Air  Liquide Group,  entirely  by  the  managers  of  the  relevant  hubs,  clusters (groups of countries/entities) and of the concerned countries. After a  review  of  each  individual  situation,  the  Board  concluded  that none of the Directors has to exercise a direct or indirect decisionmaking  power  in  the  contractual  negotiations  leading  to  the business affairs discussed. If this were not the case, he/she would have  to  declare  a  conflict  of  interest  to  the  Board.  This  matter would  then  be  addressed  in  accordance  with  the  ethical  rules provided for in the internal regulations.\n\nAs  a  result  of  the  review  carried  out,  it  was  concluded  that  no group in which a Director of Air Liquide holds a corporate office or a  management  position  has  a  significant  business  relationship with the Air Liquide Group.",

internal  regulations  as  set  forth  above (page 136 of this Universal Registration Document). The criteria used are very largely inspired by the AFEP/MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance. The Board continues to consider, however, that the Company's former employees or officers cannot be deemed to be independent even if they ceased to hold office more than five years ago.\n\nFurther to the recommendation made by the French financial market authority, a table showing the list of Directors who are considered to be independent in light of the criterion provided for in the internal regulations and the AFEP/MEDEF Code is set out below.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 Independence of the Directors appointed by the General Meeting in light of the criteria in the\n\n|                                                          | Internal regulations   | AFEP/MEDEF Code   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| Beno\u00eet Potier  - Chairman of the Board of Directors      | No                     | No                |\n| Fran\u00e7ois Jackow  - Chief Executive Officer               | No                     | No                |\n| Xavier Huillard  - Lead Director                         | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Bertrand Dumazy                                          | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Aiman Ezzat                                              | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Catherine Guillouard                                     | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Christina Law                                            | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Kim Ann Mink                                             | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Alexis Perakis-Valat                                     | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Michael H.

Thaman, Ms Monica de  Virgiliis  and  Ms  Annette  Winkler  (i.e. 83% independent Directors). Pursuant to the provisions of the AFEP/MEDEF Code, Mr  Philippe  Dubrulle  and  Ms  Fatima  Tighlaline,  Directors representing  the  employees,  were  not  taken  into  account  when calculating this ratio.\n\nGiven  the  composition  of  the  Board  of  Directors  following  the Combined  General  Meeting  of  April  30,  2024,  subject  to  the approval of the proposed resolutions concerning the renewal of the terms  of  office  of  two  independent  Directors,  the  percentage  of independent Directors on the Board of Directors would remain 83%.\n\n## 3.3.   PROFESSIONAL ETHICS OF DIRECTORS - RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe internal regulations summarize the main obligations imposed on  Directors.  The  Director  represents  all  the  shareholders  and shall act in all circumstances in the Company's corporate interest.\n\nEach Director undertakes to meet the obligations imposed upon him/her  by  the  articles  of  association  and  the  various  legal, regulatory or internal Company provisions and, more specifically, the internal rules relating to the prevention of market abuse or the obligations  to  report  transactions  in  the  Company's  shares.  The Directors  are  regularly  informed  by  the  Company  of  their obligations  in  this  area.  The  Company  also  has  an  internal procedure  for  managing  inside  information.  As  every  year,  an internal memo on the prevention of market abuse was sent to the Directors at the beginning of 2024 which outlines in greater detail the applicable legal and regulatory obligations by which they are bound pursuant to the European and national provisions.\n\nEach Director is bound by an obligation of secrecy. The members of the Audit Committee are, in particular, bound by an obligation of confidentiality concerning the information relating to the services performed  by  the  Statutory  Auditors,  under  the  conditions  laid down by the law.\n\nEach Director  shall  endeavor  to  take  part  in  all  meetings  of  the Board  and  the  Committees  of  which  he/she  is  a  member,  and attend the General Meetings.\n\nThe  information  required  by  the AFEP/MEDEF  Code  concerning  the  level  of  individual  attendance  of  the  members  of  the  Board  of Directors is shown in the following table:\n\n|                                     | Board of  Directors   | Audit and  Accounts  Committee   | Appointments  and Governance  Committee   | Remuneration  Committee   | Environment and  Society  Committee   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Beno\u00eet Potier                       |                       |                                  |                                           |                           |                                       |\n| Chairman of the Board of Directors  | 100%                  | -                                | -                                         | -                         | -                                     |\n| Fran\u00e7ois Jackow                     |                       |                                  |                                           |                           |                                       |\n| Chief Executive Officer             | 100%                  | -                                | -                                         | -                         | -                                     |\n| Xavier Huillard                     |                       |                                  |                                           |                           |                                       |\n| Lead Director                       | 100%                  | -                                | 100%                                      | 100%                      | -                                     |\n| Genevi\u00e8ve Berger  (a)               | 100%                  | -                                | -                                         | -                         | 100%                                  |\n| Bertrand Dumazy  (b)                | 100%                  | 100%                             | 100%                                      | -                         | -                                     |\n| Aiman Ezzat                         | 100%                  | 100%                             | -                                         | -                         | -                                     |\n| Catherine Guillouard  (c) (d)       | 67%                   | 100%                             | -                                         | -                         | -                                     |\n| Si\u00e2n Herbert-Jones  (e)             | 100%                  | 100%                             | -                                         | -                         | -                                     |\n| Christina Law  (c)                  | 100%                  | -                                | -                                         | -                         | -                                     |\n| Kim Ann Mink                        | 100%                  | -                                | -                                         | 100%                      | -                                     |\n| Alexis Perakis-Valat  (c)           | 100%                  | -                                | -                                         | -                         | -                                     |\n| Michael H.

In  2023,  the attendance rate for this session was 100%. (See information on the joint session between these two Committees - page 149).\n\nEach Director shall keep him/herself informed and devote the time and attention required to perform his/her duties.\n\nUnder the Company's articles of association, each Director must hold at least 500 registered shares in the Company. The Director shall inform the Company of the number of shares which he/she holds. This provision does not apply to the Directors representing the employees.\n\nUnder the internal regulations:\n\n'The members of the Board of Directors must inform the Board of any situation of conflict of interest, even if it is only potential, with the Company and must refrain from taking part in the discussions and in the vote on the corresponding decision.'\n\nThis  obligation  is  completed  by  a  formal  annual  declaration provided to the Company by each Director, attesting the absence of a potential conflict of interest involving him/her.\n\n## Declarations\n\nPursuant  to  the  declarations  made  to  the  Company  by  each corporate officer, the Company confirms that the corporate officers have no family ties with any other corporate officer and have not been convicted of fraud at  any  point  in  at  least  the  the  last  five years.\n\nNo  official  charge  and/or  public  sanction  has  been  pronounced against them by the statutory or regulatory authorities (including any  professional  bodies)  and  they  have  not  been  barred  by  a court from serving as a member of a Supervisory Board, Board of Directors or other management body of an issuer or from taking part in the management or conduct of an issuer's business affairs at any point in at least the last five years. They have no conflicts or potential conflicts of interest with regard to L'Air Liquide S.A.\n\nNo  arrangement  or  agreement  has  been  entered  into  with  the major  Shareholders,  customers,  suppliers  or  other  persons, pursuant  to  which  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.'s  corporate  officers  were selected as such. Such persons have not agreed any restriction on the transfer, within a certain period of time, of their holding in the capital of L'Air Liquide S.A. apart from the rules relating to the prevention  of  market  abuse,  the  statutory  obligation  for  the members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  who  are  elected  by  the General  Meeting  to  hold  at  least  500  registered  shares  in  the Company  throughout  the  period  of  their  term  of  office  and  the shareholding obligations which apply to the Company Officers.\n\nThe  corporate  officers  have  not  been  linked  to  any  bankruptcy, receivership  or  liquidation  at  any  point  in  at  least  the  last  five years.\n\nFinally, the Appointments and Governance Committee, under the management  of  the  Lead  Director,  currently  has  the  task  of preventing potential situations of conflict of interest on the Board.\n\nAll  the  provisions  governing  Directors'  rights  and  obligations  are included  in  the  manual  for  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors which is updated once a year.\n\n## 3.4.   LEAD DIRECTOR\n\nPursuant to the terms of article 13 of the articles of association, the  Board  of  Directors  is  obliged  to  appoint  a  Lead  Director,  as long  as  the  roles  of  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  are combined. In the event of separation of the functions of Chairman of  the  Board and Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors may also  appoint  a  Lead  Director  from  among  the  independent members of the Appointments and Governance Committee. The Lead Director remains in office until the end of his or her term of office on the Appointments and Governance Committee.\n\nMr Xavier Huillard, independent Director, has been Lead Director since May 2022.",

        "page_content": "## 4.   Role and tasks of the Board of Directors\n\n- \u25a0 The  Board  of  Directors  determines  the  orientations  of  the Company's activities and ensures their implementation, in line with its corporate interest, by taking into account the social and environmental  stakes  of  its  activity.  Accordingly,  it  examines and  approves,  based  on  proposals  from  the  Company's General Management, the main points of the Group's strategy (in principle three to  five year objectives), including the multiannual  strategy  orientations  concerning  corporate  social responsibility. It ensures the implementation of these orientations by the General Management.\n- \u25a0 The  Board  of  Directors  regularly  reviews,  in  connection  with the  strategy  which  it  has  defined,  opportunities  and  the financial,  legal,  operational,  social  and  environmental  risks, together with the measures taken accordingly. It ensures that a system  has  been  implemented  for  the  prevention  and detection of corruption and influence peddling.\n- \u25a0 Subject to the powers attributed to the General Meetings and within the limit of the corporate purpose, the Board deals with any issue concerning the smooth running of the Company and manages  corporate  business  pursuant  to  its  decisions.  The internal regulations stipulate that the specific powers vested in the  Board  of  Directors  include,  in  particular,  the  choice  of Company Officers, the determination of their remuneration and setting of the terms and conditions governing their employment and  performance  of  their  duties  in  accordance  with  current regulations;  the  appointment  of  the  Lead  Director;  the convening  of  the  General  Meeting  (and  determination  of  the agenda  and  draft resolutions within this scope); the preparation of the financial statements and Annual Management Report (including the Extra-financial Performance  Declaration  and  the  Vigilance  Plan)  and  the Report on Corporate Governance; the definition of the Group's gender policy  in  leaderships;  establishing  its  proper  rules  for functioning (formation of Committees, breakdown of Directors' annual  remuneration,  and  more).  In  addition,  the  Board  of Directors may also decide or authorize simple bond issues.\n- \u25a0 The  Board  also  exercises  the  powers  delegated  to  it  by  the General  Meeting,  particularly  with  regard  to  the  granting  of stock  options  or  award  of  performance  shares,  issues  of marketable  securities,  share  buyback  or  employee  savings programs.\n- \u25a0 The Board of Directors ensures that the General Management implements  a  non-discrimination  and  diversity  policy,  notably concerning balanced gender representation within the Group's leaderships. Acting on a proposal by General Management, the Board sets the diversity targets within the leaderships. General Management  makes  a  submission  to  the  Board  on  how  the targets  will  be  implemented,  together  with  an  action  plan  and schedule  for  completion.  General  Management  reports  the results to the Board every year.\n\nIn  this  context,  the  Board  of  Directors,  at  its  meeting  in February  2024,  on  the  recommendation  of  the Appointments and Governance Committee, noted the progress made in 2023 in connection with the targets for 2025, namely 35% women at the  managers  and  professionals  level  and  25%  of  executive positions (senior executives) held by women. At this meeting, the Board of Directors also noted the changes made in 2023 within  the  framework  of  the  objectives  set  for  the  Executive Committee for 2026. These objectives, which are incorporated into  the  non-discrimination and diversity policy, are set out in detail on pages 346, 347 and 373 of this Universal Registration Document and are supplemented by information relating to the manner  in  which  the  Company  tries  to  obtain  a  balanced representation  of  women  and  men  on  this  Committee.  The results  concerning  the  gender  mix  with  regard  to  the  10%  of positions which carry the most responsibility can also be found on pages 347 and 373.\n\n## 5.   Functioning of the Board of Directors\n\nInforming  the  Directors: the  internal  regulations  define  the methods  for  informing  the  Directors.  They  specify,  in  particular, that  prior  to  Board  meetings,  a  file  of  meeting  documentation  is sent  out  to  Board  members  covering  the  items  on  the  agenda. Files are provided in electronic form on a dedicated platform. The Chief Executive Officer, assisted, if need be, by members of the management  teams,  presents  to  the  Board  of  Directors  a quarterly report on the Company's management, the draft annual and interim financial statements and the various issues requiring the authorization or opinion of the Board of Directors. For major substantive  issues  (major  projects,  M&A,  etc.),  a  very  detailed summary is prepared. Any member of the Board of Directors may request  any  additional  information  he/she  considers  necessary. He/she makes such a request to the Chairman of the Board.\n\nInteractions between  the  non-Executive  Directors  and  the members of the Executive Committee are regular and take place during  specific  presentations  made  at  meetings  of  the  Board  of Directors,  particularly  during  the  meeting  on  strategy  or  during Committee meetings, as well as outside of these meetings. They also meet with them during training sessions on the activities for which the members of the Executive Committee are responsible.\n\nThe  Directors  may  ask  to  meet  members  of  the  Executive Committee at any time.\n\nConduct  of  meetings: the  internal  regulations  define  the frequency of meetings and the rules for convening meetings and for participation by video-conference or telecommunications.\n\nDuring  the  meeting,  a  summary  presentation  of  the  items  is made, allowing considerable time for exchanges and discussions. The  presentations  give  rise  to  questions  and  are  followed  by discussions.  A  round-the-table  discussion  is  systematically  held concerning  the  significant  points,  before  moving  to  vote  on  the items on the agenda. Detailed written minutes are then sent to the members for their review and comments, before the approval of the Board of Directors at its next meeting.\n\nPursuant  to  the  provisions  of  article  14  of  the  articles  of association,  the  Board  of  Directors,  upon  notice  from  the Chairman of the Board of Directors, may take certain decisions by written consultation of the Directors under the conditions provided for by the regulations in force.\n\nThe  Statutory  Auditors  are  also  heard  during  the  meetings  to review the financial statements.\n\nSpecialized Committees of the Board: the  internal  regulations define  the  tasks  and  operating  procedures  for  the  four  Board Committees  (a  description  of  the  missions  of  the  Committees' tasks is provided on pages 147, 150, 152 and 153).",

In particular, training on the Group's specific  accounting,  financial,  extra-financial  and  operational aspects,  as  well  as  training  on  aspects  related  to  the  Group's risks,  are  offered  to  members  of  the  Audit  and  Accounts Committee.\n\nEach  year,  the  Directors  are  asked  about  their  training requirements  and  a  training  request  form  is  systematically proposed once a year to each Director. It consists of proposals for meetings with the heads of each of the major business lines and main central functions, and site visits. The Directors may ask to meet Executive Committee members or ask for specific training for each business line, activity or geographical zone.\n\nA form is also systematically proposed to new Directors, which is used  to  draw  up  a  training  program  adapted  to  the  skills  and individual experience of each new Director.\n\nIn 2023, the focus was on training for the five new members of the Board  of  Directors.  They  received  training  on  topics  related  in particular to:\n\n- \u25a0 the strategic ADVANCE program, including ESG (Environmental, Societal and Corporate Governance) objectives;\n- \u25a0 General Control;\n- \u25a0 governance, including the main organizational principles of the Group and its main business lines, with a particular focus on the  organization  and  missions  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and each Committee;\n- \u25a0 the Group's various business lines, including Healthcare, Large Industries, Industrial Merchant, Hydrogen and Electronics.\n\nIn addition, all members of the Board of Directors took part in:\n\n- \u25a0 a training course conducted by an external consultant on the theme  of  CSR,  during  which  the  changes  resulting  from  the new  CSRD  regulations  (Corporate  Sustainability  Reporting Directive) were presented, in particular, as well as an update of the information communicated during the previous training on the  same topics in December 2022. During this meeting, the topics  discussed  concerned  in  particular  the  main  reporting obligations  linked  to  the  CSRD  and  ESG  (sustainable investment or environmental, social and governance) with the impacts  in  terms  of  governance  of  the  new  obligations resulting  from  the  transposition  in  France  of  the  CSRD.  In accordance  with  the  same  principle  as  in  2022,  discussions took place at the end of the presentations, in a question and answer format;\n- \u25a0 a discussion bringing together all the Directors and Mr Beno\u00eet Potier with the central theme being a presentation of the Group and its history.\n\nFurther  to  this,  the  two  Directors  representing  the  employees benefited from specific training, details of which are given below.\n\n## 6.   Participation of employee representatives on the Board of Directors\n\n## 6.1.   WITH A DELIBERATIVE VOTE\n\nTwo  Directors  representing  the  employees  sit  on  the  Board  of Directors:  Mr  Philippe  Dubrulle (1) ,  who  is  also  a  member  of  the Environment and Society Committee, and Ms Fatima Tighlaline (2) , who is also a member of the Remuneration Committee.\n\nMr  Philippe  Dubrulle  and  Ms  Fatima  Tighlaline  sit  on  the  Board with a deliberative vote. They are subject to all of the provisions of the internal regulations governing the rights and obligations of the Directors.\n\nWithin the scope of the agreement entered into with the various stakeholders  and  pursuant  to  the  provisions  in  force  within  the Group,  which  apply  to  all  the  employees  performing  duties  on Boards of Directors of the Group companies, it was agreed that employee Directors would not receive any remuneration.\n\n## Training of Directors representing the employees\n\nDirectors  representing  the  employees  may  benefit  from  any training adapted to the exercise of their term of office as Directors, in accordance  with  the  regulations  in  force.  This  time  is considered as actual working time and remunerated as such. The Board of Directors, pursuant to the applicable legal provisions and the  agreement  concluded  between  the  various  stakeholders  on December 10, 2021, defined the amount of time allocated to the Directors  representing  the  employees  for  (i)  the  preparation  of meetings of the Board of Directors (15 hours/meeting) and of the Committees which they are member of (5 hours/meeting) as well as  (ii)  training  (40  hours/year  on  a  cumulative  basis  over  the length of the term of office).\n\nIn addition to the internal training courses organized in particular with  members  of  the  Executive  Committee  on  certain  specific Group  activities and cross-functional skills, the Directors representing the employees benefited from the following external training:\n\n- \u25a0 As part of his first term of office, Mr Philippe Dubrulle attended the training course provided by the Institute of Political Studies of  Paris in partnership with the IFA in 2016 and obtained the Company Director certificate. At the end of 2023, he began a training course provided by the Institute of Political Studies of Paris  in  association  with  the  IDDRI  (Institute  for  Sustainable Development  and  International  Relations)  on  the  ecological transition and the transformation of organizations. This training will continue in the first half of 2024. This training complements the  training  on  sustainable  corporate  models  (organized  by Centrale  Supelec  Exed)  attended  by  Mr  Philippe  Dubrulle  in 2020.\n- \u25a0 Ms  Fatima  Tighlaline  completed  the  training  provided  by  the Institute of Political Studies of Paris in partnership with the IFA in  2021  and  obtained  the  Company  Director  certificate. Ms  Fatima  Tighlaline  did  not  request  any  specific  training  in 2023 but, at the time of the renewal of her mandate at the end of 2023,  indicated  her  training  projects,  which  will  be scheduled later.",

WITH AN ADVISORY VOTE\n\nSince the appointment in October 2020 of Ms Fatima Tighlaline as the  second  Director  representing  the  employees,  and  under  the agreement  entered  into  with  the  various  stakeholders,  a  sole member of the Social and Economic Council continues to attend Board of Directors' meetings with an advisory vote.\n\nThe delegate receives the same documents as those provided to the Directors for these meetings. The delegate is able to express his opinion on the questions discussed during the meetings.\n\nA  preparatory  meeting,  in  the  presence  of  a  member  of  the Executive Committee and the Secretary of the Board of Directors, is scheduled  before  each  Board  meeting.  This  preparatory meeting  is  the  opportunity  to  go  through  the  whole  file  for  the Board meeting with the Directors representing the employees and the Social and Economic Council delegate and to comment on the items on the agenda. It offers the participants the opportunity to raise their questions and make their initial comments.\n\n## 7.   Evaluation of the Board of Directors\n\nThe internal regulations stipulate that:\n\nThe Board will ensure that an evaluation is carried out periodically of  its  composition, its  organization and its functioning as well as those of its Committees. An update will be made by the Board on this topic once a year and a formal evaluation will be carried out at least every three years. Within the scope of the evaluation of the Board, the Directors will, in particular, be asked to state whether it appears to them to be necessary for the choice of the Company's General Management organization to be re-examined.\n\n## Evaluation process\n\nAn evaluation of the organization and functioning of the Board and its  Specialized  Committees  is  conducted every  year under  the responsibility of the Chairman  of  the  Appointments  and Governance  Committee,  who  also  acts  as  Lead  Director.  This evaluation is  carried  out  on  the  basis  of  a  questionnaire  sent  to the  Directors,  the  wording  of  which  is  approved  by  the Appointments and Governance Committee, alternating between:\n\n- \u25a0 in one year, as part of a formal evaluation , a comprehensive evaluation questionnaire sent to the members of the Board of Directors  and  followed  by  individual  interviews  with  each member, resulting in a summary document and the adoption of recommendations for action; and\n- \u25a0 the  following  year,  a simplified  questionnaire to  which  the members respond in writing, in particular to assess the actions implemented in light of the recommendations made during the formal evaluation.\n\nThe  procedure  used  for  the  annual  evaluation  guarantees  the confidentiality  of  discussions.  The  questionnaire  is  sent  to  all Directors.  Each  year,  the  questionnaire  contains  a  question relating  to  the  assessment  of  the  current  method  of  conducting General  Management.  In  this  framework,  an  assessment  is  also made  regarding  the  roles  and  actions  of  the  Chief  Executive Officer,  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Lead Director. The Directors are also asked about the composition of the Board of  Directors  and  the  current  skills  and/or  those  sought  for the future, the interaction between the Board and its Committees, onboarding of new members, training of Directors, etc.).\n\nThe  Board's  functioning  assessment  is  the  subject  of  a  specific agenda item of the Appointments and Governance Committee to allow members to debate on this matter.\n\nIn  light  of  the  collegiate  nature  of  the  Board,  the  assessment questionnaire  asks  members  about  the  dynamics  and  collective contribution  of  members  to  the  Board  operation.  However,  the questionnaire also invites the Directors to make an evaluation of\n\nthe  actual,  individual  contribution  of  Directors  in  the  work  of  the Board  of  Directors.  The  contribution  by  each  Director  is  also assessed by the Appointments and Governance Committee and then by the Board of Directors at the time of renewal of the terms of office of Directors and Committee members.\n\nAny useful feedback is made to the members.\n\n## 2023 evaluation\n\nUnder the agenda item on the Board's functioning and the debate on this subject, the Board of Directors reviewed the summary of responses to the simplified questionnaire sent to each member at the end of 2023, presented by the Chairman of the Appointments and Governance Committee.\n\nThis exercise has in particular made it possible to measure the level of satisfaction with the actions implemented concerning the  points  that  had  been  expressed  in  2022 as  part  of  the comprehensive  formal  evaluation,  carried  out  by  an  external service  provider  that  is  independent  (of  the  Company  and  its executives),  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Chairman  of  the Appointments  and  Governance  Committee,  also  acting  as  Lead Director.  The  overall  summary  carried  out  following  the  2023 evaluation  presented  to  the  Board  of  Directors  highlighted  the following points:\n\n- \u25a0 a high degree of satisfaction with (i) the current composition of the Board of Directors (diversity, competence), its balance and its dynamics, (ii) the succession to General Management and the balance of the separated mode of governance during the transition  period,  (iii)  training,  the  induction  program  and onboarding  of  new  members  and  (iv)  interactions  with  the Executive Committee.\n- In  response  to  requests  which  had  been  formulated  by  the members in 2022, the Chief Executive Officer has continued to provide  regular  updates  on  the  implementation  of  the strategics  objectives,  in  particular  during  the  Board  meeting dedicated to strategy. Updates on topical issues of relevance to the Group's business are also given during Board meetings. In  addition,  given  the  appointments  of  Directors  in  2023,  the Board has strengthened its international character, in particular by  acquiring  skills  related  to  knowledge  of  the  Asian  and American  markets,  and  its  cross-functional  skills,  including CSR;\n- \u25a0 recommendations made on (i) maintaining long-term geographical  diversity  on  the  Board,  (ii)  further  fostering interactions between the Board and the Group's high potential employees/talents and (iii) considering a new off-site strategic Board.",

The Reports on the statutory accounts and the consolidated financial statements  include  a  description  of  the  principal  audit topics  and  are  included  in  the  Universal  Registration Document while the third, more detailed report, is intended for the Audit Committee only.\n- \u25a0 With regard to risks, the Committee:\n- -monitored  the  management  of  the  risks  identified  by  the Group as part of the monitoring methodology for each type of  risk  (including  the  identification  of  management  and control  bodies  and  procedures)  and  was  informed  of  the appropriate  review  schedule  (annual  review  or  at  regular intervals,  depending  on  the  type).  The  Committee  heard regular reports on the main assignments carried out by the Group Control and Compliance Department, the corrective actions  taken,  as  well  as  the  Control  and  Compliance Department's main assignments for the forthcoming fiscal year. The Committee also regularly monitored the process for the rollout of the risk management procedure within the Group;\n- -examined the Group's risk mapping and any changes and ensured, at year-end, that all of the risks identified on the risk map and subject to regular review had been examined by  the  Audit  Committee  according  to  the  frequency specified.  The  work  program  prepared  for  the  2024  fiscal year is  consistent  with  this  approach.  It  was  presented  to the  Board  for  discussion.

It is noted that, pursuant to the PACTE Law, this procedure  provides  a  methodology  for  regularly  assessing whether  the  agreements  involving  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  that  are not  qualified  as  regulated  agreements  meet  or  continue  to meet  the  conditions  for  ordinary  agreements  entered  into  on arm's  length  terms.  Application  of  this  procedure  during  the past fiscal  year  did  not  give  rise  to  any  reclassification  of  an ordinary  agreement  entered  into  on  arm's  length  terms  as  a regulated agreement.\n- \u25a0 The  Committee  also  reviews  on  a  regular  basis  the  Group's activities  relating  to  advocacy  and  lobbying  and  reports  on them to the Board of Directors.\n\nSeveral days  prior to each  meeting,  a  file of meeting documentation,  available  in  electronic  form,  is  provided  to Committee  members  on  a  dedicated  platform.  Each  Committee meeting  is  preceded  by  a  preparatory  meeting  attended  by  the Committee  Chairwoman,  assisted  by  the  Committee  Secretary, the  Group  Chief  Financial  Officer  and  the  Group  Control  and Compliance Director (who also supervises internal audit). In order to prepare the meetings where financial statements are reviewed, the  Committee  Chairwoman  meets  with  the  Statutory  Auditors, without the presence of the Company representatives. During the meeting,  each  presentation  made  by  the  Group  Chief  Financial Officer,  Group  Control  Director,  the  senior  executive  specializing in the area under discussion or the Statutory Auditors during the financial statement review meetings is followed by discussion.\n\nAn oral and then written report of each meeting is prepared for the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Committee Chairwoman receives summaries of the internal audit reports.\n\nIn  addition,  after  presentation  meetings  for  the  accounts  for  the fiscal  year,  the  Committee  members  can  meet  alone  with  the Statutory  Auditors,  without  the  presence  of  the  Company representatives.\n\nAs  recommended  in  the  AFEP/MEDEF  Code  of  Corporate Governance,  the  following  measures  are  taken  so  that  the  time during which the financial statements are available to be reviewed is sufficient: preparatory meeting with the Committee Chairwoman more than one week prior to the meeting, as provided for above; files made available to Committee members five to seven days in advance.  These  measures  enable  the  members  to  review  the financial  statements  well  in  advance  of  the  meeting.  When compatible  with  the  schedules  of  the  members  traveling  from abroad,  the  Committee  meetings  relating  to  the  financial statements are held the day before the Board meeting.",

The Chairman of the Board of Directors participates in the work and attends Committee meetings. The Chief Executive Officer is involved in the Committee's work. However, they do not attend the deliberations made by this Committee with regard to their own personal cases. The Committee meets at least three times a year.\n\n## TASKS\n\nPursuant to the internal regulations, the tasks of the Appointments and Governance Committee are as follows:\n\n## \"1. Concerning the Board of Directors:\n\n- \u25a0 make proposals to the Board of Directors for renewal and appointment of Directors. This Committee looks for new members on the basis of its evaluation of the needs and developments expressed by the Board of Directors, and taking into consideration, in particular, the principle of attempting to achieve a balanced composition of the Board of Directors pursuant to the diversity policy described in article  III  of  these  internal  regulations.  The  Committee,  as  part  of  the  procedure  that  it  has  organized,  selects  future  independent directors  and  carries  out  its  own  research  into  potential  candidates  before  approaching  them.  The  main  steps  included  in  this procedure are (i) the definition of the profile(s) sought, (ii) the search conducted by the Committee, with assistance from an external recruitment firm, if applicable, (iii) the review of the candidates and (iv) the final selection, notably after individual meetings with the Committee Chair and each member;\n- \u25a0 make proposals to the Board of Directors for the creation and composition of Board Committees;\n- \u25a0 periodically evaluate the structure, size and composition of the Board of Directors and submit to it recommendations regarding any potential change;\n- \u25a0 the Committee periodically reviews the criteria applied by the Board to classify a Director as independent; once a year, it examines, on a case-by-case basis, the situation of each Director or each candidate for the duties of Director in light of the criteria applied and makes proposals to the Board of Directors.\n- 2. Concerning the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer (or the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as the case may be):\n- \u25a0 examine, as necessary and, in particular at the time of expiry of the term of office concerned, the renewal of the terms of office of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer (or the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as the case may be);\n- \u25a0 examine the changes in these duties and provide for solutions for their renewal, where applicable;\n- \u25a0 examine the succession plan for members of the Company Officers applicable in particular in the case of an unforeseen vacancy;\n- \u25a0 examine  periodically  developments  with  regard  to  the  Senior  Executive  Vice  Presidents,  hear  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  (or  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as the case may be) on the needs and the potential proposals for their replacement;\n- \u25a0 more generally, ensure that it is kept informed by the Chief Executive Officer (or the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as the case may be) of planned changes in Executive Management resources (and, in particular, the Executive Committee).\n\n## 3. Concerning governance:\n\n- \u25a0 examine, at the time of renewal of the terms of office of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer (or the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as the case may be) or when a request in that respect is made by Directors, notably within the framework of the evaluation of the Board, whether it is appropriate to continue to combine or separate these roles;\n- \u25a0 monitor the changes in the rules of Corporate Governance, in particular within the scope of the Code to which the Company refers and inform the Board of Directors of its conclusions; follow up on the application of the rules of Corporate Governance defined by the Board of Directors and make sure of the information given to the shareholders on this topic;\n- \u25a0 prepare the evaluation of the way the Board operates provided for by the internal regulations;\n- \u25a0 examine issues of ethics that the Audit and Accounts Committee, the Board of Directors or its Chairman may decide to refer to it;\n- \u25a0 ensure the proper functioning of the governance bodies and in particular the transmission of information requested by independent Directors;\n- \u25a0 assist,  at  their  request,  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  in  their  dealings  with  independent Directors, and be the instrument of dialogue aimed at preventing potential situations of conflict on the Board.'\n\nThe Committee can request the assistance of outside experts if necessary. The Company shall provide the Committee in such a case with the corresponding funding.\n\nThe conclusions of Committee meetings are presented by the Committee Chair for discussion and decision-making at the next Board of Directors' meeting.\n\n## The Appointments and Governance Committee's work in 2023\n\n## Concerning the composition of the Board of Directors, Committees and the 'Shareholder Relations' Working Group\n\nEach  year,  the  Committee  examines  the  compliance  of  the composition of the Board of Directors with the rules provided for in the internal regulations. The Committee wonders about the needs of the Board in terms of skills, including with regard to the various subjects  relating  to  CSR.  It  makes  recommendations  on  the changes in the composition of the Board of Directors that would be desirable in the short and medium term.\n\n- \u25a0 In 2023, the Committee:\n- -based  on  the  management  of  the  candidate  search procedure, carried out work which led it to recommend that the  Board  of  Directors  co-opt  a  Director  (Ms  Monica  de Virgiliis) to replace Ms Anette Bronder, who left her position, and to propose to the General Meeting of May 3, 2023 (i) the  appointment  of  four  new  Directors  (Ms  Catherine Guillouard, Ms Christina Law, Mr Alexis Perakis-Valat and Mr Michael H. Thaman) as well as (ii) the ratification of the co-option of Ms Monica de Virgiliis;",

The  Committee therefore  recommended  to  the  Board  of  Directors,  in  the context of the change in the composition of the Board, the appointment of (i) Ms Catherine Guillouard as Chairwoman of  the  Audit  and  Accounts  Committee,  (ii)  Mr  Bertrand Dumazy  as  a  member  of  the  Audit  and  accounts Committee and (iii) Ms Monica de Virgiliis as a member of the Environment and Society Committee.\n- \u25a0 For  2024,  the  Committee's  work  led  it  to  consider  that  the appointments  of  Directors  made  in  2023  completed  the requirements  in  terms  of  skills  at  this  stage  and  that  the number of Directors was also in line with the provisions of the internal  regulations  (which  stipulate  that  the  number  of members  is  in  principle  between  10  and  12,  excluding Directors  representing  the  employees).  As  a  result,  the Committee  did  not  look  for  new  profiles,  and  recommended that  the  Board  propose to the General Meeting of April 2024 the renewal of the terms of office of two independent Directors, Ms Kim Ann Mink and Ms Monica de Virgiliis, whose terms of office expire at the outcome of this Meeting.\n- \u25a0 Following  the  recent  appointment  of  several  independent Directors  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  of  the diversity policy for the Board, the Committee updated the draft individual Directors' skills matrix (which distinguishes between functional  and  sectoral  skills)  and  recommended  its  adoption to  the  Board  of  Directors.  This  matrix  can  be  found  on  page 135 of this document.\n\n## Concerning the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the management teams\n\n- \u25a0 The  Committee  reviewed,  as  it  does  each  year,  the  specific procedure and scenario envisaged in the event of replacement of  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Chief Executive Officer in an emergency situation.\n- \u25a0 The  Committee  examined  the  evolution  of  the  Group's management teams and talents, particularly in the context of future  managerial  succession  plans.  The  Chief  Executive Officer was involved in this work.\n- On  this  occasion,  the  Committee's  discussions  on  the succession  plan  for  the  new  Executive  Officer,  initiated  in September 2022, continued and the Committee also initiated discussions  on  the  succession  plan  for  the  Chairman  of  the Board of Directors.\n\n## Proposed amendments to the articles of association relating to the age limit applicable to a percentage of Directors and to the Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Committee  examined  practices  within  companies  regarding the  age  limit  of  Directors.  This  work  led  the  Committee  to recommend that the Board of Directors propose that the General Meeting modify the Company's articles of association  i.e. that the number  of  Directors  whose  age  exceeds 72  years (instead  of 70  years  in  the  current  wording  of  the  articles  of  association) should not exceed one third of the total number of Directors. It is also proposed to set the age limit for the Chairman of the Board of Directors at 72, instead of 70 in the current wording.\n\n## Other governance missions\n\nAs part of its governance missions, the Committee:\n\n- \u25a0 reviewed  the  business  continuity  plan  aimed  at  providing  a replacement in the event that any of its members are unable to participate in the General Meeting;\n- \u25a0 took  note  of  the  information  provided  by  the  Directors concerning their terms of office as Directors which are external to the Group;\n- \u25a0 discussed, as part of the review of the independence of Board members  of  the  personal  situation  of  each  member  of  the Board  of  Directors,  with  regard  to  the  independence  criteria\n\ndefined  in  the  internal  regulations  and  in  the  AFEP/MEDEF Code.  In  particular,  the  Committee  examined  the  existing business  relationships  between  the  Group  and  the  groups concerned  with  regard  to  each  Director.  Pursuant  to  the provisions of the AFEP/MEDEF Code, a table presenting the situation  of  each  Director  with  regard  to  each  independence criterion is provided on page 137;\n\n- \u25a0 reviewed  the  level  of  attendance  of  each  Director  at  the meetings of the Board of Directors and the Committees, which is shown in the table contained on page 138;\n- \u25a0 reviewed  the  recommendations  of  the  Report  of  the Haut Comit\u00e9 de gouvernement d'entreprise and the French financial market  authority  ( Autorit\u00e9  des  march\u00e9s  financiers )  Annual Report on Corporate Governance, published in November and December 2023, respectively, and made its recommendations concerning the practices followed by the Company;\n- \u25a0 examined the potential deviations of the Group's practices as compared  to  the  AFEP/MEDEF  Code  -  see  chart  on  page 154. No discrepancies were noted by the Committee;\n- \u25a0 updated the content of the simplified evaluation questionnaire for  the  Board  of  Directors  before  sending  it  to  the  Directors. For more details on the evaluation of the Board of Directors, see section 7 page 143;\n- \u25a0 reviewed  the  means  implemented  to  achieve  the  gender diversity  targets  on  the  Executive  Committee  in  2023,  the information relating to the way in which the Company tries to obtain a balanced representation of women and men on this Committee,  as  well  as  the  progress  made  in  2023  in connection  with  the  gender  diversity  targets  for  2025  among managers and professionals and the positions with the highest level  of  responsibility.  The  Committee  recommended  to  the Board  that  the  objectives  for  2026  concerning  the  Executive Committee  be  maintained,  namely  30%  women  by  March  1, 2026.  The  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee  also reviewed the results concerning the gender mix with regard to the 10% of positions which carry the most responsibility - for details, see Chapter 5 - pages 346, 347 and 373);\n- \u25a0 reviewed the training courses offered to Directors, particularly in terms of CSR, and recommended that the Board (i) approve the training of Mr Philippe Dubrulle, Director representing the employees, member  of  the  Environment  and  Society Committee, with a view to obtaining the certificate proposed by Sciences Po on the ecological transition and the transformation of organizations and (ii) carry out an update in 2023  to  the  CSR  training  followed  by  members  in  2022,  in particular to enable them to benefit from the latest regulatory changes concerning CSRD. (See details of training actions on page 142 and pages 142 and 143 for Directors representing the employees);\n- \u25a0 examined the draft of this section of the Universal Registration Document,  incorporating  part  of  the  Report  on  Corporate Governance  and  recommended  that  it  be  adopted  by  the Board of Directors.\n\n## 10.3.

Remuneration of Company Officers (including information mentioned in article L. 22-10-9 I of the French Commercial Code)\n\nThe remuneration  policy applicable  to  the  Chief  Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors in respect of their  terms  of  office  as  decided  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on February  15,  2023  and  presented  in  the  Company's  2022 Universal  Registration  Document  (pages  227  to  236)  was approved by the Ordinary General Meeting of May 3, 2023 (in resolutions  15  to  17).  This  General  Meeting  also  approved  the information relating to the remuneration of the Chairman and CEO (for the period from January 1, 2022 to May 31, 2022), the Chief Executive Officer (for the period from June 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022) and the Directors, presented in the Report on Corporate Governance  included in the 2022 Universal Registration Document (1) (14 th resolution).\n\nIn 2023, the structure and  principles applicable to the remuneration of Company Officers were in line with the previous fiscal year.\n\n## Concerning the Chief Executive Officer:\n\nIn accordance with the remuneration policy approved in 2023, the main  elements  of  the remuneration  of  the  Chief  Executive Officer are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 In accordance with a recurring practice at Air Liquide, the fixed remuneration represents  approximately 25% , the target variable remuneration approximately 35% and the long-term incentive  (hereafter  ' LTI ')  granted  approximately 40% of  the total  annual  remuneration.  Accordingly,  the  weight  of  the variable  remuneration  and  the  LTI,  which  are  subject  to performance conditions, represents approximately 75% of this total.\n\nThe collective  pension  insurance  contract  with  individual  and optional  subscription  and  the  termination  indemnity  are  also subject to performance conditions.\n\nThe  performance  conditions,  which  are  described  below, reflect  the Group's  ambition  to  achieve  profitable  growth over the long term by combining financial and extra-financial performance.\n\n## \u25a0 Variable remuneration:\n\n- -the variable part is expressed  as  a target variable remuneration  and  as  a maximum (as  a  %  of  the  fixed remuneration). For the quantifiable criteria, the target variable remuneration corresponds to an achievement of 100% of the target  objective  set  at  the  start  of  the  year.  The  target objectives fixed are demanding and are completely consistent with the trajectory of the ADVANCE company program,\n- -a greater  relative  weight  is  given  to  the  quantifiable criteria as compared to the qualitative criteria,\n- -a weighting  is  allocated  to  each  of  the  qualitative criteria;\n\n- \u25a0 LTI (long-term remuneration components):\n- -all the LTI (solely performance shares in 2023) granted to the  Executive  Officers  are  subject  to  performance conditions  calculated  over  a  period  of  three  years . Since  2020,  the  LTI  plans  have  included  a  performance condition  linked  to  the  Group's  climate  objectives  in addition to the ROCE and TSR criteria;\n- -limits  on  the  grants  to  Executive  Officers:  in  accordance with  the  authorizations  given  by  the  General  Meeting  on May 4, 2022, the number of performance shares granted to the Executive Officers may not exceed 0.1% of the share capital  and  the  number  of  stock  options,  if  any,  may  not exceed 0.2% of the share capital. The Board of Directors also  sets  annual  limits  for  the  grants,  which  remain  well below these sub-limits, it being noted that, as stated above, the  LTI  must  represent  approximately  40%  of  the  total target annual remuneration for the Executive Officer;\n- -the  other  principles  which  apply  to  the  LTI  are  also unchanged  ( proration  of  the  LTI in  the  event  of  the Executive Officer's departure during the period of assessment of the performance conditions, no allocation at the  time  of  departure,  the  level  of  requirement  of  the objectives, the rules which apply to the Executive Officers as described on pages 178 to 179).\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer does not receive any remuneration in his capacity as Director.\n\n## Concerning the Chairman of the Board of Directors:\n\nThe main components of the separate remuneration policy for the Chairman of the Board of Directors , approved in 2023, are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 the Chairman of the Board receives only fixed remuneration, to the  exclusion  of  any  variable  and  long-term  remuneration (notably LTI) and any exceptional remuneration;\n- \u25a0 the Chairman of the Board does not receive any remuneration as a Director.\n\nThe  elements  of  remuneration  for  Company  Officers,  as determined by the Board of Directors pursuant to the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting on May 3, 2023, are described below.\n\n(1)",

Fixed remuneration for 2023\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  remuneration  policy  established  by  the Board  of  Directors  on  February  15,  2023  and  approved  by  the General  Meeting  on  May  3,  2023,  the  fixed  remuneration  was determined  taking  into  account  the  level  of  responsibilities, experience in general management duties and market practices.\n\nAs announced, the 2023 annual fixed remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer amounts to 1,100,000 euros .\n\n## B.  Variable remuneration for 2023\n\nThe  principles  and  criteria  for  the  variable  remuneration  of  the Chief  Executive  Officer,  as  decided  upon  by  the  Board  of Directors  on  February  15,  2023,  were  approved  by  the  General Meeting on May 3, 2023 (15 th resolution).\n\nOn  the  proposal  of  the  Remuneration  Committee,  the  Board  of Directors on February 19, 2024 assessed the 2023 performance of the Executive Officer over the period.\n\nThe criteria for the variable remuneration, their weighting and their rate of achievement are detailed in the following summary table.\n\n## Quantifiable financial criteria\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  remuneration  policy  approved  by  the General Meeting of May 3, 2023, the variable portion for 2023 is based on two financial criteria: increase in recurring net earnings (excluding  exceptional  and  significant  transactions  which  do  not impact operating income recurring) excluding currency impact, per share  (hereinafter  ' recurring  EPS ')  and  comparable  growth  in consolidated revenue (excluding significant scope impact and the impact  of  currency  and  energy).  Details  of  these  criteria  are contained in the summary table below (page 176).\n\nThe increase in the recurring EPS criterion makes it possible to take  into  account  all  the  items  in  the  income  statement.  The criterion  of  an  increase  in  sales  reflects  the  momentum  of  the activity.  These  two  criteria,  growth  in  revenue  and  the  recurring EPS,  reflect  the  Group's  ambition  to  achieve  profitable  growth. Moreover, the achievement of the efficiency objectives contributes to the increase in the recurring EPS.\n\nFor  each  criterion,  the  Board  of  Directors  had  defined  a  target objective. The  target  objectives  were  exacting  and  were completely consistent with the trajectory of the main objectives of the ADVANCE company program.\n\nA formula adopted by the Board makes it possible to calculate the amount of the variable remuneration due (within a maximum limit) by taking into account, on the basis of the Consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year, the value achieved for the criterion as compared to the target objective set. Thus, in the event of a performance  that  exceeds  the  objective  set,  the  value  of  the variable part is adjusted upward within the maximum limit set for each criterion. In the event of a performance that is below the lower limit set for each objective, the variable remuneration corresponding  to  this  criterion  is  equal  to  zero . The achievement of each performance condition is assessed without any set-off between criteria.\n\nFurthermore, according to this formula, the rate of achievement of each objective is calculated linearly as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 an  initial  linear  gradient  between  the  lower  limit  of  the objective,  corresponding  to  the  trigger  threshold  (0%  below this  threshold)  and  the  target  (corresponding  to  a  100% achievement of the objective);\n- \u25a0 a  second  linear  gradient  between  the  target  (100%)  and  the maximum achievement level (125% of the target).\n\nThe  objectives  are  not  made  public  for  confidentiality  reasons. Nevertheless,  the  rate  of  achievement  of  each  objective  for  the variable  remuneration  (as  a  percentage  of  the  fixed  remuneration and as a percentage of the target variable remuneration allocated to that criterion) is communicated in the summary table on page 176.\n\nThe quantifiable criteria objectives were achieved at 94.7%.",

These are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 CSR:  ESG  objectives  published  by  the  Group  on Sustainability  Day  on  March  23,  2021  and  which  are  an integral part of the ADVANCE  strategic program (communicated on March 22, 2022):\n- -Safety  and  reliability:  continue  efforts  to  improve  safety (lost-time  accident  frequency  rate,  road  traffic  accidents and job-related accidents),\n- -Rollout  of  action  plans  linked  to  the  Group's  new sustainability objectives; Progress made on the various key indicators and alignment with the 2025 trajectory linked to these new objectives;\n- \u25a0 Organization/Human Resources (talent development, management succession plans, diversity policy);\n- \u25a0 Individual performance: this criterion responds to the Board of Directors' desire to keep a part of the variable remuneration subject to the Board's assessment, in order to take account of the unpredictability of the environment. This may be beneficial to  the  Executive  Officer,  if  the  Company  is  facing  an unfavorable environment which was not anticipated at the time the objectives were set, or disadvantageous if the environment ultimately turns out to be more favorable than anticipated.\n\nA  target  weighting  and  a  maximum  weighting  are  set  for  each qualitative criterion.\n\nFor  2023,  after  a  detailed  analysis  by  the  Remuneration Committee of the achievements for the fiscal year, the Board of Directors  noted  the  following  elements  concerning  each  of  the personal criteria:\n\n## CSR:\n\nPerformance was considered very good:\n\n## \u25a0 Safety and reliability\n\nIn 2023,  the  number  of  lost-time  accidents  for  Group employees remained closed to that for 2022 (128 compared to 123),  and  remains  at  a  historically  low  level  of  accidents compared to earlier years, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 (138  lost-time  accidents  for  Group  employees  in  2021; 158 in 2019). Based on the actual hours worked, the lost-time accident frequency rate for Group employees stood at 0.98 in 2023, which is close to the rate of 0.94 achieved in 2022. This is  the  first  time  that  the  Group  has  maintained  this  lost-time accident frequency rate for Group employees below 1 for two consecutive years: this confirms the durability of this positive performance. By way of comparison, the average value of this lost-time accident frequency rate for the gas industry in Europe stood  at  1.82  in  2022;  the  Air  Liquide  Group  is  therefore posting  a  significantly  better  performance.  A  very  significant reduction  can  be  observed  in  the  number  of  accidents involving  subcontractors  compared  to  2022  (-16%),  bringing the lost-time accident frequency rate for subcontractors down from  1.53  in  2022  to  1.25  in  2023,  which  represents  a substantial  improvement  and  the  best  performance  ever achieved by the Group for this category.\n\nOverall, 45 fewer people (whether employees or subcontractors) were injured (as a result of accidents, whether with or without lost time) in connection with Group activities in 2023,  by  comparison  with  2022,  which  reflects  the  tangible improvement in the Group's Safety performance.\n\nDespite  these  encouraging  results,  2023  was  nevertheless marked by the death of a driver (an Air Liquide employee in China)  in  a  road  traffic  accident,  leading  us,  as  in  2022,  to\n\nqualify the overall assessment of performance in this respect. For  the  record,  2022  had  been  marked  by  the  death  of  a subcontracted  driver.  Overall,  taking  into  consideration  third party  deaths  in  road  traffic  accidents  involving  an Air  Liquide vehicle  (which  have  been  systematically  monitored  since 2015), the number of deaths linked to the Group's activity for 2023 is the lowest recorded for the last seven years.\n\nDuring the course of 2023, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow systematically stressed  the  importance  of  safety  in  his  oral  presentations, notably  at  the  Group  Management  Meeting  in  October  2023 but also during each of his numerous site visits in Operations.\n\nIn  terms  of  Safety  action  plans,  he  is  building  on  previous programs,  stressing  the  need  to  remain  focused  in  order  to bring them to a successful conclusion, before launching other major  projects.  He  therefore  continued  to  supervise,  both personally  and  together  with  all  the  Executive  Committee members,  the  progress  of  the  IMS  (Industrial  Management System)  Streamlining  program,  the  revised  procedures  for which were fully rolled out to all Clusters in December 2023.\n\nMr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow also provides unwavering support for the roll-out of the Group's road Safety program that was launched several years ago, regularly stressing the importance of Road Safety in Air Liquide Operations, e.g., in the video of his New Year wishes circulated throughout the Group in January 2023.\n\nFinally,  in  addition  to  these  large-scale  programs,  an  action aimed at improving the understanding of the 24 major safety risks  was  initiated  in  March  2023,  in  order  to  enhance  the safety  culture  among Air  Liquide  employees:  videos  to  raise awareness of each of these risks are gradually being prepared and circulated throughout the Group; they explain the risk in an informative  manner  and  summarize  the  main  preventive measures.  This  initiative  has  received  strong  support  from Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow and will continue in 2024.\n\n- \u25a0 Rollout  of  action  plans  linked  to  the  Group's  new sustainability  objectives;  Progress  made  on  the  various key  indicators  and  alignment  with  the  2025  trajectory linked to these new objectives\n\nIn  line  with  the  Sustainability  objectives  announced  in March  2021  and  reiterated  in  the  ADVANCE  plan communicated in March 2022, Fran\u00e7ois Jackow continues to  place  sustainability  issues  at  the  heart  of  the  Group's development  strategy,  integrating  financial  and  extrafinancial  performance.  Considerable  progress  has  been made in 2023, regarding each of the commitments in the ACT program,  which  was  recognized  in  2023  by  the  fact that  rating  agencies  placed  the  Group  in  the  top  industry quartile.\n\n## -ACT for the Climate\n\nMr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's ambition is to make Air Liquide the leader in climate solutions.\n\nHe  actively  promotes  Air  Liquide's  ability  to  provide immediate,  tangible  solutions  to  the  major  challenge  of decarbonizing the industry, both internally and with external stakeholders.\n\nInternally,  this  is  reflected  in  governance  and  monitoring, with, for example, the introduction in 2023 of a committee set up to review strategic environmental issues, under his leadership.  The  processes  for  monitoring  and  managing CO2 emissions are fully implemented, and the Group's CO2 emissions  are  reported  and  consolidated  on  a  quarterly basis.  Alignment  with  these  budgets  and  the  impact  of activities  on  the  2025  Carbon  trajectory  are  analyzed  and presented to the Executive Committee on a regular basis.",

It  is  illustrated,  for example, by electrolyzer projects to supply customers with low-carbon  hydrogen  (the  inauguration  in  Berlin,  together with  Siemens  Energy  and  the  German  and  French authorities, the Normand'Hy project with TotalEnergies, and in  Japan  with  INPEX,  etc.).  Thanks  to  the  Cryocap TM technology  for  CO2  capture,  Air  Liquide  enables  these customers to decarbonize their production plants, such as the Holcim cement plant in Belgium. Concerning transport, a  JV  has  been  signed  with  TotalEnergies  to  develop  a network  of  hydrogen  stations  to  decarbonize  heavy  duty vehicles. Considerable progress has been made in terms of renewable energy with, for example, the signature of three PPAs in South Africa, and the first long-term PPA in China.\n\nIn  terms  of  reducing  CO2  emissions,  the  Group  therefore confirms its trajectory for reaching the inflection point by 2025.\n\nIn  addition  to  decarbonization,  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow's governance  and  his  sustainability  ambition  have  enabled the  Group  to  make  significant  progress  concerning  water management  and  biodiversity, and this work was recognized by the Act4nature initiative in 2023.\n\n## -ACT for Health:\n\nThe Group's objective in mature countries is to improve the quality  of  life  of  patients  living  at  home  with  chronic diseases.  In  this  sector,  the  Healthcare  teams  have continued  to  develop  personalized  care  plans  that  are tailored to comply with local regulations. The proportion of patients who  benefited  from  these  plans  increased significantly over the fiscal year.\n\nIn  low  and  middle-income  countries,  the  objective  is  to facilitate  access  to  medical  oxygen  for  an  increasing number  of  people.  Once  again,  thanks  to  new  projects, notably in Africa, the number of people benefiting from the 'Access Oxygen' program increased over the fiscal year.\n\n## -ACT for the whole of Society:\n\nAir  Liquide  is  continuing  its  efforts  to  build  on  the achievements  of  2022  in  terms  of  gender  diversity  within the population of Managers  and  Professionals,  the introduction  of  a  common  basis  of  care  coverage  and, finally, the Citizen at Work program.\n\nThe  programs  to  increase  gender  diversity  within  the population of Managers and Professionals continued, with a share of 32% of female employees, up compared to the results at the end of 2022 (31.5%), thus bringing it closer to the  target  for  2025,  even  if  a  slowdown  in  the  rate  of increase can be noted.\n\nOn the other hand, the generalization of a common basic social welfare cover for all employees and the roll-out of the Citizen at Work program, allowing employees to participate in social or societal projects during their working hours, saw considerable  progress  throughout  the  fiscal  year  and  is currently  ahead  of  the  2025  roadmap.  Roll-out  of  care coverage  at  the  end  of  2023  reached  78%,  compared  to 42% at the end of 2022. The objective of 100% cover for all Group  employees  by  2025  is  thus  maintained  and considered to be attainable. The Citizen at Work program has, in turn, been rolled out to 73% of Group employees by the end of 2023, compared to a roll-out of 43% at the end of 2022.\n\nThe action and progress described above confirm that, thanks to a structured and proactive implementation of the objectives set,  the  Group  is  well-positioned  with  regard  to  the  various pillars of the ACT commitments, in line with the 2025 trajectory for these new objectives.\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## Remuneration of L'Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\n## Organization and Human Resources:\n\nPerformance was considered very good:\n\nThis assessment is based on three elements: the implementation of  a  new  management  team,  Talent  management  and  an ambitious diversity and inclusion policy that delivers results.\n\n## \u25a0 Implementation of a new management team\n\nThe  implementation  on  September  1,  2023  of  a  new organization of the Executive Committee, in order to prepare for  the  future  by  benefiting  from  all  the  expertise  and experience  of  a  strong  team  with  complementary  skills,  has been  a  major  achievement.  This  new  division  of  roles  and responsibilities ensures that the experience of each of the 14 members is fully utilized.\n\nIn line with the Group's Talent management policy, and with a view to long term and continuity, this new division of roles and responsibilities  means  that  part  of  the  team  can  extend  the scope  of  their  remit  thanks  to  the  experience  brought  in  by some  of  its  members.  Six  members  of  the  Executive Committee have taken up new positions within the team as a whole  (Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Abrial,  Group  General  Secretary,  Mr Ronnie  Chalmers,  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the Asia-Pacific Hub,  Mr  Matthieu  Giard,  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the Americas  Hub,  Ms  Armelle  LEVIEUX,  Vice  President  of Innovation,  overseeing  the  Hydrogen  Energy  and  Electronics World  Business  Lines,  Ms  \u00c9milie  Mouren-Renouard,  Chief Executive Officer of the Europe Industries Hub and Ms Amelia Irion, Human  Resources  Vice  President).  These  new responsibilities  have  been  closely  monitored  by  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois Jackow in terms of the organization and quality of the transfer of roles and responsibilities and the setting of objectives.\n\n## \u25a0 Talent management\n\nThe  Group's  talent  development  policy  continued  as  before, with  regular  reviews  at  the  level  of  the  operational  clusters right  up  to  the  Executive  Committee.  Thanks  to  these exercises, a detailed review of the most promising international talents  has  been  carried  out  with  the  Appointments  and Governance  Committee  in  the  second  half  of  2023.  Special focus  was  placed  on  international  development  opportunities and development programs including executive mentoring.\n\nWith  this  in  mind,  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  promoted,  over  the course  of  the  year,  a  major  worldwide  reorganization  of  the Human Resources function, notably involving the roll-out of a unified  information  system  and  the  introduction  of  an  expert Talent  management  team  at  each  of  the  Hubs.  Talent identification and performance management have been greatly facilitated and improved as a result.\n\nFinally,  with  regard  to  Talent  management,  2023  marks  the 20 th anniversary  of  the  'Technical  Community  Leaders' program  which  identifies,  recognizes  and  develops  Group experts.  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  took  a  personal  interest  in  this event, which brought together over 2,000 employees from all over  the  world,  and  hosted  a  round  table  discussion  with inventors and fellow Group experts.\n\n## \u25a0 Promoting the diversity and inclusion policy\n\nThanks  to  his  frequent  travel  within  the  Group  and  his systematic meetings with the teams and Talents, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow has been able to actively promote the importance and value of an ambitious inclusion and diversity policy. By way of illustration,  he  was  personally  involved,  on  March  8,  as  the keynote speaker at a round table to mark the publication of the book  '120  Inspiring  Women'.  The  event  was  held  in  an auditorium  attended  by  European  employees  and  was broadcast  live  to  all  Group  entities,  thus  demonstrating  the Chief  Executive  Officer's  commitment  to  an  issue  that  is  key for Air Liquide. A stand was also set up at the Annual General Meeting to inform shareholders about this initiative.",

Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  has  expressed  a  firm commitment concerning the policy for the inclusion of disabled workers,  notably  at  the  various  events  organized  during Disability Week.\n\nFinally,  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  wishes  to  maintain  high-quality social dialog within the Group. By way of illustration, in France, he  called  a  meeting  with  the  French  Representative  Trade Unions,  on  March  17,  2023,  to  discuss  current  issues  and challenges  facing Air  Liquide  in  a  climate  of  mutual  trust.  In China, close to 4,000 employees took part in a virtual town hall to talk with Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow.\n\n## Individual performance:\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer's individual performance is considered remarkable. Despite the difficult macroeconomic and geopolitical  context  in  2023,  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  steered  the Group with  energy  and  agility,  which  enabled  him  to  distinguish himself  throughout  the  fiscal  year  (notably  marked  by  a substantial  increase  in  the  share  price,  demonstrating  the excellent  alignment  of  Group  strategy  with  the  expectations  of shareholders and stakeholders in an uncertain climate). In 2023, Fran\u00e7ois Jackow also prepared the Group for future transformations and challenges.\n\n## SUMMARY TABLE OF THE VARIABLE REMUNERATION FOR 2023\n\n|

Total fixed and variable remuneration for 2023 Changes\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the remuneration of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow as Chief Executive Officer is slightly  down compared to the 2022 remuneration on an annualized basis.\n\n## D.  Other components of annual remuneration\n\nBy  decision  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  February  15,  2023, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow benefits from the components of remuneration defined below, which are included in the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 3, 2023 (15 th resolution), in line with the 2022 remuneration policy:\n\n## Death and disability benefits and healthcare cost plan\n\nIn  2023,  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  continued  to  benefit  from  the supplementary 'incapacity, invalidity, death' benefits plan, unified as  from  January  1,  2015,  covering  all  personnel  and  corporate officers  who  are  duly  authorized  to  benefit  from  such  scheme. Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow also benefited from the healthcare cost plan covering all employees.\n\nThe  supplementary  'incapacity,  invalidity,  death'  benefits  plan provides in particular for:\n\n- \u25a0 the grant to the beneficiaries:\n- -of additional daily indemnities in the event of incapacity and a  disability  annuity  set,  all  benefits  combined,  at  a maximum annual amount of 519 322 euros, and\n- -of a death benefit, the maximum amount of which is set at 120  times  the  PASS  (annual  social  security  limit)  in  the event of an accident.\n\nThe insurance contract entered into with the insurer specifies the limits of the incapacity/disability and death benefits for the same insured party;\n\n- \u25a0 the  payment  in  full,  by  the  Company,  of  the  contributions calculated  as  a  percentage  of  the  Reference  Remuneration which is capped at:\n- -16 times the PASS for the incapacity and disability cover, and\n- -24 times the PASS for the death cover.\n\nThe contribution rate for 2023 amounts to 1.28% of the Reference Remuneration up to 16 PASS and to 1.03% between 16 and 24 PASS.  These  contributions  are  deductible  from  the  corporate income tax base, are subject to the social levy at a rate of 8%, and  are  excluded  from  the  basis  for  assessment  of  the  social security  contributions,  within  the  limit  of  an  amount  equal  to  the sum of 6% of the PASS and 1.5% of the remuneration, taken into account within the limit of 12% of the PASS.\n\nThe contributions paid by L'Air Liquide S.A. in 2023 for the benefit of  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  amounted  to  12,634  euros  in  respect  of the  life  insurance  scheme  and  414  euros  in  respect  of  the healthcare  cost  plan  (i.e.  a  total  of  13,048  euros)  and  are  also indicated in the notes to Table 2 (see page 173).\n\n## Benefits in kind\n\nThe benefits in kind paid to the Executive Officer in 2023 include the  use  of  a  company  car  and  contributions  in  respect  of  the social security scheme for company directors.\n\n## 2.1.2.  LTI: OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES\n\n## A.  2023 performance share plan (plan dated September 28, 2023)\n\n## 1. Principles of grant for 2023\n\nFor the Chief Executive Officer, the grant for 2023 forms part of the 2023 remuneration policy defined by the Board of Directors on February  15,  2023  and  approved  by  the  General  Meeting  on May 3, 2023.\n\nThe  allocation  of  LTI  to  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  in  2023  in  his capacity as Chief Executive Officer represents an IFRS valuation of 1,649,284 euros.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  of  September  2023  decided,  in accordance  with  the  general  market  trend  and  in  line  with  its practice  since  2019,  to  grant  performance  shares  only  to  all beneficiaries, in order to simplify and standardize the LTI scheme.\n\n## 2. Performance conditions of the 2023 plans\n\nAll  the  performance  shares  granted  to  any  beneficiary  are subject to performance conditions which are calculated over three years. The performance conditions were set by the Board of  Directors  at  the  start  of  the  year,  at  the  February  meeting,  in order to comply with a reference period of three full years.\n\nFor  reasons  of  confidentiality,  the  exact  objectives  set  for each performance condition will be made public ex post, at the end of the Board of Directors' meeting at the time when the financial statements are adopted for the 2025 fiscal year. The  results  achieved,  the  rate  of  achievement  of  the performance conditions and the percentage of performance shares  vested  will  also  be  published  at  the  end  of  this meeting. The  percentage  of  performance  shares  definitively awarded may in no event exceed 100% of the initial grant. The achievement  of  each  performance  condition  will  be  assessed without any set-off between criteria.\n\nIn  keeping  with  the  Group's  responsible  growth  approach,  the 2023 performance share plans incorporate, as they did in 2022, a  performance  condition  linked  to  the  Group's  climate objectives.\n\nAccordingly,  the  number  of  performance  shares  definitively awarded pursuant to the 2023 Plans will depend:\n\n- (i) for 50% of the performance shares granted ,  on  the  rate  of achievement  of  a  target,  set  by  the  Board,  comprising  the after-tax  Return  on  Capital  Employed  (recurring ROCE ) (4) recorded at the end of the 2025 fiscal year.\n- At the objective set, the grant is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis to a lower limit below which there will be no award. This lower limit corresponds to a ROCE level which is 200 basis points less than the objective set, which provides a  degree  of  flexibility,  notably  making  it  possible  to  take advantage of external growth opportunities.\n\nThe  objective  was  set  in  line  with  the  ROCE  objective announced by the Company, i.e. more than 10% at the end of 2025.\n\n## (ii) for 40% of the performance shares granted:\n\n- -for  50%  of  the  performance  shares  referred  to  in  subparagraph (ii): on an objective of Total Shareholder Return set  by  the  Board,  defined  as  the  average  annual  growth rate  of  an  investment  in  Air  Liquide  shares,  dividends reinvested,  for  the  2023,  2024  and  2025  fiscal  years ( 'AL  TSR' ).  The  objective  of  an  absolute  TSR  is  set  in accordance with historic performances. At the objective set, the  grant  is  100%  and  then  decreases  on  a  straight-line basis to a lower limit below which there will be no award,",

Any  grant  for  a  performance  lower  than  the average of the CAC 40 TSR is impossible.\n\nThe  TSR  criteria  make  it  possible  to  align  the  Company's performance with Shareholders' expectation of steady profits;\n\n- (iii) for 10% of the performance shares granted, on the change in  the  Group's  absolute  CO2  emissions over  the  period 2023-2025  in  line  with  objective  for  a  shift  in  2025  in\n\naccordance  with  the  climate  objectives  announced  by  the Group on March 23, 2021 (ACT for a sustainable future), as follows:\n\nComparison of the Air Liquide Group's CO2 emissions for the year 2025, expressed in millions of metric tonnes, with those same  emissions  for  the  year  2022,  the  2022  basis  of comparison  being  adjusted  to  take  account  of  any  possible perimeter  impacts  (the  possible  takeover  of  existing  units  at the  Group's  customers  or  companies,  asset  or  company disposals  over  the  2023-2025  period),  on  a  12-month  proforma basis, in line with the method used to monitor the carbon trajectory as communicated by the Group.\n\nFor  the  purposes  hereof,  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions include  direct  emissions  (Scope  1)  and  indirect  emissions (Scope  2).  These  emissions  are  accounted  for  as  'market based' (5) .\n\n## DIAGRAM SHOWING THE PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO THE PERFORMANCE SHARES IN 2023\n\n## 40% TSR over 3 years\n\n50% B TSR (AL TSR/CAC 40 TSR)\n\n## 50% ROCE\n\n50% AL TSR\n\n## 3. Rules applicable to Executive Officers\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  remuneration  policy,  the  grant  to  the Executive Officer is examined by the Remuneration Committee at the  same  time  as  the  allocation  to  Group  employees  and  is decided by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  grant  of  performance  shares  was  examined  in  light  of  the total  amount  of  the  Executive  Officer's  annual  remuneration, taking into account several external market surveys and ensuring that the interests of the Shareholders are respected.\n\nBefore the grant, it was verified that the conditions provided for in article L. 22-10-60 of the French Commercial Code, which aims at involving  all  staff  in  France  in  the  Company's  performance,  are satisfied. Therefore, in 2023, over 98% of all the employees in the Company and in the Group's French entities are covered by an incentive plan or a special or voluntary profit-sharing plan.\n\n## Limits on the grants to Executive Officers\n\nWithin  the  scope  of  the  sub-limits  authorized  by  the  General Meeting for 38 months, the Board of Directors sets lower annual limits for the grants to the Executive Officers, expressed (i) as a percentage  of  the  share  capital  and  (ii)  as  a  multiple  of  their remuneration,  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the AFEP/MEDEF Code.\n\nThe limits set by the Board of Directors for 2023 are identical to those for 2022 and are as follows (no subscription option having been attributed in 2023):\n\n- (i) the total number of performance shares granted in 2023 to the Executive  Officer  cannot  give  rise  to  a  number  of  shares exceeding  0.012%  of  the  share  capital  (it  being  understood that an allocation sub-limit of 0.1% of the share capital for 38 months was set by the General Meeting on May 4, 2022);\n\n10% CO2 emissions reduction\n\n-\n\n- (ii)  the  total  aggregate  IFRS  value  of  the  performance  shares granted to the Executive Officer cannot exceed approximately 1.5  times  the  amount  of  the  Executive  Officer's  maximum gross  annual  remuneration  (fixed  +  variable  maximum),  it being  noted  that  the  performance  shares  granted  represent approximately 40% of the total target annual remuneration.\n\n## Maintaining the proration principle\n\nPursuant to the decision made by the Board on February 15, 2023 and the policy approved by the General Meeting on May 3, 2023, the 2023 grant of LTI to the Executive Officer remains subject to the principle of a pro-rata calculation.\n\nIn practice, if the Executive Officer leaves the Group for a reason other  than  his  resignation  or  removal  from  office  for  serious cause (6) , the total allocation rate (after applying the performance conditions)  would  be  reduced  pro  rata  for  the  duration  of  actual presence  of  the  Executive  Officer  within  the  Group  during  the period of assessment of the performance criteria. Furthermore, no grant  is  made  to  the  Executive  Officer  at  the  time  of  this departure, in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code.\n\nThe Executive Officer will remain subject to all the provisions of the plans and, more specifically, those relating to the duration of the vesting, lock-up and holding periods in respect of the shares and stock options granted.\n\n## Shareholding and share ownership obligations\n\n## Shareholding obligation pursuant to the French Commercial Code\n\nOn  the  recommendation  of  the  Remuneration  Committee,  the Board defined the shareholding obligations resulting from articles L.  225-185  and  L.  225-197-1  of  the  French  Commercial  Code applicable  to  the  shares  resulting  from  the  exercise  of  stock options and performance shares, respectively, as from September 28, 2015, as follows:\n\nFor  each  stock  option/performance  share  plan  granted  to Company  Officers  with  effect  from  September  28,  2015,  the Company  Officers  shall  hold,  in  registered  form,  until  the termination  of  their  duties,  a  minimum  quantity  of  shares",

In 2023, the Board of Directors decided to maintain this rule in identical form.\n\nThese  lock-up  obligations  have  been  applicable  to  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois Jackow in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer since the 2022 performance share plan.\n\n## Additional share ownership obligation - Recommendation made by the AFEP/MEDEF Code\n\nThe Board of Directors' meeting of February 15, 2022 defined, as an extension of the internal rule defined by the Board since 2008, the  shareholding  rule  according  to  which  the  Company  Officers must  hold,  in  a  registered  share  account,  a  number  of  shares equivalent  to  twice  his  gross  annual  fixed  remuneration  for  the Chief Executive Officer or the Chairman of the Board of Directors and  one  time  the  gross  annual  fixed  remuneration  for  a  Senior Executive Vice President. This obligation will remain in force until it is exceeded by the effect of the rules resulting from the French Commercial Code. The number of shares required to be held is assessed as of January 1 and July 1 of each year.\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## Remuneration of L'Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\nRecommendations  encouraging  the  ownership  of  a  minimum number  of  Company  shares  equivalent  to  0.5  times  their  gross fixed annual remuneration, have also been made to members of the Executive Committee since 2009.\n\n## Other rules applicable to the Company Officers\n\n- \u25a0 Restriction  on  the  exercise  of  stock  options  and  the  sale  of performance shares during the 'black-out periods' prior to the publication  of  the  financial  statements.  These  abstention periods open 30 days before the announcement of the annual and half-year consolidated results and 15 calendar days prior to  the  publication  of  the  quarterly  financial  information.  They end  on  the  date  of  publication  of  the  information  at  close  of business.\n- \u25a0 Commitment not to carry out hedging transactions with regard to the risk concerning the performance shares awarded/shares arising  from  the  exercise  of  options,  throughout  the  length  of their term of office.\n- B.  Grants to the Chief Executive Officer within the scope of the September 28, 2023 performance share plans\n\n## Plan Regulations\n\nThe  grant  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  is  governed  by  the September  28,  2023  'France'  performance  share  plan  which applies to all the beneficiaries in France. This plan contains:\n\n- \u25a0 a three-year vesting period;\n- \u25a0 followed by a two-year holding period during which the shares cannot be sold.\n\nThe  application  of  this  rule  for  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  will  be assessed within four years of his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, i.e. from July 1, 2026.\n\n## DIAGRAM OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARE MECHANISM - 2023 PLAN (FRANCE)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nContinued presence in the Company is a condition under the plan in order to qualify for performance shares at the end of the vesting period, the loss of rights for the Chief Executive Officer occurring in  the  event  of  resignation  or  removal  from  office  for  serious cause.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer is also subject to additional conditions as described above.\n\n## Volume\n\nThe table below shows the number and value of the performance shares awarded to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow on September 28, 2023 in compliance with the authorization given to the Board of Directors by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022 (21 st resolution).",

Recording of the achievement of the performance conditions under the September 29, 2021 performance share plans (8)\n\nOn the basis of the financial statements for the 2023 fiscal year submitted  for  the  approval  of  the  General  Meeting  of  April  30, 2024, the Board of Directors on February 19, 2024, recorded the rate of achievement of the performance conditions, which apply to the whole of the performance shares awarded to any beneficiary and were determined at the time of the grant of the September 29, 2021 performance share plans.\n\nAs in 2020, the Board decided to grant only performance shares to any beneficiaries, for reasons of simplification and homogenization.\n\nThe 2021 annual plans provided that the number of performance shares  definitively  awarded  would  depend  on  the  rate  of achievement of the following objectives:\n\n- (i)  for  50%  of  the  performance  shares  granted,  on  the  rate  of achievement  of  a  target,  set  by  the  Board,  comprising  the after-tax Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) recorded at the end of the 2023 fiscal year.\n- At the objective set, the grant is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis to a lower limit below which there will be no award. This lower limit corresponds to a ROCE level which is 200 basis points less than the objective set, which provides a  degree  of  flexibility,  notably  making  it  possible  to  take advantage of external growth opportunities.\n\nThe objective was set in line with the ROCE announced by the Company of over 10% by the end of 2023.\n\nThe  level  of  recurring  ROCE  for  the  aforementioned  period was 10.60%, i.e. an objective achieved at 100%;\n\n- (ii) for 40% of the performance shares granted:\n- -for  50%  of  the  performance  shares  referred  to  in  subparagraph  (ii):  an  objective  of  Total  Shareholder  Return ('AL TSR') set by the Board, defined as the average annual growth  rate  of  an  investment  in  Air  Liquide  shares, dividends  reinvested,  for  the  2021,  2022  and  2023  fiscal years. At the objective of AL TSR \u2265 6%, the grant of shares is  100%,  and  then  decreases  on  a  straight-line  basis  to +2%.\n- This growth, over the aforementioned period, amounted to 13.65% per year, i.e. a target achieved at 100%,\n- -for  50%  of  the  performance  shares  referred  to  in  subparagraph (ii): the rate of Total Shareholder Return from an investment  in  Air  Liquide  shares,  dividends  reinvested  source: Bloomberg ('B TSR'), as compared to the CAC 40 TSR  index,  dividends  reinvested  (source:  Bloomberg)  for the 2021, 2022 and 2023 fiscal years.\n- The applicable formula provided that the rate of achievement of this performance condition was (i) 0% if the three-year  average  Air  Liquide  TSR  was  lower  than  the average CAC 40 TSR, (ii) 50% if the average Air Liquide TSR was equal to the average CAC 40 TSR, and (iii) 100% if the average Air Liquide TSR was at least 2% higher than the  average  CAC  40  TSR  on  the  basis  of  a  straight-line change.  Any  grant  for  a  performance  lower  than  the average of the CAC 40 TSR was impossible.\n\nThe rate of return for Air Liquide over the aforementioned period is 16.21%. That of the CAC 40 index over the same period  is  15.09%.  This  gives  the  difference  between  the average rate of return for Air Liquide and the average rate of  return  for  the  CAC  40  as  1.12%,  i.e.  an  objective achieved at 78.06%;\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n## Remuneration of L'Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\n- (iii)  for  10%  of  the  performance shares granted, the reduction in Air  Liquide's  carbon  intensity,  defined  as  the  following  ratio, recorded  as  at  December  31,  2023:  Greenhouse  gas emissions  of  the Air  Liquide  Group  for  the  year  2023  in  kgequivalent CO \u2082 /2023 EBITDA (calculated at constant exchange  rates  on  the  basis  of  the  2015  foreign  exchange rates)  expressed  in  euros (9) .  For  the  purposes  hereof,  the greenhouse gas emissions include direct emissions (Scope 1) and  indirect  emissions  (Scope  2).  These  emissions  are accounted for as 'location based'.\n\nThe  objective  was  determined  within  the  trajectory  of  the Group's  Climate  Objectives  announced  at  the  end  of  2018 which  aim  to  reduce  the  carbon  intensity  by  -30%  between 2015 and 2025.\n\nThe  achievement  rate  was  set  at  0%  for  carbon  intensity above 4.7, 50% for carbon intensity equal to 4.6 and 100% for carbon intensity  less  than  or  equal  to  4.5,  based  on  a  linear progression from 0% to 100% between each of those bounds.\n\nThe ratio recorded as at December 31, 2023 was 3.88, i.e. a target achieved at 100%.\n\nConsequently,  the  Board  of  Directors  recorded  that  the  rate  of achievement of the performance conditions for the September 29, 2021 performance share plans amounts to 95.61%.\n\n## 2.1.3.  LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS\n\n## A.  Company pension and similar benefit obligations\n\nIn accordance with the remuneration policy decided by the Board of  Directors  of  February  15,  2023  and  approved  by  the  General Meeting  of  May  3,  2023  (15 th resolution),  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow benefits,  in  addition  to  the  mandatory  basic  and  supplementary pension plans (Agirc-Arrco) to which he is, or has been, affiliated, from various supplementary pension plans set up by L'Air Liquide S.A.\n\n## 1. Mandatory company retirement savings plan (PERO)\n\nMr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  continued  to  benefit  in  2023  from  the supplementary defined-contribution pension plan (from which he benefited  previously  as  an  employee,  then  as  Chief  Executive Officer from his appointment in 2022) applicable to all employees and Company Officers duly authorized to benefit from that plan.\n\nThis  plan  is  financed  by  contributions  paid  equally  by  the employer and the beneficiary on the portion of remuneration not exceeding eight times the annual social security limit (PASS).\n\nThese contributions  are  assessed  on  bracket  1  (e.g.  bracket A) (the portion of remuneration that is less than one PASS) at a rate of  2.30%,  and  on  bracket  2  (e.g.  brackets  B  and  C)  (those portions of remuneration amounting, respectively, to between one PASS  and  eight  times  the  PASS)  at  a  rate  of  6.45%,  and  are distributed in the following manner: 50% borne by the Company and 50% borne by the beneficiary.\n\nFurthermore, they are deductible from the corporate income tax base, are subject to the social levy at the rate of 16%, and are excluded  from  the  basis  for  assessment  of  the  social  security contributions,  within  the  limit  of  the  higher  of  the  following  two values:  5%  of  the  PASS  or  5%  of  the  remuneration  taken  into account within the limit of five times the PASS.\n\nFor information purposes, the contributions paid by the Company in 2023  to  the  third  party  responsible  for  managing  the aforementioned supplementary defined contribution pension plan, in favor of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow, amounted to 10,437 euros.",

This amount takes into account the contributions paid by the Company for the benefit of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow in his capacity as an employee and then as Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## 2. 'Senior executive' defined contribution pension plan\n\nPursuant  to  articles  L.  911-1  and  L.  911-2  of  the  French  Social Security  Code,  and  in  accordance  with  article  L.  242-1, paragraphs 6 and 7 of the same Code, L'Air Liquide S.A. set up a defined  contribution  pension  plan  for  the  benefit  of  the  senior executives,  defined  by  reference  to  a  collective  bargaining agreement coefficient, and of corporate officers who have at least one year's length of service.\n\nIn  2023,  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  continued  to  benefit  from  this defined  contribution  pension  plan  (from  which  he  had  already benefited as a senior executive, then as Chief Executive Officer since 2022).\n\nFor information purposes, the contributions paid by the Company in 2023 to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow amounted to 9,502 euros.\n\nMr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow's  pension  entitlements  under  this  defined contribution plan implemented for the benefit of senior executives:\n\n- \u25a0 may be applied for, at the earliest,  when he has claimed his pension entitlements under the French general social security scheme;\n- \u25a0 are  financed  by  annual  contributions  paid  in  their  entirety  by the  Company.  These  contributions  were  set  at  2.7%  of  the portion  of  remuneration  that  is  lower  than  eight  times  the PASS.  Furthermore,  they  are  subject  to  the  same  tax  and social security treatment as those paid under the PERO set up for the benefit of all the staff (see above);\n- \u25a0 are estimated, as at December 31, 2023 at 27,081 euros gross per year.\n\n## 3. Collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription\n\n(known as 'article 82 of the French Tax Code') for the portion of his Reference  remuneration  [fixed  portion  +  target  variable  portion] exceeding eight PASS. This collective pension insurance contract replaces the supplementary pension plan applicable under certain conditions  to  the  Group's  senior  executives  but  not  applicable  to corporate officers,  and  from  which  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  benefited prior to his appointment as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nApplication of this mechanism to the Chief Executive Officer was determined  taking  into  account  the  overall  balance  of  his remuneration  and  the  market  conditions,  and  for  the  Company represents,  for  the  same  efficiency  for  the  beneficiary,  a  31% lower  cost  to  the  Company  than  that  which  would  result  from implementing  a  new  supplementary  pension  plan  with  defined vested  benefits  under  article  L.  137-11-2  of  the  French  Social Security Code.\n\nIn this scheme, the amount paid by the Company is split between a payment to the insurer and a payment to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow intended to cover the social security contributions and taxes due on  the  payments  made  to  the  insurer.  This  amount  is  paid  in arrears  every  year  after  recording  the  performance  conditions associated with this pension plan, for the period until the end of the executive office. These contributions are deductible from the corporate  income  tax  base  and  are  subject  to  social  security contributions.\n\nMr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow cannot apply for the entitlements under this pension insurance contract in the form of capital and/or life annuity before the age at which he becomes entitled to claim his pension entitlements under the French general social security scheme.\n\nThis  supplementary  pension  plan  for  the  fraction  of  remuneration exceeding  8  PASS  is  entirely  subject  to  performance  conditions. The gross annual amount of payments is approximately 14.10% of the target annual fixed and variable remuneration for 2023, subject to the achievement of performance conditions: the total amount to be paid in respect of a fiscal year depends on the average annual difference  (measured  on  each  fiscal  year)  between  the  after-tax Return on Capital Employed (ROCE (10) ) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (measured on the basis of the book value of  equity),  calculated  (on  the  basis  of  the  consolidated  financial statements  certified  and  approved  by  the  General  Meeting)  over the last three fiscal years preceding the said fiscal year.\n\nIn 2023, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow continued to benefit from a collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription\n\nThe performance coefficient applied to the nominal amount pursuant to the collective pension insurance contract will be determined as shown in the  table  below,  with  a  growth  of  the  increase  per  linear  segments  between  each  of  the  thresholds  between  100  bps  and 300 bps inclusive:\n\n| Average of the annual gaps (ROCE - WACC) over three years in bps  (a)   | Performance coefficient applied to  the nominal amount   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u2265 300                                                                   | 100 %                                                    |\n| 250                                                                     | 6 6  %                                                   |\n| 200                                                                     | 5 0  %                                                   |\n| 100                                                                     | 2 5  %                                                   |\n| < 100                                                                   | 0  %                                                     |\n\nCompliance with the conditions set forth above is verified on an annual basis, before the Ordinary General Meeting convened to approve the financial statements for the last completed fiscal year, by the Board of Directors.\n\nIn respect of 2023, the Board of Directors on February 19, 2024 took  note  of  the  100%  achievement  of  the  performance conditions. Accordingly, the amount to be paid in 2024 in respect of fiscal year 2023 under the pension scheme with individual and\n\noptional subscription, will amount overall to 341,231 euros (split, in  accordance  with  the  remuneration  policy  approved  by  the General Meeting of May 3, 2023, between a payment of 170,615 euros (gross) to the insurer in the form of an insurance premium, and a payment of 170,615 euros (gross) to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow intended to cover the social security contributions and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer).",

Commitments relating to termination of duties\n\nThe commitments related to the termination of duties granted to Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  since  his  appointment  as  Chief  Executive Officer  on  June  1,  2022,  continued  in  the  2023  fiscal  year.  The mechanisms described below were included in the remuneration policy  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  decided  by  the  Board  of Directors  on  February  15,  2023  and  approved  by  the  General Meeting of May 3, 2023 (15 th resolution).\n\n## 1. Termination indemnity\n\nMr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow, who unilaterally terminated his employment contract as of his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, benefits from  a  termination  indemnity,  subject  to  very  strict  triggering conditions.\n\nThe  main  terms  of  the  termination  indemnity  applicable  to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 only the cases of forced departure of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow from his  term  of  office  as  Chief  Executive  Officer  (removal  from office, request for resignation) related to a change of strategy or  a  change  in  control  (in  the  latter  case,  the  termination indemnity is due, if the departure occurs within six months of the change of control) may give rise to an indemnity;\n- \u25a0 the amount of the indemnity in any of these cases is set at 24 months  of  annual  gross  fixed  and  variable  remuneration actually  paid  (24  months  of  fixed  remuneration  +  last  two annual  variable  remuneration  amounts  actually  paid)  on  the date  of  termination  of  his  duties  (subject  to  the  exceptions described below and in paragraph B.2). As an exception to this rule, in the event of departure during the course of the 2023 or 2024  fiscal  years,  for  the  calculation  of  the  indemnity  of  24 months of fixed and variable remuneration, the following will be taken into account: the target variable remuneration awarded in  the  absence  of  variable  remuneration  paid  in  respect  of  a\n\n## Remuneration of L'Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\n- fiscal  year  (for  each  fiscal  year  concerned),  and  the  annual fixed  remuneration  of  the  ongoing  fiscal  year  and  that  of  the previous fiscal year;\n- \u25a0 the  amount  of  the  indemnity  due  decreases  gradually  as Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow, in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer, approaches the age limit defined in the Company's articles of association;  in  the  event  of  a  forced  departure  in  the  24 months preceding the date of departure due to the age limit set by the articles of association, the amount of the indemnity due will  be  capped  at  the  number  of  months'  gross  remuneration separating the date of forced departure from the date when he reaches  such  age  limit;  in  any  event,  no  indemnity  shall  be paid should the beneficiary claim his pension entitlements on the date of his forced departure;\n- \u25a0 the  right  to  payment  of  the  indemnity  is  subject  to  the achievement of the performance conditions, the proportion of the  indemnity  due  decreasing  depending  on  the  rate  of achievement of such conditions (see below for details of the performance conditions).\n\n## Performance conditions applicable to the termination indemnity\n\nThe payment of the termination indemnity concerning Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow is subject to compliance, duly acknowledged by the Board of Directors at the time of or subsequent to the termination of his duties,  with  conditions  related  to  the  beneficiary's  performance assessed  in  light  of  the  Company's  performance,  defined  as  of today as follows:\n\nEntitlement  to  the  indemnity  referred  to  above  shall  depend  on, and the amount of the indemnity paid will be adjusted on the basis of, the average of the annual gap (measured on each fiscal year) between the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (measured on the basis of the book value of equity), calculated (on the basis of the certified  consolidated  financial  statements,  approved  by  the General Meeting) with respect to the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which the departure occurs.\n\nGiven the fundamental importance, in the highly capital-intensive industrial  gas  industry,  of  the  management  and  control  of investment processes, this gap makes it possible to measure the regular  creation  of  value  over  the  three  years  prior  to  the departure.\n\nThe proportion of the indemnity due will be established as indicated in the table below, with an increase in the indemnity by straight-line segments between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive:\n\n| Average of the annual gaps (ROCE - WACC) over three years in bps  (a)   | Proportion of indemnity due   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| \u2265 300                                                                   | 100%                          |\n| 250                                                                     | 66%                           |\n| 200                                                                     | 50%                           |\n| 100                                                                     | 25%                           |\n| < 100                                                                   | 0%                            |\n\n(a) bps: basis points.\n\n## 2. Indemnity relating to a non-competition commitment\n\nAs Chief  Executive  Officer,  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  benefits  from  a non-competition indemnity in exchange for his commitment not to serve, directly or indirectly, a business competing with that of the Group, for a period of two years from the date of termination of his term of office.\n\nThis  mechanism  was  put  in  place  in  2022,  when  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois Jackow was appointed Chief Executive Officer, in order to protect the Company's legitimate interests.\n\nThe amount of this indemnity, payable monthly, would be equal to one  year  of  gross  annual  fixed  and  variable  remuneration received by the Chief Executive Officer (excluding sums received\n\nin  respect  of  long-term  variable  remuneration), wherein  the aggregated  termination  indemnity  and  non-competition indemnity are capped at 24 months of annual gross fixed and variable remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer on the date of termination of his term of office.\n\nPayment of the non-competition indemnity shall not apply from the moment  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  exercises his pension entitlements. In any event, no indemnity shall be paid beyond age 65.\n\nThe Board of Directors reserves the right to fully or partially waive the non-competition commitment upon the departure of the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  in  which  case  no  indemnity  will  be owed.",

Fixed remuneration\n\nThe  fixed  remuneration  takes  into  account  in  particular  the specific  role  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  in  the context of managerial succession and the missions that the Board of Directors wished to entrust to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier for the duration of the transition in order to benefit from his experience, in-depth knowledge of the Group and its businesses, its Shareholders and stakeholders and its strategic challenges.\n\nIn accordance with the policy approved by the General Meeting of May 3, 2023, the amount of the 2023 annual fixed remuneration of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier amounts to 800,000 euros.\n\n## 2.2.2.  Other components of annual remuneration\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier exercised his rights to a mandatory pension as from the end of his duties as Chief Executive Officer in 2022, as well as his vested rights under the various supplementary pension schemes  set  up  within  the  Company.  Since  the  final  residual payments made in 2023 under the collective  pension  insurance contract  with  individual  and  optional  subscription  and  the  life insurance  contract,  which  had  been  set  up  for  the  benefit  of Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  in  his  capacity  as  Chairman  and  CEO  (see Table  1),  no  further  amounts  are  owed  by  the  Company  in  this respect to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier.\n\n## Death and disability benefits plan\n\nIn 2023,  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  continued  to  benefit  from  the supplementary 'incapacity, invalidity, death' benefits plan, unified as  from  January  1,  2015,  covering  all  personnel  and  corporate officers  who  are  duly  authorized  to  benefit  from  such  scheme, solely  for  the  death  benefit  component.  This  system  was incorporated into the 2023 remuneration policy for the Chairman of the Board of Directors by decision of the Board of Directors of February 15, 2023, which was approved by the General Meeting of May 3, 2023 (16 th resolution).\n\nThis unified pension plan provides, in particular, for life insurance:\n\n- \u25a0 the granting to beneficiaries of a death benefit, the maximum amount of which is set at 120 times the PASS in the event of an accident.\n\nThe life insurance contract entered into with the insurer specifies the limits of the benefits for the same insured party:\n\n- \u25a0 full coverage by the Company of contributions calculated as a percentage of the Reference Remuneration, which is capped at 24 times the PASS for the death benefit.\n\nThe contribution rate for 2023 amounts to 1.28% of the Reference Remuneration up to 16 PASS and to 1.03% between 16 and 24 PASS.  These  contributions  are  deductible  from  the  corporate income tax base, are subject to the social levy at a rate of 8%, and  are  excluded  from  the  basis  for  assessment  of  the  social security  contributions,  within  the  limit  of  an  amount  equal  to  the sum of 6% of the PASS and 1.5% of the remuneration taken into account within the limit of 12% of the PASS.\n\nThe contribution paid by L'Air Liquide S.A. in 2023 in respect of the  life  insurance  scheme  for  the  benefit  of  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier amounted to 12,634 euros and this amount is also  disclosed  in the notes to Table 2 above.\n\n## Benefits in kind\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors has a company car as a benefit in kind.\n\n## 2.2.3.  Options and performance shares previously granted to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier in respect of his previous term of office as Chairman and CEO\n\nPursuant to the provisions of the AFEP/MEDEF Code, due to the end  of  his  term  of  office  as  Chairman  and  CEO  in  2022, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier no longer benefits from LTI allocations .\n\nIt should be noted that, in agreement with Mr Beno\u00eet Potier and in accordance  with  best  governance  practices,  the  Board,  at  its meeting of February 15, 2022, decided to apply the principle of prorating to  Mr Beno\u00eet Potier on the occasion of the termination of his term of office as Chairman and CEO on May 31, 2022. The LTI granted to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier in 2021 (last grant of which he was  a  beneficiary)  were  prorated  (as  for  the  2020  grant),  the definitive grant being thus reduced by -52.9%.",

This obligation will remain in force until it is exceeded by the effect of the  rules  resulting  from  the  French  Commercial  Code.  The number of shares required to be held is assessed as of January 1 and July 1 of each year. The Board noted that the valuation of the shares held by Mr Beno\u00eet Potier as at January 1 and July 1, 2023 was much greater than the amount required and concluded that the  shareholding  obligation  was  complied  with  by  the  Company Officer.\n\n## Other rules applicable to the Company Officers\n\n- \u25a0 Restriction  on  the  exercise  of  stock  options  and  the  sale  of performance shares during the 'black-out periods' prior to the publication  of  the  financial  statements.  These  abstention periods open 30 days before the announcement of the annual and half-year consolidated results and 15 calendar days prior to  the  publication  of  the  quarterly  financial  information.  They end  on  the  date  of  publication  of  the  information  at  close  of business.\n- \u25a0 Commitment not to carry out hedging transactions with regard to the risk concerning the performance shares awarded/shares arising  from  the  exercise  of  options,  throughout  the  length  of their  term  of  office.  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  remains  bound  by  this commitment  for  the  subscription  options  and  performance shares  granted  to  him  under  his  previous  term  of  office  as Chairman and CEO until the 2021 performance share plan.\n\n## TABLE 6.

CRITERIA\n\nThe maximum amount of the sum to be allocated in total to the members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  was  set  by  the  General Meeting  on  May  5,  2020  at  1.3  million  euros  per  fiscal  year (12 th resolution).\n\nAs per the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting on May 3, 2023, the formula for allocating Directors' remuneration seeks  to  ensure  pay  is  competitive  with  international  peers  to attract  the  best  and  most  suitable  talent  and  expertise,  in accordance with the Board's diversity policy.\n\nIt comprises fixed remuneration and variable remuneration based on  lump-sum  amounts  per  meeting,  thereby  taking  into  account the actual participation of each Director in the work of the Board and its Committees/working group, as well as a fixed amount per trip  for  Directors  traveling  from  abroad.  In  2023,  the  amount allocated  for  intercontinental  travel  was  readjusted  to  take  into\n\naccount  market  trends  and  maintain  the  competitiveness  of  the remuneration of foreign Directors. The variable remuneration for participation  at  the  Board  and  Committee  meetings  is  more important than the fixed remuneration.\n\nThe  fixed  remuneration  allocated  to  Committee  Chairmen  is harmonized,  with  their  duties  representing  a  substantially comparable  workload,  along  with  the  amount  of  remuneration allocated  for  attendance  at  each  Committee  meeting.  Remote participation in meetings is remunerated in the same way as faceto-face attendance in order to take into account the quality of the means  of  communication  which  allows  members  connecting  by videoconference  to  participate  in  meetings  and  take  part  in discussions  under  qualitative  conditions  equivalent  to  physical meetings. While it does not alter the preference of the Board and its  members  to  attend  meetings  in  person  where  possible,  it recognizes the advances in communication technologies.\n\nFor 2023 , the amounts used break down as follows:\n\n## 3.2.1.  Fixed remuneration (for an entire fiscal year)\n\n- \u25a0 Each  member  receives  fixed  annual  remuneration  set  at 20,000 euros.\n- \u25a0 The  Chairs  of  the  Audit  and  Accounts  Committee,  the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Remuneration Committee  and  the  Environment  and  Society  Committee receive additional fixed annual remuneration of 20,000 euros.\n- \u25a0 The Lead Director receives additional fixed annual remuneration of 20,000 euros.",

Based  on  the  actual  hours worked,  the  lost-time  accident  frequency  rate  for  Group  employees  stood  at  0.98  in 2023, which is close to the rate of 0.94 achieved in 2022. This is the first time that the Group has maintained this lost-time accident frequency rate for Group employees below 1 for two consecutive years: this confirms the durability of this positive performance. By way of comparison, the average value of this lost-time accident frequency rate for the gas industry in Europe stood at 1.82 in 2022; the Air Liquide Group is therefore posting a significantly  better  performance.  A  very  significant  reduction  can  be  observed  in  the number  of  accidents  involving  subcontractors  compared  to  2022  (-16%),  bringing  the lost-time accident frequency rate for subcontractors down from 1.53 in 2022 to 1.25 in 2023,  which  represents  a  substantial  improvement  and  the  best  performance  ever achieved by the Group for this category.\n\nOverall,  45  fewer  people  (whether  employees  or  subcontractors)  were  injured  (as  a result of accidents, whether with or without lost time) in connection with Group activities in  2023,  by  comparison  with  2022,  which  reflects  the  tangible  improvement  in  the Group's Safety performance.\n\nDespite  these  encouraging  results,  2023  was  nevertheless  marked  by  the  death  of  a driver  (an Air  Liquide  employee  in  China)  in  a  road  traffic  accident,  leading  us,  as  in 2022, to qualify the overall assessment of performance in this respect. For the record, 2022  had  been  marked  by  the  death  of  a  subcontracted  driver.  Overall,  taking  into consideration third party deaths in road traffic accidents involving an Air Liquide vehicle (which have been systematically monitored since 2015), the number of deaths linked to the Group's activity for 2023 is the lowest recorded for the last seven years.\n\nDuring the course of 2023, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow systematically stressed the importance of safety in his oral presentations, notably at the Group Management Meeting in October 2023 but also during each of his numerous site visits in Operations.\n\nIn terms of Safety action plans, he is building on previous programs, stressing the need to  remain focused in order to bring them to a successful conclusion, before launching other major projects. He therefore continued to supervise, both personally and together with  all  the  Executive  Committee  members,  the  progress  of  the  IMS  (Industrial Management System) Streamlining program, the revised procedures for which were fully rolled out to all Clusters in December 2023.\n\nMr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  also  provides  unwavering  support  for  the  roll-out  of  the  Group's road  Safety  program  that  was  launched  several  years  ago,  regularly  stressing  the importance of Road Safety in Air Liquide Operations, e.g., in the video of his New Year wishes circulated throughout the Group in January 2023.\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE",

This initiative has received strong support from Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow and will continue in 2024.\n\n## Rollout of action plans linked to the Group's new sustainability objectives; Progress made on the various key indicators and alignment with the 2025 trajectory linked to these new objectives \u25a0\n\nIn line with the Sustainability objectives announced in March 2021 and reiterated in the  ADVANCE  plan  communicated  in  March  2022,  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  continues  to place  sustainability  issues  at  the  heart  of  the  Group's  development  strategy, integrating  financial  and  extra-financial  performance.  Considerable  progress  has been made in 2023, regarding each of the commitments in the ACT program, which was recognized in 2023 by the fact that rating agencies placed the Group in the top industry quartile.\n\n## -ACT for the Climate\n\nMr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's ambition is to make Air Liquide the leader in climate solutions.\n\nHe actively promotes Air Liquide's ability to provide immediate, tangible solutions to the major challenge of decarbonizing the industry, both internally and with external stakeholders.\n\nInternally,  this  is  reflected  in  governance  and  monitoring,  with,  for  example,  the introduction in 2023 of a committee set up to review strategic environmental issues, under his leadership. The processes for monitoring and managing CO2 emissions are fully implemented, and the Group's CO2 emissions are reported and consolidated on a quarterly basis. Alignment with these budgets and the impact of activities on the 2025 Carbon trajectory are analyzed and presented to the Executive Committee on a regular basis.\n\nExternally,  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  engages  stakeholders  (customers,  partners, government  authorities,  etc.)  to  decarbonize  the  planet.  The  acceleration  of  lowcarbon  energy  transition  projects  is  visible.  It  is  illustrated,  for  example,  by electrolyzer projects to supply customers with low-carbon hydrogen (the inauguration in Berlin, together with Siemens Energy and the German and French authorities, the Normand'Hy project with TotalEnergies, and in Japan with INPEX, etc.). Thanks to the  Cryocap TM t echnology for CO2 capture, Air Liquide enables these customers to decarbonize  their  production  plants,  such  as  the  Holcim  cement  plant  in  Belgium. Concerning transport, a JV has been signed with TotalEnergies to develop a network of hydrogen stations to decarbonize heavy duty vehicles. Considerable progress has been made in terms of renewable energy with, for example, the signature of three PPAs in South Africa, and the first long-term PPA in China.\n\nIn  terms  of  reducing  CO2  emissions,  the  Group  therefore  confirms  its  trajectory  for reaching the inflection point by 2025.\n\nIn addition  to  decarbonization,  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow's  governance  and  his sustainability  ambition  have  enabled  the  Group  to  make  significant  progress concerning water management and biodiversity, and this work was recognized by the Act4nature initiative in 2023.\n\n## -ACT for Health:\n\nThe Group's objective in mature countries is to improve the quality of life of patients living  at  home  with  chronic  diseases.  In  this  sector,  the  Healthcare  teams  have continued to develop personalized care plans that are tailored to comply with local regulations.  The  proportion  of  patients  who  benefited  from  these  plans  increased significantly over the fiscal year.\n\nIn  low  and  middle-income countries, the objective is to facilitate  access to medical oxygen  for  an  increasing  number  of  people.  Once  again,  thanks  to  new  projects, notably in Africa, the number of people benefiting from the 'Access Oxygen' program increased over the fiscal year.",

Rollout of care coverage at the end of 2023 reached 78%, compared to 42% at the end of  2022.  The  objective  of  100%  cover  for  all  Group  employees  by  2025  is  thus maintained  and  considered  to  be  attainable.  The  Citizen  at  Work  program  has,  in turn, been rolled out to 73% of Group employees by the end of 2023, compared to a roll-out of 43% at the end of 2022.\n\nThe  action  and  progress  described  above  confirm  that,  thanks  to  a  structured  and proactive implementation of the objectives set, the Group is well-positioned with regard to the various pillars of the ACT commitments, in line with the 2025 trajectory for these new objectives.\n\n## Organization and Human Resources:\n\nPerformance was considered very good:\n\nThis  assessment is based on three elements: the implementation of a new management team,  Talent  management  and  an  ambitious  diversity  and  inclusion  policy  that  delivers results.\n\n## \u25a0 Implementation of a new management team\n\nThe  implementation  on  September  1,  2023  of  a  new  organization  of  the  Executive Committee, in  order  to  prepare  for  the  future  by  benefiting  from  all  the  expertise  and experience of a strong team with complementary skills, has been a major achievement. This new division of roles and responsibilities ensures that the experience of each of the 14 members is fully utilized.\n\nIn  line  with  the  Group's  Talent  management  policy,  and  with  a  view  to  long  term  and continuity, this new division of roles and responsibilities means that part of the team can extend  the  scope  of  their  remit  thanks  to  the  experience  brought  in  by  some  of  its members. Six members of the Executive Committee have taken up new positions within the team as a whole (Mr Fran\u00e7ois Abrial, Group General Secretary, Mr Ronnie Chalmers, Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the  Asia-Pacific  Hub,  Mr  Matthieu  Giard,  Chief  Executive Officer  of  the  Americas  Hub,  Ms  Armelle  LEVIEUX,  Vice  President  of  Innovation, overseeing  the  Hydrogen  Energy  and  Electronics  World  Business  Lines,  Ms  \u00c9milie Mouren-Renouard, Chief Executive Officer of the Europe Industries Hub and Ms Amelia Irion, Human Resources Vice President). These new responsibilities have been closely monitored by Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow in terms of the organization and quality of the transfer of roles and responsibilities and the setting of objectives.\n\n## \u25a0 Talent management\n\nThe Group's talent development policy continued as before, with regular reviews at the level  of  the  operational  clusters  right  up  to  the  Executive  Committee. Thanks to these exercises, a detailed review of the most promising international talents has been carried out  with  the  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee  in  the  second  half  of  2023. Special focus was placed on international development opportunities and development programs including executive mentoring.\n\nWith this in mind, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow promoted, over the course of the year, a major worldwide reorganization of the Human Resources function, notably involving the roll-out of  a  unified  information  system  and  the  introduction  of  an  expert  Talent  management team at each of the Hubs. Talent identification and performance management have been greatly facilitated and improved as a result.\n\nFinally,  with  regard  to  Talent  management,  2023  marks  the  20th  anniversary  of  the 'Technical  Community  Leaders'  program  which  identifies,  recognizes  and  develops Group experts. Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow took a personal interest in this event, which brought together  over  2,000  employees  from  all  over  the  world,  and  hosted  a  round  table discussion with inventors and fellow Group experts.\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE",

By  way  of illustration, he was personally involved, on March 8, as the keynote speaker at a round table to mark the publication of the book '120 Inspiring Women'. The event was held in an  auditorium  attended  by  European  employees  and  was  broadcast  live  to  all  Group entities, thus demonstrating the Chief Executive Officer's commitment to an issue that is key for Air  Liquide. A  stand  was  also  set  up  at  the Annual  General  Meeting  to  inform shareholders about this initiative.\n\nIn his capacity as Chief Executive Officer, he has put the issue of diversity on the agenda for Executive Committee meetings, notably to review the targets for gender diversity and the inclusion policy. Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow has expressed a firm commitment concerning the policy for the inclusion of disabled workers, notably at the various events organized during Disability Week.\n\nFinally,  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  wishes  to  maintain  high-quality  social  dialog  within  the Group.  By  way  of  illustration,  in  France,  he  called  a  meeting  with  the  French Representative  Trade  Unions,  on  March  17,  2023,  to  discuss  current  issues  and challenges  facing  Air  Liquide  in  a  climate  of  mutual  trust.  In  China,  close  to  4,000 employees took part in a virtual town hall to talk with Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow.\n\n## Individual performance:\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer's individual performance is considered remarkable. Despite the  difficult  macroeconomic  and  geopolitical  context  in  2023,  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow steered  the  Group  with  energy  and  agility,  which  enabled  him  to  distinguish  himself throughout the fiscal year (notably marked by a substantial increase in the share price, demonstrating  the  excellent  alignment  of  Group  strategy  with  the  expectations  of shareholders and stakeholders in an uncertain climate). In 2023, Fran\u00e7ois Jackow also prepared the Group for future transformations and challenges.\n\nIn  total,  the  amount  of  the  variable  part  of  the  remuneration  is  above  the  target  and amounts to 1,471,067 euros.\n\nThe total amount of the variable remuneration due for the 2023 fiscal year will be paid in 2024, after approval of the financial statements by the General Meeting, it being noted that its payment is conditional on the approval by a General Meeting of the components of remuneration paid during or awarded in respect of the 2023 fiscal year to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow, as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThere is no deferred variable annual remuneration mechanism, multi-annual variable remuneration mechanism or exceptional remuneration.",

Furthermore, no grant is made to the Executive Officer at the time of this departure, in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code.\n\nThe  Executive  Officer  will  remain  subject  to  all  the  provisions  of  the  plans  and,  more specifically,  those  relating  to  the  duration  of  the  vesting,  lock-up  and  holding  periods  in respect of the shares and stock options granted.\n\n## Performance conditions\n\nThe  performance  shares  awarded  are  all  accompanied  by  performance  conditions calculated over three years. They are calculated:\n\n- (i) for 50% of the performance shares granted , on the rate of achievement of a target, set by the Board, comprising the after-tax Return on Capital Employed (recurring ROCE ) (c) recorded at the end of the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nAt the objective set, the grant is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis to a lower limit below which there will be no award. This lower limit corresponds to a ROCE level which is 200 basis points less than the objective set, which provides a degree of flexibility, notably making it possible to take advantage of external growth opportunities.\n\nThe objective was set in line with the ROCE objective announced by the Company, i.e. more than 10% at the end of 2025.",

Remuneration policy applicable to corporate officers\n\n## (submitted for the approval of the General Meeting pursuant to article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code)\n\nIn accordance with article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code, the remuneration policy applicable to the corporate officers of L'Air Liquide S.A., as established by the Board of Directors on February 19, 2024 and described in this section, is submitted for approval by the General  Meeting  on April  30,  2024,  in  the  11 th resolution  and  12 th resolution  for  Company  Officers  (paragraph  5.1  below)  and  in  the 13 th resolution for Directors (paragraph 5.2 below).\n\n## 5.1.   REMUNERATION POLICY APPLICABLE TO COMPANY OFFICERS\n\nThe remuneration policy applicable to Company Officers described below and subject to the approval of the General Meeting breaks down as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 the  remuneration  policy  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer (applicable, in 2024, to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow); and\n- \u25a0 the  remuneration  policy  for  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors (applicable, in 2024, to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier).\n\nThis remuneration policy for Company Officers was established by the Board of Directors on February 19, 2024, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee.\n\nDuring this work, the Company Officers do not attend deliberations by  the  Remuneration  Committee  relating  to  their  personal  case and  do  not  take  part  in  deliberations  or  votes  by  the  Board  of Directors on the remuneration components that concern them. The decision-making process followed to determine the policy is also applicable when said policy is reviewed and implemented.\n\nTo determine the remuneration policy, the Board of Directors takes into account the principles of completeness, balance, comparability,  consistency,  comprehensibility  and  proportionality as  recommended  by  the  AFEP/MEDEF  Code  of  Corporate Governance.\n\nThis policy is in line with that approved by the General Meeting of May 3, 2023, with a proposed change in the level of remuneration of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  details  of  which  are  provided  in section 5.1.2 below.\n\nBoth  in  terms  of  structure  and  level,  the  remuneration  policy  for Company  Officers  was  therefore  established  in  accordance  with Group practices, its governance context and market practices. It is competitive  and  aligned  with  the  Group's  strategy  and  mediumand long-term objectives.\n\n## 5.1.1.  Remuneration policy applicable to Executive Officers\n\n## A.  General principles\n\nIn  keeping  with  the  Group's  practices,  the  remuneration  policy applicable  to  Executive  Officers  determined  by  the  Board  of Directors  includes  incentive  elements  reflecting  the  Group's strategy,  which  is  steered  toward  profitable  long-term  growth  by acting  on  behalf  of  a  sustainable  future,  with  regard  to  the corporate  interest  and  the  interests  of  all  the  stakeholders.  In  a\n\nhighly capital-intensive industry, profitable long-term  growth requires constant attention to be paid to each investment decision and to the competitiveness of every operation, while maintaining an  ongoing  effort  over  time  in  favor,  in  particular,  of  safety  and security,  innovation,  employee  development,  and  environmental and societal stakes. It incorporates, both in the short-term variable element and in the long-term incentive elements, criteria  aligned with  the ADVANCE  strategic  plan  combining  financial  and  extrafinancial  performance.  It  is  tailored  to  the  Group's  specific situation,  reflects  the  level  of  responsibility  of  Group  executives and remains competitive. In this context, the elements taken into account for the determination of the remuneration of the Executive Officers are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 an annual short-term component, comprising a fixed remuneration and a variable remuneration;\n- \u25a0 a  long-term  incentive  (hereafter  'LTI')  through  the  grant  of performance shares and/or stock options, both subject in full to performance conditions calculated over three years;\n- \u25a0 other  benefits  attached  to  the  performance  of  the  Executive Officer's term of office, specifically including:\n- -a supplementary pension scheme,\n- -additional  social  coverage  in  terms  of  death  and  disability benefits and healthcare expenses,\n- -benefits  in  kind  (including  unemployment  insurance  for company managers and corporate officers),\n- -commitments  in  the  event  of  termination  of  duties (indemnity  in  the  event  of  cessation  of  functions  at  the Company's  initiative  in  certain  very  limited  circumstances, subject  to  performance  conditions  calculated  over  three years  and,  as  the  case  may  be,  a  non-competition indemnity).\n\nThere are no employment contracts between the Executive Officer and any of the Group's companies (1) .\n\nFurthermore,  if  such  a  situation  were  to  arise,  the  remuneration applicable  to  a  Senior  Executive  Vice  President  would  be determined  on  the  basis  of  the  policy  applicable  to  the  Chief Executive  Officer  of  the  Company,  after  taking  into  account, however,  the  difference  in  profile,  experience,  and  level  of responsibility,  consistent  with  the  earlier  practices  applied  at  the Company for this type of Company Officer.",

Structure and main characteristics common to the general remuneration of Executive Officers\n- A. The structure and principles applicable to the remuneration are in line with previous years and with the policy approved in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25a0 The remuneration policy provides for a proportionate balance between  the  three  components  of  the  total  annual remuneration (i.e. the fixed remuneration,  the  variable remuneration and the long-term incentives, comprising performance shares and/or stock options).\n- (i) The fixed remuneration represents approximately 25%, the variable  remuneration  approximately  35%  and  the  LTI approximately 40% of the target total annual remuneration. The elements  subject  to  performance  conditions represent in principle approximately 75% of this total target remuneration.  The  achievement  of  each  performance condition is assessed without any set-off between criteria.\n- (ii) The variable remuneration continues to be expressed as a target variable remuneration (as a percentage of the fixed remuneration)  with  a maximum .  The  total  target  variable remuneration  set  represents  approximately  80%  of  the Executive  Officer's  total  maximum  variable  remuneration, for a very good performance.\n- \u25a0 The annual  variable  remuneration includes  quantifiable  and qualitative criteria.\n- B. Regarding the weighting of criteria chosen, a greater relative weight is given to the quantifiable criteria as compared to the qualitative criteria.\n\nThe target weighting and the maximum weighting are made public ex-ante and appear below (paragraph 5.1.2); the actual weight of each  criterion  for  the  determination  of  the  variable  remuneration due in respect of the fiscal year will be established on the basis of the performance measured for each criterion in light of the target objective,  on  the  basis  of  the  application  of  a  formula  for  the financial  criteria  and  the  assessment  of  the  Executive  Officer's performance by the Board of Directors upon the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee for the qualitative criteria.\n\nThe rate  of  achievement  of  the  objectives for  the  variable remuneration, expressed as a percentage of the fixed remuneration and as a percentage of the target variable remuneration allocated to the criterion, will be made public ex-post.\n\nThe quantifiable elements of the annual variable remuneration include, as in 2023:\n\n- \u25a0 a  criterion  of  an  increase  in  the  recurring  net  earnings (excluding  exceptional  and  significant  transactions  which  do not impact the operating income recurring) excluding currency impact, per share (hereinafter 'recurring EPS'), which makes it possible  to  take  into  account  all  the  items  in  the  income statement;\n- \u25a0 a  criterion  of  comparable  growth  in  consolidated  revenue (excluding significant scope impact and the impact of currency and energy), which reflects the momentum of the activity.\n- The two criteria  of  the  recurring  EPS  and  the  revenue  reflect the  Group's  strategy  to  achieve  profitable  growth  taking  into account  medium  and  long-term  objectives.  The  efficiency objective contributes to the increase in the recurring EPS.\n\nEach  quantifiable  criterion  is  assigned  a  target  weighting (expressed  as  a  percentage  of  the  fixed  remuneration) corresponding to a 100% achievement of the target objective set  at  the  beginning  of  the  year,  and  a  maximum  weighting (also  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  the  fixed  remuneration). For  each  quantifiable  criterion,  the  Board  of  Directors  has defined an exacting target objective, which is not made public for confidentiality reasons. Nonetheless, the rate of achievement of the objectives for the variable remuneration as a percentage of the fixed remuneration and as a percentage of the  target  variable  remuneration  allocated  to  that  criterion  is made public ex-post.\n\nFor each quantifiable criterion, a formula adopted by the Board of  Directors  makes  it  possible  to  calculate  the  amount  of  the variable  remuneration  due  (within  a  maximum  limit)  by  taking into  account,  on  the  basis  of  the  Consolidated  financial statements  for  the  fiscal  year,  the  value  achieved  for  the criterion  as  compared  to  the  target  objective  set. Thus,  in  the event  of  a  performance  that  exceeds  the  objective  set,  the value  of  the  variable  part  is  adjusted  upward  within  the maximum  limit  set  for  each  criterion.  In  the  event  of  a performance that is below the lower limit set for each objective, the  variable  remuneration  corresponding  to  this  criterion  is equal to zero.\n\nThe qualitative elements of the annual variable remuneration continue to be based, for two-thirds, on several categories or subcategories  of  objectives  which  are  defined  each  year.  For  2024, these  include,  for  one-third  each,  (i) CSR objectives  (safety  and reliability, rollout of action plans linked to the Group's sustainability objectives  as  part  of  the  ADVANCE  strategic  program)  and  (ii) organization  and  Human  Resources objectives.  All  of  these objectives contribute to the development and sustainability of the Company  and  reflect  its  extra-financial  performance  objectives. One  third  of  the  qualitative  components  is  based  on  an assessment  of  the  executive's  individual  performance  in  light  of the context of the year.\n\nThe grant of LTI to the Executive Officers is  examined by the Remuneration  Committee  at  the  same  time  as  the  allocation  to Group employees and is decided by the Board of Directors. It is made within the scope of plans, adopted by the Board of Directors in  the  fall,  in  the  form  of  performance  shares  and/or  share subscription options granted without any discount. It is examined in  light  of  the  total  amount  of  the  Executive  Officer's  annual remuneration, adopted taking into account external market surveys and ensuring that the interests of Shareholders are respected.\n\nAccording to the principle that has been adopted since 2016, the award of LTI to the Executive Officer and its evolution over time are assessed in terms of the IFRS value (and not in terms of the volumes  granted),  for  all  stock  option  and  performance  share plans combined.",

They  lead  to  the  obligation,  for  the Company  Officer,  to  hold,  in  registered  form,  until  the termination  of  his  duties,  a  minimum  quantity  of  shares corresponding to 50% of the capital gain on acquisition, net of social security charges and tax, resulting from each exercise of stock  options/each  definitive  award  of  performance  shares. However, this percentage will be lowered to 5%, as soon as the quantity of shares held by the Company Officer resulting from the  exercise  of  stock  options  or  the  definitive  award  of performance shares represents a minimum amount equal to at least  three  times  the  Company  Officer's  gross  annual  fixed remuneration.  Compliance  with  this  obligation  is  verified annually by the Board of Directors.\n- \u25a0 Additional shareholding obligation defined  by  the  Board  in accordance  with  the  AFEP/MEDEF  Code:  each  Company Officer  must  also  hold  in  a  registered  account  a  minimum number  of  shares  based  on  his  or  her  gross  annual  fixed remuneration (equivalent to twice his or her gross annual fixed remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors and once his or her gross annual fixed remuneration  for  a  Senior  Executive  Vice  President).  The number  of  shares  required  to  be  held  is  assessed  as  of January 1 and July 1 of each year. Newly appointed Company Officers must comply within four years of their first appointment.\n- \u25a0 Lastly,  the  Company  Officers  are  subject  to  the  requirement restricting  the  exercise  of  stock  options  and  the  sale  of performance  shares  during  the 'black-out  periods' prior  to the publication of the financial statements and undertake not to use risk hedging transactions on options/shares resulting from the  exercise  of  options  and  on  performance  shares  granted, throughout their term of office.\n\nAs with all beneficiaries, all the LTI granted to the Executive Officers are subject to demanding performance conditions calculated  over  a  period  of  three  years.  The  performance conditions, which apply to the plans decided upon in autumn, are set by the Board of Directors at the start of the year, at the February meeting, in order to comply with a reference period of three full years.\n\n(2)\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## Remuneration of L'Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\nFor  each  performance  condition,  a  formula  adopted  by  the Board of Directors makes it possible to determine, following the end of the three fiscal years during which the performance has to be  achieved,  the  percentage  of  performance  shares definitively awarded/stock options that can be exercised.\n\nThe demanding objectives set for each performance condition are made public ex-post, at the end of the Board meeting in the month of February following the end of the three fiscal years during which the performance has to be achieved. The rate of achievement of the performance conditions and the percentage of LTI definitively awarded/that  can  be  exercised  are  also  published  at  the  end  of this Board meeting.\n\nFor  the  beneficiaries  of  the  'France'  performance  share  plan, including Executive Officers, the vesting period is three years from the Board meeting which decided upon their grant. This period, at the end of which the performance shares are definitively awarded, is followed by a two-year holding period. The stock options are in principle  subject  to  a  four-year  lock-up  period,  followed  by  a  sixyear  exercise  period.  Added  to  this  is  a  condition  of  presence which  stipulates  the  loss  of  the  stock  options/rights  to  the performance shares in the process of being acquired, in the event of resignation or removal from office for serious cause.\n\nOn  the  recommendation  of  the  Remuneration  Committee,  the Board  has  retained  for  2024,  for  all  LTI  beneficiaries  (Executive Officers and employees) the ROCE, Total Shareholder Return (AL TSR and relative TSR) and an objective related to the evolution of the Group's carbon emissions.\n\n- \u25a0 The ROCE, which makes it possible to measure the Return on Capital  Employed,  is  relevant  in  a  highly  capital-intensive industry.\n- \u25a0 The Total Shareholder Return (TSR) in turn makes it possible to  align  the  Company's  performance  with  the  regular  profits expected by its Shareholders.\n- \u25a0 Moreover,  consistent  with  the  Group's  responsible  growth approach, the LTI plans incorporate since 2020 a performance condition linked to the Group's Climate Objectives.\n\nIn  total,  all  the  performance criteria for the variable remuneration and LTI, both financial (growth in recurring EPS and comparable revenue,  ROCE,  shareholder  return  -  TSR)  and  extra-financial (CSR  and  HR  objectives  for  the  qualitative  portion  of  variable remuneration,  and  LTI  criterion  aligned  with  the  Group's  climate objectives), reflect the Group's overall performance objectives as announced  in  its ADVANCE  strategic  plan  aimed  at  achieving  a solid financial performance  while  developing  an  ambitious decarbonization plan and taking into account the interests of all its stakeholders.\n\nDuring the annual process of determining the components of the remuneration for Executive Officers, the Remuneration Committee ensures  that the choices made take into account  the remuneration and employment conditions of the Company's employees .  The  attendance  of  the  Director  representing  the employees, who is a member of the Committee, helps to ensure that all aspects of these remuneration and employment conditions, and  more  generally  the  interests  of  the  Group's  employees,  are taken into account in this work, which give rise to a recommendation  to  the  Board  at  its  meeting  in  February.  The policy presented for approval by the General Meeting reflects this consideration.  Concerning  the  conditions  of  remuneration,  the quantifiable and qualitative elements of the variable remuneration of  the  Company's  Executive  Officer  and  senior  executives  are therefore  convergent.  Moreover,  the  LTI  performance  conditions are  identical  for  all  the  employee  beneficiaries  (approximately 2,000  Group  employees  in  2020  and  2021,  approximately  2,600 Group  employees  in  2022  and  2023)  and  for  the  Executive Officers. These alignments provide for greater coherence of efforts in  achieving  the  Company's  performance objectives.  With  regard to  taking  the  employment  conditions  of  employees  into  account, the  importance  given  to  safety  objectives  in  the  qualitative",

The variable  remuneration  also  incorporates  objectives  of  talent development, the achievement of which requires in particular the implementation  of  varied,  relevant  programs  for  the  training  and development of employees throughout their career, the implementation  of  new  ways  of  working  within  the  entire  Group, and  an  objective  relating  to  the  implementation  of  the  Group's diversity policy and, more generally, the promotion of a culture of inclusion.\n\nExecutive  Officers  also  benefit  from  long-term  commitments  and commitments  related  to  the  termination  of  their  duties  described below,  as  well  as  other  components  of  annual  remuneration (benefits in kind, supplementary social protection schemes) which may be terminated under ordinary law conditions.\n\n## 5.1.2.  Implementation for the determination of the Chief Executive Officer's remuneration for 2024\n\nThe Board of Directors, at its meeting of February 19, 2024, on the recommendation  of  the  Remuneration  Committee,  defined  the criteria  for  determining,  distributing  and  allocating  the  elements comprising  the  total  remuneration  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer which  are  submitted  for  the  approval  of  the  General  Meeting  of April 30, 2024. They are in line with the 2023 remuneration policy, with  a  proposed  a  re-evaluation  submitted  by  the  Board  to  the General  Meeting,  as  described  below,  in  order  to  maintain  the attractiveness,  comparability  and  competitiveness  of  the  Chief Executive  Officer's  remuneration.  The  Board  of  Directors  has taken into account Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's level of responsibility and experience,  the  Group  context  and  market  practices.  It  is  noted that  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  decided  to  unilaterally  terminate  his employment contract at the start of his corporate mandate in June 2022,  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the  AFEP/ MEDEF Code and best governance practices.\n\nWhen  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  was  appointed  as  Chief  Executive Officer in May 2022, the positioning of his total remuneration had been  determined  on  the  basis  of  an  in-depth  study  of  market practices.  This  study  conducted  in  2021  included  a  benchmark, carried  out  with  the  assistance  of  an  outside  firm,  based  on publicly available data for the total remuneration of CEOs at CAC 40  groups  with  a  separated  governance  mode  (homogeneous panel  excluding  a  data  item  that  is  not  representative  as  much higher than the average).\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors,  on  the  recommendation  of  the Remuneration  Committee,  decided  to  review  this  positioning  at mid-term  to  ensure  it  still  accurately  reflects  the  Chief  Executive Officer's level of responsibility and the market conditions.\n\nFor this purpose, an update in 2023 of the 2021 benchmark has been  carried  out  on  the  basis  of  the  panel  described  above, adjusted for changes which have occurred in the meantime in the composition of the CAC 40 or in the governance of certain groups. It  shows that, in a highly  inflationary context following the public health crisis, the median and average remuneration of CEOs in the panel  under  review  have  been  revised  upwards,  with  the  result that the relative positioning of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's remuneration is now out of step (the positioning of his total target remuneration compared to that of his peers is 18% below that of the average of the  2023  benchmark).  An  increase  of  around  10%  in  his  total remuneration  would  always  place  him  significantly  below    the average, and slightly below the median, of his peers.\n\nConsequently,  the  Board,  on  the  recommendation  of  the Remuneration  Committee,  considered  that  it  was  appropriate  to reassess the total remuneration of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow which had not  been  changed  since  his  appointment  as  Chief  Executive Officer,  by  +10%  (applicable  to  the  fixed  and  target  variable remuneration as well as the LTI, in order to maintain the balanced structure  of  the  components  of  his  remuneration).  This  10% increase represents an average annual increase of +3.2% up until the end of his current mandate, in line with the trend in employee remuneration within the Group.\n\nIndeed,  across  the  Group,  in  2023,  an  increase  in  the  average wage of +5.7% was recorded (on a like-for-like basis) (+3.8% in mature countries). Over the last three years (2021, 2022, 2023), across  the  Group,  the  average  wage  (including  social  security contributions)  increased  by  +5.5%  per  year  (+4.5%  in  mature countries).\n\nThe  structure  of  the  remuneration  remains  the  same  as  that approved by the General Meeting of May 3, 2023.\n\nThe revised remuneration will then remain stable until the end of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's term of office.\n\nMr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow will not receive any remuneration for his office as Director.\n\n## A.  Fixed remuneration\n\nThe fixed remuneration is determined on the basis of the level of responsibility,  the  experience  in  the  general  management  duties and market practices.\n\nThe  annual  fixed  remuneration  recommended  for  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois Jackow in 2024 in application of the aforementioned principles and considerations, amounts to an annual amount of 1,210,000 euros, an increase of +10% compared to 2023.\n\n## B.  Variable remuneration\n\nPursuant  to  the  principles  set  forth  above  ('Structure  and  main characteristics common to the general remuneration of Executive Officers'),  the  Board  of  Directors  of  February  19,  2024,  on  the recommendation  of  the  Remuneration  Committee,  defined  the components  of  the  variable  remuneration  of  the  Chief  Executive Officer  for  2024  in  line  with  those  of  the  previous  fiscal  year.  A target and maximum weighting is defined for each criterion, and an allocation key between  quantifiable criteria (majority) and qualitative criteria is set in line with market practices, as indicated in the table below.",

Other components of annual remuneration\n\nMr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  will  continue  to  benefit  from  the following other items :\n\n## Benefits in kind\n\nThe benefits in kind include the use of a company car as well as contributions to the unemployment  insurance  for  company managers and corporate officers, subscribed to by the Company. The  contributions  paid  by  the  Company  are  included  in Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's remuneration as benefits in kind. By way of information, these benefits amount to around 18,110 euros on an annual  basis,  around  14,000  euros  of  which  is  for  the unemployment  insurance  for  company  managers  and  corporate officers.\n\n## Death and disability benefits and healthcare cost plan\n\n- \u25a0 The supplementary 'incapacity, invalidity, death' benefits plan, unified  as  of  January  1,  2015,  covering  all  personnel  and corporate officers who are duly authorized to benefit from such scheme, in which the remuneration taken into account for the calculation  of  the  contributions  is  capped  at  (i)  16  times  the annual  social  security  limit  for  the  incapacity  and  invalidity cover, (ii) 24 times the annual social security limit for the death benefit;\n- \u25a0 The healthcare cost plan covering all employees.\n\nThe estimates for the 2024 fiscal year are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 employer's contribution to Healthcare Costs: 414 euros;\n- \u25a0 employer's contribution to Life Insurance schemes: 10,980 euros.\n\n## D.  Long-term remuneration components\n\nAt its meeting of February 19, 2024, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors provided for the allocation  of  performance  shares  to  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow,  in respect of his office as Chief Executive Officer for the 2024 fiscal year, in an annual amount of 1,815,000 euros (based on an IFRS valuation),  an  increase  of  +10%  compared  to  2023,  as  indicated above.\n\nPursuant to the principles of the remuneration policy applicable to Executive Officers, the LTIs continue to represent 41% of the total target remuneration (fixed remuneration, target variable remuneration  and  LTI),  and the  remuneration  components subject  to  performance  conditions  (variable  remuneration  + LTI) represent approximately three quarters of the total target remuneration.\n\nThe  performance  conditions  which  apply  to  the  Chief  Executive Officer (and to all the beneficiaries of the LTI Plans which will be allocated in 2024) were determined by the Board of Directors on February  19,  2024.  The  number  of  LTI  definitively  granted/ exercisable under the 2024 plans will depend on the achievement of the following performance conditions (identical to those defined in 2023):\n\n- (i) for 50% of the LTI granted, on the rate of achievement of an objective, set by the Board, consisting of the recurring ROCE recorded at the end of the 2026 fiscal year.\n- At the objective set, the grant is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis to a lower limit below which there will be no award. This lower limit corresponds to a ROCE level which is 200 basis points less than the objective set, which provides a degree  of  flexibility,  notably  making  it  possible  to  take advantage of external growth opportunities.",

The objective  of  an  absolute  TSR  is  set  in  accordance  with historic  performances.  At  the  objective  set,  the  grant  is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis to a lower limit below which there will be no award;\n- -for  50% of the LTI referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on the rate of Total Shareholder Return from an investment in Air Liquide  shares,  dividends  reinvested  -  source:  Bloomberg (' B  TSR '), as  compared  to  the CAC  40  TSR index, dividends  reinvested  (source:  Bloomberg)  for  the  2024, 2025 and 2026 fiscal years. The rate of achievement will be 0%, if the average of the Air Liquide TSR is lower than the average  of  the  CAC  40  TSR,  50%  if  it  is  equal  to  the average of the CAC 40 TSR and 100%, if it is at least 2 % higher than the average of the CAC 40 TSR on the basis of a  straight-line  change. Any  grant  for  a  performance  lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR is impossible;\n- (iii) for  10% of  the  LTI  granted:  on  an  objective  linked  to  the change in  the  Group's  CO2  emissions  in  absolute  value  over the 2024-2026 period, aligned with the Group's CO2 trajectory (an  integral  part  of  the ADVANCE  strategic  program),  broken down as follows:\n\nComparison of the Air Liquide Group's CO2 emissions for the year  2026,  expressed  in  millions  of  metric  tonnes,  with  those same  emissions  for  the  year  2023,  the  2023  basis  of comparison  being  adjusted  to  take  account  of  any  possible perimeter  impacts  (possible  takeovers  of  existing  units  at  the Group's customers or companies, asset or company divestitures)  over  the  period  2024-2026,  on  a  12-month  proforma basis, in line with the method used to monitor the carbon trajectory as communicated by the Group.\n\nFor  the  purposes  hereof,  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions include  direct  emissions  (Scope  1)  and  indirect  emissions (Scope  2).  These  emissions  are  accounted  for  as  'market based' (3) .\n\nThe  rate  of  achievement  of  the  performance  conditions  will  be recorded  in  2027  by  the  Board  at  the  time  when  the  financial statements are approved for the 2026 fiscal year.\n\nAll  of  the  rules  and  conditions  applying  to  LTI  grants  to  the Executive  Officers  described  above  (limits  on  volume  and  value, condition of presence, proration, shareholding and share ownership  obligations (4) and  other  specific  regulations)  apply  to the  allocation  of  performance  shares  in  2024  to  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois Jackow in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## E.  Long-term commitments\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  on  February  19,  2024,  on  the recommendation  of  the  Remuneration  Committee,  maintained without change the elements of the pension schemes from which Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow will benefit for the duration of his term of office as Chief Executive Officer. These elements, including, in particular, a supplementary pension plan, were initially defined in 2022 when Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  was  appointed  as  Chief  Executive  Officer, taking  into  account  the  results  of  a  detailed  benchmark  formed from a panel of CAC 40 companies and European companies with separated governance, the plan applicable to the Group's senior\n\nexecutives,  the  overall  balance  of  the  remuneration  of  the  Chief Executive  Officer,  and  an  effort  to  outline  a  plan  ensuring competitive coverage at the best cost for the Company.\n\nAll of these  components  are,  as  with  other  remuneration components, subject to the approval of the General Meeting voting on  the  remuneration  policy  applicable  to  the  Chief  Executive Officer.\n\nThe  overall  amount  of  the  Company's  contributions  to  the supplementary pension plans detailed below represents approximately 15% of the target annual Reference Remuneration (fixed remuneration + target variable remuneration), as in previous years.\n\n## Mandatory company retirement savings plan (PERO) (5)\n\nThis  plan  is  financed  by  monthly  contributions  based  on remuneration  not  exceeding  eight  PASS  and  equally  distributed between  the  employer  and  the  beneficiary.  They  are  deductible from the corporate income tax, are subject to the social levy at the rate  of  16%,  and  are  excluded  from  the  basis  for  assessment  of the social security contributions, within the limit of the higher of the following two values: 5% of the PASS or 5% of the remuneration taken into account within the limit of five times the PASS.\n\nThe  amount  of  the  employer's  contribution  to  this  plan,  for  the 2024 fiscal year, is estimated at 11,001 euros.\n\n## 'Senior managers' defined contribution pension plan\n\nThis  'article  83'  defined  contribution  pension  plan  is  financed  by annual contributions paid in their entirety by the company on the remuneration fraction below eight PASS and subject to the same tax and social security treatment as those paid under the PERO.\n\nThe amount of the employer's contribution to this plan for the 2024 fiscal year is estimated at 10,015 euros.\n\n## Collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  this  collective  pension  insurance  contract with individual and optional subscription replaced the pension plan from which Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow benefitted prior to his appointment as  Chief  Executive  Officer.  This  collective  pension  insurance contract with individual and optional subscription (known as 'article 82  of  the  French  Tax  Code')  is  applicable  for  the  portion  of  his Reference  remuneration  [fixed  portion  +  target  variable  portion] exceeding eight PASS. The amount paid by the Company is split between a payment to the insurer and a payment to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow intended to partially cover the social security contributions and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer. This amount is  paid  in  arrears  every  year  for  the  period  until  the  end  of  the executive  office,  after  recording  the  performance  conditions associated with this pension plan.\n\nMr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow cannot apply for the entitlements under this pension insurance contract before the age at which he becomes entitled to claim his pension entitlements under the French general social security scheme.\n\nApplication of this mechanism to the Chief Executive Officer was determined  taking  into  account  the  overall  balance  of  his remuneration  and  the  market  conditions,  and  for  the  Company represents, for the same efficiency for the beneficiary, a markedly lower  cost to  the  Company  than  that  which  would  result  from implementing  a  new  supplementary  pension  plan  with  defined vested  benefits  under  article  L.  137-11-2  of  the  French  Social Security Code.",

The  gross  annual  amount  of  payments  totals approximately  378,000  euros,  subject  to  the  achievement  of  the performance conditions described below.\n\nThus, the total amount of contributions for a fiscal year will depend on  the  average  annual  gap  (measured  on  each  fiscal  year) between  the  Return  on  Capital  Employed  after  tax  (ROCE), determined as set out below, and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital  (WACC)  (measured  on  the  basis  of  the  book  value  of equity),  calculated  (on  the  basis  of  the  certified  consolidated financial  statements,  approved  by  the  General  Meeting)  with respect to the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year.\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## Remuneration of L'Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\nIn  order  not  to  penalize  the  calculation  in  the  event  of  a  major transaction,  the  ROCE  used  is,  as  in  2023,  recurring  ROCE 'excluding  major  acquisitions'.

Commitments relating to termination of duties\n\n## Termination indemnities\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors,  on  the  recommendation  of  the Remuneration Committee, decided that Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow (who unilaterally ended his employment contract as of his appointment as  Chief  Executive  Officer  with  effect  from  June  1,  2022)  would continue  to  benefit  from  a  termination  indemnity,  subject  to  very strict triggering conditions. The main terms are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 only the cases of forced departure of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow from his  term  of  office  as  Chief  Executive  Officer  (removal  from office,  request for resignation) related to a change of strategy or  a  change  in  control  (in  the  latter  case,  the  termination indemnity is due, if the departure occurs within six months of the change of control) may give rise to an indemnity;\n- \u25a0 the amount of the indemnity in any of these cases is set at the 24  previous  months  of  annual  gross  fixed  and  variable remuneration actually paid (24 months of fixed remuneration + 2 previous annual variable remunerations actually paid) on the date  of  termination  of  his  duties  (subject  to  the  exception described  below  and  in  the  paragraph  relating  to  the  noncompetition  commitment). As  an  exception  to  this  rule,  in  the event of departure during the course of the 2024 fiscal year, for the  calculation  of  the  indemnity  of  24  months  of  fixed  and variable remuneration, the following will be taken into account: for the variable remuneration, the target variable remuneration awarded  in  the  absence  of  variable  remuneration  paid  in respect  of  a  fiscal  year  (for  each  fiscal  year  concerned),  and the  annual  fixed  remuneration  of  the  ongoing  fiscal  year  and that of the previous fiscal year;\n- \u25a0 the  amount  of  the  indemnity  due  decreases  gradually  as Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow, in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer, approaches the age limit defined in the Company's articles of association; in the event of a forced departure in the 24 months preceding the date of departure due to the age limit set by the articles of association, the amount of the indemnity due will be capped  at  the  number  of  months'  gross  remuneration separating the date of forced departure from the date when he reaches such age limit; in any event, no indemnity shall be paid should  the  beneficiary  claim  his  pension  entitlements  on  the date of his forced departure;\n- \u25a0 the  right  to  payment  of  the  indemnity  is  subject  to  the achievement  of  the  performance  conditions,  the  proportion  of the  indemnity  due  decreasing  depending  on  the  rate  of achievement  of  such  conditions  (see  below  for  details  of  the performance conditions).\n\n## Performance conditions applicable to the termination indemnity\n\nThe Board of Directors decided that the payment of the termination indemnity concerning Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow  is subject to compliance, duly acknowledged by the Board of Directors at the time  of  or  subsequent  to  the  termination  of  his  duties,  with conditions  related  to  the  beneficiary's  performance  assessed  in light of the Company's performance (unchanged compared to the conditions included in the policy approved in May 2023), defined as of today as follows:\n\nEntitlement  to  the  indemnity  referred  to  above  shall  depend  on, and the amount of the indemnity paid will be adjusted on the basis of, the average of the annual gap (measured on each fiscal year) between the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) and the Weighted  Average  Cost  of  Capital  (WACC)  (measured  on  the basis of the book value of equity), calculated (on the basis of the certified  consolidated  financial  statements,  approved  by  the General Meeting) with respect to the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which the departure occurs.",

In any event, no indemnity shall be paid beyond age 65.\n\nThe Board of Directors reserves the right to fully or partially waive the non-competition commitment upon the departure of the Chief Executive Officer, in which case no indemnity will be owed.\n\n## 5.1.3.  Remuneration policy applicable to the Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\n## A.  Remuneration principles and structure\n\nThis  remuneration  policy  for  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors is unchanged from that approved by the General Meeting on May 3, 2023.\n\nThus,  in  accordance  with  the  recommendation  of  the  AFEP/ MEDEF Code (article 26.2), the Chairman is only awarded fixed remuneration, to the exclusion of any variable remuneration, LTI or exceptional remuneration.\n\nDepending  on  the  circumstances,  the  Chairman  may  receive remuneration  in  respect  of  his  duties  as  a  Director  (section  5.2 'Remuneration  policy  applicable  to  Directors').  Nevertheless,  in the case of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, it has been decided that he will not receive any remuneration as a Director.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  has  all  of  the  material means to fulfill his mission.\n\nDepending  on  the  circumstances,  the  Chairman  may  be authorized  to  benefit  from  the  death  and  disability  benefits  plan covering all personnel in addition to corporate officers authorized to benefit therefrom.\n\n## B.  2024 Remuneration of the Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  principles  set  out  above,  the  Board  of Directors' meeting of February 19, 2024, on the recommendation of  the  Remuneration  Committee,  defined  the  components  of remuneration  applicable  to  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier,  unchanged  from those defined in 2023.\n\nIt  is  reminded  that  the  positioning  of  the  remuneration  had  been drafted at the time of the separation of duties in 2022 based on an in-depth  study  of  industry  practices,  including  a  benchmark  of remunerations  of  Board  Chairs  at  a  representative  panel  of companies with a separated governance mode within the CAC 40, and European companies (7) with the assistance of an outside firm. The  remuneration  takes  into  account  the  specific  role  of  the Chairman  of  the  Board  in  the  particular  context  of  managerial succession and the missions that the Board of Directors wished to entrust to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier for the duration of the transition in order to  benefit  from  his  experience,  in-depth  knowledge  of  the  Group and  its  businesses,  its  Shareholders  and  stakeholders,  and  its strategic  challenges  -  see  Chapter  3,  section  2.2,  paragraph 'Duties of the Chairman of the Board of Directors'.\n\nIn  this  context,  the  amount  of  the  annual  fixed  remuneration  of Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  remains  set  at  800,000  euros,  excluding  any variable  and  long-term  remuneration  (notably  LTI)  and  any exceptional  remuneration.  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  will  not  receive  any additional remuneration in his capacity as a Director.\n\nFurthermore,  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  will  benefit  from  the  use  of  a company  car,  representing  benefits  in  kind  which  amount  to around 2,793 euros per year.\n\nIn line with 2023, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier continues to benefit from the life insurance schemes (death benefit only) covering all employees as well as corporate officers duly authorized to benefit from them.\n\nThe amount of the 2024 contribution to this plan is estimated at 8,438 euros.\n\n## 5.2.   REMUNERATION POLICY APPLICABLE TO DIRECTORS\n\nThe remuneration policy applicable to Directors was determined by the  Board  of  Directors  on  February  19,  2024  on  the  basis  of  a recommendation from the Remuneration Committee. The decision-making process followed to determine the policy is also applicable when said policy is reviewed and implemented.\n\nThe remuneration policy applicable to Directors is submitted to the vote of the General Meeting. Its principles and structure are in line with the policy decided by the Board of Directors in February 2023 and approved by the General Meeting of May 3, 2023.",

        "page_content": "The remuneration policy for Directors seeks to ensure, within the framework  of  the  overall  pay  package  voted  by  the  Ordinary General Meeting, that pay is competitive with international peers to attract  the  best  and  most  suitable  talent  and  expertise,  in accordance with the Board's diversity policy.\n\nAt this time, the maximum annual global pay package amounts to 1.3  million  euros  per  fiscal  year,  in  accordance  with  the  12 th resolution of the Combined General Meeting of May 5, 2020. The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, decided to submit to the General Meeting of April 30, 2024 a draft resolution for the purpose of increasing this maximum amount  to  1.5  million  euros  per  fiscal  year  from  2024.  The proposed  increase  takes  into  account  in  particular  the  new composition  of  the  Board  of  Directors  which,  since  the  recent appointments approved by the General Meeting of May 3, 2023, now  comprises  14  members,  including  12  appointed  by  the General Meeting, and the evolving regulatory context requiring an increased  number  of  meetings  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and/or certain Committees (see Chapter 6, 14 th resolution proposed to the General Meeting).\n\nThis  policy,  unchanged  from  the  2023  policy,  provides  for  fixed remuneration (prorated if the term of office commences or comes to an end during the course of the year) allocated to the Directors. This  remuneration  is  increased  for  the  Lead  Director,  and  an additional fixed remuneration is allocated to the Chairs of the four Board Committees, to take account of the level of responsibilities incurred and the work involved as a result of these duties.\n\nIt also includes a variable remuneration, which is the highest part, on the basis of each Director's attendance at the meetings of the Board  and  the  Committees/working  group,  pursuant  to  the provisions of the AFEP/MEDEF Code, in the form of the allocation of a fixed amount for each attendance at a meeting.\n\nThe  fixed  remuneration  allocated  to  Committee  Chairmen  is harmonized, along with the amount of remuneration allocated for attendance at each Committee meeting, and remote participation in  meetings  is  remunerated  in  the  same  way  as  face-to-face attendance in order to take into account the quality of the means of communication which allows members connecting by videoconference  to  participate  in  meetings  and  take  part  in discussions  under  qualitative  conditions  equivalent  to  physical meetings. While it does not alter the preference of the Board and its  members  to  attend  meetings  in  person  where  possible,  it recognizes the advances in communication technologies.\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## Remuneration of L'Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\nIn order to take account of the distance for Directors coming from abroad,  a  fixed  amount  per  trip  is  added  to  the  variable remuneration  for  such  Directors  if  attending  in  person  (the remuneration  for  intercontinental  travel  being  higher  than  that provided for intracontinental travel; it may be readjusted to remain competitive at the international level).\n\nThis policy promotes attendance and effective participation by the Directors in the work of the Board and Committees, which fosters dialog between the Directors and with the management team, and, more generally, a complete understanding by the members of the Company's  activities  and  issues,  including  any  social  and environmental  issues,  which  ensures  solid  governance  for  the Company's sustainability.\n\nThe  recognition  of  the  role  of  the  Lead  Director,  who  receives additional  remuneration  in  this  regard,  reflects  the  importance accorded by the Group to his governance tasks, in connection with the meetings of the Board and the Appointments and Governance Committee,  and  in  an  informal  manner  between  such  meetings, thus  promoting  best  governance  practices.  The  consideration,  in the  remuneration  policy,  of  the  work  of  the  four  Specialized Committees  is  evidence  of  the  importance  accorded  to  the preparation of the principal Board decisions, whether in terms of the  proper  running  of  the  governing  bodies,  the  review  of  the financial  statements  and  the  financial  situation,  the  risk  analysis, the consideration of the societal and environmental issues across all  the  Group's  activities  or  indeed  the  determination  of  an incentivizing  remuneration  policy  for  the  Executive  Officers, including objectives in line with those of the Company.\n\nAccordingly,  the  remuneration  policy  for  Directors,  which  is balanced and incentivizing, contributes to the quality of the Board's work, the latter being thus able to determine the orientations of the Company's  activity  and  its  strategy  in  the  best  interests  of  the Company, its employees and all the stakeholders.\n\nThe Company Officers do not receive remuneration in respect of their  office  as  Director  or  as  Chairman  of  a  Committee/working group  while  they  perform  executive  duties  at  L'Air  Liquide  S.A. Moreover, pursuant to the provisions in force at the Group which apply  to  all  the  employees  who  perform  duties  on  the  Group companies'  Boards  of  Directors,  and  pursuant  to  the  applicable agreements with the stakeholders, the employee Directors do not receive remuneration in respect of their office as Director.

Performance share plans for its employees have been in place since 2008, and have been open to the Executive Officers and the members of the Executive Committee since 2015.\n\nThese  attributions  are  decided  upon  by  the  Board  of  Directors pursuant  to  the  authorizations  granted  by  the  General  Meeting, and most recently by the Combined General Meeting of May 4, 2022 for a period of 38 months.\n\nSince  2019,  the  Board  of  Directors  has  decided,  in  accordance with the general market trend, to grant performance shares only (instead of a mix of stock options and performance shares) to all beneficiaries, in order to simplify and standardize the scheme.\n\nThe  system  for  the  LTI  plans  is  aimed  at  three  sets  of beneficiaries:\n\n- \u25a0 the  Company's  Executive  Officer,  for  whom  the  attribution  of LTI and its evolution over time continue to be valued in terms of the IFRS valuation (and not as attributed volumes), all stock option and performance share plans included;\n- \u25a0 the  members  of  the  Executive  Committee  and  the  Group's managers who hold positions with a high level of responsibility or  who make special contributions to the Group, all of whom benefit,  beginning  in  2015  for  the  Executive  Committee  and since  2019/2020  for  the  other  beneficiaries,  from  attribution exclusively in the form of performance shares;\n- \u25a0 the specific contributors, such as those employees distinguished by  the  quality  of  their  conduct  in  exceptional  situations,  the inventors  and  innovators,  the  middle  managers,  as  well  as  an expanded category of new employee beneficiaries.\n\nThe criteria used to draw up the lists of the beneficiary employees reflect  the  jobs  and  the  geographical  areas  in  which  the  Group carries out its activities and the specific contribution, the particular potential,  or  the  individual  or  collective  conduct  of  the  persons concerned, which has been noted in exceptional situations. The lists of beneficiary employees are also drawn up with the desire to ensure  a  certain  rotation  and  an  expansion  of  the  beneficiary population. Accordingly, more than one-third of the beneficiaries of the plans dated September 28, 2023 are employees who had not been awarded stock options/performance shares during the last five years.\n\n## ATTRIBUTIONS OF PERFORMANCE SHARES ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2023\n\n| Total number of performance shares   | 341,249   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|\n| % of the share capital               | 0.07%     |\n| Number of grants  (a)                | 2,693     |\n| % of employees                       | 3.96%     |\n\n- (a) Including 2,637 distinct beneficiaries.\n\nPerformance conditions apply to all the performance shares which are awarded to all the beneficiaries. They are described on pages 177 to 178.\n\nAt  December  31,  2023,  the  aggregate  total  of  outstanding performance shares for which the definitive grant date has not yet occurred  and  the  outstanding  stock  options  has  not  yet  been exercised  corresponds  to  the  number  of  shares  representing 0.43% of the share capital on this date.",

Stock option plans (Information to be regarded as the Special Report of the Board of Directors within the meaning of article L. 225-184 of the French Commercial Code)\n\nPursuant to the decisions of the Board of Directors, following the authorizations of the General Meeting and on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Company has adopted plans granting a certain number of stock options to certain employees of the Company and its subsidiaries worldwide, including the Executive Officer.\n\nThese stock options are granted for a price which cannot be lower than the average opening market price over the 20 trading days preceding the attribution date. The maximum exercise period is 10 years since the stock option plan dated October 14, 2011.\n\nThe stock options cannot be exercised before a minimum period of four years after they are awarded. The Board of Directors has the power to terminate this lock-in period if there is a takeover bid\n\nfor  the  Company's  shares  or  a  merger  or  takeover  of  the Company.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  the  number  of  outstanding  share options  granted  by  the  Board  of  Directors  under  the  plans approved  by  Annual  General  Meetings  amounted  to  894,980 options after adjustment (average price of 73.91 euros), or 0.17% of share capital.\n\nOf  the  total  stock  options  authorized  for  issue  by  the  General Meeting  of  May  4,  2022  there  was  still  a  potential  attribution  of 10,490,336  stock  options  as  at  December  31,  2023  (no  stock options  were  attributed  since  2019,  as  the  Board  of  Directors decided to only attribute performance shares).\n\nTABLE 8.

Performance share plans (information to be regarded as the Special Report of the Board of Directors within the meaning of article L. 225-197-4 of the French Commercial Code)\n\n## 3.1.   DESCRIPTION\n\nSince 2008, performance share attributions have been designed to  retain  and  motivate  talented  employees  dynamically  and  to reward performance over the medium term.\n\nThe Extraordinary General Meeting of May 4, 2022 authorized the Board to attribute performance shares to the Group's employees, within an upper attribution limit equal to 0.5% of the share capital over 38 months; pursuant to this upper limit, it fixed the limit on the  number  of  shares  that  can  be  attributed  to  the  Executive Officers  over  the  same  period,  which  amounts  to  0.1%  of  the share capital.\n\nFor  each  attribution,  the  Board  determines  two  different  plan regulations (the 'France' Plan and the 'World' Plan) which govern the  attribution  of  performance  shares  to  the  beneficiaries determined by the Board of Directors. The 'France' and 'World' Plans mainly differ in the number of years of presence required, and to the correlative absence of any holding requirement for the 'World' Plan as described below.\n\nThe performance shares are accompanied by:\n\n- \u25a0 a continued service requirement during the vesting period: the shares granted to a beneficiary shall only finally vest if he or she  has  been  an  employee  or  corporate  officer  of  a  Group company during a vesting period, calculated as from the grant date,  of  three  years  for  'France'  Plan  beneficiaries  and  four years for 'World' Plan beneficiaries. In the event of retirement, the  beneficiary  retains  his  rights,  being  no  longer  required  to satisfy the continued service requirement;\n\n- \u25a0 performance conditions which relate, since the first attribution in 2008, to all performance shares awarded to any beneficiary; see  the  performance  conditions  in  the  summary  table  for attribution of performance shares below;\n- \u25a0 a  holding  obligation:  with  effect  from  the  definitive  attribution date, the beneficiaries of the 'France' Plan have an obligation to hold the shares for an additional two years during which the said shares cannot be transferred (other than in the event of a death or disability).\n\nTo  date,  the  performance  shares  delivered  have  been  treasury shares  issued  as  part  of  the  Company's  buyback  program  (see page 414).\n\nThe  outstanding  performance  shares  attributed  by  the  Board  of Directors  pursuant  to  the  authorizations  voted  by  the  General Meetings, for which the definitive attribution has not yet occurred, amounted, after adjustment, to 1,340,496 shares as at December 31, 2023, i.e. 0.26% of the shares that make up the share capital.\n\nOut of the total performance shares whose award was authorized by  the  General  Meeting  of  May  4,  2022  for  38  months, 1,820,740 performance shares remained potentially available for award as at December 31, 2023.",

Profit-sharing\n\nProfit-sharing  and  incentive  schemes  have  been  organized  for many years in Group companies in France and paid almost 63.2 million  euros  for  2022  performance.  This  year  these  schemes cover over 98% of employees.\n\nUnder the Company Savings Plans, Group employees in France can  make  payments  to  dedicated  and  diversified  investment funds, on a voluntary basis or based on profit-sharing, incentives and,  where  applicable,  Company  contributions  and  thus  benefit from  the  preferential  tax  regime  applicable  in  consideration  for locking-in their assets over a period of five years.\n\nIn  2023, L'Air  Liquide  S.A .  distributed  9.5  million  euros  gross (excluding Company contributions) in respect of profit-sharing and incentives. Some  1,272  employees  benefited  from  these schemes. Company contributions to the Company Savings Plan are  negotiated  every  year  and  amounted  to  nearly  1.3  million euros gross in 2023. These payments correspond to an average amount of 7,465 euros gross per employee excluding Company contribution.\n\n## 2.   Employee shareholding\n\nThe Group is keen to involve its  employees  in  its  development. These employee share ownership offers contribute significantly to increasing employee motivation and a sense of belonging to the Group.\n\nSince 1986, the Company has regularly performed share capital increases reserved for Group employees, for which subscription is offered  at  a  preferential  rate.  The  most  recent  capital  increase, conducted  in  November  2023,  resulted  in  the  subscription  of 746,401  shares  by  22,093  Group  employees  and  retirees, representing 32.49% of the eligible population in 57 countries.\n\nSince 2021, the employees of L'Air Liquide S.A . may invest their incentive and profit-sharing (excluding Company contributions) in the Air Liquide Supplementary Retirement Savings Plan. In 2023, 492 thousand euros were invested in this plan.\n\nIn 2023, L'Air Liquide S.A. employees invested 90% of their profitsharing  and  incentives  in  savings  plans,  respectively  in  bondweighted  assets  (22%)  and  equity-weighted  assets  (28%) (excluding the AL SAVINGS fund).\n\nA  total  of  50%  of  employee  savings  was  invested  in  corporate mutual funds holding only Air Liquide shares (AL SAVINGS fund) compared with 46% last year.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the share of capital held by Group employees and  former  employees  was  estimated  at  2.9%,  of  which  2.1% corresponded  (within  the  meaning  of  article  L.  225-102  of  the French  Commercial  Code)  to  shares  subscribed  by  employees under  employee-reserved  capital  increases  or  held  through mutual funds. The percentage of Group employees holding L'Air Liquide S.A. shares totaled around 53% of the workforce.\n\nAir  Liquide  wishes  to  pursue  this  strategy  and  further  the development  of  its  employee  share  ownership,  by  regularly offering share capital increases to employees.\n\nIn  France,  the  shares  subscribed  in  these  capital  increases  are also  eligible  for  the  preferential  tax  regime  applicable  provided that they are blocked over a period of five years, while those held abroad are governed by the legal regulations prevailing  in  each relevant country.\n\n## 3.   Capital increase reserved for employees (2023) Additional report\n\nDear Shareholder,\n\nWe  present  to  you  this  additional  report  in  accordance  with article R. 225-116 of the French Commercial Code, on the use we made  of  the  delegation  of  authority  that  you  entrusted  to  the Board of Directors at the time of its Combined General Meeting of May 3, 2023, in the twenty-first resolution, for a maximum period of  26  months,  in  order,  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  article L. 225-138-1 of French Commercial Code and articles L. 3332-18 et seq .  of  the  French Labor Code, to increase the share capital,\n\non one or more occasions, up to a maximum of 4 million shares with  a  par  value  of  5.50  euros  each,  the  subscription  of  these shares  being  reserved  for  employees  of  the  Company  and companies, French or foreign, related to it within the meaning of articles L. 225-180 of the French Commercial Code and L. 3344-1 of  the  French  Labor  Code,  members  of  a  company  or  group savings plan.",

MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OPERATION\n\nThe capital increase reserved for employees is governed by the applicable legal and regulatory provisions of the French Savings Plan  (PE  France)  and  the  International  Group  Savings  Plan (PEGI).\n\nSubscription to this capital increase was open to employees and eligible  corporate  officers  of  the  Group's  French  and  foreign companies whose share capital or voting rights were more than 50% held by L'Air Liquide S.A. and members of the PE France or PEGI, provided that these employees have at least three months of seniority at the closing date of the subscription period (stricter seniority conditions being set by certain countries in application of local regulations). In addition, the operation was open to retirees of  the  Group's  French  subsidiaries  that  had  belonged  to  the  PE France, provided that these retirees had retained assets in the Air Liquide Group PE France.\n\nYou are reminded that by decisions of the Chairman and CEO of March 30, 2009, November 2, 2010, October 29, 2013, March 16, 2016,  October  30,  2018  and  October  30,  2021,  certain companies, directly or indirectly held at between 40% and 50% by L'Air Liquide S.A., were admitted to the PE France or PEGI.\n\n## Employee savings and share ownership\n\nBy decision of the Chief Executive Officer on October 30, 2023, this option was also granted to a Group company located in China whose  employees  were  included  in  the  scope  of  the  2023 operation.\n\nHowever, for  reasons  related  to  the  local  context,  employees  of the  Group's  foreign  subsidiaries  in  the  following  countries  were not  able  to  participate  in  the  operation:  Qatar,  Nigeria,  Vietnam, Senegal,  Ivory  Coast,  Ghana,  Mali,  Burkina  Faso,  Benin,  Togo, Cameroon,  Republic  of  the  Congo,  Democratic  Republic  of  the Congo, Gabon, Botswana and Madagascar.\n\nThe subscription price was set at 126.49 euros (134.40 euros for the United States) per share, corresponding to the average of the opening prices of the Air Liquide share over the 20 trading days preceding  the  date  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's  decision setting the dates of the subscription period, i.e. 158.11 euros per share  ('the  Reference  Price')  less  20%  (15%  for  the  United States) and rounded up to the nearest euro cent.\n\nThe  maximum  subscription  amount  per  eligible  employee  was limited  to  25%  of  the  gross  annual  remuneration  of  each subscriber,  in  accordance  with  the  regulations  applicable  to savings  plans  (in  France  this  limit  includes  all  other  voluntary payments  made  into  company  or  group  savings  plans,  during 2023). A matching contribution was proposed by L'Air Liquide S.A. and the French subsidiaries  that  had  joined  the  PE  France  and adopted  the  2023  addendum  on  this  point,  at  a  rate  of  1  free share  for  1  or  2  shares  subscribed,  2  free  shares  for  3,  4  or  5 shares subscribed, 3 free shares for 6 or more shares subscribed, with a maximum of 3 free shares per employee.\n\nThe share subscription period was open from November 6, 2023 to November 16, 2023 inclusive (until noon, Paris time).\n\nPursuant to the powers granted by the Board of Directors at its meeting of  July  26,  2023,  the  capital  increase  was  recorded  on December 7, 2023.\n\nSubscription  requests  being  higher  than  the  limit  of  750,000 shares  decided  by  the  Board  of  Directors  in  its  aforementioned decisions  (namely  1,000,029  shares  at  a  price  of  126.49  euros requested  by  all  subscribers  outside  the  United  States,  and 93,721  shares  at  a  price  of  134.40  euros  requested  by subscribers  in  the  United  States,  i.e.  a  total  number  of  shares requested  of  1,093,750  shares),  it  was  decided  to  cap subscription  requests  higher  than  the  average  subscription,  in accordance with the terms set by the Chief Executive Officer in his decision of October 30, 2023.\n\nThe total number of new shares issued is therefore 746,401 each  with  a  par  value  of  5.50  euros,  for  a  total  number  of 22,093 subscribers.\n\nThe  new  shares  issued  are  Air  Liquide  ordinary  shares  of  the same  class  as  and  immediately  assimilated  with  Air  Liquide shares already admitted to trading on the Euronext Paris market (Compartment  A).  They  will  be  admitted  to  trading  on  the Euronext Paris market under the same ISIN code (FR0000120073)  as  the  former Air  Liquide  shares  and  will  give entitlement  to  any  dividend  distribution  decided  by  the  General Meeting  subsequent  to  the  date  of  the  decision  to  record  the capital increase (i.e. December 7, 2023). The new shares will be subject  to  all  the  provisions  of  the  Company's  articles  of association.",

IMPACT OF THE ISSUE OF 746,401 SHARES ON THE POSITION OF SHAREHOLDERS AND THEIR SHARE OF EQUITY AND THEORETICAL IMPACT ON THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SHARE\n\n## 3.3.1.  Impact on equity holdings in the Company's share capital\n\nBased  on  the  share  capital  of  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  as  of  December  7,  2023  before  the  capital  increase  reserved  for  employees,  i.e. 523,759,188 shares, the impact of the issue on the equity holding of a shareholder holding 1% of the share capital of L'Air Liquide S.A. prior to the issue and not subscribing thereto is as follows:\n\n|                                                                    | Equity holding of shareholders  (in %)   | Equity holding of shareholders  (in %)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                    | Undiluted basis                          | Diluted basis  (a)                       |\n| Before issuance of new shares resulting from this capital increase | 1%                                       | 0.996%                                   |\n| After issuance of new shares resulting from this capital increase  | 0.999%                                   | 0.994%                                   |\n\n## 3.3.2.  Impact of the issue on the share of equity\n\nBased on the Company's equity as shown in the Company financial statements at December 31, 2023, the impact of the issue on the share of equity for the holder of one Air Liquide share prior to the issuance and not subscribing to said issuance is as follows:\n\n|                                                                    | Share of equity  (in euros)   | Share of equity  (in euros)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                                    | Undiluted basis               | Diluted basis  (a)            |\n| Before issuance of new shares resulting from this capital increase | 20.22                         | 20.26                         |\n| After issuance of new shares resulting from this capital increase  | 20.37                         | 20.41                         |\n\n## 3.3.3.   Theoretical impact on the market value of the Air Liquide share\n\nThe theoretical impact of the issue of 746,401 shares at the issue price on the market value of the share is calculated as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Theoretical share price before the operation = average of the 20 opening prices of the Air Liquide share preceding the date of the Chief Executive Officer's decision setting the subscription price and the dates of the subscription period (i.e. the  average  price  opening  of  the  share  between  October  2, 2023 and October 27, 2023). This theoretical share price was 158.11 euros.\n- \u25a0 Share  price  after  the  operation  =  [(theoretical  share  price before the operation x number of shares before the operation) + (issue price x number of new shares)] / (number of shares before the operation + number new shares).\n\nThe  average  issue  price  of  the  reserved  capital  increase  was 127.24 euros.\n\nGiven  these  assumptions,  the  theoretical  market  value  of  the share after the operation would be 158.07 euros for a theoretical share price before the transaction of 158.11 euros.\n\nIt is specified that this theoretical approach is given purely as an indication  and  in  no  way  prejudges  future  changes  in  the  share price.\n\nThe  dilutive  effect  of  this  share  issue  will  be  neutralized  by buybacks of its own shares by the Company, carried out during the  2023  and  2024  fiscal  years,  as  part  of  the  share  buyback programs  presented  to  the  Board  of  Directors  and  already approved  by  the  General  Meeting  (General  Meetings  of  May  4, 2022 and May 3, 2023).\n\nParis, February 19, 2024\n\nThe Board of Directors of L'Air Liquide S.A.",

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.\n\nYear ended December 31, 2023\n\nTo the Shareholders,\n\nIn  our  capacity  as  Statutory  Auditors  of  your  Company,  and  in compliance  with  article  R.225-116  of  the  French  Commercial Code (Code de commerce), we hereby present you an additional report to our March 1, 2023 report, on the issue of ordinary shares and  other  equity  securities  giving  rights  to  the  share  capital reserved for the employees of the Company and of any French of foreign  companies  related  to  it  within  the  meaning  of  article L. 225-180 of the French Commercial Code and article L. 3344-1 of  the  French  Labor  Code  (Code  du  travail),  provided  that  such employees are members of a company or group savings plan, as approved  by  the  Combined  General  Meeting  of  the  Company's Shareholder's Meeting of May 3, 2023.\n\nThis  share  capital  increase  was  submitted  to  your  approval  in compliance with articles L. 225-129-6 of the French Commercial Code and L.3332-18 of the French Labor Code.\n\nThis  Meeting  delegated  authority  to  your  Board  of  Directors  to decide on such an operation within a period of 26 months and for a maximum amount of 22 million euros (i.e. 4 million shares at a nominal value of 5.50 euros).\n\nUnder this delegation of authority,  at  its  July  26,  2023  meeting,  the Board of Directors decided a share capital increase reserved for the employees members of a company or group savings plan which will be limited to 750,000 shares with a nominal value of 5.50 euros. At this  date,  the  Board  of  Directors  also  subdelegated  to  your  Chief Executive Officer all necessary powers to proceed with this operation.\n\nExercising  this  subdelegation,  your  Chief  Executive  Officer decided on October 30, 2023, to proceed with this operation.\n\nSubscription to this capital increase was open to employees and eligible  corporate  officers  of  the  Group's  French  and  foreign companies whose share capital or voting rights were more than 50% held by L'Air Liquide S.A. and members of the PE France or PEGI, provided that these employees have at least three months of seniority at the closing date of the subscription period (stricter seniority conditions being set by certain countries in application of local regulations).\n\nIt is to be noted that, pursuant to decisions made by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on March 30, 2009, November 2, 2010, October 29, 2013, March 16, 2016, October 30, 2018 and October 30, 2021 certain companies, in which L' Air Liquide S.A. directly or indirectly holds 40% to 50%, were allowed to join to the PE France or the PEGI.\n\nBy decision of the Chief Executive Officer on October 30, 2023, this option  was  also  granted  to  a  Group  companies  located  in  China whose employees were included in the scope of the 2023 operation.\n\nHowever, for  reasons  related  to  the  local  context,  employees  of the  Group's  foreign  subsidiaries  in  the  following  countries  were not  able  to  participate  in  the  operation:  Qatar,  Nigeria,  Vietnam,\n\nSenegal,  Ivory  Coast,  Ghana,  Mali,  Burkina  Faso,  Benin,  Togo, Cameroon,  Republic  of  Congo,  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo, Gabon, Botswana, and Madagascar.\n\nOn  December  7,  2023,  your  Chief  Executive  Officer  noted  the issuance  of  746,401  shares  with  a  nominal  value  of  5.50  euros and  a  subscription  price  of  126.49  euros  (134.40  euros  for  the United  States)  which  corresponds  to  an  average  issuance subscription price of 127.24 euros.\n\nIt  is  the  Board  of  Directors'  responsibility  to  prepare  a  report  in accordance  with  articles  R.  225 -115  and  R.  225 -116  and R.22-10-31 of the French Commercial Code  (Code  de commerce).

        "page_content": "## Accounting principles\n\n## BASIS FOR PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nDue to its listing on the Paris Stock Exchange and pursuant to EC Regulation  No.  1606/2002  of  July  19,  2002,  the  Consolidated Financial Statements of the Air Liquide Group for the year ended December 31, 2023 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), as endorsed by the European Union as of December 31, 2023. The IFRS standards and  interpretations  as  adopted  by  the  European  Union  are available at the following website:\n\nhttps://finance.ec.europa.eu/regulation-and-supervision/financialservices-legislation/implementing-and-delegated-acts/ international-accounting-standards-regulation\\_en\n\nThe Group has not anticipated any new standards, amendments to existing standards or new interpretations published by the IASB but not yet approved or not yet mandatory in the European Union, as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Financial Statements are presented in millions of euros. They were approved by the Board of Directors on February 19, 2024. They will be submitted for approval to the Shareholders' Meeting on April 30, 2024.\n\n## NEW IFRS AND INTERPRETATIONS\n\n- 1.   Standards, interpretations and amendments endorsed by the European Union whose application is mandatory as of January 1, 2023\n\nThe following texts have no significant impact for the Group:\n\n- \u25a0 amendments  to  IAS  12  'Deferred  Tax  related  to Assets  and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction', issued on May 7, 2021;\n- \u25a0 amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements', issued on February 12, 2021;\n- \u25a0 amendments  to  IAS  8  'Definition  of  Accounting  Estimates', issued on February 12, 2021;\n- \u25a0 amendments to IAS 12 'International Tax Reform-Pillar Two Model Rules', issued on May 23, 2023. The international tax reform  developed  by  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation and  Development  (OECD),  referred  to  as  'Pillar  2'  aims  to establish a minimum taxation of multinational groups at 15% in the form of a Top-up tax in each jurisdiction where such groups operate. These rules will have to be transposed by the various States. Within the European Union, a directive was adopted at the end of 2022 (transposed in France by the Finance Act (\"Loi de finances\") for 2024) for application to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2024. The Group is affected by the Pillar 2 reform and will have to ensure that it is subject to a minimum tax rate of 15% in the countries where it operates. The Group is  currently  carrying  out  a  project  to  identify  the  impacts  and organize  the  processes  to  comply  with  these  obligations.  On the basis of the Pillar 2 model rules to date, the financial data of  2023  and  the  tax  rates  currently  in  force  in  the  countries where  it  is  established,  as  well  as  subject  to  regulatory clarifications to come, the Group does not expect this reform to have  a  significant  impact  on  its  effective  global  tax  rate.  No deferred taxes have  been  recognized  in  the  Group's Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2023 in respect of any potential additional taxes.\n\nIn addition, the following texts are not applicable to the Group:\n\n- \u25a0 IFRS 17 \"Insurance Contracts\", issued on May 18, 2017;\n- \u25a0 amendments  to  IFRS  17  \"First-time  adoption  of  IFRS  17  and IFRS 9 - Comparative information\", issued on December 9, 2021.\n\n## 2.   Standards, interpretations and amendments endorses by the European Union whose application is optional in 2023\n\nThe Group Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 do not include any potential impacts from the standards,  interpretations  and  amendments  endorsed  by  the European Union as of December 31, 2023, for which adoption is only mandatory as of fiscal years beginning after January 1, 2023. These texts are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current', 'Classification  of  Liabilities  as  Current  or  Non-current  Deferral  of  Effective  Date'  and  'Non-current  Liabilities  with Covenants',  issued  on  January  23,  2020,  July  15,  2020  and October 31, 2022 respectively;\n- \u25a0 amendments  to  IFRS  16  'Lease  Liability  in  a  Sale  and Leaseback' issued on September 22, 2022.\n\n## 3.   Standards, interpretations and amendments not yet endorses by the European Union\n\nThe impacts on the Financial Statements of texts published by the IASB  as  of  December  31,  2023  and  not  yet  endorsed  by  the European Union are currently being analyzed. These texts are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 amendments  to  IAS  7  and  IFRS  7  \"Vendor  Finance Arrangements\", issued on May 25, 2023;\n- \u25a0 amendments  to  IAS  21  \"The  effects  of  changes  in  foreign exchange rates: lack of exchangeability\", issued on August 15, 2023.\n\n## USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nThe  preparation  of  the  Financial  Statements  requires  Group  or subsidiary  management  to  make  estimates  and  use  certain assumptions  which  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  carrying amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  recorded  in  the  consolidated balance sheet, the notes related to these assets and liabilities, the profit  and  expense  items  in  the  income  statement  and  the commitments  relating  to  the  period-end.  Balance  sheet,  income statement and cash flow statement line items could differ should the subsequent actual results differ from the estimates. The most significant estimates and assumptions concern namely:\n\n- \u25a0 the estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment used for calculation of depreciation and  amortization: these estimates  are  described  in  section  5.e  of  the  accounting policies;\n- \u25a0 the  assumptions  used  to  determine  provisions  for  employee retirement benefit obligations: the actuarial assumptions used (employee turnover, mortality, retirement age, salary increase, etc.),  and  the  discount  rates  used  to  determine  the  present value  of  obligations,  as  described  in  section  9.b  of  the accounting policies and in note 23.3;\n- \u25a0 the estimates and assumptions concerning assets' impairment tests,  as  described  in  section  5.f.  of  the  accounting  policies and in note 10.2;",

They are described in section 5.g of the accounting principles.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group  considers  that  climate  risks  are  material, even though their quantified impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements  of  the  Group  is  not  material.  The  Group  takes  into account  these  risks  in  its  closing  assumptions  and  incorporates their  potential  impact  in  its  Financial  Statements.  In  particular, climate  risks  are  taken  into  account  when  carrying  out  closing procedures,  in  particular  the  analysis  of  the  useful  lives  of property, plant and equipment used for calculation of depreciation and  amortization,  the  review  of  the  estimates  and  assumptions concerning assets' impairment tests, and the risk assessment to determine the amount of provisions for contingencies and losses. The  consideration  of  climate  risks  by  the  Group  is  described  in particular in note 31.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared under the historical cost convention, except for financial assets and liabilities measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  or  through  other comprehensive  income  in  accordance  with  IAS  32/IFRS  9.  The carrying amount of other assets and liabilities hedged against fair value  risk  is  adjusted  to  take  into  account  the  changes  in  fair value attributable to the hedged risks. In addition, the principles of fairness, going concern, and consistency were applied.\n\n## 1.  CONSOLIDATION METHODS\n\nThe consolidation methods used are:\n\n- \u25a0 full consolidation method for subsidiaries;\n- \u25a0 assets, liabilities, expenses and revenue of joint operations are recognized in relation to the Group's interest in these entities;\n- \u25a0 equity method for joint ventures and associates.\n\n## a.  Subsidiaries\n\nAll the subsidiaries or companies in which the Air Liquide Group exercises  exclusive  control  are  fully  consolidated.  Control  exists when all the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities;\n- \u25a0 the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity;\n- \u25a0 the  Group  has  the  ability  to  use  its  power  over  the  entity  so that it affects the amount of the returns.\n\nCompanies  are  fully  consolidated  from  the  date  on  which  the Group  obtains  control  and  until  the  date  on  which  control  is transferred outside the Group.\n\n## b.  Joint operations\n\nJoint  operations  are  joint  arrangements  whereby  the Air  Liquide Group  has  joint  control  with  one  or  several  parties  through  a contractual  agreement,  which  gives  it  rights  to  the  assets  and obligations for the liabilities of the entity.\n\nAssets,  liabilities,  expenses  and  revenue  of  joint  operations  are recognized  in  relation  to  the  Group's  interest  in  these  entities. These  amounts  are  recorded  on  each  relevant  line  of  the Financial Statements as for the consolidated entities.\n\n## c.   Joint ventures\n\nJoint  ventures  are  joint  arrangements  whereby  the  Air  Liquide Group  has  joint  control  with  one  or  several  parties  through  a contractual agreement, which gives it rights to the net assets of the entity.\n\nJoint  ventures  are  consolidated  using  the  equity  method.  Under this  one,  the  net  assets  and  net  profit  of  a  company  are recognized pro rata to the interest held by the Group in the share capital.\n\nOn acquisition of an investment in a joint venture, goodwill relating to  the  joint  venture  is  included  in  the  carrying  amount  of  the investment.\n\n## d.  Associates\n\nAssociates are investments over which the Air Liquide Group has significant influence (generally when the Group has more than a 20% interest), but no control.\n\nAssociates are consolidated using the equity method. Under this one, the net assets and net profit of a company are recognized pro rata to the interest held by the Group in the share capital.\n\nOn  acquisition  of  an  investment  in  an  associate,  the  goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates are prepared as of December 31.\n\n## 2.  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES AND TRANSLATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF COMPANIES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS NOT THE EURO\n\nThe functional currency of an entity is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it carries out its operations. In the majority of cases, the functional currency corresponds to the local currency.  However,  a  functional  currency  other  than  the  local currency  can  be  retained  for  certain  entities,  provided  that  it represents  the  currency  of  the  main  transactions  carried  out  by the  entity  and  that  it  ensures  faithful  representation  of  its economic  environment. Foreign currency transactions are recognized according to the following principles:\n\n- \u25a0 foreign currency transactions are translated by each company into its functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction;\n- \u25a0 at  year-end,  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the closing exchange rate.\n\nExchange  differences  relating  to  commercial  transactions  are recognized in operating profit. For financial transactions, exchange  differences  are  recognized  in  financial  income  and expenses except for differences resulting from the hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity that are directly recognized in equity until the net investment is removed from the consolidation scope.",

REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe  analysis  of  revenue  recognition  is  based  on  the  Group's activities, as follow:\n\n## a.  Gas & Services\n\nThe  supply  of  gas  involves  local  production  in  order  to  limit transport  costs.  Therefore,  Air  Liquide  gas  production  units  are located  throughout  the  world  and  can  supply  several  types  of customers and industries, with the relevant volumes and services required:\n\n## Large Industries\n\nThis business is characterized by the supply of large quantities of gas  contracted  for  a  period  of  15  years  or  longer  with  a  limited number  of  customers.  The  Group  guarantees  a  high  level  of reliability  and  availability  of  gas  supply  with  continued  service, over the long-term. In return, these contracts include guaranteed minimum  volumes  through  firm  purchase  clauses  (take-or-pay). Due to the volume of gas to be supplied, Air Liquide supplies its Large Industries customers directly by pipelines, from a dedicated plant or different plants connected by a network.\n\nThese plants represent significant investments that are generally made  in  a  way  to  share  the  production  assets  with  the  other business  lines  of  the  Group,  particularly  the  Industrial  Merchant business, or intended to serve the customers in an industrial basin that  is  connected  on  a  pipeline  network.  In  these  cases,  the assets are not identified under the meaning of IFRS 16 'Leases' and  no  lease  contract  is  contained  in  the  contracts  with customers.  When  the  customer's  gas  supply  comes  from  a dedicated plant, the Group may decide on the use of these plants under the meaning of IFRS 16 'Leases'. Consequently, the gas supply contracts for the Large Industries business do not contain leases.\n\nCustomers  of  the  Large  Industries  business  simultaneously receive  and  consume  the  benefits  granted  by  the  gas  supply service  or  its  availability.  As  a  result,  the  revenue  recognition related  to  these  contracts  occurs  when  the  gas  is  supplied  or when the reserved capacity is made available.\n\n## Industrial Merchant, Healthcare and Electronics\n\nThe  Industrial  Merchant  business  relies  mainly  on  the  gas production capacity of Large Industries and thereafter develops its own distribution logistics. This business is characterized by a wide range of customers and markets. The contract terms can be up to five years for cylinders and liquid gas supply and up to 15 years for small on-site gas generators.\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nHealthcare  business  supplies  medical  gases,  hygiene  products, services as well as medical devices to hospitals and patients in their homes. It also produces and distributes healthcare specialty ingredients  for  the  cosmetics,  pharmaceutical  and  vaccine markets.\n\nThe  Electronics  business  supplies  its  customers  with  (i)  carrier gases with a business model based on long-term contracts and on guaranteed minimum volumes with take-or-pay type clauses, (ii)  electronics  specialty  materials  in  the  form  of  pure  or  mixed gases,  (iii)  advanced  materials,  (iv)  equipment  and  installations and  (v)  services  notably  on-site  quality  control  and  fluid management services.\n\nFor  safety  and  quality  reasons, Air  Liquide  supplies  gas  with  its own  equipment  (small  generators,  storage  tank,  cylinders). Customers have no right of control on the identified assets under the meaning of IFRS 16 'Leases'.\n\nConsequently, the gas supply contracts for these businesses do not contain leases and the revenue recognition occurs as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 gas  supply:  the  revenue  recognition  occurs  when  the  gas  is supplied or when the reserved capacity is made available;\n- \u25a0 sale  of  standard  equipment  and  materials:  the  revenue recognition  occurs  when  the  control  of  these  equipment  and materials  is  transferred,  which  generally  takes  place  at  their delivery;\n- \u25a0 specific  equipment  and  installations:  the  transfer  of  control occurs  over  the  time,  together  with  their  construction. Consequently,  the  revenue  recognition  occurs  based  on  the stage of completion of the contracts at the balance sheet date;\n- \u25a0 service:  the  revenue  recognition  occurs  when  the  service  is provided.\n\n## b.  Engineering & Construction\n\nAir  Liquide  enters  into  contracts  to  design  and  build  production units  worldwide  for  the  Group's  own  account  and  for  third-party customers.\n\nThe control of installations is transferred progressively with their design/construction.  Consequently,  the  revenue  recognition  is based on the stage of completion of the contracts at the balance sheet date. The costs associated are recognized as an expense in the period when incurred. The stage of completion is assessed by using the ratio of contract costs incurred at the balance sheet date versus total estimated contract costs.\n\nThe margin realized at the stage of completion is recognized only when it can be reliably measured. When it is probable that total contract  costs  will  exceed  total  contract  revenue,  the  expected loss  is  immediately  recognized  as  a  provision  for  onerous contracts.\n\n## c.   Global Markets & Technologies\n\nThe  Global  Markets  &  Technologies  business  focuses  on  new markets  requiring  a  global  approach.  This  business  is  growing mainly within the following markets:\n\n- \u25a0 new markets relating to the energy transition, as well as space, aerospace, and extreme cryogenics markets. As a consequence  of  its  nature,  the  analysis  of  the  revenue recognition  on  this  market  is  done  on  a  case-by-case  basis depending on the nature of performance obligations;\n- \u25a0 gas  usages  by  the  actors  in  the  maritime  sector,  namely offshore  oil  and  gas  platforms,  offshore  wind  turbines,  or cryogenic  transportation  by  sea.  The  analysis  carried  out  for Industrial Merchant is applicable to this market.",

Income tax expense\n\nThe  tax  rate  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  fiscal  regulations enacted or substantively enacted at the fiscal year closing date in each of the countries where the Group's companies carry out their business.\n\nThe Group's applicable tax rate corresponds to the average of the theoretical  tax  rates  in  force  in  each  of  the  countries,  weighted according to profit obtained in each of these countries.\n\nThe  average  effective  tax  rate  is  calculated  as  follows:  (current and deferred income tax expense)/(net profit before tax less share of profit of equity affiliates, dividends received and net profit from discontinued operations).\n\n## b.  Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred  taxes  are  recognized  for  all  temporary  differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base (excluding non-deductible goodwill and the other exceptions provided in IAS 12), the tax loss carryforwards and the unused tax credits.  Deferred  tax  assets  are  recognized  on  all  deductible temporary differences provided that it is highly probable that the tax benefits will be realized in future years.\n\nDeferred taxes are calculated at the tax rate applicable when the temporary  difference  is  reversed  and  allowed  under  local regulations at the period-end date. The liability method is applied and any changes to the tax rates are recognized in the income statement,  except  those  related  to  items  directly  recognized  in equity.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if the entities have a legally enforceable right to offset and if they relate to income tax levied  by  the  same  taxation  authority.  Deferred  taxes  are  not discounted.\n\nDeferred taxes are mainly due to temporary differences between the tax and economic depreciation of assets, the carryforward of tax  losses  and  provisions  not  immediately  deductible  for  tax purposes, such as employee benefit provisions.\n\nWhen the Group decides not to distribute profits retained by the subsidiary within the foreseeable future, no deferred tax liability is recognized.\n\n## 5.  NON-CURRENT ASSETS\n\n## a.  Goodwill and business combinations\n\nThe Group has prospectively applied IFRS 3 revised and IAS 27 revised since January 1, 2010.\n\nWhen  the  Group  obtains  control  of  an  acquiree,  the  business combination is accounted for by applying the acquisition method on the acquisition date, in accordance with IFRS 3 revised:\n\n- \u25a0 the identifiable assets  acquired  and  the  liabilities  and contingent liabilities assumed are measured at fair value;\n- \u25a0 any  minority  interests  in  an  acquiree  are  measured  as  the minority  interest's  proportionate  share  of  the  acquiree's  net identifiable assets or at fair value. This option is applied on a case-by-case basis;\n- \u25a0 the consideration transferred and any contingent consideration are measured at fair value;\n- \u25a0 acquisition-related  costs  are  recorded  as  other  operating expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.\n\nFor  a  business  combination  achieved  in  stages,  any  previously held  equity  interests  in  the  acquiree  are  measured  at  the acquisition-date  fair  value.  Any  resulting  gains  or  losses  are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe  measurement  period  of  a  business  combination  shall  not exceed  12  months  as  of  the  acquisition  date. Any  adjustments, after  the  measurement  period,  of  the  consideration  transferred and the fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities are recorded in the income statement.\n\nOn the acquisition date, goodwill is recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as the difference between:\n\n- \u25a0 the  consideration  transferred  plus  the  amount  of  minority interests  in  the  acquiree  and  the  fair  value  of  the  previously held equity interest; and,\n- \u25a0 the  fair  value  of  the  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed.\n\nNegative goodwill is recognized immediately through profit or loss.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of  CGUs  that  benefit  from  business  combination  synergies. Subsequently,  goodwill  is  not  amortized  but  is  tested  for impairment annually or more frequently if there are any indications of  impairment,  in  accordance  with  the  method  described  in section 5.f.\n\nIn addition, at the time of the transition to IFRS and in accordance with the exemption offered by IFRS 1, the Group decided not to apply IFRS  3  'Business  combinations'  retrospectively  for acquisitions that took place prior to January 1, 2004.\n\n## b.  Research and Development expenditures\n\nResearch and Development expenditures include all costs related to  the  scientific  and  technical  activities,  patent  work,  education and training necessary to ensure the development, manufacturing,  start-up, and  commercialization  of  new  or improved products or processes.\n\nAccording  to  IAS  38,  development  costs  shall  be  capitalized  if, and only if, the Group can meet all of the following criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 the  project  is  clearly  identified  and  the  related  costs  are itemized and reliably monitored;\n- \u25a0 the technical and industrial feasibility of completing the project is demonstrated;\n- \u25a0 there is a clear intention to complete the project and to use or sell the intangible asset arising from it;\n- \u25a0 the  Group  has  the  ability  to  use  or  sell  the  intangible  asset arising from the project;\n- \u25a0 the  Group  can  demonstrate  how  the  intangible  asset  will generate probable future economic benefits;\n- \u25a0 the  Group  has  adequate  technical,  financial  and  other resources  to  complete  the  project  and  to  use  or  sell  the intangible asset.\n\nWhen  these  conditions  are  not  satisfied,  development  costs generated  by  the  Group  are  recognized  as  an  expense  when incurred.\n\nResearch  expenditure  is  recognized  as  an  expense  when incurred.",

        "page_content": "## c.   Internally generated intangible assets\n\nInternally generated  intangible  assets  primarily  include  the development  costs  of  information  management  systems.  These costs are capitalized only if they satisfy the criteria as defined by IAS 38 and described above.\n\nInternal and  external  development  costs  on  management information  systems  arising  from  the  development  phase  are capitalized.  Significant  maintenance  and  improvement  costs  are added  to  the  initial  cost  of  assets  if  they  specifically  meet  the capitalization criteria.\n\nInternally  generated  intangible  assets  are  amortized  over  their useful lives.\n\n## d.  Other intangible assets\n\nOther  intangible  assets  include  separately  acquired  intangible assets such as software, licenses, and intellectual property rights. They also include the technology, brands and customer contracts valued  upon  the  acquisition  of  companies  in  accordance  with IFRS 3 'Business Combinations'.\n\nWith  the  exception  of  certain  brands,  intangible  assets  are amortized  using  the  straight-line  method  over  their  useful  lives. Information management systems are generally amortized over a period  comprised  between  five  and  eight  years  and  customer contracts  over  a  maximum  period  of  25  years,  considering  the probabilities of renewal.\n\n## e.   Property, plant and equipment\n\nLand, buildings and equipment are carried at their acquisition cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\n\nIn the event of mandatory dismantling or asset removals, related costs  are  added  to  the  initial  cost  of  the  relevant  assets  and provisions are recognized to cover these costs.\n\nInterest  costs  on  borrowings  to  finance  the  construction  of property, plant, and equipment are capitalized during the period of construction when they relate to the financing of industrial projects over a twelve-month construction period, or longer.\n\nWhere  parts  of  an  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  have different useful lives, they are accounted  separately  and depreciated over their own useful lives.\n\nRepair and maintenance costs are recognized as expenses when incurred.  The  costs  of  major  inspections  and  overhauls  are recognized  as  a  separate  component  of  the  asset  and  are depreciated over the period between two major overhauls.\n\nDepreciation  is  calculated  according  to  the  straight-line  method over the estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 buildings: 20 to 30 years;\n- \u25a0 cylinders: 10 to 40 years;\n- \u25a0 production units: 15 to 20 years;\n- \u25a0 pipelines: 15 to 35 years;\n- \u25a0 other equipment: 5 to 30 years.\n\nThe estimated useful lives are reviewed regularly and changes in the estimates are recorded prospectively from the date of change.\n\nLand is not depreciated.\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## f. Impairment of assets\n\nThe Group regularly assesses whether there are any indications of asset impairment. If such indications exist, an impairment test is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is  greater  than  its  recoverable  amount,  defined  as  the  higher  of the  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell  (net  fair  value)  and  the  value  in use.\n\nImpairment  tests  are  performed  systematically  once  a  year  for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.\n\nAssets that  do  not  generate  largely  independent  cash  flows  are grouped according to the cash-generating units (CGUs) to which they  belong.  A  cash-generating  unit  is  an  identifiable  group  of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the  cash  inflows  of  other  assets  or  groups  of  assets.  They  are mainly  determined  on  a  geographical  basis  and  by  reference  to the markets in which the Group operates.\n\nIn practice, the Group performs impairment tests at various levels pursuant to these principles:\n\n- \u25a0 dedicated and on-site plants are tested individually;\n- \u25a0 pipelines and plants that provide these pipelines are tested at the network level;\n- \u25a0 liquid  gas  and  hydrogen/CO  plants  are  grouped  together according to the plants' customer market;\n- \u25a0 other assets are allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units.\n\nThe  cash-generating  units  of  the  Gas  &  Services  activities  are determined  on  a  geographical  basis.  The  other  activities  are managed at  a  worldwide  level  (Engineering  &  Construction  and Global Markets & Technologies).\n\nGoodwill is allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cashgenerating units that benefit from business combination synergies and which represent the levels at which goodwill is monitored by the Group.\n\nWhen  performing  impairment  tests  on  cash-generating  units  or groups  of  cash-generating  units  comprising  goodwill,  the  Group uses the market multiples approach. The multiples of revenue and operating  income  recurring  before  depreciation  and  amortization are based on the Air Liquide Group's stock market valuation. They are comparable with those of companies whose business is similar to  that  of  the  Group.  The  resulting  multiples  are  applied  to aggregates  (revenue  and  operating  income  recurring  before depreciation and amortization) of each CGU. Where the fair value obtained  using  the  multiples  method  is  not  significantly  greater than the net carrying amount of the cash-generating unit or group of  cash-generating  units,  the  Group  confirms  the  recoverable amount  of  the  cash-generating  unit  or  group  of  cash-generating units using the estimated future cash flow approach (value in use).\n\nFor cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units not including  goodwill,  and  assets  whose  value  is  tested  on  an individual  basis,  the  Group  determines  the  recoverable  amount using the estimated future cash flow approach (value in use).\n\nThe growth rates, taken into account with respect to the cash flow estimates  for  future  cash-generating  units  or  groups  of  cashgenerating  units,  are  determined  based  on  the  activity  and geographical location of the CGU considered.",

Cash  flows  are  measured  over  the  asset's  estimated  period  of use,  taking  into  account  customer  contract  terms  and  technical obsolescence.\n\nThe discount rate depends on the nature, the location of the asset and  the  customer  market.  It  is  determined  according  to  the minimum  level  of  profitability  expected  from  the  investment considering industrial and commercial risks and credit terms.\n\nWhen the recoverable amount of an asset, a cash-generating unit or  a  group  of  cash-generating  units  is  lower  than  its  carrying amount,  an  impairment  loss  is  recognized  immediately  through profit  and  loss. An  impairment  loss  of  a  cash-generating  unit  is first allocated to goodwill.\n\nWhen  the  recoverable  amount  exceeds  the  carrying  amount again,  the  previously  recognized  impairment  loss  is  reversed  to the income statement, with the exception of impairment losses on goodwill, which cannot be reversed.\n\n## g.  Leases\n\nIn  the  course  of  its  activity,  the  Group  enters  as  a  lessee  in contracts mainly for the following types of assets:\n\n- \u25a0 land, buildings and offices;\n- \u25a0 transportation equipment, in particular for Industrial Merchant and Healthcare business lines;\n- \u25a0 other equipment.\n\nAccording  to  IFRS  16,  any  contract  (apart  from  exceptions mentioned below) containing a lease leads to recognition on the lessee's balance sheet of a right-of-use of the leased asset and a lease liability related to the present value of the commitments for future lease payments (lease liability).\n\nA contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys to the Group the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange of consideration. In particular, the Group has concluded that  transportation  contracts  which  confer  to  the  supplier  the substantive right to substitute the vehicle throughout the period of use and/or the control on the choice of the route, the driver and maintenance  policy,  are  service  contracts  and  do  not  meet  the definition of a lease under IFRS 16.\n\nIn addition, the Group has chosen to use the following exemptions and not to apply IFRS 16:\n\n- \u25a0 to  the  lease  contracts  having  a  lease  terms  of  12  months  or less;\n- \u25a0 to the lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value, in particular, office and telephony equipment, computers and small IT equipment. Lease contracts for data centers are analyzed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe main assumptions used to measure the right-of-use and the lease liability are:\n\n- \u25a0 lease  term.  It  corresponds  to  the  non-cancellable  period  for which  a  lessee  has  the  right  to  use  an  underlying  asset, together  with  periods  covered  by  an  option  to  extend  or  to terminate  the  lease  if  the  Group  is  reasonably  certain  to exercise (for options to extend) or not to exercise (for options to  terminate)  such  options. The  probability  to  exercise  or  not\n\nan option is determined by type of contracts or on a case-bycase basis according to contractual terms, regulatory environment  and  the  nature  of  the  underlying  asset  (in particular, its technical specificity and strategic location);\n\n- \u25a0 the discount rate used for evaluation of the lease liability. The discount  rate  retained  is  the  lessee's  incremental  borrowing rate.  Due  to  the  centralized  financing  in  the  Group,  it corresponds  for  each  subsidiary  to  the  interest  rate  for intragroup borrowings determined according to the currency of the lease contract, the country and the lease term taking into account the repayment profile (linear amortization of the lease liability).\n\nDeferred taxes relating to the right of use asset and lease liability arising from a single transaction are recognized on a net basis.\n\n## 6.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## a.  Non-consolidated investments\n\nInvestments in non-consolidated companies  that are not accounted  for  using  the  equity  method  are  classified  as  assets measured  at  fair  value.  These  investments  are  not  held  for trading, consequently, at initial recognition, the Group may make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value. In this case, changes in fair value  are  not  reclassified  to  net  result  upon  disposal  of  these investments.\n\nDividends  from  these  investments  are  recognized  in  other financial income.\n\n## b.  Trade and other-receivables\n\nTrade  and  other  receivables  are  measured  at  their  transaction price upon initial recognition and then at amortized cost less any impairment losses based on expected credit losses model.\n\nExpected  credit  losses  are  estimated  on  the  basis  of  a  matrix consisting  in  using  historical  loss  rates  adjusted  depending  on actual observable conditions. Expected  credit losses are estimated at each closing date in the following manner:\n\n- \u25a0 segregating  trade  receivables  into  appropriate  groups,  in particular  depending  on  the  activities  of  the  Group,  type  and size of client and its market segment;\n- \u25a0 within  each  group  of  trade  receivables,  determining  of  agebands;\n- \u25a0 for each age-band identification of losses realized in previous financial year;\n- \u25a0 adjusting if necessary historical loss rate depending on actual observable  conditions  in  order  to  take  into  account,  in particular,  current  market  conditions,  type  of  client,  credit management  practices  of  the  Group  as  well  as  specific information concerning individual customers;\n- \u25a0 application  of  loss  rates  estimated  in  this  way  to  each  ageband of trade receivables.\n\nFor  all  construction  contracts  in  progress  at  the  year-end,  the gross amounts payable by and to customers represent the sum of costs  incurred  plus  profits  recognized  using  the  percentage  of completion method, equivalent to total revenue recorded using the percentage of completion method, less the amount of advances received.\n\nAmounts  payable  by  customers  are  presented  in  trade receivables.  Amounts  due  to  customers  are  presented  in  other current liabilities.",

        "page_content": "## Assignments of trade receivables\n\nAssignments  of  trade  receivables  are  derecognized  from  the balance sheet when:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows related to these receivables to the assignee; or\n- \u25a0 the  Group  retains  the  contractual  rights  to  receive  the  cash flows related to these receivables, but assumes a contractual obligation  to  pay  the  cash  flows  to  the  assignee  in  an arrangement  that  cumulatively  meets  the  following  three conditions:\n- -the Group has no obligation to pay to the assignee unless it collects the equivalent amount,\n- -the  Group  is  prohibited  from  selling  or  pledging  the receivables other than as security for the obligation to pay cash flows to the assignee,\n- -the  Group  has  an  obligation  to  remit  any  cash  flows  it collects on behalf of the assignee without material delay;\n- \u25a0 and the Group transfers substantially all the risks and awards of ownership of the receivables, in particular credit risk and risk of late payment.\n\n## c.   Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash balances, current bank accounts, and short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and which are exposed to a negligible risk of change in value.\n\nShort-term  investments  include  temporary  cash  investments maturing in less than three months (commercial paper, certificates of  deposit  and  money  market  funds)  whose  minimum  long-term rating is A (S&P) or A2 (Moody's).\n\nAs  cash  investments  maturing  in  less  than  three  months  are exposed  to  a  negligible  risk  of  a  change  in  value,  they  are recognized at historical cost (including accrued interest) which is considered to approximate fair value.\n\n## d.  Trade payables\n\nThe  Group  sets  up  supplier  paying  services  agreements  with partner  banks  to  facilitate  the  processing  of  supplier  invoices payments.  The  Group  analyzes  the  main  contract  features  that enable to keep the trade payables qualification. In particular, the Group ensures that the following characteristics are met:\n\n- \u25a0 no deviation of  the  payment  terms  of  the  underlying  payable between the financing party and the original supplier. In other words,  the  Group  must  pay  to  the  bank  no  later  than  the payment term of invoice;\n- \u25a0 payment terms negotiations between Air Liquide and supplier must be conducted independently of any negotiation on paying service  agreement.  In  particular,  payment  terms  shall  not  be subject  to  the  supplier's  success  in  selling  invoices  to  the bank;\n- \u25a0 the  terms  of  contract  with  the  supplier  shall  not  be  explicitly linked  to  any  payment  term  extension.  Payment  term  with  a particular supplier must be homogenous, independently of the participation of a particular invoice in the program or not;\n- \u25a0 payment terms should stay within the ordinary industry/sector norms  and  local  regulation,  and  should  not  be  tied  to  the participation in the paying services agreement;\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n- \u25a0 program  structures  should  avoid  debt-like  features  such  as interest and fees paid by Air Liquide to the bank or supplier;\n- \u25a0 tri-party agreements between Air Liquide, the supplier and the bank  that  pre-arrange  the  financing  of  the  invoices  owed  by Air Liquide to the supplier shall be avoided.\n\n## e.   Current and non-current borrowings\n\nBorrowings  include  bonds  and  other  bank  borrowings  (including the put options granted to minority shareholders).\n\nAt inception, borrowings are recognized at fair value corresponding  to  the  net  proceeds  collected.  At  each  balance sheet date, except for put options granted to minority shareholders,  they  are  measured  at  amortized  cost  using  the effective  interest  rate  (EIR)  method.  Under  this  method,  the borrowing cost includes the redemption premiums and issuance costs initially deducted from the nominal amount of the borrowing in liabilities.\n\nBorrowings  maturing  in  less  than  one  year  are  classified  as current borrowings.\n\nBorrowings  hedged  by  interest  rate  swaps  are  recognized  on  a hedge accounting basis.\n\n## Put options granted to minority shareholders\n\nPut  options  granted  to  minority  shareholders  are  recorded  as borrowings at the option's estimated strike price. The share in the net assets of subsidiaries is reclassified from 'Minority interests' to  'Borrowings'.  Due  to  the  absence  of  any  specific  IFRS guidance, the  Group  has  elected  to  recognize  the  consideration for  the  difference  between  the  strike  price  of  the  option  granted and the value of the minority interests reclassified as borrowings in shareholders' equity - Group share. Minority interests in profit and  loss  do  not  change  and  still  reflect  present  ownership interests.\n\n## f. Derivative assets and liabilities\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used to manage exposures to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity risks relating to the Group's financial and operating activities. For all these transactions, the Group applies hedge accounting and documents, at the inception of the transaction, the type of hedging relationship, the hedging instruments, and the nature and term of the hedged item.\n\nApplying hedge accounting has the following consequences:\n\n- \u25a0 fair value hedges for existing assets and liabilities: the hedged portion of the item is carried at fair value in the balance sheet. Any  changes  in  fair  value  are  recognized  in  the  income statement,  where  they  are  offset  by  the  corresponding changes  in  fair  value  of  the  hedging  instruments  (except  for the impact of premiums/discounts);\n- \u25a0 future cash flow hedges: the effective portion of the change in fair  value  of  the  hedging  instrument  is  recorded  directly  in equity (items that may be subsequently reclassified to income statement),  while  the  change  in  the  fair  value  of  the  hedged item is not recognized in the balance sheet. The change in fair value of the ineffective portion is recognized in other financial income or expenses. When the hedged transactions occur and are  recorded,  amounts  recorded  in  other  comprehensive income are reclassified in the income statement;",

The  ineffective  portion  of changes in fair value is recognized in 'Other financial income and  expenses'.  Once  the  foreign  entity  subject  to  the  net investment hedge is sold, the loss or profit initially recognized in translation reserves is recognized in profit or loss, within the gain or loss generated.\n\nHowever, in limited circumstances, certain types of derivatives do not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting;  they  are  carried  at  fair  value through 'Other financial income and expenses' with an offsetting entry in financial assets and financial liabilities.\n\nThe fair value of assets, liabilities and derivatives is based on the market price at the balance sheet date.\n\n## 7.  ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\n## a.  Assets classified as held for sale\n\nNon-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale  transaction  rather  than  through  continuing  use.  This classification  occurs  when  the  Group  takes  the  decision  to  sell them and that the sale is considered highly probable.\n\nThe assets and liabilities held for sale are presented on different lines  of  the  balance  sheet.  They  are  measured  at  the  lower  of their  carrying  amount  or  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell.  Assets classified as held for sale are no longer depreciated (amortized) as  of  the  date  they  are  classified  as  assets  or  disposal  groups held for sale.\n\nWhen  a  sale  involving  the  loss  of  control  of  the  subsidiary  is considered  highly  probable,  all  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  this subsidiary are classified as being held for sale, independently of whether or not the Group retains a residual interest in the entity after its sale.\n\n## b.  Discontinued operations\n\nA discontinued operation is a clearly identifiable component that the Group either has abandoned or that is classified as held for sale:\n\n- \u25a0 representing a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;\n- \u25a0 being  part  of  a  single  coordinated  plan  to  dispose  of  a separate  major  line  of  business  or  geographical  area  of operations; or,\n- \u25a0 being a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\n\nOnce the criteria  are  met,  the  profit  and  loss  and  the  cash  flow from  discontinued  operations  are  presented  separately  in  the income  statement  and  the  consolidated  cash  flow  statement  for each period.\n\n## 8.  SHARE CAPITAL, RESERVES AND TREASURY SHARES\n\nAir Liquide's share capital is composed of ordinary shares.\n\nRetained earnings include the following items:\n\n- \u25a0 translation  reserves:  exchange  differences  arising  from  the translation  into  euros  of  financial  statements  prepared  by foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the euro\n- are recorded in translation reserves. Fair value changes in net investment  hedges  of  these  foreign  subsidiaries  are  also recorded in this reserve;\n- \u25a0 fair value of financial instruments: this item records accumulated fair value changes in the effective portion of cash flow hedge derivatives (transactions not yet recognized in the accounts);\n- \u25a0 actuarial gains and losses: all actuarial gains and losses and adjustments  arising  from  the  asset  ceiling,  net  of  deferred taxes, are recognized in consolidated reserves in the period in which they occur.\n\nWhen the Group buys back its own shares, they are classified as treasury  shares  at  the  purchase  price  and  presented  as  a deduction from equity for the consideration paid. The profit or loss from the sale of treasury shares is recognized directly in equity, net of tax.\n\nFurthermore,  acquisitions  or  disposals  of  minority  interests, without change in control, are considered as transactions with the Group's shareholders. Thus, the difference between the price paid to increase the percentage of interest in entities that are already controlled  and  the  additional  share  of  equity  thus  acquired  is recognized  in  Shareholders'  equity.  Similarly,  a  decrease  in  the Group's percentage interest in a controlled entity is accounted for as an equity transaction with no impact on profit or loss.\n\nDisposals of shares with loss of control give rise to the recognition in disposal gains or losses of the change in fair value calculated for  the  total  investment  at  the  date  of  disposal. Any  investments retained, where applicable, will be measured at fair value at the date when control is lost.\n\n## 9.  PROVISIONS\n\n## a.  Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized when:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event;\n- \u25a0 it is probable  that  an  outflow  of  resources  embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation;\n- \u25a0 a  reliable  estimate  can  be  made  of  the  amount  of  the obligation.\n\nRestructuring provisions include only the direct costs arising from the  restructuring  and  are  recognized  in  the  period  in  which  the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the  restructuring  has  either  begun  or  been  announced.  When these plans involve termination benefits, the resulting provisions are recognized at the earlier of the following dates:\n\n- \u25a0 when  the  Group  can  no  longer  withdraw  the  offer  of  those benefits;\n- \u25a0 when the provision of the related restructuring is recognized.\n\nA  provision  for  losses  on  contracts  is  recognized  when  the expected  benefits  from  the  contract  are  lower  than  the  cost  of satisfying the obligations under the contract.\n\n## b.  Pensions and employee benefits\n\nThe  Group  provides  its  employees  with  various  pension  plans, termination benefits, jubilees and other post-employment benefits for both active and retired employees. The characteristics of each plan vary according to the laws and regulations applicable in each country as well as each subsidiary policy.",

        "page_content": "These benefits are covered by two types of plan:\n\n- \u25a0 defined contribution plans;\n- \u25a0 defined benefit plans.\n\nThe  Group  grants  both  defined  benefit  and  defined  contribution plans.\n\nDefined contribution plans are plans under which the employer's sole  obligation  is  to  pay  regular  contributions.  The  employer's obligation is limited to payment of the planned contributions. The employer  does  not  grant  any  guarantees  on  the  future  level  of benefits paid to the employee or retiree (means-based obligation). The  annual  pension  expense  is  equal  to  the  contribution  paid during the fiscal year which relieves the employer from any further obligation. It is recognized in 'Personnel expenses'.\n\nDefined  benefit  plans  are  those  by  which  the  employer guarantees the future level of benefits defined in the agreement, most  often  depending  on  the  employee's  salary  and  seniority ('result-based obligation'). Defined benefit plans can be:\n\n- \u25a0 either  financed  by  contributions  to  a  fund  specialized  in managing the amounts received;\n- \u25a0 or managed internally.\n\nIn  the  case  of  defined  benefit  plans,  retirement  and  similar obligations are measured by independent actuaries, according to the projected unit credit method. The actuarial calculations mainly take  into  account  the  following  assumptions:  salary  increases, employee turnover, retirement date, life expectancy, inflation and appropriate discount rates for each country.\n\nDefined  benefit  plans  are  covered  by  external  pension  funds  in certain  cases. The  assets  of  these  plans  are  mostly  invested  in bonds or equities carried at their fair value.\n\nAll  actuarial  gains  and  losses  as  well  as  any  adjustment  arising from the asset ceiling are recognized in the period in which they occur.\n\nActuarial  assumptions  used  vary  according  to  the  demographic and  economic  conditions  prevailing  in  each  country  where  the Group has pension plans.\n\nDiscount  rates  used  to  measure  the  present  value  of  the Company's obligations  and  the  net  interest  cost  are  determined by  reference  to  market  yields  on  High-Quality  corporate  bonds. Where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market yields on government bonds with the same maturity at the valuation date shall  be  used.  In  the  Euro  zone,  the  United  States,  the  United Kingdom and Canada, discount rates were determined using tools designed by independent actuaries. Their database uses several hundred different corporate bonds with a minimum AA-rating and maturities ranging from one to 30 years. Cash flows of expected benefits  are  subsequently  discounted  using  rates  associated  to each maturity.\n\nValuations are carried out annually by independent actuaries for significant  plans  and  every  three  years  for  other  plans  unless there  are  material  changes  in  assumptions  or  major  events  that require a new calculation. Impacts related to defined benefit plans are registered as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 the  service  cost,  the  gain  relating  to  curtailments  and settlements,  and  the  actuarial  gains  and  losses  from  other long-term benefits and recognized in 'Personnel expenses'. In addition,  the  service  cost  of  defined  benefit  plans  which  are capped, linked to length of service and require the presence of the  beneficiary  in  the  company  at  the  time  of  retirement  is spread over the period between the date on which the services rendered began to generate rights and the date on which the additional services cease to generate rights;\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n- \u25a0 net  interest  cost  for  defined  benefits  is  registered  in  'Other financial income and expenses';\n- \u25a0 past service cost is recorded in profit or loss according to the nature of the change to the plan that generated it (i.e. either in 'Personnel  expenses'  or  in  'Other  operating  income  and expenses');\n- \u25a0 actuarial gains  and  losses  from  defined  benefit  plans, retirement  termination  payments,  and  medical  plans  are recorded in 'Gains and losses recognized directly in equity'.\n\n## 10.  GOVERNMENT GRANTS\n\nGovernment grants received are initially recognized in 'Other noncurrent  liabilities'.  They  are  then  recognized  as  income  in  the income statement for the period:\n\n- \u25a0 on the same basis as the subsidized assets are depreciated in the case of government grants related to assets;\n- \u25a0 deducted  from  the  costs  intended  to  be  compensated  in  the case of government grants other than those related to assets.\n\nThe  Group  analyzes  the  substance  of  government  incentives delivered  through  the  tax  system  and  selects  an  accounting treatment consistent with such substance.\n\n## 11.  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\n\nThe  Group  grants  stock  options  and  performance  shares  to Executive Officers and some employees.\n\nStock options and performance shares are measured at fair value on the grant date. Their fair value is recognized as a 'Personnel expense' in the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity, and amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\n\nThe  valuation  is  performed  by  an  independent  expert,  using mathematical  models  appropriate  to  the  characteristics  of  each plan.  It takes  into  account  the  market  vesting  conditions associated to each one. The fair value measured at the grant date is not  subject  to  re-evaluation  due  to  changes  in  market conditions.\n\nVesting conditions, other than market ones, have no impact on the fair  value  measurement  of  services  received  but  adjust  the expense  that  is  recognized  according  to  the  number  of  equity instruments actually granted.\n\nThe  dilution  effect  of  non-vested  stock  option  plans  and performance  share  allocations  is  reflected  in  the  calculation  of diluted earnings per share.\n\n## Share subscription option plans\n\nOptions are valued using the following main  underlying assumptions:\n\n- \u25a0 volatility: implicit;\n- \u25a0 risk-free interest rate: zero-coupon benchmark rate at the plan issue date and matching the various maturities retained;\n- \u25a0 dividend growth rate: based on the historical average annual growth rate;\n- \u25a0 employee resignation rate: that of individuals belonging to the same age group as the plan beneficiaries. The resignation rate is used to extrapolate the number of options which will not be exercised due to the resignation of beneficiaries;\n- \u25a0 the probability of achieving the market vesting conditions.",

The cost of nontransferability  is  measured  as  the  cost  of  a  two-step  strategy consisting in the forward sale of shares being non-transferable for four years (or five years depending on the plan) and the purchase on the spot market of the same number of shares funded by an amortizable loan with an in fine capital repayment.\n\nValuation is based upon the following main underlying assumptions:\n\n- \u25a0 risk-free  interest  rate:  four-year  zero-coupon  benchmark  rate (or five-year depending on the plan) at the plan issue date plus a credit margin that would be proposed to employees;\n- \u25a0 dividend growth rate: based on the historical average annual growth rate;\n- \u25a0 employee resignation rate: that of individuals belonging to the same  age  group  as  the  plan  beneficiaries.  This  resignation rate  is  used  to  extrapolate  the  shares  which  will  not  be allocated due to the resignation of beneficiaries;\n- \u25a0 the probability of achieving the market vesting conditions.\n\n## 12.  GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION QUOTAS\n\nIn  certain  countries,  the  Group  is  subject  to  greenhouse  gas emission quota systems.\n\nIn  the  absence  of  any  specific  IFRS  guidance,  the  Group  has elected  to  apply  the  ANC  Regulation  No.  2014-03.  The  Group does  not  buy  CO2  quotas  for  the  purpose  of  generating  profits from fluctuations in price; therefore, at each closing date:\n\n- \u25a0 a  liability  is  recognized  if  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  are higher than the CO2 quotas held by the Group. It corresponds to the cost of CO2 quotas in shortfall to cover the greenhouse gas already emitted; or,\n- \u25a0 an  asset  is  recognized  if  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  are lower than the CO2 quotas held by the entity. It corresponds to the CO2 quotas available to cover the future greenhouse gas emissions, valued at historical cost.\n\n## 13.  RENEWABLE POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS\n\nIn  order  to  reduce  its  indirect  emissions  related  to  energy purchases (Scope 2 emissions), the Air Liquide Group signs longterm  renewable  energy  purchase  agreements  (Power  Purchase Agreements or PPAs). The Group analyzes the main features of these contracts, in particular verifying that:\n\n- \u25a0 Regarding IFRS 10/11:\n- -Air Liquide neither has the right nor is exposed to variable returns from the entity supplying the energy,\n- -Air  Liquide  has  no  power  over  the  activities  of  the  entity supplying the energy;\n- \u25a0 Regarding IFRS 16: the volume to be purchased by Air Liquide under  these  contracts  represents  a  portion  of  the  sites' electricity production that does not represent substantially all of their  capacity  or,  if  this  is  the  case,  the  Group  has  neither participated in its design nor has the right to control the use of the asset;\n- \u25a0 Regarding IFRS 9:\n- -site/basin  consumption  exceeds  the  contracted  volume  of renewable energy,\n- -the Group does not resell with a view to generate a profit resulting from market price variations,\n- -the terms of the contracts do not allow for net settlement in cash,  in  other  financial  instruments  or  by  exchanging financial instruments, and Air Liquide's has no practice, for similar contracts, of such net settlements,\n- -the  PPA  price  structure  is  closely  linked  to  the  economic characteristics and risks of the energy supply contract.\n\nConsequently, PPAs are classified as purchase contracts for own use, and are presented as off-balance sheet commitments.\n\n## Considerations for Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (or VPPAs)\n\nVPPAs are financial instruments (derivatives) to be recognized at fair  value  at  inception.  The  Group  qualifies  them  as  cash  flow hedges by verifying:\n\n- \u25a0 the  highly  probable  nature  of  the  underlying,  i.e.  electricity purchases over the entire term of the contract;\n- \u25a0 the expected effectiveness of the hedge.\n\n## Basis for presentation of financial information\n\n## 1.  SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nThe Group is structured according to the following activities: Gas &  Services,  Engineering  &  Construction  and  Global  Markets  & Technologies.\n\nThe  Group's  main  operational  decision-making  body  is  the Executive Management assisted by the Executive Committee.\n\nThe Gas & Services activities are organized by geographical area, which  is  the  responsible  level  for  operations  management  and performance  monitoring.  These  geographical  areas  are  as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Europe;\n- \u25a0 Americas;\n- \u25a0 Asia Pacific;\n- \u25a0 Middle East & Africa.\n\nWithin  the  Gas  &  Services  segment,  the  geographical  areas determine sales policies and development projects in liaison with the  four  business  lines  (Large  Industries,  Industrial  Merchant, Healthcare and Electronics).\n\nThe Engineering & Construction segment is managed separately on a worldwide scale. The segment designs, develops and builds industrial gas production plants for the Group and third parties. It also designs and manufactures plants in the traditional, renewable and alternative energy sectors.\n\nThe  Global  Markets  &  Technologies  segment  is  also  managed separately on a worldwide scale. It focuses on new markets which require  a  global  approach,  drawing  on  science,  technologies, development models, and usages related to digital transformation.\n\nResearch and Development and corporate activities do not meet the  operating  segments  definition  and  are  thus  presented  within reconciliation.\n\nThe  information  communicated  in  the  tables  covering  segment information  is  presented  according  to  the  same  accounting principles  as  those  used  for  the  Group  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\nRevenue is analyzed by geographical area of production (country of origin).",

OTHER NON-RECURRING OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES\n\nMaterial  non-recurring  operations  that  could  affect  operating performance readability are classified under 'Other non-recurring operating income' and 'Other non-recurring operating expenses'. They may include:\n\n- \u25a0 gains  or  losses  on  the  disposal  of  activities  or  groups  of assets;\n- \u25a0 acquisition-related  and  integration-related  costs  relating  to business combinations;\n- \u25a0 restructuring  costs  resulting  from  plans  whose  unusual  and material nature distort the readability of the Operating income recurring;\n- \u25a0 significant provisions and impairment losses for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets;\n- \u25a0 incurred or estimated costs relating to significant political risks or litigations;\n- \u25a0 costs relating to capital increases reserved for employees;\n- \u25a0 costs of projects to comply with regulatory changes impacting several geographical areas and for significant amounts.\n\n## 7.  NET EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\n## a.  Basic earnings per share\n\nBasic  earnings  per  share  is  calculated  by  dividing  net  profit (Group share) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Air Liquide by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year,  excluding  ordinary  shares  purchased  by  Air  Liquide  and recognized in equity.\n\n## b.

Consequently,  as  stated  in  note  5.f  of  the  accounting policies, the method of future estimated cash flow was not used to determine the recoverable amount of cash-generating units.\n\nConsidering the activity  of  the Air  Liquide  Group,  no  reasonably possible change in key assumptions would result in an impairment loss. The Gas & Services activities favor synergies between the different business lines by pooling assets for a given geographical area.  The  geographical  development  of  an  activity  is  generally based  on  local  industrial  investments  and  external  growth operations through the Large Industries business line. The supply of gas to clients of the Large Industries business is contracted for a  minimum  duration  of  15  years.  These  customer  contracts provide a good visibility and guarantee of future income.",

In  the  event  of retirement,  the  beneficiary  retains  his  rights,  being  no  longer required to satisfy the continued service requirement;\n- b) performance requirements for all performance shares allocated to all beneficiaries;\n- c) a  holding  requirement  for  performance  shares:  as  from  the final  grant  date,  the  beneficiaries  of  the  'France'  Plan  are required  to  hold  their  shares  for  two  additional  years  during which such shares may not be transferred (except in the event of disability or death).\n\nOptions granted to the ten employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (excluding corporate officers) who were attributed the highest number of options\n\nIn 2023, no options have been granted.\n\n## Options exercised in 2023 by the ten employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (excluding corporate officers) with the highest number of options exercised\n\n| Grant date   | Number of options exercised   |   Average price (in euros) (a) |\n|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 09/26/2013   | 103,640                       |                          67.15 |\n| 09/22/2014   | 35,122                        |                          70.42 |\n| 09/28/2015   | 10,229                        |                          76.23 |\n| 11/29/2016   | 891                           |                          69.33 |\n| TOTAL        | 149,882                       |                          68.55 |\n\n## Options exercised in 2022 by the ten employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (excluding corporate officers) with the highest number of options exercised\n\n| Grant date   | Number of options exercised   |   Average price (in euros) (a) |\n|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 09/27/2012   | 36,889                        |                          69.92 |\n| 09/26/2013   | 31,538                        |                          68.71 |\n| 09/22/2014   | 19,270                        |                          75.31 |\n| 09/28/2015   | 3,747                         |                          81.46 |\n| 11/29/2016   | 76                            |                          69.33 |\n| TOTAL        | 91,520                        |                          71.11 |\n\n## Number of share subscription options and weighted average strike price\n\n|                                                                                  | 2022      | 2022                                       | 2023      | 2023                                       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                  | Options   | Weighted average  strike price  (in euros) | Options   | Weighted average  strike price  (in euros) |\n| Total number of options outstanding as of January 1  (adjusted number and price) | 1,700,972 | 71.39                                      | 1,340,889 | 72.38                                      |\n| Options exercised during the period (adjusted number and price)                  | 352,635   | 71.14                                      | 440,106   | 69.28                                      |\n| Options canceled during the period (adjusted number and price)                   | 7,448     | 72.43                                      | 5,803     | 71.92                                      |\n| Total number of options as of December 31  (adjusted number and price)           | 1,340,889 | 72.38                                      | 894,980   | 73.91                                      |\n| Of which total number of options eligible for exercise                           | 1,340,889 | 72.38                                      | 894,980   | 73.91                                      |",

They include provisions for industrial disputes and for tax  risks,  excluding  income  taxes,  respectively  for  97.5  and 40.5 million euros.\n\nThe  Group  does  not  provide  the  detail  of  these  provisions, considering  that  disclosing  the  amount  provided  for  each individual litigation could be prejudicial to the Group. Nevertheless, no single litigation is likely to have a material effect on the Group's financial position or its profitability.",

        "page_content": "## Note 23 Employee benefit obligations\n\n## 23.1.  PENSION PLANS\n\nThe most significant pension plans relate to France, Germany and the United States.\n\nIn  France,  Air  Liquide  provides  an  additional  retirement  benefit based on the final salary which is paid in addition to other normal pension  plans.  On  December  31,  1995,  this  plan  was  closed to employees under age 45 or with less than 20 years of service as  of  January  1,  1996;  the  latter  being  covered  by  a  defined contribution plan. This plan is unfunded. The annual amounts paid with regards to additional benefits cannot exceed a threshold set originally  at  12%  of  total  payroll  or  12%  of  pre-tax  profits  of companies  involved.  This  12%  threshold  will  be  proportionately reduced  by  comparing  the  number  of  plan  beneficiaries  for  the year to the number of plan beneficiaries for the previous year. In 2017,  this  additional  benefit  was  funded  subsequently  to  the Article 50 of the law of January 20, 2014 securing the future and fairness of pensions plans.\n\nAdditionally,  changes  to  retirement  age  assumptions  in  France following the 2023 reform do not have any significant impact for the Group.\n\nIAS 19 'Employee Benefits' provides a very restrictive definition of defined contribution plans; any plans not complying fully with the conditions required are defined benefit plans by default.\n\nThis  restrictive  definition  of  defined  contribution  plans  requires Air  Liquide  to  account  for  these  additional  benefits  as  a  defined benefit plan in spite of the limited obligations for the Company and the nature of the obligations not being stable or continuous.\n\nThe  qualification  as  a  defined  benefit  plan  results  in  the recognition of a provision with regards to the future obligations.\n\nWith  the  Company's  obligations  being  limited,  the  valuation  of what will actually be paid to retirees is uncertain. Since the effect of  this  threshold  cannot  be  measured  reliably,  the  provision recognized  represents  the  actuarial  value  of  the  amounts  to  be paid out to retirees until the plan is closed, excluding any potential threshold  effect.  The  additional  retirement  benefit  paid  by Air Liquide is aligned with the indexation of French statutory and supplementary  pension  plans  up  to  a  maximum  annuity.  Any additional annuity will not be subject to any indexation.\n\nIn Germany, there are two main Air Liquide pension plans.\n\nThe  first  plan  provides  the  retirees  of  Lurgi  (Engineering &  Construction  activity)  with  a  lifetime  annuity,  based  on  the income  and  length  of  service  vested  in  the  plan  at  the  time  of retirement,  the  normal  retirement  age  being  65.  The  plan  also provides  disability  and  widowhood  pensions.  This  plan  is  now closed  to  new  entrants,  the  latter  benefiting  from  a  defined contribution plan.\n\nThe second plan is an old plan covering employees of the Gas & Services activities. The plan provides a lifetime annuity, based on  the  average  income  earned  over  the  employee's  career  and the length of service vested at the time of retirement, the normal retirement  age  being  65.  The  plan  also  provides  disability,  preretirement  and  widowhood  pensions.  It  is  now  closed  to  new entrants,  with  new  employees  benefiting  from  another  defined benefit plan. Providing a minimum length of service of ten years, the plan provides a lifetime annuity based on the average income earned  over  the  employee's  career  and  the  length  of  service vested at the time of retirement, the normal retirement age being 65. The  plan  also  provides  disability, pre-retirement and widowhood pensions.\n\nIn accordance with common market practice in Germany, limited funding contributions are made to pension funds as both plans are mainly managed internally.\n\nIn  the  United  States,  Air  Liquide  grants  retirees  supplemental benefits  in  addition  to  the  normal  pension  plans.  The  US  plan provides  a  traditional  final  average  pay  benefit  to  those  who continue  to  accrue  benefits.  A  retiring  employee  may  elect  to receive their pension benefit as a lump sum or a lifetime annuity. This plan was closed to new participants in 2004 and was frozen in  2016.  Therefore,  employees  who  joined  the  Company  before 2004  are  no  longer  acquiring  new  rights  on  this  defined  benefit plan, but benefit from the defined contribution plan that has been opened since 2004 to new employees.\n\nA new plan was implemented on January 1, 2017 (Supplemental Saving plan). This plan comes on top of the basic savings plan offering  additional  retirement  benefits  beyond the tax limit of the basic plan. It represents an annual cost of around 6 million US dollars.\n\n<!-- image -->",

PENSION PLAN RISK ANALYSIS\n\n## Sensitivity to movements in discount rates and other variables\n\nThe present value of obligations related to defined benefit plans is measured by discounting estimated future cash flows. Discount rates are determined based on Government bonds rates or, when the financial markets are sufficiently liquid, on 'high-quality' corporate bond rates, which can vary from one period to another.\n\nChanges in discount rates can materially change the present value of the Group's obligations and the expense recorded in the year.\n\nThe amount of obligations is  affected  to  a  lesser  extent  by  revised  wages  and  inflation  indexes,  as  well  as  legal  changes  regarding retirement age or official mortality tables.\n\n## Impact of a -0.25% decrease in discount rates\n\n|                 |   Impact on obligations as of December 31, 2023  (in millions of euros) | % of total obligations as of  December 31, 2023   |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Europe / Africa |                                                                      35 | 2 . 6  %                                          |\n| Americas        |                                                                      16 | 2 . 3  %                                          |\n| Asia-Pacific    |                                                                       2 | 3 . 2  %                                          |\n| TOTAL           |                                                                      53 | 2 . 5  %                                          |\n\n|                 |   Impact on obligations as of December 31, 2022  (in millions of euros) | % of total obligations as of  December 31, 2022   |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Europe / Africa |                                                                      34 | 2 . 7  %                                          |\n| Americas        |                                                                      17 | 2 . 4  %                                          |\n| Asia-Pacific    |                                                                       1 | 1 . 9  %                                          |\n| TOTAL           |                                                                      52 | 2 . 6  %                                          |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Any adverse change on these variables  would  require  additional  Group  contributions  to  the pension funds on a timely basis.\n\nPlan  assets  consist  of  shares,  bonds  and  other  assets  whose value is generally subject to market fluctuations. A downturn in the financial  markets  would  increase  the  net  liabilities  of  defined\n\nbenefit  plans.  The  plans'  coverage  ratios  would  decrease accordingly,  requiring  additional  Group  contributions  on  a  timely basis.\n\nWithin the Group, plan assets are piloted and managed at local level, especially through investment committees and monitoring of performance  and  allocations  based  on  the  social  liabilities covered.\n\n| 2023                | Shares   | Shares   | Bonds   | Bonds   | Real estate   | Real estate   | Cash    | Cash   | Others   | Others   | TOTAL   | TOTAL        |\n|---------------------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------------|---------------|---------|--------|----------|----------|---------|--------------|\n| (in millions euros) | Amounts  | %        | Amounts | %       | Amounts       | %             | Amounts | %      | Amounts  | %        | Amounts | %            |\n| Europe / Africa     | 87       | 24.9 %   | 60      | 17.2 %  | 99            | 28.4 %        | 5       | 1.4 %  | 98       | 28.1 %   |         | 349  100.0 % |\n| Americas            | 171      | 27.1 %   | 406     | 64.4 %  | 34            | 5.4 %         | 10      | 1.6 %  | 9        | 1.5 %    |         | 630  100.0 % |\n| Asia-Pacific        | 5        | 13.5 %   | 28      | 75.7 %  | -             | 0.0 %         | 3       | 8.1 %  | 1        | 2.7 %    |         | 37  100.0 %  |\n| TOTAL               | 263      | 263      | 494     | 494     | 133           | 133           | 18      | 18     | 108      | 108      | 1,016   | 1,016        |\n\n| 2022                | Shares   | Shares   | Bonds   | Bonds   | Real estate   | Real estate   | Cash    | Cash   | Others   | Others   | TOTAL   | TOTAL        |\n|---------------------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------------|---------------|---------|--------|----------|----------|---------|--------------|\n| (in millions euros) | Amounts  | %        | Amounts | %       | Amounts       | %             | Amounts | %      | Amounts  | %        | Amounts | %            |\n| Europe / Africa     | 71       | 21.0 %   | 48      | 14.0 %  | 97            | 29.0 %        | 30      | 9.0 %  | 91       | 27.0 %   |         | 337  100.0 % |\n| Americas            | 221      | 34.0 %   | 388     | 60.0 %  | 42            | 6.0 %         | -       | 0.0 %  | -        | 0.0 %    |         | 651  100.0 % |\n| Asia-Pacific        | 5        | 11.0 %   | 35      | 79.0 %  | 1             | 1.0 %         | 3       | 6.0 %  | 1        | 3.0 %    |         | 45  100.0 %  |\n| TOTAL               | 297      |          | 471     |         | 140           |               | 33      |        | 92       |          | 1,033   |              |",

        "page_content": "## 24.5.  NET DEBT BY CURRENCY\n\nThe Group ensures a natural hedge and reduces its exposure to currency fluctuations by raising debt mainly in the currency of the cash  flows  that  are  generated  to  repay  the  debt.  In  most countries,  and  especially  outside  the  euro,  US  dollar,  Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi zones, financing is raised in either local or  foreign  currency  (EUR  or  USD)  when  sales  contracts  are indexed  to  foreign  currency.  Debt  in  other  currencies  is  mainly denominated  in  Taiwan  dollar,  South  African  Rand  and  in Canadian dollar.\n\nAs  part  of  intra-group  multi-currency  financing,  the  Central Treasury Department converts the debt raised in financial markets into  various  currencies  to  finance  subsidiaries  in  their  functional\n\ncurrencies  or  their  cash  flow  currencies.  The  breakdown  of  this hedging portfolio is shown in the table below.\n\nAccordingly,  a  portion  of  the  euro  debt  raised  was  converted (1,443.0  million  euros)  to  other  currencies  to  finance  foreign subsidiaries.  As  an  example,  2,498.3  million  euros  equivalent were  raised  initially  in  US  dollar,  and  512.1  million  euros equivalent were raised in euros and converted in US dollar using currency swap contracts. 244.5 million euros were in cash or cash equivalent,  leading  to  an  adjusted  net  debt  in  US  dollars  of 2,765.9 million euros equivalent.\n\n| 2023 (in millions of euros)   | Gross debt -  original issue   | Interest rate and  currency swaps   | Cash and cash  equivalents   | Adjusted net debt   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|\n| EUR                           | 6,885.1                        | (1,443.0)                           | (642.2)                      | 4,799.9             |\n| USD                           | 2,498.3                        | 512.1                               | (244.5)                      | 2,765.9             |\n| JPY                           | 226.2                          | 107.9                               | (18.6)                       | 315.5               |\n| CNY                           | 310.8                          | 3.6                                 | (263.5)                      | 50.9                |\n| TWD                           | 453.7                          | -                                   | (30.1)                       | 423.6               |\n| Other currencies              | 471.7                          | 819.4                               | (426.0)                      | 865.1               |\n| TOTAL                         | 10,845.8                       | -                                   | (1,624.9)                    | 9,220.9             |\n\n| 2022 (in millions of euros)   | Gross debt - original  issue   | Interest rate and  currency swaps   | Cash and cash  equivalents   | Adjusted net debt   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|\n| EUR                           | 7,209.7                        | (1,622.0)                           | (892.7)                      | 4,695.0             |\n| USD                           | 3,543.5                        | 537.3                               | (296.3)                      | 3,784.5             |\n| JPY                           | 108.8                          | 218.2                               | (13.6)                       | 313.4               |\n| CNY                           | 314.6                          | (45.8)                              | (213.9)                      | 54.9                |\n| TWD                           | 387.9                          | -                                   | (12.1)                       | 375.8               |\n| ZAR                           | 264.2                          | -                                   | (41.4)                       | 222.8               |\n| Other currencies              | 344.0                          | 912.3                               | (441.4)                      | 814.9               |\n| TOTAL                         | 12,172.7                       | -                                   | (1,911.4)                    | 10,261.3            |\n\n## 24.6.

OTHER FINANCING INFORMATION\n\nTwo  financial  covenants  are  associated  to  bank  debt  facilities exceeding 50 million euros: they are long term loans used by Air Liquide  Large  Industries  South  Africa  (South  Africa),  for  a  total outstanding  amount  of  169  million  euros  as  of  December  31, 2023. Financial covenants were all met as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe  total  amount  of  bank  credit  facilities  subject  to  financial covenants represents around 3.7% of the Group's gross debt as of December 31, 2023.\n\nBonds issued by L'Air Liquide S.A. and Air Liquide Finance, and making up the carrying amount of bonds as of December 31, 2023, include a change of control clause, with the exception  of  the  20  billion  Japanese  yen  (128  million  euros equivalent) private placement maturing in September 2031.\n\n## Note 25 Financial risk policy and management\n\n## 25.1.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk  management is a priority  for  the  Group.  Consequently,  the Finance  Department  governance  relies  on  Strategic  Finance Committees and Operational Finance Committees.\n\nThe  Finance  Department  centrally  manages  the  main  financial risks, in accordance with decisions taken by the Strategic Finance Committee  to  which  it  reports  on  a  regular  basis.  The  Finance Department  also  performs  country  and  customer  risks  analyses associated  with  investment  decisions  and  attends  Investment Committee meetings.\n\nThe financial policy adopted by Air Liquide, the purpose of which is to minimize the risks incurred by the Group and its subsidiaries, enables  the  Group  to  ensure  sustainable  funding  sources.  To minimize the refinancing risk related to debt maturity schedules, the  Group  diversifies  financing  sources  and  spreads  maturities over  several  years.  In  2023,  the  average  debt  maturity  was  5.5 years. As of December 31, 2023, the long-term debt (gross debt maturing in more than one year) represented 79% of the overall Group debt, compared to 84% as of December 31, 2022.\n\nInterest rate, commodities and foreign currency hedging strategies  validated  by  the  Operational  Finance  Committee  are set  up  depending  on  market  opportunities,  while  complying  with prudence  and  risk  limitation  principles.  Negotiated  market operations  can  be  governed  by  F\u00e9d\u00e9ration  Bancaire  Fran\u00e7aise ('FBF')  contracts  or  by  International  Swaps  and  Derivatives Associates ('ISDA') contracts. These do not include collateralization commitments or margin calls.\n\nThe  Group  also  pays  continuous  attention  to  its  bank  and customer counterparty risks by regularly monitoring ratings issued by  main  international  rating  agencies  and  the  level  of  risk associated with these counterparties. An internal ratings system, set-up  in  2018,  is  used  for  the  most  important  clients  when  no leading credit ratings agency information is available.\n\n## a) Foreign exchange risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Principles\n\nFinancial  instruments  are  only  used  to  hedge  transaction-based foreign  exchange  risk.  The  risk  is  attached  on  the  one  hand  to financial  cash  flows  arising  from  royalties,  dividends,  intra-group loans and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and on the  other  hand  to  foreign  currency  commercial  cash  flows  from operating entities in foreign currencies other than their functional currency.  Although  in  slight  increase,  commercial  cash  flows denominated  in  foreign  currencies  do  not  represent  significant amounts compared to consolidated revenue.\n\nForeign  exchange  risk  related  to  royalties,  dividend  flows  and intra-group loans and borrowings in foreign currencies is hedged by  the  Central  Treasury  Department  using  currency  forwards  or options with an overall term of less than 18 months.\n\nForeign  currency  commercial  cash  flows  from  operating  entities are  hedged  either  as  part  of  the  annual  budgetary  process  for subsidiaries  with  recurring  flows  in  foreign  currency  or  at  the signing date of a sale or purchase contract for non-recurring flows for  the  Engineering  &  Construction  business  line.  Around  a hundred subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange risk. These subsidiaries  mainly  use  currency  forwards  set  up  by Air  Liquide Finance (internal counterparty for hedging transactions) except in countries where it is prohibited by local regulations. The majority of these contracts have short maturities (three to twelve months) and market transactions are regulated by master agreements of the French Banking Federation ('FBF') or by master agreements of the International Swaps and Derivative Association ('ISDA') for local  hedging  operations.  These  do  not  include  collateralization commitments or margin calls.\n\nWhen preparing their budget at the year-end, subsidiaries report their  foreign  exchange  risk  exposure  to  the  Central  Treasury Department  in  order  to  hedge  the  commercial  cash  flows expected in the following year. In each case, the Central Treasury Department  monitors  the  adequacy  of  the  hedges  with  the identified risks and performs a full revaluation of all hedges, every six months.\n\nThe  foreign  exchange  translation  risk  (consolidation  in  euros  of the assets and liabilities in currencies) is not subject to hedging. Indeed,  investments  are  essentially  funded  in  the  currency  in which  the  cash  flows  are  generated,  thus  creating  a  natural currency hedging.",

Regarding  other  currencies,  the  Finance  Department  provides subsidiaries  with  advice  as  to  the  different  types  of  bank  loans and/or  hedging  transactions  to  enter  into  according  to  the characteristics of local financial markets.\n\nThe Group policy is to maintain the major portion of total debt at fixed  rates  and  to  protect  the  residual  balance  using  optional hedging instruments. This approach enables the Group to limit the effect of interest rate fluctuations on financial expenses.\n\nConsequently,  at  the  2023  year-end,  93%  of  the  total  debt  was fixed-rate debt. The fixed-rate/floating-rate breakdown is reviewed on  a  regular  basis  by  the  Finance  Committees,  depending  on interest rate fluctuations and the level of Group debt.\n\n## Sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations on cost of floating-rate debt\n\nThe Group net debt exposed to interest rate fluctuations amounted to around 482 million equivalent euros as of December 31, 2023, for  an  average  outstanding  amount  over  the  year  of  0.6  billion equivalent  euros  (total  debt  adjusted  for  interest  rate  hedging instruments  and  short-term  securities)  in  decrease  compared  to December 31, 2022 (0.8 billion equivalent euros).\n\nAn  increase  or  decrease  in  interest  rates  by  100  basis  points (\u00b11%) on all  yield  curves  would  have  an  effect  of  approximately \u00b16 million euros on the Group's annual cost of debt (accounted in financial charges) before tax, assuming outstanding floating debt remains constant.\n\n## Sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations on derivatives and their underlying hedged items\n\nThe table below shows the effect of a 1% fluctuation of interest rates in all foreign currencies on the interest rate derivatives portfolio in the Group's net profit and equity, as of December 31, 2023.\n\n|                                                             | Interest rate risk   | Interest rate risk   | Interest rate risk   | Interest rate risk   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                                             | +1.0%                | +1.0%                | -1.0%                | -1.0%                |\n| (in millions of euros)                                      | P&L impact           | Equity impact        | P&L impact           | Equity impact        |\n| Interest rate derivatives and their hedged underlying items | (3.0)                | 76.1                 | (4.5)                | (66.2)               |",

They were completed by optional hedges for a total amount of 140 million euros and 200 million US dollar.\n\nTo  protect  the  Group  against  new  rate  increases  in  2024 applicable  to  short-term  financing  (commercial  papers)  and  to other exposure to variable rates, Air Liquide Finance set up firm hedges for a total amount of 400 million euros and 250 million US dollar. They are completed by optional hedges for a total amount of 200 million euros and 200 million US dollar.\n\nAll hedging instruments used for interest rate or foreign exchange risk management purposes relate to identified risks and were set up to comply with the Group's financial policy. The effect on equity primarily stems from the fixed-rate hedging instruments contracted by the subsidiary Air Liquide Finance.\n\n## c)  Counterparty risk\n\nCounterparty  risks  for  Air  Liquide  potentially  include  customers and bank counterparties.\n\nThe  Group's  subsidiaries  serve  a  large  number  of  customers (more  than  two  million  worldwide)  located  in  extremely  diverse markets: chemicals, steel, refining, food, pharmaceuticals, metals, automotive,  manufacturing,  healthcare,  research  laboratories, electronics,  etc.  In  2023,  the  Group's  main  customer  represents around  2%  of  revenue,  the  Group's  10  main  customers  around 12% of sales, and the Group's 50 main customers around 30% of sales. The geographical risk is limited by the Group's sustainable coverage  in  72  countries (1) on  all  continents.  This  diversity reduces customer and market risk.\n\nTo  better  assess  its  exposure,  the  Group  has  implemented procedures to regularly monitor the financial situation of its major customers  as  well  as  a  monthly  reporting  for  the  Group's  169 main  transnational  customers  in  order  to  monitor  the  related consolidated risk.\n\nMoreover, customer risk assessment and in particular the quality of  the  customer's  site  is  an  important  component  of  the investment decision process.\n\nBank  counterparty  risk  relates  to  the  outstanding  amounts  of deposits,  current  accounts,  market  values  of  derivatives  and  to the credit lines contracted with each bank. Pursuant to its financial policy,  in  the  majority  of  cases,  the  Group  requires  a  long-term Standard & Poor's 'A' credit rating or a Moody's 'A2' rating from its counterparties to accept commitments on financial instruments. The  Group's  credit  lines  are  also  spread  among  several  banks from various geographical areas to avoid the risk of concentration while  complying  with  the  same  credit  rating  requirements.  The Operational  Finance  Committee  regularly  reviews  and  approves the list of bank counterparties related to investments and the list of  financial  instruments.  With  regards  to  short-term  investments, outstandings are subject to strict limits per counterparty and are monitored daily.\n\nIFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement specifies that the valuation of currency, interest rate and commodity hedging instruments must take  into  account  the  counterparty  credit  risk  attached  to  these transactions. Considering the aforementioned counterparty selection criteria, the effect on the periodic valuations, by applying the secondary bonds spread method is immaterial.\n\n## d) Liquidity risk\n\nIt  is  Group  financial  policy  to  spread  over  time  the  maturity  of long-term  debt  in  order  to  avoid  concentration  of  annual refinancing needs. Liquidity risk is also reduced by the stability of cash  flows  generated  from  operations  as  well  as  by  having confirmed credit lines in place. The financial covenants attached to  the  current  financing  arrangements described in note 24.7 do not affect the Group's access to liquidity.\n\nThe carrying nominal amount of short-term financing in the form of commercial  paper  amounted  to  401  million  euros  as  of December 31, 2023, an increase by 269 million euros compared to  the  end  of  2022.  The  average  amount  of  commercial  paper amounted  to 617 million euros in 2023, compared  to 756 million euros in 2022.\n\nThe  Group  policy  requires  that  commercial  paper  in  issue  be backed  by  confirmed  long-term  credit  lines.  In  2023,  this requirement was met, with an amount of confirmed credit lines of 3,795  million  euros  largely  exceeding  maximum  outstanding commercial paper.\n\nThe table below presents the maturities of the bilateral and syndicated credit lines:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                      | 2024   | 2025   |   2026 |   2027 |   2028 | 2029   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Bilateral lines and syndicated credit lines | -      | 2,550  |    495 |    200 |    550 | -      | 3,795   |\n\nWhen  the  Group  makes  short-term  financial  investments  other than bank deposits, it systematically favors monetary instruments with a short-term maturity in order to limit the risk of non-liquidity or high volatility.\n\nThe following tables represent the future cash flows related to the main  balance  sheet  items  and  to  the  derivative  financial instruments recognized at the end of the last two periods. Interest flows are calculated in accordance with IFRS 7 and represent the\n\n(1)\n\ninterest payable for each relevant period. Interest flows related to floating  interest  rate  or  foreign  currency  instruments  were calculated  using  the  closing  interest  and  exchange  rates  as  of December  31,  2022  and  2023.  The  flows  related  to  debt repayment obligations differ from the amounts recognized in the Group's balance sheet due to the accounting treatment applied to borrowings and the exclusion of hedging instruments.",

As  Air  Liquide  does  not  purchase  electricity  or  natural  gas  for speculation or arbitrage on commodity price trends purposes, no forward  contracts  relating  to  energy  meet  the  definition  of  a derivative  instrument.  The  contracts  enter  into  as  part  of  the Company's normal business to be used in the industrial process and do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument.\n\nFurthermore,  in  a  global  context  of  highly  volatile  electricity  and natural gas market prices, Air Liquide continues to index long-term customer  contracts  to  hedge  these  risks.  For  natural  gas  and electricity  prices,  the  opening  of  some  markets  led  the  Group, under  these  circumstances,  to  replace  the  regulated  tariffs  by local market indices.\n\nNonetheless,  a  few  contracts  remain  for  which  price  indexation alone  cannot  guarantee  a  total  and  effective  hedge  against  the risk  of  energy  prices  fluctuations.  These  risks  are  therefore hedged by Air Liquide, particularly by Air Liquide Finance, using adequate  commodity  derivatives,  which  are  mainly  swaps  with maturities of generally less than two years. For contracts for the supply  of  industrial  gas  produced  from  renewable  energy,  new risks to be taken into account (long-term commitment, fixed price, intermittency, management of environmental certificates, etc.) can lead  the  Group  to  make  greater  use  of  appropriate  hedging instruments.\n\nThe  fair  value  recognition  of  these  derivative  instruments  had  no material impact on Group equity or profits as of December 31, 2023.",

BUSINESS MODEL\n\nAir  Liquide  offers  to  its  customers  in  the  metals,  chemicals, refining and energy industries gas and energy solutions essential to  their  own  core  businesses,  enabling  them  to  improve  the efficiency  of  their  processes  and  to  make  their  plants  more environmentally friendly.\n\nAir  Liquide's  business model is based on the outsourcing of the industrial gas needs of its customers who often emit greenhouse gases  themselves,  in  particular  in  the  metals,  chemicals  and refining  industries.  This  outsourcing  is  justified  by  Air  Liquide's expertise  which  grants  them  access  to  state  of  the  art technologies, optimized energy consumption of production tools, while  ensuring  the  reliability  of  the  supply  in  the  long  term. However,  it  leads  to  the  transfer  of  a  portion  of  the  customer's greenhouse gas emissions to the Group.\n\nIndustrial gases are used in most industries today and they will be even more so during the energy transition because they are at the heart  of  industry  decarbonization  solutions.  In  a  scenario  of limiting global  warming  to  a  level  significantly  below  2\u00b0C compared to the pre-industrial level, demand will increasingly turn to low-carbon  gases  and  solutions,  in  line  with  changing regulations.\n\nFor the Large Industries activity, which bears most of the assets described below, the supply of gas is contracted for 15 years or more. Such assets are depreciated over the term of the contract, which  significantly  reduces  the  risk  of  impairment.  Within  these contracts, the Group guarantees long-term service continuity and a high level of reliability with respect to the gas supply via a highperforming  industrial  solution.  In  return,  long-term  gas  supply contracts include guaranteed minimum volumes through take-orpay clauses,  as  well  as  the  indexation  to  variable  costs  (mainly electricity  and natural gas), including any CO2 cost (for example ETS schema in Europe), and inflation.\n\n## 31.2.  G ROUP'S ASSETS AND CO \u2082 EMISSIONS\n\nThe main Group assets that impact the CO2 balance are:\n\n- \u25a0 449 large Air Separation Units (ASU), oxygen and nitrogen in particular,  which  do  not  use  any  combustion  processes,  and therefore do not emit CO2 directly. These units use air as their only raw material, while the energy required for the separation of  the  air  is  consumed  almost  exclusively  in  the  form  of\n\nelectricity. The electricity used by the Group to operate these units  generates  CO2  emissions,  known  as  indirect  emissions or Scope 2. The CO2 emissions reductions can be in this case done mostly through renewable electricity purchases;\n\n- \u25a0 57 large hydrogen production units by hydrocarbon reforming, which generate CO2 emissions from natural gas consumption; these emissions are classified as direct emissions (Scope 1). Several  levers  for  reducing  CO2  emissions  are  possible  for these assets: first, carbon capture and sequestration (Carbon Capture and Sequestration - CCS), using a technology owned by the Group, but also the use of biomethane. In addition, the Group  is  developing  the  use  of  low-carbon  or  renewable ammonia, which also helps to reduce the emissions of these units.\n\nAir Liquide carries out a complete inventory of its greenhouse gas emissions,  which  are  reported  according  to  the  different categories  recommended  by  recognized  standards  such  as  the GreenHouse  Gas  (GHG)  Protocol.  The  following  schema represents the CO2 emissions of the Group:\n\nThe data presented have been rounded up to the tenth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a) Emissions are reported in million tonnes of CO2-equivalent using 'marketbased' methodology",

        "page_content": "Thus,  in  2023,  the  Group's  direct  reported  emissions  (Scope  1) and indirect reported emissions (Scope 2) amount respectively to 16.1 million tonnes and 21.5 million tonnes in CO2-equivalent.\n\n## 31.3.  GROUP'S CLIMATE OBJECTIVES\n\nAir Liquide acknowledges the importance and urgency of climate issues. The Group intends to play an active role in achieving the targets  set  out  in  the  Paris  Agreement,  which  defines  a  global framework to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2\u00b0C compared with the pre-industrial level, and by continuing efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nIn  this  regard,  the  Group  has  committed  to  achieve  carbon neutrality by 2050. This long-term objective is based primarily on a massive  reduction  in  CO2  emissions,  with  two  major intermediate milestones:\n\n- \u25a0 the start of reduction of absolute CO2 emissions around 2025;\n- \u25a0 followed  by  a  -33%  reduction  in  Scope  1  and  Scope  2 emissions in 2035 compared with a 2020 baseline (1) .\n\nMoreover, the Group has maintained the objective set in 2018 to reduce  its  carbon  intensity  by  -30%  by  2025  compared  with 2015 (2) .\n\n## 31.4.  TRANSITION RISK - GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS\n\nThe main climate risk identified by the Group at the 2023 closing period relates to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe climate transition risk (greenhouse gas emissions) is closely linked  to  the  need  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions, particularly  through  implementation  by  public  authorities  of greenhouse gas emission reduction policies such as, for example, the  introduction  of  a  carbon  price  or  more  stringent  product regulations, that may impact:\n\n- \u25a0 either  the  Group's  plants  (direct  impact  on  the  operational scope),  resulting  in  increased  production  costs,  which  by contract would be transferred to the customers, and the need for new investments;\n- \u25a0 or those of its suppliers, resulting in suppliers price increases;\n- \u25a0 or customers (indirect impact on the value chain), impacting for instance their market, processes and industrial gases needs.\n\nAccess  to  renewable  energy  is  a  key  element  in  managing  the Group's transition risk.\n\n## The following governance and actions have been implemented to limit the risk on the Group's assets:\n\n- \u25a0 for  all  its  projects,  for  all  geographies,  even  those  without  a current  price  for  CO2,  Air  Liquide  integrates  a  sensitivity analysis around the carbon price into its investment process to assess the project's viability for the client. The Group's internal investment policy requires that this sensitivity analysis be done with a price of 50 euros per tonne, the local current price and a high value of 100 euros or more per tonne, chosen in function of the geography and context. As a reminder, any CO2 cost is contractually  passed  through  to  the  customer,  significantly reducing any impairment risk on the related asset;\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n- \u25a0 in cases where the public carbon price exceeds a certain cap, contracts with some  customers  contemplate  additional investment  to  decarbonize  the  facility  (for  example  by  using carbon  capture  and  sequestration  solutions  -  CCS)  and  the corresponding additional revenue for the Group;\n- \u25a0 the  Group's  electricity  procurement  initiatives  have  been reinforced, in particular the procurement  of  renewable electricity, in order to reduce the scope 2 emissions figures;\n- \u25a0 the trajectory of the climate objectives is centrally managed via a  carbon  budget  allocated  to  the  regions  which  is  revisited every year, in line with intermediary objectives. The Environment and Society Committee of the Board of Directors meets three times a year and once more in a joint session with the Audit  and Accounts  Committee. The  trajectory  of  climate objectives  and  associated  risks  are  reviewed  during  these sessions.  The  implementation  of  these  climate  objectives  is part  of  the  criteria  for  the  Long  Term  Incentive  plans  for  the CEO and for more than 2000 beneficiaries.\n\n## Air Liquide's actions to limit transition risk impacts include:\n\n## Scope 2 reduction:\n\n- \u25a0 related  to  the  449  large  air  gas  production  units  or  ASUs, (Scope 2 emissions) mainly by using renewable electricity: the deployment of the Group's actions in the 10 countries with the greatest  potential  will  significantly  reduce  scope  2  emissions. Since  2018,  Air  Liquide  has  already  signed  20  long-term renewable  energy  supply  contracts  (PPA)  for  an  estimated annual quantity of 3.236 GWh/y (in a full year after start-up of renewable  production  units),  as  well  as  a  Virtual  Power Purchase  Agreement  (VPPA).  As  the  ASUs  are  almost  all electrified, they do not require any  significant specific investment for the transition, because emission reduction will be managed by the purchase of renewable energy depending on access to these sources (see note 29). In addition, the Group has undertaken the electrification of a few steam-driven air gas production  assets,  which  will  allow  them  to  be  completely decarbonized via the supply of renewable electricity;\n- \u25a0 energy  costs,  including  renewable  energy  costs  do  not represent a significant financial risk as they are reflected in the prices charged to customer according to the terms of the 15 years or more contracts.\n\n## Scope 1 reduction:\n\n- \u25a0 related  to  the  57  large  hydrogen  production  units  (scope  1 emissions),  by  mobilizing  various  levers,  in  particular  by capturing  CO2.  Air  Liquide  masters  a  complete  portfolio  of proprietary  technologies  for  capturing  CO2.  For  example,  an advanced Cryocap\u2122 system has been in industrial operation since 2015 on a hydrogen production unit in France. Thus, the decarbonization of the Group's 10 largest hydrogen production units should reduce Scope 1 emissions by more than 40%. The future of these assets and their emission trajectory is analyzed in  the  decarbonization  plans  developed  for  each  geography, taking into account  technology,  unit  capacity,  products, customers  served,  and  the  decarbonization  policies  of  the countries  and  sectors  served.  The  most  suitable  reduction levers are identified and give rise to targeted studies and, in the most advanced cases, the development and implementation of reduction projects, such as CO2 capture projects;",

The  Group  focuses  on  technologies for climate solutions and energy transition. In 2023, Air Liquide had more than 450 patent families on hydrogen.The Group's Innovation expenses amounted to 309 million euros in 2023, including more than 100 million dedicated to climate solutions;\n- \u25a0 in a scenario of limiting global warming to a level significantly below 2\u00b0C compared to the pre-industrial level, the demand for low-carbon  industrial  gas  at  a  higher  price  is  growing  and makes it possible to remunerate the investment necessary for  the  decarbonization of Air  Liquide's  assets,  in  particular for the production of hydrogen, as well as any additional costs linked  to  the  supply  of  renewable  electricity  for  developing energy  transition  markets.  In  addition,  financing  programs  in the  form  of  subsidies  or  tax  credits  are  also  implemented  in Europe  and  more  recently  in  the  United  States  in  order  to support,  during  a  transition  period,  the  decarbonization  of existing  industrial  assets  and  new  units  of  production.  The Group has recently been selected for financing via European grants  for  two  carbon  capture  projects  on  steam  methane reforming  (SMR)  hydrogen  production  units. At  the  end  of 2023,  the  Group  has  not  identified  any  indication  of impairment for the related assets;\n- \u25a0 costs related to CO2 emissions (ex ETS scheme in Europe) are passed-through to the customer according to the terms of the 15 years or more contracts. The Group also applies this business  model  to  the  supply  of  low  carbon  industrial  gas, therefore, Air  Liquide  does  not  bear  significant  risks associated with energy and CO2 costs.\n\nAt the end of 2023, no significant impact has been identified, either on the useful life or on the value of the assets, on the client  portfolio  or  on  the  cash  flows  generated  by  existing activities or on provisions for risks and charges.\n\n## 31.5.  PHYSICAL RISKS\n\nAir Liquide operates in certain regions of the world exposed to changes (in amplitude or frequency) in exceptional meteorological phenomena due to climate change. These phenomena can slow down or interrupt the Group's operations or make them more expensive. Its suppliers and customers are also confronted with this same issue.\n\nThese can be broken down into:\n\n- \u25a0 acute risks triggered by events such as natural disasters, the frequency  and  severity  of  which  are  increasing:  storms, hurricanes, flooding, etc. These risks may relate to Air Liquide sites located near the coast for example, or in regions affected by hurricanes (the US Gulf Coast, South Asia, etc.);\n- \u25a0 chronic  risks  related  to  more  long-term  changes  in  climate models and rising temperatures: rising sea levels, chronic heat waves in certain regions, changes in rainfall patterns and an increase  in  their  variability,  the  disappearance  of  certain resources, etc.\n\nAir Liquide's actions to limit physical impacts include:\n\n- \u25a0 physical risks (water availability, frequency of extreme events, etc.)  are  appraised during the review of investment requests, in  the  same  way  as  financial  criteria,  to  ensure  that  the associated  risk  management  measures  are  adapted,  for example in the design of equipment;\n- \u25a0 Group  operations  which  are  regularly  exposed  to  the  acute risks described above have risk management systems in place aimed  at  adopting  suitable  preventive  operational  measures, and at managing these crises by, first and foremost, protecting individuals  and  the  production  facilities  in  close  cooperation with  customers.  These  systems  are  regularly  updated  and improved;\n- \u25a0 chronic risks are taken into account, in particular in the design of production units, in the same way and to the same extent as their energy efficiency and carbon footprint;\n- \u25a0 losses caused by natural disasters are covered by the Group property and business interruption program;\n- \u25a0 in 2023, Air Liquide initiated a study to identify the perils linked to the physical impacts of climate change according to 2 highemission  scenarios  (SSP2-4.5  used  as  'business  as  usual' leading  to  +2.7\u00b0C  by  2100  and  the  SSP5-8.5  scenario  or 'worst  case  scenario'  leading  to  +4.4\u00b0C  by  2100)  and  to consolidate  and  improve  the  physical  risk  management process. In 2024, this study will continue in order to refine the analysis.\n\nAt the end of 2023, no significant impact has been identified, either on the useful life or on the value of the assets, on the client  portfolio  or  on  the  cash  flows  generated  by  existing activities or on provisions for risks and charges.\n\nTo be noted for both transition risks and physical risks, there is no impact  on  the  dismantling  provision,  as  this  is  an  immediate obligation  provisioned  from  the  date  of  the  Large  Industries contract signature.",

This  Statutory  Auditors'  report  includes  information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the Statutory Auditors or verification of the information concerning the Group presented in the Management Report and other documents provided to shareholders.\n\nThis  report  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  and  construed  in  accordance  with,  French  law  and  professional  auditing  standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting,\n\n## OPINION\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of L'Air Liquide ('the Group') for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2023 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\n## BASIS FOR OPINION\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur  responsibilities  under  those  standards  are  further  described  in  the  Statutory  Auditors'  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe  conducted  our  audit  engagement  in  compliance  with  independence  requirements  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  (Code  de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors, for the period from January 1, 2023 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## JUSTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENTS - KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L.821-53 and R.821-180 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the  justification  of  our  assessments,  we  inform  you  of  the  key  audit  matters  relating  to  risks  of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nLarge Industries activity: qualification of the contracts and related revenue recognition method\n\n## Risk identified\n\nThe  gas  supply  of  the  Large  Industries  activity  is  based  on  long  term  contracts  with  a  limited  number  of  customers  and  requires significant industrial investments.\n\nAs  described  in  note  '3.a.  Revenue  recognition  -  Gas  &  Services'  of  the  accounting  principles  section  of  the  consolidated  financial statements, these investments are usually made to share production capacity with the other business lines of the Group, particularly the Industrial Merchant business or to serve customers connected to pipelines in an industrial region. In such cases, Group management considers that those assets are not identified as defined in the standard IFRS 16 'Leases'.\n\nWhen assets used for the long term supply agreements are dedicated to a customer, the Group considers that it retains the right to direct the  use  of  these  assets  as  defined  in  the  standard  IFRS  16.  Accordingly,  gas  supply  agreements  linked  to  those  assets  are  not considered  as  leases.  These  industrial  investments  continue  to  be  controlled  by  the  Group  and  are  recorded  as  property,  plant  and equipment, the full amounts received for the contracts being, otherwise, recognized as revenue.\n\nCustomers of the Large Industries business simultaneously receive and consume the benefits granted by the gas supply service or its availability. As a result, the revenue recognition related to these contracts occurs when the gas is supplied or when the reserved capacity is made available.\n\nAs described in note 31 \"Climate risk consideration\" to the consolidated financial statements, long term gas supply contracts include guaranteed minimum volumes through take-or-pay clauses, as well as the indexation to variable costs (mainly electricity and natural gas), including any CO2 cost, and inflation.\n\nDue to the complexity of those contracts and the impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements of the judgments made when the contract is signed or in case of subsequent significant modifications, and of the execution of contractual clauses such as indexation clauses to variable costs, we have considered the qualification of Large Industries long term contracts and related revenue recognition criteria as a key audit matter.",

Revenue  recognition  -  Gas  Services'  of  the  accounting principles section of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Large Industries activity: useful lives of production units and measurement of their recoverable amount\n\n## Risk identified\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the net book value of property, plant and equipment amounts to 23,652 million euros, or 48,9% of the Group total assets, that include the significant industrial investments to execute the customer agreements of the Large Industries activity. As disclosed in note '5.e. Property, plant and equipment' of the accounting principles section of the consolidated financial statements, Large Industries production units are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life, usually 15 to 20 years. The estimated useful lives are reassessed on a regular basis and the resulting change in estimates, if any, are recorded on a prospective basis.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group  can  be  exposed  to  certain  risks  specific  to  industrial  investments.  Expected  returns  on  investment  and  their recoverable value can, for example, be adversely impacted by events such as the economic context, overruns and construction delays, start-up conditions, technology changes, geographical location, counterparty risk or the need for new investments in order to meet an increasing  demand  for  low-carbon  industrial  gases.  New  investments  may  also  be  required  to  meet  the  Group  objectives  and commitments to achieve carbon neutrality.\n\nAs  disclosed  in  note  '5.f.  Impairment  of  assets'  of  the  accounting  principles  section  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  Group management determines on a regular basis whether asset impairment indicators exist. If a triggering event is identified, an impairment test is performed to confirm whether the net book value of the asset exceeds its recoverable value. These principles lead the Group to test production assets (either individually or within the cash generating unit to which they are attached), in particular in case of significant start-up  delays,  project  termination,  significant  decrease  in  expected  business  volumes,  early  termination  or  non-renewal  of  related customer contracts, obsolescence of assets in the context of the energy transition.\n\nThe measurement of the recoverable value of the equipment relies on significant estimates relating to the Group's capacity to generate future  cash-flows,  re-use  certain  equipment  for  other  internal  or  external  customers,  to  sell  the  assets,  or  to  obtain  indemnification, notably from customers, or subsidies.\n\nThe Group has carried out a review of its portfolio of assets, identified certain triggering events and thus performed impairment tests, which resulted in an impairment charge of LI assets recognized as part of the total amount of assets impairment (344,9 million euros) disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2023.\n\nDue to the significant value of each production asset and the cumulative value of these assets, the key assumptions used to assess their useful life, their re-use or the compensation to be received, we have considered the useful life and measurement of the recoverable value of Large Industries production assets as a key audit matter.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur procedures consisted notably in:\n\n- \u25a0 understanding the procedures performed by the Group to assess and update the depreciation period of the equipment;\n- \u25a0 assessing the consistency of their useful lives with contractual terms and available internal technical studies;\n- \u25a0 analyzing the Group's process to identify impairment indicators;\n- \u25a0 understanding the work carried out by the Group to determine the recoverable values of the plants, including key assumptions and estimates used to determine the future cash flows;\n- \u25a0 assessing the accounting translation of impairment losses resulting from the determination of recoverable values;\n- \u25a0 assessing,  with  the  assistance  of  our  experts  in  climate  change  and  energy  transition,  the  impact  of  climate  change  and  energy transition on the financial statements, in order to corroborate the Group's assessment that its climate strategy has not resulted in any material impact, neither on the useful life nor on the recoverable value of Large Industries production assets;\n- \u25a0 assessing the absence of obvious inconsistencies between the consolidated financial statements and the Group's other publications addressing the issues related to climate change;\n- \u25a0 verifying  the  appropriateness  of  the  disclosure  included  in  note  '5.e.  Property,  plant  and  equipment'  and  note  '5.f.  Impairment  of assets' of the accounting principles section of the consolidated financial statements and note 31 'Climate risk consideration\" to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Impairment test of goodwill\n\n## Risk identified\n\nIn connection with its external growth strategy, the Group monitors the related goodwill at the level of group of cash generating units. For the  Gas  &  Services  activity,  goodwill  are  mostly  allocated  on  a  geographical  basis.  For  the  world  business  units  Engineering  & Construction and Global Markets & Technologies, goodwill is monitored at the business unit level. As at December 31, 2023, goodwill amounts to a net book value of 14,194 million euros (29,4% of the Group total assets).",

Insofar as the fair value is not significantly greater than the net carrying amount of the cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units, the Group confirms the recoverable amount of the cash-generating  unit  or  group  of  cash-generating  units  using  the  estimated  cash  flow  approach  (value  in  use)  as  described  in  note '5.f. Impairment of assets' of the accounting principles section of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe  determination  of  fair  value  and  recoverable  value,  and  the  sensitivity  to  the  fluctuation  of  market  multiples  and  key  data  and assumptions used, require significant judgement and management estimates, in particular in the context of climate change and energy transition.\n\nWe have therefore considered the impairment test of goodwill as a key audit matter.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur procedures consisted notably in:\n\n- \u25a0 understanding and assessing the principles used to determine the groups of cash generating units;\n- \u25a0 analyzing,  with  the  assistance  of  our  valuation  experts,  principles  and  methods  used  to  determine  the  market  value  and  their measurement based on multiples of market capitalization;\n- \u25a0 corroborate, on the basis of external data:\n- -the results of the Group's impairment tests as of December 31, 2023, and\n- -the consideration of both climate risk and challenges and opportunities relating to the energy transition;\n- \u25a0 assessing the sensitivity of the result of the impairment tests performed by the Group as at December 31, 2023;\n- \u25a0 assessing the appropriateness of the information included in note '10. Goodwill' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Specific verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verification required by laws and regulations of the Group's information given in the Group's Management Report.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to their fair presentation and their consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe  attest  that  the  consolidated  non-financial  statement  required  by  Article  L.225-102-1  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  (Code  de commerce)  is  included  in  the  Group's  information  given  in  the  Management  Report,  being  specified  that,  in  accordance  with Article L.823-10 of this Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained therein and the information has to be subject to a report by an independent third party.\n\n## REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\n## Format of the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Financial Report\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Financial Report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French  Monetary  and  Financial  Code  (Code  mon\u00e9taire  et  financier),  prepared  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer (Directeur  G\u00e9n\u00e9ral),  complies  with  the  single  electronic  format  defined  in  the  European  Delegated  Regulation  No  2019/815  of 17 December 2018. As it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Financial Report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nDue to the technical limitations inherent to the block-tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to the European single electronic format, the content of certain tags of the notes may not be rendered identically to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe  were  appointed  as  statutory  auditors  of  L'Air  Liquide  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  held  on  May  12,  2016  for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and on May 4, 2023 for KPMG S.A.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit was in its eighth year of uninterrupted engagement and KPMG S.A. in its second year.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nManagement  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS)  as  adopted  by  the  European  Union  and  for  such  internal  control  as  management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit and Accounts Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is  not  a  guarantee  that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  will  always  detect  a  material  misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L.821-55 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u25a0 identifies  and  assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs  and  performs  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtains  audit  evidence  considered  to  be  sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u25a0 obtains  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- \u25a0 evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements;\n- \u25a0 assesses  the  appropriateness  of  management's  use  of  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  and,  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- \u25a0 evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  assesses  whether  these  statements  represent  the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- \u25a0 obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance  of  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  for  the  opinion  expressed  on  these  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit and Accounts Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit and Accounts Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Accounts Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe  also  provide  the  Audit  and  Accounts  Committee  with  the  declaration  provided  for  in  Article  6  of  Regulation  (EU)  N\u00b0  537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.821-27 to L.821-34 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Accounts Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, March 4, 2024 The Statutory Auditors French original signed by\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nOlivier Lotz\n\nC\u00e9dric Le Gal\n\nKPMG S.A\n\nVal\u00e9rie Besson\n\nLaurent Genin",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the statutory accounts\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## 1.   General principles\n\nThe statutory  accounts  of  the  Company  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  have been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  accounting  rules  and principles generally  accepted  in  France  according  to  the provisions  of  the  French  Chart  of  Accounts (Plan  Comptable G\u00e9n\u00e9ral) .\n\nThe accounting policies for the establishment and presentation of the statutory accounts have been applied in accordance with the principle of prudence and with the following basic assumptions:\n\n- \u25a0 Going concern;\n- \u25a0 Consistency  of  accounting  methods  from  one  accounting period to another;\n- \u25a0 Separation of each accounting periods.\n\nThe  method  used  for  the  valuation  of  recorded  items  is  the historical cost method.\n\nOnly material information is disclosed.\n\n## 2.   Non-current assets\n\n## A.  Intangible assets\n\nInternally generated  intangible  assets  primarily  include  the development costs of information management systems. They are capitalized  only  if  they  generate  probable  future  economic benefits  and  whether  there  is  available  appropriate  resources (technical, financial and others) to complete the development and use  or  sell  the  intangible  asset.  Internal  and  external  costs corresponding  to  detailed  application  design,  programming,  the performance of tests and the drafting of technical documentation intended for internal or external use are capitalized.\n\nSignificant upgrade and improvement costs are added to the initial cost of assets if they specifically meet the capitalization criteria.\n\nOther  intangible  assets  include  separately  acquired  intangible assets such as software, licenses and intellectual property rights and are measured at acquisition cost.\n\nIntangible  assets  are  amortized  according  to  the  straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.\n\n## B.  Tangible assets\n\nLand, buildings and equipment are recognized at historical cost. Interim interest expense is not included in the cost.\n\nWhere components of a tangible asset have different useful lives, they  are  accounted  separately  and  depreciated  over  their  own useful lives.\n\nDepreciation  is  computed  according  to  the  straight-line  method over their estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 buildings: 10 to 30 years;\n- \u25a0 equipment: 5 to 20 years.\n\nLand is not depreciated.\n\n## C.  Impairment of intangible and tangible assets\n\nThe Company assesses at each closing date whether there is any indication of impairment loss of intangible and tangible assets. If such indications exist, an impairment test is performed to assess whether  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  exceeds  its  present value,  which  is  defined  as  the  greater  of  its  market  value  and value in use.\n\nIn  assessing  value  in  use,  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  are discounted  to  their  present  value  as  this  would  be  done  for  an investment decision.\n\nWhen  the  present  amount  of  an  asset  is  lower  than  its  net carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in the income statement. When the present value exceeds the carrying amount, the  previously  recognized  impairment  is  reversed  to  the  income statement.\n\n## D.  Equity investments\n\nEquity  investments  are  recognized  at  their  initial  amount  on  the entry date, with the exception of those subject to a revaluation as provided  by  Law  76-1232  of  December  29,  1976.  Acquisition costs that are not representative of market value are expensed.\n\nWhen the carrying amount, determined using the criteria normally adopted  for  the  measurement  of  equity  investments  (market multiples  method  based  on  the  Air  Liquide  Group  market valuation,  estimated  cash  flow  approach,  and  net  asset  value remeasured  at  fair  value),  is  lower  than  the  book  value,  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.\n\n## E.  Treasury shares\n\nWhen  the  Company  purchases  its  own  shares,  they  are recognized  at  cost  as  treasury  shares  in  other  long-term investment  securities.  The  gains  or  losses  on  disposals  of treasury shares contribute to the net profit for the year.\n\nHowever, shares allocated for the purpose of implementing plans for free grants of shares are reclassified to a 'Short-term financial investments - Company treasury shares' caption at the balance sheet value on the date of allotment.\n\nA provision is recorded over the rights vesting period to cover the future charge of employees  and  members  of  Executive Management of the Company relating to the remittance of current shares  when  the  performance  criteria  can  be  determined  with reliability.\n\nWhen the purchase cost of shares is higher than their valuation based  on  the  average  share  price  during  the  last  month  of  the fiscal year,  treasury  shares  earmarked  for  cancellation  or allocated for the purpose of implementing plans for free grants of shares are not impaired.\n\n## 3.   Inventories and work-in-progress\n\nRaw  materials,  supplies  and  goods  are  primarily  measured  at weighted average cost.\n\nAn  impairment  loss  is  recognized  for  inventories  and  work-inprogress when the estimated realizable amount is lower than cost.\n\n## 4.   Trade receivables and other operating assets\n\nTrade  receivables  and  other  operating  assets  are  measured  at historical cost.\n\nAn impairment loss for receivables is recognized when it becomes probable that the amount due will not be collected and the loss can be reasonably estimated.\n\n## 5.   Foreign currency transactions\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized when:\n\n- \u25a0 the Company has a present obligation towards a third party as a result of a past event or an ongoing one;\n- \u25a0 it is probable  that  an  outflow  of  resources  embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation;\n- \u25a0 a  reliable  estimate  can  be  made  of  the  amount  of  the obligation.\n\n## 7.   Financial instruments\n\nL'Air Liquide S.A. applies the ANC regulation no. 2015-05 of July 2, 2015 related to financial forward and hedging instruments.\n\nIn accordance with its risk management policy, L'Air Liquide S.A. enters into forward currency purchases or sales in order to hedge the exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with transactions carried out in foreign currencies.\n\nBy  symmetry,  the  foreign  exchange  gains  or  losses  on  forward currency purchases or sales is presented at the same time and in the same income statement caption as the hedged item.\n\nLikewise, the unrealized gain from the hedging is presented within the unrealized foreign currency gains or losses statement caption, to  offset  the  exchange  differentials  related  to  the  revaluation  of underlying  receivables  and  debts.  When  the  forward  currency purchases or sales, hedge future transactions not yet recorded on the balance sheet, the fair value of these instruments represents an off balance sheet commitment.\n\nWhere  applicable,  when  the  financial  instruments  used  do  not constitute  hedging  transactions  ('isolated  open  position'),  the losses resulting from their year-end market value are provided for in  the  income  statement.  In  accordance  with  the  principle  of prudence,  unrealized  gains  are  not  recognized  in  the  income statement.\n\n## 8.   Post-employment benefits\n\nThe Company applies the ANC recommendation no. 2013-02 of November 7, 2013 amended on November 5, 2021 (2 nd method) related to the recognition and measurement of retirement benefits and similar obligations\n\nThe Company provides its employees with various pension plans, termination benefits, jubilees (awards based on years of service) and  other  post-employment  benefits  for  both  active  employees and retirees. These benefits are covered in two ways:\n\n- \u25a0 by so-called defined contribution plans;\n- \u25a0 by so-called defined benefit plans.\n\nThe Company  grants  both  defined benefit and defined contribution plans.\n\nDefined contribution plans are plans under which the employer's sole obligation is to pay regular contributions. The employer does not grant any guarantee on the future level of benefits paid to the employee  or  retiree  ('means-based  obligation').  The  annual pension expense is equal to the contribution paid during the fiscal year which relieves the employer from any further obligation.\n\nDefined  benefit  plans  are  those  by  which  the  employer guarantees the future level of benefits defined in the agreement, most  often  depending  on  the  employee's  salary  and  seniority ('result-based obligation'). Defined benefit plans can be:\n\n- \u25a0 either  financed  by  contributions  to  a  fund  specialized  in managing the contributions paid;\n- \u25a0 or managed internally.\n\nIn  the  case  of  defined  benefit  plans,  retirement  and  similar obligations are measured by independent actuaries, according to the projected unit credit method. The actuarial calculations mainly take  into  account  the  following  assumptions:  salary  increases, employee  turnover,  retirement  date,  mortality,  inflation  and appropriate discount rates.\n\nActuarial  gains  and  losses  exceeding  the  greater  of  10%  of  the obligations or the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the reporting period are amortized over the expected average working lives of the plan participants.\n\nIn  accordance  with  article  L.  123-13  of  the  French  Commercial Code (Code de Commerce), the Company maintained its previous practices:  obligations  related  to  retirement  termination  payments and  jubilees  are  provided  whereas  other  retirement  obligations related to defined benefit plans are not provided but are disclosed in the notes.\n\n## 9.   Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.\n\nRevenue  associated  with  delivery  of  services  is  booked  when delivery is completed.\n\n## 10.   Tax consolidation\n\nL'Air  Liquide  S.A.  has  set  up  a  tax  consolidation  group  with  the French subsidiaries in  which  it  holds  a  direct  or  indirect  interest exceeding  95%,  as  defined  by  article  223-A  of  the  French  Tax Code.\n\nEach  company  calculates  its  tax  provision  as  if  it  was  taxed separately.  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.,  as  head  of  the  tax  consolidation group, recognizes as an expense the tax corresponding to its own profits.  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  booked  in  exceptional  income  and expenses  according  to  the  Opinion  2005-G  of  the  Emergency Committee  of  the  C.N.C  the  impact  of  restatements  and eliminations  when  determining  taxable  profit  as  a  whole.  Tax deferrals of companies with losses are recognized in tax liabilities.\n\n## 11.   Research and Development expenditures\n\nDevelopment costs shall be recognized as assets if and only if the Company can demonstrate all of the following:\n\n- \u25a0 the  project  is  clearly  identified  and  the  related  costs  are individualized and reliably monitored;\n- \u25a0 the  technical  and  industrial  feasibility  of  the  project  is demonstrated;\n- \u25a0 there is a clear intention to complete the project and use or sell the products arising from it;\n- \u25a0 it  is  probable  that  the  project  will  generate  future  economic benefits for the Company.\n\nWhen these conditions are not satisfied, the work carried out does not systematically result in the completion of an intangible asset that will be available for use or sale, development costs generated are recognized as an expense when incurred.",

Significant events\n\nIn 2023,\n\n- \u25a0 Following the decision of the Council of State ('Conseil d'\u00e9tat') in March 2023 which partially questioned the favorable judgment of May 12, 2022 of the European Court of Justice (CJEU) by referring the case to an Administrative Court of Appeal, the Company paid 36 million euros related to the equalization charge (see note 6 and 7).\n- \u25a0 At the same time, the Company cancelled the receivable linked to the refund claim on the equalization charge paid for the years 2000 to 2004 (see note 10). This operation have no impact on the income statement, as the receivable was totally depreciated.\n\n## 2.

The Additional paid-in capital was reduced by the amount of premiums related to these shares, i.e. -17.5 million euros;\n- -capital increase of 4.1 million euros resulting from the subscription of 746,401 shares by employees of the Group ascertained on December 7, 2023 by the Chief Executive Officer, under powers granted by the Board of Director's on July 26, 2023. The additional paid-in capital was increased by 90.9 million euros and has been reduced by the costs related to share capital increase for -2.8 million euros;\n- -capital  increases  of  2.4  million  euros  resulting  from  the  exercise  of  440,106  subscription  options.  The  Additional  paid-in  capital  was  increased  by  the premiums related to these share capital increases, i.e. 28.1 million euros.\n- (c) The change in Retained earnings also includes the difference between the estimated loyalty dividend and the loyalty dividend actually paid and the cancellation of the dividend pertaining to treasury shares.\n- (d) The change in the Accelerated depreciation results from the new accelerated depreciation in accordance with asset depreciation and amortization policies.\n\n## 14.

There  is  therefore  no  isolated  open  position  whose  change  in  fair  value would have a direct impact on the income statement.\n\n## 16.   Retirement and similar plans\n\n## A.  Group retirement benefit guarantee agreement\n\nIn France, Air Liquide grants additional benefits to retirees (3,059 retirees  as  of  December  31,  2023).  These  benefits  provide  a supplemental retirement income based on final pay, which is paid in addition to other normal retirement benefits. This plan is closed to  employees  under  the  age  45,  or  with  less  than  20  years  of service  as  of  January  1,  1996.  These  plans  are  unfunded.  The annual  amount  paid  with  regards  to  additional  benefits  cannot exceed originally  12%  of  total  payroll  or,  in  some  case,  12%  of pre-tax profits of companies involved. This 12% threshold will be proportionately  reduced  by  comparing  the  number  of  plan beneficiaries for the year to the number of plan beneficiaries for the previous year. The additional benefit granted by Air Liquide is indexed  to  the  pension  revaluation  rates  of  normal  and supplemental retirement benefits up to a certain annuity threshold without any indexation beyond. This additional benefit was funded subsequently  to  the  article  50  of  the  law  of  January  20,  2014 securing the future and fairness of pensions plans.\n\nThe contributions amounted to 18.9 million euros after reinvoicing subsidiaries (19.2 million euros in 2022). Excluding the impact of timelines,  and  until  the  plan  ends,  the  actuarial  value  of obligations vis-\u00e0-vis retirees and those eligible as of December 31, 2023 amounts to 390.9 million euros.\n\nBased on the assumptions used for the valuation of the retirement obligations, an estimated 206.4 million euros will be recharged to the  subsidiaries  of  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  as  and  when  benefits  are paid to the retirees.\n\n## B.  Externally funded plan\n\nL'Air Liquide S.A. grants to employees not covered by the preceding plan (1,117 employees as of December 31, 2023) and with at least six months of service, the benefit from an externally funded defined\n\ncontribution  plan.  Contributions  to  this  plan  are  jointly  paid  by  the employer  and  employee.  For  2023,  employer  contributions amounted to 7.2 million euros (8.4 million euros in 2022).\n\n## C.  Retirement termination payments and jubilees\n\nThe  corresponding  obligations  are  provided  for  an  amount  of 48.1 million euros and 1.0 million euros, respectively.\n\n## D.  Calculation of actuarial assumptions and methods\n\nThe  calculations  with  respect  to  the  Group's  retirement  benefit guarantee  agreement,  retirement  termination  payments  and jubilees  are  performed  by  independent  actuaries  using  the projected unit credit method.\n\nActuarial  gains  and  losses  exceeding  the  greater  of  10%  of  the obligations  related  to  retirement  termination  payments  and unrecognized past service costs are amortized over the expected average working lives of the plan participants. As of December 31, 2023, the amounts stand at -0.5 million euros (-5.7 million euros in 2022).\n\nThe  actuarial  assumptions  (turnover,  mortality,  retirement  age, salary  increase)  vary  according  to  demographic  and  economic conditions.\n\nThe  discount  rates  used  to  determine  the  present  value  of obligations  are  based  on  Government  bonds  or  High-quality Corporate bonds, with the same duration as the obligations at the valuation date (3.20% as of December 31, 2023).\n\n## E.  Change in retirement obligations and similar benefits\n\nCompany  obligations  with  respect  to  pension  plans  and  similar benefits break down as follows:\n\n| (in millions of euros)              | Defined benefit  plan   | Retirement  indemnities   | Jubilees   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------|---------|\n| OBLIGATIONS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2023   | 393.8                   | 40.4                      | 1.0        | 435.2   |\n| Service cost                        |                         | 2.0                       | -          | 2.0     |\n| Interest cost                       | 13.1                    | 1.4                       |            | 14.5    |\n| Plan amendments                     |                         |                           |            | -       |\n| Benefit payments                    | (40.7)                  | (1.0)                     |            | (41.7)  |\n| Actuarial (gains) / losses          | 24.7                    | 5.3                       |            | 30.0    |\n| OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2023 | 390.9                   | 48.1                      | 1.0        | 440.0   |",

This Statutory Auditors' report includes information required by European regulations  and  French  law,  such  as  information  about  the  appointment  of  the  Statutory  Auditors  or  verification  of  the  Management Report and other documents provided to the shareholders.This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting,\n\n## OPINION\n\nIn  compliance  with  the  engagement  entrusted  to  us  by  your Annual  General  Meeting,  we  have  audited  the  accompanying  financial statements of L'Air Liquide for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2023 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\n## BASIS FOR OPINION\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de d\u00e9ontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes) for the period from January 1, 2023 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.\n\n## JUSTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENTS - KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 821-53 and R. 821-180 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to  the  justification  of  our  assessments,  we  inform  you  of  the  key  audit  matters  relating  to  risks  of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our professional  judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  our  audit  of  the  financial  statements  of  the  current  period,  as  well  as  how  we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n## Equity investments measurement\n\n## Risk identified\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the net book value of the equity investments amounts to 12 419,3 million euros and represents 86,6% of the total balance sheet. Equity investments are recognized at their initial consideration, excluding acquisition costs and after considering legal reevaluation if any (as provided by Law 76-1232 of December 29, 1976).\n\nAs disclosed in note \"2.D. Accounting policies - Equity investments\" to the statutory financial  statements,  when  the  carrying  amount (determined applying the market multiples method based on the Group market capitalization or the estimated cash flows method or the method of net asset value re-measured at fair value) is lower than the net book value of the equity investment, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.\n\nThe selection of the method used to determine the carrying amount requires significant judgement of the Company.\n\nDue to the significant equity investments balance and the impact of the method retained to determine the carrying amount, we have considered that the measurement of the equity investments as a key audit matter.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur procedures mainly consisted in considering, based on information provided by the Company, the valuation methods applied by the Company, and assessing :\n\n- \u25a0 the assumptions used to determine the re-measured net asset;\n- \u25a0 the methodology and the results of the tests performed based on the Group market capitalization;\n- \u25a0 the  appropriateness  of  information  included  in  notes  \"2.D.  Accounting  policies  -  Equity  investments\",  \"10.  Financial  assets\"  and \"11. Impairment, allowances and provisions\" to the statutory financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nWith respect to the information relating to items that your Company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a takeover bid or exchange offer, provided pursuant to Article L. 22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), we have agreed this information  to  the  source  documents  communicated  to  us.  Based  on  these  procedures,  we  have  no  observations  to  make  on  this information.\n\n## Other information\n\nIn accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the purchase of investments and controlling interests and the identity of the shareholders and holders of voting rights has been properly disclosed in the Management Report.\n\n## REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\n## Format of the presentation of the Financial Statements included in the Annual Financial Report\n\nWe  have  also  verified,  in  accordance  with  the  professional  standard  applicable  in  France  relating  to  the  procedures  performed  by statutory auditors regarding the annual and consolidated financial statements prepared in the European single electronic format, that the preparation of the financial statements included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code mon\u00e9taire et financier), prepared under the Chief Executive Officer's responsibility, complies with the single electronic format defined in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2019/815 of 17 December 2018.\n\nOn the basis of our work, we conclude that the preparation of the financial statements included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as Statutory Auditors of the Annual General Meeting held on May 12, 2016 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and on May 4, 2022 for KPMG S.A.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit was in its eighth year of uninterrupted engagement and KPMG S.A. in its second year.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting principles and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern  and  using  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  unless  it  is  expected  to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit and Accounts Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## STATUTORY AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  will  always  detect  a  material  misstatement  when  it  exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users made on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 821-55 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u25a0 identifies  and  assesses  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  designs  and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u25a0 obtains  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- \u25a0 evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management in the financial statements;\n- \u25a0 assesses  the  appropriateness  of  Management's  use  of  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  and,  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material  uncertainty  exists,  there  is  a  requirement  to  draw  attention  in  the  audit  report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the  financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- \u25a0 evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  and  assesses  whether  these  statements  represent  the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## REPORT TO THE AUDIT AND ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE\n\nWe submit to the Audit and Accounts Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report significant deficiencies, if any, in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Accounts Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also  provide  the Audit  and Accounts  Committee  with  the  declaration  provided  for  in Article  6  of  Regulation  (EU)  No.  537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France as set out in particular in Articles L. 821-27 to L. 821-34 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de d\u00e9ontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes). Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Accounts Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine et Paris-La D\u00e9fense, March 4, 2024 The Statutory Auditors French original signed by\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nOlivier Lotz\n\nC\u00e9dric Le Gal\n\nKPMG S.A.\n\nVal\u00e9rie Besson\n\nLaurent Genin\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group was the first in its industry to obtain validation from the SBTi.\n\nAir Liquide intends to contribute to carbon neutrality by addressing its entire value chain, covering direct emissions (Scope 1), indirect emissions related to energy procurement (Scope 2), as well as the indirect emissions of Scope 3, which includes the other indirect emissions reported.\n\nTo achieve the decarbonization of its assets, the Group has set up processes to measure and control its CO2 emissions on a quarterly basis. Each geography of the Group has been allocated a yearly carbon budget and each new project is evaluated against the global trajectory of decarbonization.\n\nAir Liquide's strategy is based on the decarbonization of its own assets, as well as on a commitment throughout its value chain:\n\n- -upstream, by integrating the reduction of emissions into the purchasing process and supporting its suppliers,\n- -downstream, by developing innovative low-carbon solutions with its customers and co-developing processes like oxy-combustion and CO2 capture.\n\nOverall, the Group contributes to the emergence of a low-carbon society by promoting hydrogen, by developing clean mobility, and by enabling the circular economy with use of biomethane.\n\nThe Group's scopes 1 and 2 CO2 emissions in 2023 totaled 37.6 million tonnes of CO2 (3) . They were down -4.7% compared with 2022 and -4.9% compared with the 2020 baseline. In a context of soft demand from Large Industries customers, the Group's main actions driving  this  improvement  were  the  increase  of  voluntary  low-carbon  energy  supplies  and  to  a  lesser  extent  the  energy  efficiency projects. This decrease in emissions was however slightly penalized by a deterioration in the electricity networks' carbon footprint, especially in Europe.\n\nAware of the importance of contributing to the achievement of carbon neutrality throughout its value chain, in 2022, Air Liquide worked on developing its 'Scope 3' emissions reduction strategy. The value of its customer relationships has led the Group to make a pledge that 75% of its 50 largest customers will have a stated carbon neutrality commitment by 2050, by 2025 and 100% by 2035.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 2035 Objectives   |                                                                                        | 2025 Objectives                                                                        | 2023 Results                                                                 |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 100%              | of the 50 largest customers will  have a stated carbon neutrality  commitment by 2050. | of the 50 largest customers will  have a stated carbon neutrality  commitment by 2050. | of the 50 largest customers  stated a carbon neutrality  commitment by 2050. |\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## EXTRA-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DECLARATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL REPORTING\n\nIntroduction\n\nAvoided emissions: Air  Liquide's  contribution  goes  well  beyond reducing its own emissions, as it brings solutions enabling a strong positive impact for the planet.\n\nAir Liquide, through its activities, helps to avoid greenhouse gas emissions compared with a more carbon-intensive reference situation, via three main levers:\n\n- -via its intrinsically efficient business model, which enables the Group to pool the needs of several different customers in the same basin. The units invested and operated by the Group are therefore larger in capacity, and better valorize the various co-products than it would be the case if each customer had to satisfy its own needs separately;\n- -via the direct use of the Group's products and services, which enable its customers to reduce their emissions for the same level of production. For example, the use of oxygen in a blast furnace reduces the need for coking coal, thereby cutting emissions at the steel mills. The Group is also developing CO2 capture solutions to enable its customers in certain sectors, such as cement, to reduce their emissions by over 90%;\n- -via the impact of the Group's products on the greenhouse gas balance of customers' downstream value chains: for example, the desulfurization  of  road  fuels  using  hydrogen  reduces  black  coal  emissions,  an  aerosol  that  contributes  to  climate  change. The Group is also developing the production and supply of low-carbon or renewable hydrogen to service station operators, enabling end-users - whether transporters of people or goods - to reduce the CO2 footprint of their activity.\n\n## \u25a0 Acting for health.\n\nAir Liquide is engaged alongside patients and communities. In mature economies, the Group improves the quality of life of patients with chronic diseases at home, 55% of them having personalized support plans by the end of 2023, a +12% improvement compared to the year before. In low-and-middle-income countries, Air Liquide facilitates access to oxygen to 2,057,078 people.\n\n## \u25a0 Acting as a trusted partner.\n\nAir  Liquide  strives  to  act  as  a  trusted  partner  with  all  its  stakeholders:  employees,  customers,  suppliers,  shareholders  and  local communities.\n\nAir  Liquide  is  promoting  inclusive  culture  and  diversity.  In  2023,  the  Group  has  reached  a  share  of  32.0% (5) of  women  among Managers and Professionals with an objective of 35% by 2025.\n\nThe Group is committed to providing 100% of its employees with a common basis care of coverage, including death and disability insurance, healthcare and paid maternity leave by 2025. In 2023 the population covered is 78% of employees, an improvement of +86% vs. last year.\n\nAir Liquide supports local social initiatives, with Citizen at Work program. 73% of employees had access to volunteering opportunities in 2023, with the objective of providing such access to its 100% of employees by 2025.\n\n## Other environmental objectives\n\nDecarbonizing the planet is a strategic pillar for the Group. On a broader level, Air Liquide acts as a responsible actor in preserving the environment, particularly water resources and biodiversity.\n\nIn 2023, following the roll-out of the water management policy, focus was given to the deployment of the Group objectives that have been defined in 2021: implementation of a documented water management plan by 2025 to reduce the risks associated with water use in areas of high water stress, and definition and implementation of a Group-wide standard to guarantee the quality of discharged water.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of falling demand and the deployment of efficient water management practices for all the Group activities, the Group's overall annual water consumption decreased by -2%.\n\nAfter an in-depth analysis of the impacts and dependencies of its products and supply chain on biodiversity, Air Liquide has formalized a more detailed framework in 2022, which led it to make its first commitments to preserving biodiversity.\n\n## BIODIVERSITY COMMITMENTS RECOGNIZED BY ACT4NATURE\n\nThe Act4nature International initiative validated Air Liquide's commitment:\n\n- \u25a0 to reinforce biodiversity assessment criteria in the investment process for all new projects by 2024;\n- \u25a0 to develop and implement an aggregated biodiversity indicator by 2025;\n- \u25a0 to raise awareness amongst employees on biodiversity;\n- \u25a0 to reaffirm the Group's climate and water ambition.\n\n(5)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Some  of  these  risks  also  relate  to criteria  in  the  Prospectus  III  regulation,  and  as  such  are presented  in  Chapter  2  of  this  Universal  Registration Document;\n- \u25a0 the  policies  and  procedures  implemented  to  prevent  and mitigate these risks (Chapter 5);\n- \u25a0 the  results  of  these  policies  and  key  performance  indicators (Chapter 5).\n\nIt is structured around environmental, social and societal stakes.\n\nIn the Extra-financial Performance Declaration, the main risks and stakes were identified by the Sustainable Development Department  in  partnership  with  the  Legal,  Financial,  Human\n\nResources and Risks departments. Some of them appear in the Group's overall risks map and have been reviewed by the Board of Directors.\n\nMoreover,  in  identifying  these  risks  and  stakes, Air  Liquide  also takes into account a dual perspective:\n\n- \u25a0 their  internal  impact,  i.e.  on  the  Group's  performance  and development;\n- \u25a0 their  external  impact  taking  into  account  the  perception  of  its stakeholders.\n\nIn order to integrate the main risks and opportunities into Group's strategy, according to the importance given to them by the various stakeholders,  Air  Liquide  updated  the  matrix  of  its  sustainable development  stakes  in  2020.  The  results  of  this  process  are presented in this chapter (page 370).\n\nJust  like  the  Annual  Financial  Report,  the  Environmental  and Societal  reporting  is  reviewed  each  year  by  an  independent verifier.  Audits  by  the  independent  verifier  conducted  in  2023 covered  20%  of  the  workforce  and  45%  of  the  Group's environmental footprint (1) .\n\nFor  further  information,  the  Group's  website  has  a  section dedicated to Sustainable Development at the following link: https:// www.airliquide.com/sustainable-development/act-sustainable-future.\n\nThrough  its  business,  commitment  and  environmental  and  social  actions,  Air  Liquide  contributes  to  achieving  certain  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) introduced by the UN to eradicate poverty, protect the planet and guarantee prosperity for all by 2030. To illustrate this contribution, initiatives by the Group - described in the EFPD - are associated with the relevant SDGs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AIR LIQUIDE PROTECTS LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT\n\nMany industrial and medical gas applications protect the environment on the sites of Group's customers, and life of the Group's patients.

The Group intends to play an active role in achieving the targets  set  out  in  the  Paris  Agreement,  which  defines  a  global framework to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming  to  well  below  2\u00b0C  compared  with  pre-industrial  levels, and  by  continuing  efforts  to  limit  it  to  1.5\u00b0C.  In  this  regard,  the Group  has  committed  to  achieve  carbon  neutrality  by  2050. Air Liquide intends to contribute to carbon neutrality by addressing its entire  value  chain,  covering  direct  emissions  (Scope  1),  indirect emissions  related  to  the  procurement  of  electricity  and  steam (Scope 2), as well as emissions of Scope 3, where other indirect emissions  are  reported.  Two  major  intermediate  milestones support this long-term objective: the start of reduction of absolute CO2  emissions  around  2025,  followed  by  a  -33%  reduction  in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (1) in 2035 compared with a 2020 baseline  in  'market-based'  methodology.  Moreover,  the  Group has  maintained  the  objective  set  in  2018  to  reduce  its  carbon\n\nintensity (2) by  -30%  by  2025  compared  with  2015. The  Group's trajectory  was  validated  by  the  Science  Based  Targets  initiative (SBTi)  in  May  2022  and  has  been  determined  to  be  consistent with  a  scenario  well  below  2\u00b0C  compared  with  pre-industrial levels.  Until  now,  there  is  no  1.5\u00b0C  sectoral  trajectory  for  the chemicals sector in general or for the industrial gases in particular. Nevertheless, Air Liquide has developed its climate objectives on the basis of various studies, including those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in particular the  1.5\u00b0C  report  and  those  of  the  International  Energy  Agency, whose Net Zero roadmap, published in May 2021, sets out levers and  a  trajectory  for  the  chemicals  sector  similar  to  that  of  the Group strategy.\n\nAware of the importance of contributing to the achievement of carbon neutrality throughout its value chain, in 2022, Air Liquide worked on developing its Scope 3 emissions reduction strategy. The value of its customer relationships has led the Group to make a pledge that by 2025  75%  of  its  50  largest  customers  will  have  a  stated  carbon neutrality commitment by 2050, and 100% will by 2035.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## EXTRA-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DECLARATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL REPORTING\n\n## Extra-financial Performance Declaration\n\n## 1.1.2.  Climate risk: greenhouse gas emissions\n\nClimate  risk (greenhouse  gas  emissions)  is  part  of  the Environmental and Societal risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document - page 81).\n\nAir  Liquide's  business model is based on the outsourcing of the industrial  gas  needs  of  its  customers  who  often  emit  large quantities  of  greenhouse  gases,  in  particular  in  the  metals, chemicals and refining industries. This outsourcing is justified by Air Liquide's expertise which allows them to optimize the energy consumption  of  production  tools  and  favor  low-carbon  energy procurement. However, it leads to the transfer of a portion of the customer's greenhouse gas emissions to the Group.\n\nThe main metric to assess the raw risk related to climate transition risks is the CO2 footprint of the Group, or an assessment of the emissions  induced  by  the  Group  along  its  value  chain.  These emissions  are  accounted  for  and  reported  in  Scope  1,  Scope  2 and Scope 3, and the evolution of the metric is monitored through dedicated  processes  in  particular  by  an  analysis  of  variance carried out by Group Management Control.\n\nAlmost  85%  of  Air  Liquide's  large  production  units  are  Air Separation  Units,  which  do  not  use  any  combustion  processes, hence do not directly  generate  any  CO2  emissions. These  units use  air  as  their  only  raw  material,  while  the  energy  required  to separate  air  is  consumed  almost  exclusively  in  the  form  of electricity. Electricity procured by the Group to power these units generates  CO2  emissions  at  electricity  suppliers,  and  are classified as indirect or Scope 2 emissions.\n\nThe  Group's  two  main  activities  that  directly  emit  CO2  are hydrogen  production  through  methane  reforming  and  cogeneration of steam and electricity. These account for nearly 15% of  large  production  units  and  use  combustion  and  chemical conversion processes emitting CO \u2082 , known as direct emissions Scope  1.  Other  sources  of  direct  emissions  include  emissions from  trucks  transporting  products  to  customers  and  small stationary combustion units, e.g. for heating.\n\nIn the interests of defining and developing mitigation measures for this risk, Air Liquide has defined scenarios to assess the impact of this risk on its activities.\n\n## SCENARIOS FOR AIR LIQUIDE'S CLIMATE STRATEGY\n\nIn order to develop and manage the achievement of its climate objectives, Air Liquide draws on scenarios which allow it to:\n\n- \u25a0 plan  its  activities  and  assets  in  a  variety  of  prospective  scenarios  to  guarantee  the  Group's  resilience  going  forward  and  feed  its strategy;\n- \u25a0 develop  an  economic  growth  strategy  which  incorporates  a  reduction  in  the  Group's  emissions  in  line  with  trajectories  that  are compatible with the Paris Agreement;\n- \u25a0 analyze the possible impact of public greenhouse gas emission reduction policies on the Group and on its existing assets, as well as any dependence of the Group's carbon trajectory on these policies, in particular those aimed at making the energy sector and end markets carbon-free;\n- \u25a0 manage the Group's carbon trajectory by monitoring, notably, the impact of new investments made on the carbon footprint.\n\nAs the Group's activities are global and cover a wide-range of sectors, Air Liquide relies on various sources to develop these analyses. These include work by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) based on the findings of climate science, and that of the International Energy Agency (IEA), with a particular focus on the IEA low emissions scenarios, such as the 'Net Zero by 2050' one that provides  insights  into  trajectories  to  net-zero  for  the  energy,  heavy  industries  and  mobility  sectors.  The  IEA  Net  Zero  Scenario  is consistent with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C (with at least a 50% probability), in line with emissions reductions assessed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s Sixth Assessment Report. Such a scenario is used to understand how and at which pace the different segments transform in the different geographies where Air Liquide operates, to ensure the Group's strategy and business model are compatible with the transition to a sustainable economy.\n\n## CLIMATE TRAJECTORY\n\nScience Based Targets commitment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn July 2019, the Group joined the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a certification created  by  a  coalition  of  stakeholders  committed  to  environmental  issues. The  Science Based  Targets  initiative  provides  companies  with  a  methodology  for  setting  a  GHG emissions reduction objective based on climate science and in line with a well below 2\u00b0C scenario or a 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\nFollowing  the  submission  of  its  application  to  SBTi  in  November  2021, Air  Liquide's  objectives  have  been  approved  by  SBTi,  and determined in May 2022 to be compliant with a well below 2\u00b0C trajectory, a 'premi\u00e8re' for industrial gases. However, as of today, there is  no  sectoral  approach specific either to the chemicals sector in general or to Air Liquide's activities, which serve a wide variety of sectors  of  the  economy  with  a  specific  business  model.  The  objectives  submitted  by  Air  Liquide  aim,  for  Scope  1  and  Scope  2 emissions  in  absolute  terms,  at  a  -35%  reduction  in  2035  compared  to  a  base  year  of  2021,  considered  as  the  first  year  with  full deployment  of  'market-based'  reporting. Air  Liquide  has  therefore  joined,  together  with  other  stakeholders,  an  SBTi-led  initiative  to develop  a  sectoral  approach  for  the  chemical  sector  so  it  can  continue  to  contribute  to  the  development  of  methodologies  for  the chemical and industrial gases sector, to ensure methodologies adequately represent the value of its climate actions, both in terms of its emissions and the resulting environmental benefits to its customers through the solutions provided.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Policy and procedures\n\nIn 2022, Group's Climate Policy has been added to the BlueBook, to  consolidate  the  principles  governing  Group's  management  of Climate risks, covering the full value chain.\n\nThe monitoring and achievement of the Group's climate objectives rely on:\n\n- \u25a0 the internal greenhouse gas emissions procedure, which sets out  the  monitoring  of  current  greenhouse  gas  emission regulatory  obligations  with  which  the  Group  must  comply  on this  subject;  the  standardized  methodologies  for  calculating Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, as well as the reporting scope and frequency;\n- \u25a0 integration of the monitoring of the CO2 trajectory performance in  the  Group's  management  process,  in  particular  the  CO2 budgeting process that now includes the allocation of a carbon budget to the different geographical areas, as well as quarterly monitoring  by  geography  and  business  line  at  the  Executive Committee level;\n- \u25a0 the Group Energy & Emissions Risk Management Committee ('E-Enrisk'),  which  reviews  the  entities'  energy  purchasing strategies, examines  the  most  significant commitments submitted  to  it,  and  ensures  that  commitments  made  are consistent with the Group's climate strategy (both upstream of investment decisions and for existing assets). Each month, it brings together the Executive Committee member overseeing the  Large  Industries  World  Business  Line  and  the  Group Strategy  function,  the  Large  Industries  Vice  President,  the Large Industries Director of Markets and Energy Transition, the Director of Energy, the Group Financing and Treasury Director, the  Organization  and  Accounting  Methods  Director,  the Sustainable  Development  Director,  the  Group  Investment Director  and  the  Energy  Transition  Strategy  Director  of  the Hydrogen Energy World Business Line;\n- \u25a0 a  review  of  investment  decisions,  taking  climate  factors,  in particular  a  CO2  price,  into  consideration,  along  with  an analysis of the opportunities and risks associated with energy transition.  This  approach  is  completed  with  a  CO2  price sensitivity study. For all its projects, for all geographies, even those without a current price for CO2, Air Liquide includes in its investment decision process a CO2 price sensitivity study. The Group's  investment  policy  detailed  in  the  BlueBook  requires this  sensitivity  analysis  to  be  performed  with  a  price  of 50 euros per tonne of CO2, the current local price and a high value  of  100  euros  or  more  per  tonne,  depending  on geography and context;\n- \u25a0 the  implementation  of  the  'Climate  Champions'  network  and the yearly review of the geographical decarbonization plans for each group of countries (cluster). The plans define the projects to be carried out in order to reduce CO2 emissions in line with the  Group's  objectives,  such  as  the  supply  of  renewable energy,  CO2  capture  on  hydrogen  production  units  using Steam  Methane  Reforming,  energy  efficiency  programs  or vehicle fleet conversion programs;\n- \u25a0 the assumption of the introduction, in the regions in which the Group  operates,  of  public  policies  aimed  at  stepping  up  the transition toward a low-carbon economy that are in line with a 'well below 2\u00b0C' trajectory.\n\nThe  main  lines  of  the  Group's  action  plans  are  detailed  in  the 'Acting  for  a  low-carbon  society'  infographics  on  pages  327  to 330.\n\nIn  order  to  reduce  its  indirect  emissions  related  to  power procurement  (Scope  2  emissions),  Air  Liquide  is  increasing  its sourcing of renewable power, using several approaches depending on local conditions allowing access to renewable power.\n\nThe main approach is the signature of long term Power Purchase Agreements (PPA). However, the Group may purchase certificates such as Guarantees of Origin that may or may not be bundled with power delivery especially when integration of a PPA into  the  sourcing  portfolio  is  uneasy  or,  in  areas  supplied  by regulated utilities, through 'green tariffs'.\n\nEnergy  costs  (electricity  for  air  gases  and  natural  gas  for  units producing hydrogen by methane reforming) and those related to CO2 emissions  (e.g.  ETS  scheme  in  Europe)  are  re-invoiced  to customers in the frame of a long-term contract (15 years or more). The Group also applies this business model to the supply of lowcarbon  gas,  so  Air  Liquide  does  not  bear  significant  risk associated with energy and CO2 costs.\n\nAware  of  the  importance  of  contributing  to  the  achievement  of carbon neutrality throughout its value chain, in 2022, Air Liquide worked on developing its Scope 3 emissions reduction strategy. The value of its customer relationships has led the Group to make a pledge that by 2025 75% of its 50 largest customers will have a stated carbon neutrality commitment by 2050, and 100% will by 2035. In addition, Air Liquide will continue its in-depth analysis of all  Scope  3  emission  categories  leveraging  the  work  carried  out by the Expert Advisory Group (EAG) led by SBTi. To support the Group in the achievement of carbon neutrality, the Procurement department  initiate  in  2021  a  climate  roadmap  'Procure  to Neutrality'  based  on  four  pillars:  measure,  engage,  leverage  to value, reduce, see Sustainable procurement and suppliers section on page 384.",

This method does not generally deal with a product's economic or social aspects, but the approach and methodologies of the  life  cycle  described  in  the  international  standard  can also be applied to these other aspects.\n\nA team of LCA practitioners operating from the different R&D  centers  of  the  Group  supports  the  Group  in deploying this tool to assess and quantify, on products or projects, positive and negative impacts on climate, water and marine resource, waste, pollutant emissions, biodiversity, and ecosystems.\n\nFor instance, Air Liquide's production of hydrogen delivered to refineries leads to direct CO2 emissions: an in-depth life cycle analysis highlighted the fact that the environmental cost relating to the CO \u2082 emissions associated with this hydrogen production is largely offset by the benefit of the elimination of acid rain and the decrease in respiratory diseases.\n\nThe Group relies on this LCA approach to:\n\n- \u25a0 assess and take account the environmental impacts when designing technologies, products, and offers;\n- \u25a0 maintain and enrich its interactions with stakeholders by proposing sustainable solutions to customers and suppliers;\n- \u25a0 improve  the  efficiency  of  its  processes,  rethink  the  production  chain  and  make  the  best  long-term  strategic  choices  for  its investments.\n\nIn  2023,  Air  Liquide  has  carried  on  with  the  project  aiming  at  harmonizing  methodologies  for  calculation  of  Carbon  Footprint  of Products.  The  project  covers  the  various  gases  produced  and  sold  by  the  Group  and  their  respective  production  pathways.  The objective is to provide clear information to customers on their carbon footprint related to  supplies from Air Liquide and support them in their CO2 emissions reduction journey.\n\n## CLIMATE AND ENERGY TRANSITION TRAINING\n\nIn  2023,  Air  Liquide  University  organized  two  virtual  events  open  to  all  Group employees: an opportunity for internal facilitators to share their knowledge with their colleagues on various subjects such as Climate & Energy Transition, Digital &  IT,  Inclusion  &  Diversity,  Innovation,  Management  &  Leadership,  Operational Excellence, Personal Development and Sales & Marketing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo meet the demand for training highlighted by the internal survey conducted in 2022 on the subject of sustainable development, Air Liquide University continued to  organize  'Climate  &  Energy  Transition'  online  training  courses  in  2023.  The aim of the webinars is to share the Group's vision and provide knowledge and behaviors to ensure resilience and secure growth opportunities in the context of the climate and energy transition. The topics covered are climate, customers and technology.  These  training  sessions  are  open  to  all  employees  live  and  also remain  available  after  the  event.  In  2023,  40  sessions  were  organized  on 17 different topics related to the climate and energy transition, with a total of more than 4,000 connections and around 1,900 participants.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Engaging internal stakeholders\n\nSince the announcement of its first climate objectives at the end of 2018,  Air  Liquide  set  up  a  dedicated  in-house  organizational structure. The announcement of these objectives and the associated action plan have proven to be factors that drive engagement among Group employees and were further boosted by the announcement of  the  sustainability  objectives  in  March  2021,  as  well  as  by  the ADVANCE strategic plan published in March 2022.\n\n## Climate Champions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPresent  within  each  cluster  (group  of  countries),  Climate Champions  are  responsible  for  managing  the  Group's  CO2 emissions reduction objectives. The  Climate  Champions are the Sustainable  Development  Department's  point  of  contact  in  the different clusters (group of countries).\n\nThey  coordinate  the  development  of  a  roadmap  that  defines  all the  operational  measures  required  to  achieve  the  climate objectives. Their role includes monitoring KPIs, rolling out projects and reporting progress.\n\nThe Group Sustainable Development Department is the facilitator of this network  that  is  currently  composed  of  14  Climate Champions:  meetings  are  held  monthly,  and  in  2023,  a  two  day webinar brought together more than 40 experts and managers to share  experiences  and  good  practices  regarding  evolution  of regulations, decarbonization technologies and solutions, renewable energy sourcing, and other CO2 emissions reduction topics.\n\n## Healthcare ESG Champions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIntroduced in July 2021, Healthcare ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance)  Champions  are  present  within  each  of  the  Home Healthcare  entities  in  the  mature  countries  where  the  Group operates.\n\nEach quarter,  these  champions  are  responsible  for  reporting  on the  number  of  patients  under  personalized  care  programs;  they also report on the projects rolled out in their entities for improving the quality of life of home patients with chronic diseases, such as the  development  of  patient  boards  and  the  production  of innovative learning materials.\n\n## Sustainability Ambassadors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe employees established a network of volunteers to support the Group's  sustainable  development  approach.  Previously  called 'Climate Ambassadors' and renamed 'Sustainability Ambassadors' in  2022  to  account  for  the  extended  role  covering  all  aspects  of sustainable development, the members implement local initiatives within their entities, raise awareness among employees and share best practices.\n\nTheir  actions  cover  recycling,  zero-waste  campaigns,  and sustainable  mobility.  The  network  has  more  than  600  members, demonstrating  the  great  interest  of  employees  in  sustainable development issues.\n\nThese actions are also relayed on a dedicated Intranet site where general information on sustainable development and the Group's strategy  in  this  area  is  accessible:  sustainable  development objectives,  educational  videos,  articles,  current  projects,  local initiatives, etc.\n\n## SEVERAL INITIATIVES FROM OUR SUSTAINABILITY AMBASSADORS AROUND THE WORLD\n\nThroughout  the  year,  the  voluntary  network  of  Sustainability Ambassadors  organized  initiatives  around  the  world  to  promote sustainable development, raise awareness and encourage action on environmental issues. For example:\n\n- \u25a0 promote:  contests  on  the  best  sustainable  development initiatives  in  Latin  America,  calculating  employees'  carbon footprint,  participation  in  workshops  to  there  environmental footprint on a daily basis in Europe, etc.;\n- \u25a0 raising awareness: participation in external and internal trainings or conferences such as a 'Sustainability Talk' in Taiwan Island;\n- \u25a0 take  action:  waste  collections  in  France  and Asia,  tree-planting activities  in  Canada,  organization  of  'Sustainable  Development Week' in several regions, waste recycling initiatives in Singapore.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY DAY\n\nAs Air Liquide makes progress towards its sustainability ambition, it is  of the  utmost importance  to  ensure  employees  have  the necessary information and resources to understand the Group's objectives, the progress made  towards achieving those objectives, and  that they  can  relate  their  own  actions  to  the Group's sustainability strategy.\n\nIn  order  to  inform  and  to  promote  the  Group's  sustainability objectives, the Group  hosted  the  second  edition  of its 'Sustainability Day' on June, 12 2023. This internal event featured a corporate webinar featuring sustainability actions and initiatives taking place all around the world.\n\nIn December 2022, the Group launched an internal sustainability survey, reaching  more  than  78%  of the  Group  population, to measure the interest of its employees in ESG thematic as well as their  personal  involvement in  these  subjects. The data collected provides  insight into the Group's  strengths, for instance, employees' belief that sustainability should be a top priority for Air Liquide. In this sense, the survey also reflects opportunities for the Group to improve, notably by providing sufficient information and training  on  sustainability  topics. In  2023, Air  Liquide  launched targeted  actions  to  address  employees' feedback  and  increase sustainability-related engagement, including training courses and roundtables on topics such as energy transition, carbon neutrality, biodiversity and inclusive purchasing.",

Climate: physical impact on operations\n\nThis risk is part of the Environment and Society risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document - page 81).\n\nAir  Liquide  operates  in  certain  regions  of  the  world  exposed  to changes (in severity  or  frequency)  in  exceptional  meteorological phenomena due to climate change. These phenomena can slow down  or  interrupt  the  Group's  operations  or  make  them  more expensive. Its  suppliers  and  customers  are  also  confronted  with this same issue.\n\nThese can be broken down into:\n\n- \u25a0 acute risks, triggered by events such as natural disasters, the frequency  and  severity  of  which  are  increasing:  storms, hurricanes, flooding, etc. These risks may relate to Air Liquide sites located near the coast for example, or in regions affected by hurricanes (the Gulf Coast, South Asia, etc.);\n- \u25a0 chronic risks, related to longer-term changes in climate models and rising temperatures: rising sea levels, chronic heat waves in certain regions, changes in rainfall patterns and an increase in their variability, the disappearance of certain resources, etc.\n\n## 1.2.2.  Policy and procedures\n\nPhysical risks (water scarcity, frequency of extreme events, etc.) are  appraised  during  the  review  of  investment  requests,  in  the same way as financial criteria, to ensure that the associated risk management measures are adapted, for example, in the design of equipment.\n\nIn  addition,  Group  operations  that  are  regularly  exposed  to  the acute  risks  described  above  have  risk  management  systems  in place aimed at adopting suitable preventive operational measures and  managing  these  crises  by,  first  and  foremost,  protecting individuals and the production facilities in close cooperation with customers. These systems are regularly updated and improved.\n\nChronic risks are taken into account, particularly in the design of production units, in the same way, and to the same extent as their energy efficiency and carbon footprint.\n\nPhysical risks are furthermore taken into account at Group level, especially  in  (i)  the  Water  Management  Policy,  which  concerns, among  other  things,  water-related  risks  for  production  units  for which this risk is proven, and (ii) Business Continuity Plans that ensure  the  resilience  of  operations  in  the  event  of  disruption, including extreme climatic events.\n\nIn 2023, Air Liquide has initiated the development of a procedure for the different activities across the Group to:\n\n- \u25a0 identify,  for  the  different  activities  and  types  of  assets,  the relevant perils linked to the physical impacts of climate change in high emissions scenarios;\n- \u25a0 evaluate  the  importance  of  these  perils  for  the  Group's activities;\n- \u25a0 develop, if necessary, adaptation plans to mitigate these risks.\n\nThese risks, like the risk of greenhouse gas emissions, are taken into  account  in  the  preparation  of  the  Financial  Statements (paragraph 'Use of estimates and assumptions' of the accounting principles and Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Chapter 4) - page 233 and 282 respectively).\n\n## 1.2.3.  Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to UN  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  9  'Industry, innovation and infrastructure,' 11 'Sustainable cities and communities'  and  13  'Take  urgent  action  to  combat  climate change and its impacts'.\n\nIn  2021  and  2022,  a  preliminary  assessment  was  performed  by Air Liquide's experts based on literature review. In 2023, a more detailed  analysis  on  physical  climate  risks  was  conducted  was performed  with  the  support  of  a  consulting  firm.  This  analysis covered the following elements:\n\n- \u25a0 selection of climate scenarios: two climate scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were selected for the analysis: the scenario SSP2-4.5, used as 'business as usual', leading to +2.7\u00b0C by 2100 and the  scenario  SSP5-8.5  or  'worst  case  scenario',  leading  to +4.4\u00b0C by 2100. A time horizon of 2040 was selected as it is consistent  with  the  lifetime  of  the  majority  of  assets  invested and operated by Air Liquide;\n- \u25a0 definition  of  the  physical  climate  risk  universe:  a  series  of interviews with Air Liquide's Industrial Departments to identify the most significant perils in the short, medium and long terms;\n- \u25a0 exposure  analysis:  the  analysis  was  performed  on  a  site's location-based  approach  for  the  perils  under  each  climate scenario.  As  a  result,  Air  Liquide  identified,  within  its  own production  sites,  the  sites  that  may  be  exposed  to  perils  by 2040;\n- \u25a0 vulnerability  analysis:  the  analysis  of  the  vulnerability  of  Air Liquide's sites was performed on a qualitative basis including the  description  of  the  main  operational  impacts  for  the  sites exposed to perils.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the main perils identified as relevant at Group level include high temperature, drought and fire. As an outcome  of  the  vulnerability  analysis,  a  mitigation  plan  will  be established where needed. In 2024, this analysis will serve as a basis to deploy the corresponding risk management process.\n\nThe  same  approach  and  the  corresponding  risk  management process are used by the Group to carry out the assessment of the 'Climate  Change  Adaptation'  No  Significant  Harm  criterion  for activities  identified  as  eligible  under  the  European  Taxonomy Regulation  and  aligned  with  the  Substantial  Contribution  criteria and Minimum Guarantees.\n\n## 1.3.   WATER MANAGEMENT\n\n## 1.3.1.  Water management risk\n\nThe  Group  depends  on  water  for  its  activities.  Its  water consumption is related to the loss of water by evaporation in the process  of  cooling  rotating  machines,  particularly  for  the production  of  air  gases,  or  its  use  as  a  raw  material  for  the manufacture of products such as hydrogen.\n\nAir  Liquide  pays  particular  attention  to  water  management, especially in areas of water stress. The main water management risk  for  Air  Liquide's  activities  is  defined  as  the  potential unavailability  of  water,  which  could  result  in  a  slowdown  or shutdown  of  a  production  unit.  Moreover,  Air  Liquide  integrates the  risks  for  other  stakeholders  in  its  water  management.  The management of water in its activities can have two main types of impact on people:\n\n- \u25a0 related to the withdrawal and use of water on the sites where the Group operates; or\n- \u25a0 related to the quality of water returned to ecosystems after use.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Policy and procedures\n\nTo manage the risks associated with water withdrawal and use as well as the quality of the water returned to ecosystems, a water management policy has been published in the BlueBook in 2021.\n\nThis policy identifies the impact of Air Liquide's activities on water availability  and  quality.  The  policy  defines  the  principles  of  risk management based on a specific assessment of the situation at each site.  Finally,  it  describes  the  actions  to  be  implemented  to ensure appropriate water management.\n\nIn  2023,  Air  Liquide  published  in  its  website  a  document  to describe  its  commitment  to  responsible  water  management, available at the following address: https://www.airliquide.com/sites/ airliquide.com/files/2023-07/air-liquide-water-stewardship.pdf\n\n## WATER MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES\n\nIn  2023,  following  the  roll-out  of  the  water  management  policy, focus was given to the deployment of the Group objectives that have been defined in 2021:\n\n- \u25a0 implementing a documented water management plan by 2025 aimed at  reducing  water  withdrawal  and  use  risks  for  waterintensive operations in areas of high water stress;\n- \u25a0 defining  and  implementing  a  Group-wide  standard  for  all operations  that  goes  beyond  existing  local  processes  and procedures  and  which  will  guarantee  that  the  quality  of discharged water meets or exceeds applicable local criteria.\n\nThe action  plans  to  achieve  these  objectives  are  in  progress  in 2023. In particular this foundation work included:\n\n- \u25a0 the execution of guidelines and tools for implementing a water management  plan  for  water-intensive  operations  in  areas  of high water stress;\n- \u25a0 the  integration  of  a  new  technical  standard  regarding  the sustainable  monitoring  and  control  of  wastewater  into  the Group's industrial management system.\n\n## 1.3.3.  Performance\n\nThe  actions  undertaken  by  the  Group  contribute  to  the  United Nations  (UN)  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  6  'Clean water  and  sanitation'  and  12  'Responsible  consumption  and production'.\n\nFor several years, Air Liquide has been implementing initiatives to improve data collection and better guide water management on its production  sites  to  reduce  water  consumption,  particularly  in water-stressed areas.\n\nIn  2023,  Air  Liquide  consumed  89  million  m\u00b3  of  water,  a  -2% decrease  compared  with  2022,  which  is  mainly  related  to  the deployment of the best practices for water management.\n\nAir Liquide withdrew 944 million m\u00b3 of water from various sources. 88%  came  from  customers,  4%  came  from  freshwater  sources such  as  rivers  and  lakes,  2%  from  municipal  supply  and  the remaining 6% from various other sources.\n\nIn 2023, more than 87% the water discharged from the Air Liquide facilities has been reused by third parties (typically customers) for their own usage, after treatment, if necessary. This usage allowed the third party to not withdraw the corresponding amount of water from the natural environment.\n\nIn  terms  of  water  usage,  several  types  of  cooling  systems  are utilized at Air Separation Units (ASU):\n\n- \u25a0 61% of these units have semi-open water circuits, where some of the water evaporates during cooling;\n- \u25a0 32%  of  these  units  have  open  circuits.  The  water  passes through the plant to cool it, and all the water taken is returned. Both  types  of  units  require  continuous  water  top-ups  for\n- cooling;\n- \u25a0 finally,  the  other  units  have  closed  systems,  which  do  not withdraw  water  from  their  surrounding  environment.  These consume no water after the initial filling.",

This assessment takes into account the specific data for each site according to its location in terms of a watershed, groundwater and an  administrative  boundary.  A  new  version  of  the  map  of  the World Resource Institute (WRI) was published in August 2023 and will be used in 2024.\n\nTo  carry  out  this  assessment,  the  Group  used  the  'business  as usual'  scenario  (SSP2-4.5  of  the  IPCC).  Each  site  is  thus identified as belonging to an area of water stress (3) or  not (area defined  according  to  the  intensity  of  water  competition).  This mapping also includes new units.\n\nThe  analysis,  conducted  in  2022,  focused  on  water  intensive operations  (i.e.  facilities  that  have  a  water  withdrawal  greater  than 50,000 m 3 per year) showed that there are 76 sites (4) located in high and  extremely  high  water  stress  locations.  In  2023,  the  Water Management  Plan  is  rolled  out and  a  part  of  the  water-intensive operations in areas of high water stress are audited and integrated in the water risk management process. By 2025, 100% of these sites have the objective of implementing a documented management plan aimed at reducing water withdrawal and use risks.\n\nAdditionally, since September 2023, the technical standard regarding the sustainable monitoring and control of industrial wastewater has been issued and the deployment phase is in progress. Following this analysis,  the  monitoring  standardization  of  the  quality  of  the discharge of industrial wastewater is thus reinforced across all of the Group's activities. According to these analyses, no body of water or associated habitat were significantly affected by water discharge or water runoff from the Group's units in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group continues  to  support  its  customers  to  meet  more  stringent regulations,  and  to  fight  water  stress  and  scarcity  with  costeffective solutions.\n\nAir Liquide's 'Essential Small Molecules' (mainly O2, O3 and CO2) play  a  fundamental  role  in  drinking  water  and  wastewater treatment  processes.  These  gases  are  key  to  balance  mineral levels  in  desalination  of  water  plants,  or  to  eliminate  pollutants from  surface  drinking  water.  For  industrial  players  seeking technologies  to  treat  and  recycle  water,  these  molecules  help boost  the  removal  of  organic  pollution  from  wastewater  and  to avoid corrosion or clogging in cooling systems.\n\nThe  Group  continues  to  innovate  in  water  treatment  to  help respond to the growing needs of global markets.\n\nFor example, over the last years, Air Liquide has been working on gas applications for water reuse, in particular CO2 use in combination with membrane filtration systems (reverse osmosis). This solution is safer  than  traditional  sulfuric  or  chloridric  acid,  ensures  more precision  on  dosage  and  reduces  the  emissions  of  sulphates  or chlorates. These advantages are in addition to the high water reuse rates  achieved  by  the  activity  of  the  sites  where  this  technology  is used. In 2023, the solution has been installed in a food industry in Belgium  which  recycles  2,500m\u00b3/day  of  water  in  the  course  of  its activity, the equivalent of an Olympic swimming pool per day.\n\n(5)\n\n## 1.4.   BIODIVERSITY\n\nBiodiversity  refers  to  living  species  of  all  kinds,  including terrestrial,  marine  and  other  aquatic  ecosystems,  and  also  the ecosystems to which they belong. It includes diversity within and between species, the diversity of ecosystems, and the interactions between living organisms.\n\n## 1.4.1.  Risk associated with biodiversity\n\nAir  Liquide  is  mindful  of  its  impact  on  biodiversity,  which encompasses  both  the  diversity  of  living  things  and  the  links between  species  themselves.  At  a  time  when  the  balance  of natural  environments  is  threatened,  it  is  important  to  preserve biodiversity - not only because of the many services it provides to human society, but also for its own intrinsic value.\n\nThere  are  two  ways  in  which  companies  can  interact  with biodiversity:  in  terms  of  impact  and  in  terms  of  dependency.  In addition, the IPBES (5) identified five pressures that companies can have on biodiversity, which are land degradation, pollution, climate change,  overexploitation  of  biological  resources  and  invasive species.  The  approach  to  the  issue  of  biodiversity  must  therefore cover the company's entire value chain, from resource management to product life cycle analysis and must cover the five pressures.\n\nAir  Liquide  completed  an  in-depth  review  of  its  value  chain's impact  on  biodiversity  through  an  assessment  of  the  direct  and indirect  impact  along  the  value  chain:  not  only  the  Group's operation  but  also  upstream  and  downstream,  This  approach allowed to identify its positive and negative impacts as well as its dependencies.",

For this reason, the Group's impact in terms of land occupation and degradation is limited and, where necessary, is the subject of particular attention,\n- -the  other  impacts  are  primarily  indirect  and  linked  to  CO2 emissions, water consumption and discharges, and certain atmospheric  discharges  which  are  already  addressed through other dedicated Policies and actions, in particular the Group Climate Policy and Water Policy;\n- \u25a0 The main impacts associated with biodiversity are indirect and outside of the Group operations:\n- -the  electricity  sourcing  mix  of  the  Group  has  an  indirect impact  on  water  consumption  and  climate  change  due  to certain energy sources used, such as nuclear, natural gas or  coal,  which  have  direct  impacts  on  water  consumption and climate change,\n\n- -some  other  impacts  identified  as  minor  linked  to  specific sourced  materials,  as  well  as  to  fuels  and  feedstocks production have been identified;\n- \u25a0 Furthermore,  the  Group  allows  avoiding  certain  impacts  on biodiversity  through  some  of  its  products  such  as  hydrogen used for fuel desulfurization, thus reducing emissions of sulfur compounds, as well as through its solutions to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gases emissions of its customers.\n\n## 1.4.2.  Policy and procedures\n\nThe  Group  currently  addresses  the  issue  of  biodiversity  in different ways, each adapted to the issue at stake:\n\n- \u25a0 Seppic  (a  Group  subsidiary  developing  specialty  ingredients) and biomethane's activities have their own dedicated policies to  address  their  business-specific  issues.  Seppic  commits  to reduce the pressures that its supply puts on biodiversity;\n- \u25a0 a  procedure is  being  developed to assess the environmental impact of new projects;\n- \u25a0 main indirect impacts of the Group are addressed through the climate  change  and  water  policies,  and  industrial  standards regarding waste and pollutant emissions.\n\nAs  part  of  its  commitment  to  preserving  biodiversity,  and  in addition  to  the  specific  initiatives  in  the  specific  activities  where biodiversity  is  deemed  relevant,  Air  Liquide  participates  to  the Act4Nature initiative.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Given this  multifunctionality,  understanding  the  impact  of  biomethane production projects is complex. Investing in sustainable biomethane  therefore requires an in-depth study of the specificities  of  each  project  and  an  overall  understanding  of  the environmental  externalities,  not  only  on  climate,  but  also  on biodiversity,  air  and  water  quality,  as  well  as  the  nitrogen  and phosphorus cycles.\n\nTherefore, Air Liquide and WWF France joined forces in 2022 and got  the  support  of  international  experts  to  design  a  first  set  of principles,  criteria  and  indicators  to  frame  what  'sustainable biomethane  production'  means  beyond  existing  regulatory environments.  The  objective  is  for  Air  Liquide  to  methodically understand,  measure,  report  and  manage  the  sustainability characteristics  of  its  current  operations  and  future  projects.  This project will lead in 2024 to the release of two main deliverables:\n\n- \u25a0 an internal charter which will serve as a concrete sustainability assessment for any new biogas projects to be presented to Air Liquide investment committees.\n- \u25a0 a  public  synthesis  that  will  aim  at  increasing  the  awareness around biomethane projects' potential impacts, and to engage further collaboration with the ecosystem towards more efficient sustainability frameworks for renewable gases production.\n\n## Seppic\n\nSpecial  attention  is  paid  to  the  value  chain  of  Seppic,  an Air Liquide  subsidiary  which  has  been  manufacturing  and marketing  specialty  ingredients  for  80  years.  As  Seppic's biodiversity  challenges  mainly  relate  to  procurement,  Seppic ensures  that  supplies  comply  with  the  Group's  responsible procurement policy. More  specifically, Seppic adheres to biodiversity  regulations  for  the  countries  in  which  it  accesses genetic  resources  and  their  derivatives;  to  the  principles  of  the Convention  on  Biological  Diversity  and  the  Nagoya  Protocol  for access  to  genetic  resources  and  the  sharing  of  benefits  arising from their utilization. Seppic constantly monitors developments in associated regulatory tools and the status of the plant and marine species it uses with regard to CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) and UICN (International Union for the  Conservation  of  Nature)  lists  of  threatened  and  endangered species.  An  internal  validation  process  is  established  with  a steering  committee  to  ensure  that  the  use  of  raw  materials complies with the Nagoya Protocol and applicable national laws.\n\nIn addition, as palm derivatives represent almost half of its natural origin  inputs  by  volume,  Seppic  is  taking  actions  to  actively promote  the  sustainable  transformation  of  the  palm  oil  supply chain and to be compliant with the new legislation adopted by the European Union to fight imported deforestation.\n\n## 1.4.3.  Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 12 'responsible consumption and production' and 15 'Life on land'.\n\n## Actions undertaken by the Group\n\nAfter  identifying  in  2020  the  biodiversity  topic  as  a  topic  requiring further  assessment, Air  Liquide  launched  in  2021  and  finalized  in 2022 a project with the company I Care & Consult (ICC) to assess all  its  dependencies  to,  and  the  pressure  it  puts  on,  biodiversity along the value chain. The analysis was structured around the five pressures identified by the IPBES as illustrated in paragraph 1.4.1. This  in-depth  analysis  served  as  a  basis  to  pinpoint  the  priority issues for the roll out of the Group's biodiversity strategy in 2022.\n\nAs  part  of  this  process,  Air  Liquide  performed  in  2021  a  first mapping of all of its sites with respect to distance with the IUCN's Key Biodiversity Areas (KBA) database. The KBAs correspond to areas identified based on specific criteria such as areas that make a significant contribution to biodiversity within various ecosystems. Proximity  to  these  areas  reflect  the  heightened  sensitivity  of biodiversity  to  human  activity.  For  sake  of  simplicity,  a  50-km radius was used for this first study. This review, found that 13% of Air Liquide sites in 2021 were located within this 50-km radius of at least nine KBAs (mainly in Europe due to the large number of KBAs recognized by regulations). This allows the Group to narrow down the analysis to be conducted to identify sites located at a proximity  (depending  on  the  activity  at  stake)  that  shall  trigger heightened  attention  on  potential  impacts  on  biodiversity.  Air Liquide is currently working on determining, for the various type of activities, what is the relevant radius regarding its sites' proximity to  KBAs. Also,  as  KBAs  may  change  over  time, Air  Liquide  will renew this mapping on a regular basis.\n\nAt  the  beginning  of  2023,  Air  Liquide  joined  the  Act4Nature initiative,  that  reviewed  and  validated  objectives  submitted.  This highlights the Group's recognition of the importance of biodiversity in  maintaining  ecological  balance,  preserving  natural  resources and  ensuring  the  well-being  of  communities  and  wildlife.  In  line with these commitments, four online training courses open to all employees were organized to raise awareness on biodiversity and 246 employees attended them in 2023. The training is available online at any time to Air Liquide's employees.\n\nIn  addition  to  global  measures  taken  in  response  to  biodiversity issues, focused measures are also taken at various levels within the  Group,  in  particular  in  activities  where  biodiversity  may  be material.\n\n## Actions undertaken by the Biomethane business\n\nAir Liquide's  biomethane  business  contributes  to  a  better management of certain waste by substituting alternative practices. For example,  the  methanization  of  livestock  effluents or communities'  organic  waste  helps  prevent  certain  ammonia  or methane emissions generated by their storage and decomposition, at the edge of fields or in landfill. This business, by preventing these emissions, thus contributes to the protection of biodiversity as part of a circular economy approach.",

This study identified the top  challenges  Seppic  faces  with  regard  to  the  five  major pressures  on  biodiversity:  the  destruction  or  degradation  of natural  habitats,  the  introduction  and  spread  of  invasive  species or  invasive  alien  species,  the  pollution  of  natural  environments, the overexploitation of natural resources and climate change. The analysis of these main impacts led Seppic to identify its areas of improvement and formalize its Biodiversity program based on four strategic pillars (RICE) described below:\n\n- \u25a0 reducing the pressures  generated  by  its  supplies  on biodiversity:  Seppic  is  committed  to  increase  control  over  its supply  chains  by  improving  the  traceability  of  supplies  and verifying  the  sustainability  of  the  conditions  under  which ingredients  are  grown  and  harvested.  With  regard  to  its strategy for dealing with palm derivatives, Seppic is continuing its program to ensure that 100% of its incoming raw materials will  be  Mass  Balance  certified  by  2025.  In  2023,  99.8%  of Seppic's palm oil inputs were already Mass Balance certified either  RSPO  or  ISCC+ (6) and  the  rest  was  covered  by  the 'Book  &  Claim'  certificates  of  small,  independent  producers, meaning all of Seppic's sourced palm derivatives was certified. Since  2019,  Seppic  has  been  producing  annual  traceability reports  for  its  procurement  within  the  framework  of  ASD (Action for Sustainable Derivatives) with continuous progress. Seppic's palm-derivative sourcing commitments and practices have also been assessed according to the Sustainable Palm Index (SPI) methodology, and Seppic has achieved a score of 94/100 in 2023. Furthermore, Seppic's sourcing strategy aims at  the  continuous  improvement  of  its  organization  and  the management of plants and seaweeds with fair benefit sharing in line with its UEBT (Union for Ethical BioTrade) membership status  for  Lons  and  Pontrieux,  and  its  commitment  to  ethical sourcing practises. Finally, Seppic is committed to developing a  database  of  its  raw  materials  in  order  to  enhance  the transparency of its supply chain;\n- \u25a0 integrating biodiversity  into  its  industrial  processes  and facilities:  Seppic  is  taking  into  account  the  impact  of  climate change  on  biodiversity,  by  committing  to  improving  the efficiency of its production sites and reducing their water and energy  consumption.  For  instance,  Seppic  is  committed  to achieve  100%  biogas  use  at  all  its  French  sites  by  2030.  In 2023,  Seppic's  French  sites  were  already  using  biogas certificates to cover 74% of their energy consumption.\n- \u25a0 controlling the  impact  of  its  products  throughout  their  life cycle:  Seppic  accords  great  significance  to  maintaining biodiversity  in  its  Research  and  Innovation  projects.  This  is why  Seppic  invests  in  developing  environmentally-friendly technologies  with  an  eco-design  approach  to  measure  the environmental impact of new products. From 2024, 100% of its new  products  of  Seppic  will  be  developed  using  this  ecodesign approach;\n- \u25a0 engaging and  supporting  its  stakeholders  in  favour  of biodiversity: Seppic is committed  to raising employee awareness of the importance of biodiversity. Moreover, Seppic collaborates with its suppliers of plant raw materials to ensure that they adopt good agricultural practices and limit the risks of deforestation and pollution. In 2023, Seppic supported several projects to preserve biodiversity. For instance, Seppic contributes  to  the  governance  and  funding  of  a  joint  project with  five  other  ASD  members,  the  Kaleka (7) Initiative  which aims to restore the ecosystem and stimulate economic growth in two of the most important palm-producing regions of Central Kalimantan,  Indonesia.  Seppic's  commitment  began  in  2022 for a period of five years.\n\n## Actions undertaken by Group employees\n\nThe Sustainability Ambassadors, volunteer employees who want to  act  in  favour  of  sustainable  development  within  Air  Liquide, have also organized local initiatives in favor of biodiversity:\n\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide France Industry employees repeated their initiative launched in 2022 to rethink lawn mowing on sites in order to mow lawns less intensely during flowering period to preserve insects. They have launched a 'no-mow month' in May 2023 as part of this action;\n- \u25a0 At the Paris Innovation Campus:\n- -a waste collection was organized,\n- -in  addition,  two  surveys  will  nourish  the  work  of  the 'Biodiversity'  and  'Sustainable  Mobility'  working  groups within the Sustainability Ambassadors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SUSTAINABLE SOURCING\n\nSeppic's  Lons  and  Pontrieux  sites,  which  are  specialized  in  the botanical  extraction  of  cosmetic  and  pharmaceutical  active ingredients, joined the UEBT to align their sourcing strategy and good practices with an independent standard. As UEBT members, these  sites  are  committed  to  taking  into  account  the  impact  of seaweeds and plant sourcing  activities  on  social,  environmental and economic issues. By 2025, 100% of Seppic's new cosmetic, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical ingredients manufactured at the industrial  facilities of Lons  and  Pontrieux  will  be  sourced according to its Ethical Sourcing System (8) .\n\n<!-- image -->",

Health and safety risks\n\nHealth  and  safety  risks  form  part  of  the  Group's  industrial  risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document, page  73),  which  are  associated  with  the  various  products, industrial processes and distribution methods in use. Air Liquide's various business lines involve more specific risks associated with products and processes, and how they are operated.\n\n## 2.1.2.  Policy and procedures\n\nSafety  is  an  integral  part  of Air  Liquide's  operational  excellence and culture. The Group is committed to reducing the exposure of its  employees,  customers,  subcontractors,  suppliers  and  local communities to occupational and industrial risks effectively and in all  circumstances.  Commitment  to  safety  is  total,  visible  and accompanied by unshakable vigilance.\n\nTo assess and manage these risks, the Group has an Industrial Management  System  (IMS)  that  covers  all  Air  Liquide's businesses.  The  IMS  relies  on  the  accountability  of  the Departments of the various Group entities for the implementation of  this  system  and  on  the  issuance  of  key  organizational  and management procedures.\n\nSince  its  rollout  in  2005,  the  IMS  has  significantly  changed  and improved  the  way  in  which  industrial  activities  are  managed. Thanks  to  employees'  commitment  to  safety,  environmental protection  and  reliability,  this  system  helps  strive  towards operational  excellence.  Its  implementation  is  regularly  assessed by specific IMS internal audits.\n\nThe IMS defines the industrial audit process, its governance and its  implementation.  This  audit  process  makes  it  possible  to periodically analyze and assess the compliance of the activities of each subsidiary with its own industrial management system, the effectiveness of this system and its compliance with the Group's Industrial  Management  System.  Following  an  industrial  audit, action  plans  are  implemented  based  on  the  opportunities  for improvement identified, and best practices are shared.\n\n## EXTRA-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DECLARATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL REPORTING\n\n## Extra-financial Performance Declaration\n\nPrevention, protection, early detection and rapid reaction to health and  safety  risks  are  at  the  heart  of  the  Group's  concerns.  This commitment is reiterated in the General Statement of Air Liquide's Principles of Action. These Principles are shared with all entities and are available on the Group's website (https://www.airliquide. com/sustainable-development/ethics/groups-principles-action).\n\nEvery  subsidiary  is  committed  to  achieving  the  'zero  accidents' ambition,  as  well  as  the  objective  of  continuously  improving  its safety performance.\n\nSubsidiaries regularly report all safety and security events in the Group's  reporting  tool.  Each  month,  every  event  reported  is reviewed  by  a  team  of  experts.  The  most  serious  events  are analyzed in detail, the corrective action plan is implemented and lessons learned are shared with Group entities potentially affected by similar situations.\n\n## The safety of individuals\n\nSafety is  a  collective  commitment  and  the  responsibility  of  each individual.  Being  aware  of  dangers  and  risks,  applying  the  rules and taking care of others - all this contributes to reducing the risk of accidents and strengthening the Group's safety culture. Safety leadership  training  and  on-the-job  training  courses  are  regularly organized.  Air  Liquide's  managers  encourage  safety  efforts, demonstrate this commitment on site and reward best practices.\n\nEach  employee  and  contractor  must  be  aware  of  safety  rules, follow  them  and  intervene  each  time  there  is  a  risk  of  unsafe behavior or conditions.\n\nThe Group has drawn up Life-Saving Rules. Everyone working for Air  Liquide,  whether  an  employee  or  subcontractor,  must  be aware of these rules, follow them and always intervene if there is a  risk  of  unsafe  behavior  or  conditions.  The  interpretation  and meaning of each rule is widely shared within the Group and with subcontractors.  The  Safety  and  Industrial  System  Department provides  entities  with  various  communication,  awareness-raising and  training materials on  Life-Saving  Rules.  Given  their importance,  non-compliance  with  any  of  these  rules  by  anyone working for on an Air Liquide site can lead to a warning, or even penalties  up  to  and  including  suspension.  These  Life-Saving Rules,  translated  into  at  least  10  languages  and  in  force  in  all countries where the Group operates, are as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  draws  on  Air  Liquide's Industrial  Management  System  (IMS),  which  applies  to  all activities, and requires:\n\n- \u25a0 the identification of specific industrial risks for each business;\n- \u25a0 knowledge of scenarios and their potential consequences;\n- \u25a0 the  implementation  of  appropriate  preventive  and  protective safety measures for each of these risks;\n- \u25a0 the monitoring and  analysis  of  risks  relating to new technologies and events arising within the profession;\n- \u25a0 feedback to facilitate learning, awareness-raising, the promotion of a safety culture and to improve prevention.\n\nThe safety of industrial processes is a complex issue as, although rare,  incidents  can  lead  to  very  serious  consequences  with multiple  fatalities.  In  order  to  ensure  that  operations  efficiently take  this  risk  into  account,  Air  Liquide  has  introduced  specific action plans, the purpose of which is to control the most serious risks  relating  to  industrial  processes.  They  have  been  assigned the  necessary  resources  (expertise  and  budgets)  and  follow  a roadmap.\n\n- 1. I do not work under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\n- 2. I do not smoke outside the reserved areas.\n- 3. I wear the personal protective equipment (PPE) required for the task and the work area.\n- 4. I wear a portable detector in the required areas.\n- 5. I never enter a confined space without analyzing and managing the risk.\n- 6. I only intervene when the risks are identified and formalized.\n- 7. I apply lockout procedures before working on any equipment potentially containing energy.\n- 8. I do not deactivate an Important Safety Component (ISC) without applying downgraded mode or compensatory measures.\n- 9. I wear fall-prevention equipment when required.\n- 10. I do not pass under a suspended load.\n- 11. I secure vehicle loading.\n- 12. I always wear my seat belt when I am in a moving vehicle.\n\nThe progress of specific action plans aimed at bringing the most serious  risks  related  to  industrial  processes  under  control  is regularly monitored by the Group's General Management.\n\n## Road safety\n\nEach  year,  delivery  vehicles,  sales  staff  and  technicians  travel hundreds  of  millions  of  kilometers.  Non-compliance  with  traffic regulations or the lack of regular maintenance of vehicles would expose drivers and third parties to increased risks of accidents.\n\nThe  Group's  goal  is  to  permanently  reduce  the  frequency  and severity of road accidents, for its employees and subcontractors as well as for third parties.\n\nIt uses the following means to achieve these goals:\n\n- \u25a0 ensuring  that  the  Group's  safety  rules  are  applied  by  all subsidiaries and service providers;\n- \u25a0 replacing the fleet with safer vehicles;\n- \u25a0 improving the safety of drivers and third parties by introducing the necessary behavioral changes through the implementation of digital alert and support technologies;\n- \u25a0 systematically  incorporating  feedback  from  the  most  serious events,  and  sharing  best  practices  with  all  of  Group's subsidiaries and partners;\n- \u25a0 monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of measures implemented by subsidiaries through dedicated audits.\n\nAccording  to  the  geographies,  context,  current  legislation  and practices, all or some of the following measures are applied:\n\n- \u25a0 the  installation  of  onboard  technologies  such  as  cameras, which can detect driver  fatigue  and  distractions,  or  reversing cameras to reduce blind spots, in order to help change driver behavior or provide visibility of the vehicle's surroundings;\n- \u25a0 increased dialog on road safety both internally as well as with service  providers  and  other  organizations  specialized  in  this subject, both locally and on an international scale. Air Liquide regularly  holds  transport  safety  discussions  and  knowledgebuilding events with its partners;\n- \u25a0 initiatives which lead to a change in behavior to implement a dynamic culture of road safety among Air Liquide employees and employees of the Group's contractors.",

Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to the  UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 'Good health and well-being' and 8 'Decent work and economic growth'.\n\nThe  lost-time  accident  frequency  rate  for Air  Liquide  employees and  temporary  workers  has  slightly  increased  by  +4%,  and  will tend toward 1.0 at the end of 2023, compared to 0.9 at the end of 2022. There was also a -16% reduction in the number of lost-time accidents among  subcontractors,  significantly  reducing  the corresponding frequency rate.\n\nTo  achieve  a  significant  and  lasting  reduction  in  lost-time accidents,  the  Group  must  remain  vigilant  at  all  times  and continue to raise awareness and take all preventive measures to further improve safety.\n\nIn 2023, the Group recorded the death of one employee in a road accident. The Group has made and will continue to make every effort to analyze all accidents that have occurred in order to learn from them and thus prevent them from happening again.\n\n## LOST-TIME ACCIDENT FREQUENCY RATE AMONG AIR LIQUIDE EMPLOYEES AND SUBCONTRACTORS (a) (b)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a) Number of accidents with at least one day's absence per million hours worked.\n- (b) Including Airgas since 2017.\n\n## ROAD SAFETY: FREQUENCY OF PREVENTABLE SERIOUS ACCIDENTS WITH INJURIES (a)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a) Per million km driven by trucks of over 3.5 metric tonnes.\n\nWith regard to road transport safety, the year 2023 shows a slight decline  in  performance  compared  to  the  previous  year.  It  was marked  by  the  death  of  a  truck  driver  employee  in  a  road accident.  In  addition,  a  number  of  accidents  involving  an  Air Liquide vehicle, unfortunately led to the death of third parties.\n\nAn  analysis  of  road  accidents  in  recent  years  has  highlighted certain  recurring  causes,  such  as  fatigue  or  distraction  while driving.  Air  Liquide's  2021-2025  program  to  implement  driving assistance  technologies  and  fatigue  prevention  keeps  being carried out, as well as support in all the regions where the Group operates  for  changes  in  driving  behavior.  These  initiatives  are gradually improving transport road safety.\n\n<!-- image -->",

HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT\n\n## 2.2.1.  Human Resources management related risks\n\nHuman  Resources  management  related  risks  are  part  of  the Group's  business  related  risks  (described  in  Chapter  2  of  this Universal Registration Document, page 76). Working arrangements in an international group like Air Liquide need to be able to adapt to a constantly changing world so that employees can  operate  in  a  safe,  high-quality  work  environment  and contribute to the Group's sustainable growth.\n\nThe long-term performance of Air Liquide is driven, in particular, by the quality of its employees, their skills and their commitment. In its businesses, the Group is therefore exposed to the risk of not being able to:\n\n- \u25a0 attract and maintain the required skills at the right time and in the  right  place,  in  particular  in  emerging  countries  where  the Group  is  expanding  its  activities,  or  in  regions  where  the employment market is strained;\n- \u25a0 develop these skills, in particular with the digitization of certain businesses.\n\nIn  addition  to  risks  relating  to  skills  management,  psycho-social risks may also affect the health and level of commitment of Group employees, in particular in the recent context where working from home has been rapidly implemented.\n\nLastly,  although  all  Air  Liquide  employees  have  social  security coverage  that  complies  with  local  regulations,  there  are  still disparities between  countries  that  could  potentially  create inequitable  situations  within  the  Group.  Furthermore,  local standards  may  not,  in  some  cases,  be  enough  to  provide adequate and fair social protection for employees.\n\n## 2.2.2.  Policy and procedures\n\nThe Group is committed to identifying, attracting and developing the necessary scientific, technical and digital skills required for its growth, the efficient working of its operations and innovation. To this  end,  the  Human  Resources  policy  defines  the  main  rules, together with the roles and responsibilities of the different parties involved in their implementation, with respect to issues including:\n\n- \u25a0 acquisition  and  sustainability  of  the  necessary  skills. Training is provided under the Air Liquide University brand as part of a structured program. In 2023, Air Liquide continued the rollout of  Workday,  its  new  Human  Resources  management  tool. Training  is  mainly  monitored  in  Workday  Learning  for  most geographies, as the rollout of the software is still ongoing;\n- \u25a0 supporting employees in their personal development throughout their careers, in particular through Workday Talent, the new career and skills management tool;\n- \u25a0 changes  in  working  methods  within  the  Company.  The organization  of  work  must  not  only  meet  the  demands  and expectations of current employees and the Company, but also those  of  tomorrow,  while  being  based  on  the  Group's fundamentals.  The  result  of  a  co-creation  bringing  together more than 700 employees, the Group thus deployed in 2020 its BeActEngage  model,  which  allows  its  employees  to develop in a safe, ethical and engaging environment to deliver long-term performance;\n- \u25a0 measuring and recognizing performance and contributions of all employees.  In  addition  to  employee  remuneration  and  loyalty policies  (regular  capital  increases  reserved  for  employees), specific  provisions  aimed  at  promoting  and  sustaining  certain\n\nskills, such as inventor and innovator recognition programs, the technical expertise development scheme (Technical Community Leaders) in a wide range of fields such as industrial operations, industrial safety and digital.\n\nThe  Group  ensures  the  building  of  a  performance-focused, attractive  and  collaborative  professional  environment  while  also safeguarding  the  health  and  well-being  of  employees  in  the workplace.\n\nThe growth in working from home has increased the use of digital tools to ensure business continuity. Within the context of changes to the Group's organizational models, which were accelerated by the  covid-19  pandemic, Air  Liquide  launched  a  global  project  in 2020 called 'Next Normal' to support this shift in the organization of work.\n\nWith this project, the entities can provide their employees with:\n\n- \u25a0 a new framework including team management;\n- \u25a0 a supervised remote working policy;\n- \u25a0 reorganization of workspaces;\n- \u25a0 careful  consideration  of  interactions  with  customers  and patients;\n- \u25a0 a new framework for Air Liquide's responsible travel policy.\n\nTo  facilitate  the  rollout  of  the  project,  Air  Liquide  developed  a reference  guide  in  2021.  First  shared  with  managers,  the  guide helps  the  entities  to  set  up  new  working  methods  based  on  the initial  global  experience.  Working  groups  were  then  organized with employees in the entities to validate the commitments.\n\nIn order to strengthen well-being at work, focus groups have been set up aiming at promoting the work-life balance of employees to strengthen  their  occupational  well-being.  This  approach  meets employees' expectations on this subject.\n\nIn 2019, the Group partnered with the European Works Council to develop  the  'Care  and  Perform'  initiative,  whose  purpose  is  to prevent  psychosocial  risks.  This  led  to  the  creation  of  a  charter based  on  Principles  of  Action  linked  to  improvements  in  work scheduling, workloads and work-life balance. The content of this charter  facilitated  the  conclusion  of  company  agreements  with social partners in order to offer new services to employees.\n\nIn addition, the Group continued the rollout of the common basis of care coverage for all employees worldwide, in accordance with local regulations and the minimum standards set by Air Liquide:\n\n- \u25a0 life insurance: an insurance with a compensation equivalent to one's year salary in the event of death;\n- \u25a0 medical  coverage:  coverage  for  hospital  inpatient  and outpatient care;\n- \u25a0 maternity leave: minimum 14 weeks leave paid at 100%.\n\n## 2.2.3.  Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to the  UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 'Good health and well-being' and 8 'Decent work and economic growth'.\n\n## Employee training and engagement\n\nAs  part  of  the  BeActEngage  program,  the  Group  provides employees with the means to learn throughout their career. As a learning company, Air Liquide also encourages employees to pass on  their  knowledge  and  learn  from  each  other.  Peer-to-peer learning is a great opportunity to expand their skills.",

This has  resulted  in  6,300  employees  logged  in  to  over  270  online sessions:  webinars,  virtual  classes  and  learning  paths.  One  of these virtual events is dedicated to peer learning with all sessions offered by Air Liquide internal facilitators. For this second edition, which  took  place  over  five  weeks,  more  than  150  internal facilitators shared their knowledge with 4,150 participants in 170 sessions  organized  in  different  time  zones  and  in  multiple languages.  Thanks  to  the  mini  tutorial  program,  this  year  26 creators  of  mini  tutorials  also  shared  their  knowledge  via  more than  25  micro-learning  videos.  The  sessions  are  then  made available in the old LMS (Learning Management System) or in the new Workday Learning tool and on the University website.\n\nThis year, the first face-to-face Campus Europe since the health crisis  was  organized  in  the  Paris  region.  140  participants  from 31 different countries took part in training programs: Management &  Leadership,  Sales  &  Marketing  and  Operational  Excellence. This  event,  organized  over  four  days,  is  a  unique  learning  and networking opportunity for employees.\n\nThese events have, firstly, promoted interactions within the Group thanks to participants from 68 countries and, secondly, revealed employees' creative and teaching abilities.\n\nIn  2019,  the  Group  launched  a  program  to  measure  and  track commitment, My Voice. This program aims to assess and improve the experience and well-being of employees within the Group. It is based on a simple concept: listen, understand and act.

They were able for instance to build a bicycle shed, help in the maintenance of the garden, prepare and share a meal with the residents, etc. and thus participate in a rewarding day for everyone;\n- \u25a0 in China, around 30 employees of the Yantai Engineering & Construction entity cleaned a beach in early June 2023, on the occasion of World Ocean Day;\n- \u25a0 in the Middle East & Africa hub, a major day of commitment organized on Nelson Mandela Day (July 18) brought together more than 330 employees in nine countries to plant trees in local communities;\n- \u25a0 the Human Resources Management Committee assisted the L'Envol association in preparing play packages for hospitalized children.\n\nunderstand their expectations, identify and implement appropriate actions and thus significantly improve their commitment. This level of  attention  to  the  employee  experience  is  a  key  factor  in attracting,  retaining  and  developing  employees.  The  response rate for the 2023 commitment survey was 81%, compared to 77% in 2022.\n\nAir Liquide is committed to meaningful labor relations in all of its subsidiaries.  This  comes  in  different  forms  according  to  local regulations. In 2023, 87% of Group employees had access to a representation, dialog or consultation structure.\n\nThe  performance  review  meeting  is  a  key  stage  in  employee development, as it facilitates a discussion between the employee and  their  manager  on  performance  and  development,  the assessment and setting  objectives  for  the  year  ahead.  In  2023, 79% of Group employees had a performance review meeting with their immediate supervisor.\n\n## Citizen at Work\n\nAs part of the ADVANCE program, the Group launched the Citizen at Work initiative in 2022 to enable its employees to actively serve their local communities.\n\nFor  many  years  and  throughout  the  world,  Air  Liquide's employees have been involved in helping local communities, with the support of subsidiaries' management or the Foundation.\n\nTo encourage this even further, the Group has created the Citizen at Work program, with the aim of giving employees the means to act and increasing its collective impact. This initiative, launched as a pilot scheme in 2022, provides subsidiaries with a framework to enable employees to volunteer in their local community. It will be gradually  rolled  out  across  the  entire  Group  to  reach  100%  of entities  by  2025. At  the  end  of  2023,  73%  of  Group  employees already had access to this program. Each project identified as part of  the  Citizen  at  Work  initiative  is  in  line  with  Air  Liquide's sustainability objectives and enables employees to get involved in areas  such  as  professional  integration,  children's  learning, environmental protection, health and social inclusion.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, in 2022, each hub consolidated a 2023-2025 roadmap to achieve the objective.\n\n## 2.3.   DISCRIMINATION\n\n## 2.3.1.  Risks associated with discrimination\n\nDiversity is a priority of Air Liquide's Human Resources strategy and  policy  and  the  Group  considers  it  a  source  of  dynamism, creativity  and  performance.  It  is  a  fundamental  element  of  the organization,  in  terms  of  both  businesses  and  employees,  and drives the Group's long-term performance.\n\nThe discrimination risk is part of the environment and society risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document on page 81).\n\nAir Liquide carries out activities with high technological content in a  large  number  of  countries  with  different  cultures.  The  Group's objective  in  this  regard  is  to  have  teams  comprising  employees who represent the environment in which they operate. Each entity is  therefore responsible for implementing action plans specific to its  own  environment  and  legal  framework,  which  may  include many forms of diversity (disability, age, skin color, disability, ethnic origin, religion, sexual orientation, etc.).\n\nDiscrimination-related  issues,  particularly  concerning  gender diversity  (gender  disparities,  particularly  in  technical  or  expert professions),  disability  and  age  could  affect  employees  of  the Group or of its partners.\n\n## 2.3.2.  Policy and procedures\n\nThe Group's objective is to increase diversity among managerial staff to better recognize the many cultures from which Air Liquide employee come and to improve gender equality. In this respect, quantified  gender  equality  targets  have  been  set  for  the  Group. The  local  entities  took  an  inventory  of  the  current  situation  to define an objective at the level of the clusters and thus contribute to the overall objective.\n\nWithin the Human Resources organization, a team leads projects designed to improve diversity. The Group's roadmap is based on three pillars:\n\n- \u25a0 tracking objectives for all entities;\n- \u25a0 mitigating  bias  in  talent  discussions  and  improving  Human Resources processes;\n- \u25a0 promoting a culture of inclusion.\n\nEach  hub  and  business  then  implements  its  own  roadmap  and diversity action plans taking the local context into consideration. In this  context,  they  analyze  processes  and  practices,  identify potential biases and implement corrective measures ('nudges') to limit these biases. Thus, during the regular reviews of talents with high potential, the diversity of profiles is taken into account, with the  aim  of  continuing  to  increase  diversity  in  the  Group's  key positions.  This  serves  as  a  way  to  promote  the  many  cultures present  within  the  Group,  and  to  strengthen  gender  equality.  In addition, the roll-out of the new Human Resources management tool from  2022  will  ensure  that  talent  and  performance management processes are standardised and fair, thereby limiting the risk of discrimination.\n\nThrough its diversity policy, Air Liquide is therefore committed to combating all forms of discrimination.\n\nTo promote the inclusion of disabilities, Air Liquide intervenes at two levels:\n\n- \u25a0 with its employees, in particular via the HandivAirsity initiative;\n- \u25a0  with its suppliers, by developing relationships with companies in the adapted sector.\n\n## 2.3.3.  Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group aim to contribute to the UN Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDG)  5  'Gender  equality'  and 10 'Reduced inequalities'.\n\nIn 2023, Air Liquide employed 67,800 employees in 72 countries (1) .\n\n## Gender equality\n\n## PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN AMONG MANAGERS AND PROFESSIONALS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a) Including Airgas since 2017.\n- (b) The share of women among 'Managers and Professionals' is rounded off\n- in increments of 0.5%.\n- (c) Including Airgas since 2016.",

        "page_content": "## EXTRA-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DECLARATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL REPORTING\n\n## Extra-financial Performance Declaration\n\nThe Group has set several gender equality objectives, aimed at reaching a rate of:\n\n- \u25a0 35%  women  at  the  'Managers  and  Professionals'  level,  by 2025.  These  objectives  are  in  line  with  the  results  obtained over the past 10 years, which have seen the share of female 'Managers and Professionals' within the Group increase from 27% in 2013 to 32.0% (2) in 2023;\n- \u25a0 25% of executive positions (senior executives) held by women by 2025.\n\nThe  gender  diversity  objectives  set  for  the  'Managers  and Professionals'  and  'senior  executives'  population,  and  for maintaining  the  gender  diversity  goal  among  the  Group's  'high potentials,'  are  also  intended  to  form  a  talent  pool  to  ensure balanced gender representation on the Executive Committee by promoting  female  talents  to  higher  levels  of  management. Moreover, in view of the new obligations laid down by the 'Rixain' Law of December 24, 2021, the Group is also aligning its gender equality  objectives  with  regard  to  the  Executive  Committee  with those of the Law, i.e. 30% of women by March 1, 2026.\n\nIn  2023,  women  represented  50%  of  employees  considered  as high  performers,  this  level  has  been  increasing  regularly  for  a number of years and must be maintained.\n\nThe  Executive  Committee  includes  four  women  among  its  13 members.\n\nMore  generally,  and  taking  the  highest  level  of  responsibilities across the Group into account, women hold 24.7% of all positions defined  as  'senior  executives'.  This  latter  percentage  has increased from 19% to 24.7% over the last five years.\n\nAmong  the  10%  of  positions  with  the  greatest  level  of responsibility within L'Air Liquide S.A., 28.7% of them are held by women; these women have an average age of 52.8 years and a median  age  of  53  years,  i.e.  3.7  years  and  4.1  years  less respectively than the average age (56.5 years) and median age (57.1  years)  for  men.  This  difference  is  due  to  the  policy  to promote women to the highest levels of responsibility earlier on in their careers,  and  therefore  eliminate  career  development discrepancies that occur in the absence of proactive measures in this area.\n\nFinally, the promotion of an inclusive culture also contributes to a sustainable  approach  to  diversity.  Numerous  initiatives  are deployed  within  the  Group  to  this  end:  events,  learning opportunities,  mentoring,  networks  and  communities for different interest groups such as women's careers. Another recent example is  the  third  edition  of  the  movement  for  inclusion,  which  is  a development  opportunity  for  committed  employees.  For  seven months, 200 of these 'Inclusion & Diversity enthusiasts' designed and carried out pilots across the Group using innovative methods to  promote  inclusion  in  the  work  environment.  These  new approaches  are  disseminated  throughout  the  organization  in  a spirit of continuous improvement.\n\n|     | 2025 Objectives                                                   | 2023 Results   | 2023 Results                                                       |\n|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 35% | women among Group Managers and Professionals.                     | 32.0% (a)      | women among Group Managers  and Professionals.                     |\n| 25% | (senior executives). women at the highest level of responsibility | 24.7%          | women at the highest level of responsibility  (senior executives). |\n\n- (a) The share of women among 'Managers and Professionals' is rounded off in increments of 0.5%.\n\n## Gender and equal pay\n\nEach  year,  Air  Liquide  assesses  the  pay  and  treatment  gap between women and men in France and at Group level.\n\nIn  France,  in  accordance  with  the  law  of  September  5,  2018 known  as  the  'loi Avenir  professionnel', Air  Liquide  calculates  a professional equality index for the 22 companies with 50 or more employees, based on five indicators defined by law. This index is presented  to  the  relevant  Social  and  Economic  Committee  and declared to the Ministry of Labor, Full Employment and Integration. In  2023,  the  weighted  average  professional  equality  index  for  all 22 companies was 86.7/100 and that of L'Air Liquide S.A. reached 89/100.  This  slight  decline  for  the  latter  compared  to  2022  is exclusively linked to the circumstantial effect  of  the  departure  on leave before retirement of two people within the governing body.\n\nAt  Group  level, Air  Liquide  assesses  the  differences  in  pay  and treatment between women and men in entities with more than 200 employees  using  an  internal  equality  index  adapted  to  its international  presence.  It  makes  it  possible  to  identify  the differences between certain entities in terms of equal pay, to then analyze them and undertake action plans if necessary. This index is calculated on the basis of the weighting of four criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 pay gap between women and men using the median fixed and variable salary per job grade;\n\n(2)\n\n- \u25a0 individual  fixed  and  variable  wage  increase  gap  between women and men per job grade;\n- \u25a0 percentage  of  employees  having  received  a  salary  increase after a maternity leave;\n- \u25a0 gender diversity among the 10 highest remunerations.\n\nThe  result  of  the  2022  internal  equality  index  for  the  Group, calculated in 2023, is 77/100 for a coverage of 81% of the Group's workforce  (entities  with  more  than  200  employees),  while  the result of the 2022 index was 75/100 for a scope covering 74% of the  workforce  (entities  with  more  than  200  employees).  An improvement action plan is rolled out on a yearly basis:\n\n- \u25a0 part  of  the  'Merit  Increase'  budget  was  allocated  to  filling wages gaps;\n- \u25a0 awareness workshops on the index criteria were organized for the HR functions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  France, 553  young  people  have  benefited  from  workstudy contracts and 459 from an internship, combining theoretical learning at their university or school and a practical internship at Air Liquide.\n\nSeniors  will  represent  an  increasing  share  of  Air  Liquide employees  in  the  coming  years.  Their  contribution  to  mentoring programs  (notably  the  Technical  Community  Leaders  program), and  training  programs  aimed  at  younger  generations  will  be further promoted.\n\nVarious  initiatives  have  been  introduced  within  the  Group  to ensure  the  support  and  engagement  of  employees  nearing retirement age. For example, in France:\n\n- \u25a0 a skills sponsors' program was launched in France in 2018;\n- \u25a0 'generation  /  youth-employment  contracts'  were  continued. They  include  initiatives  promoting  the  hiring  and  retention  of older employees.\n\nInternational  exchange  programs  are  in  place  to  attract  and develop young talents: ALLEX programs for executives and EVE for technicians.\n\nNB: extrapolated from Workday's current data (~98.4% of headcount).\n\n|     | 2025 Objectives                                               | 2023 Results                                                  |\n|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 33% | young graduates among manager  and professional recruitments. | young graduates among manager  and professional recruitments. |\n\n(a) Indicator calculated annually.\n\n## Inclusion of disabilities - one of the Group's priorities\n\n## Internal HandivAirsity initiative\n\nLaunched  in  2017  at  the  European  level,  the  HandivAirsity initiative  aims  to  encourage  diversity  by  integrating  people  with disabilities into teams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Our  differences  make  our  performance.'  This  slogan  carries  a strong conviction that is fully reflected in the policy of promoting Inclusion  and  Diversity  within  Air  Liquide  and  which  has  been embodied  in  successive  agreements  in  France  since  2007. Through its policy of welcoming, maintaining in employment and professional development of people with disabilities, Air Liquide is committed to seeking and implementing solutions that enable the successful inclusion of people with disabilities. Organizational and material adjustments are planned to compensate for the disability in relation to the work situation, such as:\n\n- \u25a0 schedule  adjustments,  additional  remote  working,  workload adjustment;\n- \u25a0 ergonomic studies and specific equipment and tools;\n- \u25a0 adaptations to facilitate access to work premises;\n- \u25a0 specific training and individual support services;\n- \u25a0 transportation and moving assistance.\n\nIn  addition,  Air  Liquide  raises  awareness  among  all  employees about  the  inclusion  of  disabilities  in  order  to  facilitate  the  hiring, welcoming and professional integration of workers with disabilities in  the  company.  Each  French  subsidiary  organizes  an  annual activity  plan  -  specifically  during  the  European  Week  for  the Employment of People with Disabilities (SEEPH) - in order to better inform all stakeholders and fight against prejudices that may persist. In addition, a specific 'handimanagement' training was offered to a set  of  managers  in  2023  to  remove  obstacles  to  recruitment  and support them in their questions. They are now ambassadors to their peers  and  contribute  through  their  testimonials  to  mobilizing everyone  around  inclusion.  Each  year,  the  French  entities  also participate in DuoDay, a day during which they welcome a person with a disability, who is paired with a volunteer professional.\n\nWithin the scope of around 6,000 employees in France, a sixth threeyear  Disability  agreement  (2023-2025)  was  signed,  and  has  been accredited.  Its  objective  requires  the  strengthening  of  the  actions already carried out in favor of people with disabilities to increase the direct employment rate of 4.46% in 2022 (calculated in April 2023) to 6% by the end of 2025 (4.43% in 2021, 4.35% in 2020).\n\nMore widely in Europe, other concrete actions were also carried out  to  change  the  way  disability  is  seen  in  operations  and accelerate the pace of recruitment: campaign ambassadors, and a working group with managers.\n\n## Actions with the Group's suppliers\n\nIn  the  process  of  promoting  an  inclusive  culture  within  its operations, Air Liquide has developed relationships with companies  in  the  disability  sector .  Through  the  purchase  of goods and services from these specialized companies, Air Liquide contributes to the so-called 'indirect' employment of people with disabilities.  These  suppliers  include  organizations  for  the  social and  professional  integration  of  people  with  disabilities  (ESAT), self-employed workers with disabilities  (TIH)  as  well  as  adapted enterprises (EA).",

The  social footprint  of  these  purchases  represented  90  jobs  created  or maintained in 2022.\n\nEach year, in France, Air Liquide organizes a 'Forum des Achats Inclusifs'  (Inclusive  Procurement  Forum),  bringing  together  Air Liquide's  specifiers  and  companies  in  the  disability  sector  to promote purchases from them. In 2023, this event, co-hosted with the Handeco association, was conducted in a digital and face-toface format through a round table and testimonials. More than 200 Air Liquide employees took part in this event. During this Forum, the round table 'Air Liquide's social footprint: the men and women behind our contracts with suppliers in the disability sector' made it possible to demonstrate the benefits of inclusive procurement with companies in the adapted sector for Air Liquide, its suppliers and their  employees.  This  exchange  of  views  illustrated  the  pride  of each of the stakeholders in participating in partnerships that also meet high standards in terms of performance, quality, innovation and  agility.Two  testimonials  from  the  Procurement  Europe organization  and  Campus Technologies Grenoble confirmed this growing maturity of inclusive procurement.\n\n## 3.   Societal stakes\n\n## 3.1.   ETHICS AND COMBATING CORRUPTION\n\n## 3.1.1.  Ethical risk and combating corruption\n\nIn  all  geographical  areas  in  which  it  operates,  the  Group  faces risks of non-compliance with ethics and anti-corruption provisions. These risks are part of the Geopolitical,Regulatory and Legal risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document page 83).\n\n## 3.1.2.  Policy and procedures\n\nIntegrity  and  transparency  are  the  cornerstones  of  the  Group's ethical  approach.  They  govern  the  behavior  and  actions  of  all employees. These principles are reflected in a program based on a dedicated structure, codes and procedures, training tools and, finally, whistleblowing and control systems.\n\n## A dedicated structure\n\nA dedicated structure has been set up to support the management of the Ethics program:\n\n- \u25a0 an  Ethics  and  Compliance  Committee,  comprised  of  Air Liquide's  various  global  functions  (Human  Resources,  Legal, Group  Control  and  Compliance,  Sustainable  Development) and  Operation  representatives, validates the program's guidelines  and  priority  actions  and  may,  if  necessary, recommend penalties in the event of serious deviations;\n- \u25a0 the  Group  Control  and  Compliance  Department,  which  is responsible  for  Ethics,  reports  directly  to  the  Group  General Secretary;\n\nFor the third time, another event related to inclusive procurement, the  'Inclusive  Procurement  European  Forum',  was  organized  in 2023 by Air Liquide. Nearly 200 participants - from operations and procurement,  as  well  as  suppliers  -  attended  the  meeting  and round  table  with  the  Group  Chief  Procurement  Officer  and  the European  Procurement  Officer.  On  this  occasion,  testimonials from  the  Germany  team  with  supplier  HPZ  (Heilp\u00e4dagogisches Zentrum) and the United Kingdom team with Royal British Legion Industries  were  shared  to  raise  awareness  and  encourage relationships  with  companies  promoting  the  inclusion  of  people with disabilities and workshops in the protected sector in Europe.\n\n## Nationality\n\nThere  are  34  different  nationalities  among  Air  Liquide's  senior executives.  The  Group's  Board  of  Directors  comprises  five nationalities. In terms of total employees, more than 161 different nationalities are employed by the Group.\n\nBREAKDOWN OF EMPLOYEES BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25a0 the  Ethics  Officer  is  responsible  for  providing  advice  and assistance  to  entities  in  the  implementation  of  the  Ethics program  and  in  the  handling  of  fraud  and  deviations.  This Officer also suggests improvements to the Ethics program by integrating  strategic  challenges,  best  practices,  regulatory developments  and  annual  action  plans.  He/she  relies  on  a network of over 50 ethics correspondents present in each of the Group's geographic regions and business lines.\n\n## Codes and procedures\n\nRules  on  ethics  and  conduct,  which  are  shared  and  actively circulated  among  all  Group  employees  through  the  BlueBook  in particular, are set out within the Group's Code of Conduct. These rules  are  implemented  as  operational  procedures  or  policies  at either the Group or local level.\n\n## The Code of Conduct, the ethics guide for employees\n\nThe Code of Conduct embodies Air Liquide's ethical commitment, in particular with regard to the protection of employees, business practices and respect for the environment and human rights.\n\nThe  Code  of  Conduct  is  available  on  the  Group's  website  in  28 languages: https://www.airliquide.com/sustainable-development/ ethics. An online employee training module exists on the employee Code of Conduct which sets out the Group's ethics approach and presents  each  subject  through  case  scenarios.  This  module  is mandatory  and  must  be  taken  by  all  employees  (including  parttime staff) each year. A test is completed at the end of the module to  assess  the  participant's  level  of  attainment  and  validate participation  in  the  training.  In  addition,  individual  employee compliance  with  the  Code  of  Conduct  is  required.  Thus,  each employee undertakes annually to comply with the rules of conduct presented in the Code through an online signature process.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For some  of  the  Group's  activities,  Healthcare  in  particular,  specific Codes of Conduct on competition law have also been developed.\n\nAudits  are  jointly  conducted  on  a  regular  basis  by  the  Group's internal audit departments and an external law firm. They conduct tests  and  interviews  to  identify  and  correct  risk  practices  or  any deviations observed. Awareness-raising meetings on compliance with  competition  law  are  also  held.  Finally,  an  online  training program  has  been  launched  covering  competition  law-related practices and international principles.\n\n## Anti-corruption program\n\nAir  Liquide's  commitment,  which  is  set  out  in  the  introduction  to the  Principles  of  Action,  to  prohibit  all  forms  of  corruption  is supported  by  a  major  anti-corruption  program.  In  the  updated Code of Conduct, the principles of integrity and transparency are defined  and  illustrated  in  a  specific  chapter.  This  chapter specifically outlines the laws governing the fight against corruption and  influence  peddling,  covers  relations  with  intermediaries  and the types of payment requiring particular attention.\n\nMoreover,  the  Group  has  a  Supplier  Code  of  Conduct,  which includes a chapter on the prevention of corruption.\n\nAn online training module ensures sufficient awareness is raised regarding the prevention of corruption. It is primarily intended for those  teams  which  are  most  exposed  to  corruption-related  risks (in  particular  sales,  procurement,  administrative  management). These employees must complete this training module every year. It is supplemented by in-person training every three years. A test is completed at the end of these trainings.\n\nAir  Liquide  operates  a  corruption-prevention  program  in  which General Management and management are closely involved. This program relies in particular on:\n\n- \u25a0 the mapping of corruption risks;\n- \u25a0 the Code of Conduct;\n- \u25a0 a  complete  set  of  training  and  awareness-raising  actions  for those exposed to corruption risks;\n- \u25a0 a third-party assessment mechanism, a whistleblowing system and accounting controls.\n\nThis  program  is  regularly  updated  to  take  into  account  new regulatory and legislative obligations under the coordination of the Group Ethics Officer, who relies on a network of Ethics Officers, responsible in particular for managing the implementation of the program locally. It also benefits from the support of the operational departments in the hubs and businesses and is subject to regular audits.\n\n## 3.1.3.  Performance\n\nThe  Ethics  and  Compliance  Committee  ensures  that  the  ethics program is correctly implemented by monitoring action plans and reviewing  indicators  such  as  employee  participation  rates  in classroom  training  and  online  training  courses.  By  way  of illustration,  98%  of  Group  employees  completed  the  Code  of Conduct online training module and 96% of employees exposed to  corruption  risks  completed  the  online  training  module  on corruption  prevention.  The  Committee  also  analyses  types  of fraud  and  alerts  received  via  the  whistleblowing  system  and  the results of internal audits or other internal investigations, providing guidelines for changes to the ethics program.\n\n## The whistleblowing system\n\nAir  Liquide's  Whistleblowing  Policy,  updated  at  the  end  of  2022, defines  the  various  channels  that  the  whistleblower  can  use  to report a possible violation of the Group's ethics commitments and rules and the process for handling alerts by Air Liquide. Available for all employees in the BlueBook, it is accessible on the Group's website  for  external  stakeholders  (https://www.safecall.co.uk/ clients/ethicall/). This policy is progressively being cascaded down through local entities in the Group's entities.\n\nThe  whistleblowing  system,  EthiCall  (https://safecall.co.uk/en/ clients/ethicall/),  is  available  for  all  Group  entities  and,  after consultation  with  employee  representative  bodies  in  France  in 2021, all internal and external stakeholders (customers, patients, suppliers,  subcontractors  and  their  staff,  local  communities, facilitators,  etc.).  Airgas  and  its  subsidiaries  also  have  a  similar platform, EthicsPoint (https://secure.ethicspoints.com/domain/ media/en/gui/28723/index.html). Air Liquide communicates regularly  on  these  systems  to  its  employees  (e.g.  via  posters, Intranet, reminder in the annual and mandatory e-learning relating to  the  Code  of  Conduct,  managerial  communication,  induction training for new hires).\n\nAnyone can report an alert in their own language by telephone or via dedicated websites (alerts are collected by service providers). For  employees,  these  systems  come  in  addition  to  the  usual channels  for  reporting  potential  incidents  within  the  entities  (line management, Human Resources Department, Ethics Correspondent, Group Ethics Officer). Third parties can also raise their concerns to their contact person within the Group.\n\nAlerts may notably relate to allegations of breaches of the Group's Code of Conduct, of internal policies and procedures or applicable laws,  and  to  any  incidents  related  to  human  rights,  health  and safety, or the environment.\n\nThe whistleblowing system enables rapid and structured handling of  alerts  received  as  well  as  objective  and  confidential  handling. Once  an  alert  has  been  registered,  the  treatment  procedure provides  that  an  acknowledgment  of  receipt  be  sent  to  the whistleblower  within  seven  days  after  the  initial  receipt.  The competent person within Air  Liquide  with  regard  to  the  category and geographic origin of the alert studies the admissibility of the alert  in  accordance  with  internal  procedures,  and  appoints  an investigator  if  necessary.  The  latter  conducts  an  investigation  to determine whether the reported facts are substantiated. They may call  on  external  resources  for  this  investigation.  If  the  facts  are substantiated, appropriate corrective measures and remedies are implemented. These measures may include:\n\n- \u25a0 the strengthening of Group policies, controls and processes;\n- \u25a0 Human  Resources  or  other  type  of  assistance  to  the whistleblower;\n- \u25a0 individual or collective awareness-raising;\n- \u25a0 disciplinary  sanctions,  up  to  and  including  dismissal,  in accordance  with  applicable  regulations  or  legal  proceedings where appropriate.\n\nFollow-up and feedback should be provided to the whistleblower during  processing  and  no  later  than  three  months  from  the acknowledgment  of  receipt  of  the  alert  (but  as  far  as  possible within  two  months).  In  certain  justified  cases  and  in  certain jurisdictions (for example, due to the nature or complexity of the alert),  a  longer  period  may  be  necessary  (but  this  period  should not exceed three additional months).",

The  most  serious  cases  are  reviewed  by  an  Ethics Committee at the relevant hub or World Business Unit level, or by the Group's Ethics and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe principles concerning the protection granted to whistleblowers (anonymity of the whistleblower, respect for the confidentiality of the alert treatment, prohibition of any form of retaliation) are stated in the Code of Conduct and the Group Whistleblowing Policy. The Group guarantees that  any  whistleblower  who  has  in  good  faith reported an ethical breach or misconduct will not be subject to any disciplinary or discriminatory measures or retaliation of any kind.\n\nThe  Group  Ethics  Officer  reports  back  to  the  Group  Ethics  and Compliance Committee and to the Audit and Accounts Committee of  the  Board  of  Directors  on  the  main  indicators  and  lessons learned from the whistleblowing system.\n\nIn 2023, 443 alerts were reported through the whistleblowing system.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBREAKDOWN OF ALERTS PER NATURE (number / %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBREAKDOWN OF ALERTS PER GEOGRAPHY (number / %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs of  December 31,  2023,  75  alerts  were  still  being  processed. 37% of alerts were found to be justified following an investigation and led to corrective measure and remediation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.2.   FIGHTING TAX EVASION\n\n## 3.2.1.  Risk of tax evasion\n\nAs far as tax is concerned, the Group focuses on complying with laws  and  regulations.  Modifications  of  laws  and  regulations  are followed  and  monitored  by  its  Tax  Department  and  its  local Finance  Departments.  Tax  risks  are  part  of  the  financial  risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document on page 79).\n\n## 3.2.2.  Policy and procedures: the Tax Charter\n\nThe Group's tax Charter supports its ambition to remain a leader in its sector by acting in a responsible manner, consistent with the Group's  long-term  growth  strategy.  Air  Liquide  has  defined  the following  principles  which  govern  its  tax  policy,  in  line  with article L. 22-10-36 of the French Commercial Code:\n\n- \u25a0 Group entities must respect the laws and regulations in force, as  well  as  the  international  standards  that  affect  it  such  as those of the OECD, in particular on transfer prices;\n- \u25a0 Group  entities  ensure  that  tax  returns  and  payments  are completed in compliance with local regulations. They complete the required tax returns according to the jurisdictions in which the Group operates;\n- \u25a0 the Group is committed to acting with integrity in all tax-related matters. It aims to operate in a transparent manner and build constructive, long-term relationships with the tax authorities;\n- \u25a0 the  Group  deals  with  tax-related  matters  by  banning  tax havens and does not make use of shell corporations without economic or commercial substance;\n- \u25a0 the  Group  protects  value  for  its  Shareholders  by  taking measures to minimize double taxation phenomena. Furthermore, it acts to minimize fiscal risk. Its tax strategy is in line  with  the  Group's strategy and complies with the Code of Conduct.\n\nAir  Liquide  applies  a  tax  compliance  and  transparency  policy, guaranteed by the presence of qualified and dedicated teams of tax  experts  who  are  up  to  date  with  the  latest  tax  reforms  and respect the Group's values. The Group is committed to acting with integrity  in  all  tax-related  matters.  In  the  countries  where  it operates, the Group maintains transparent, constructive and longterm relationships with the tax authorities, providing them with the information  they  need  within  a  reasonable  period  of  time.  L'Air Liquide  S.A.,  on  its  own  behalf  and  on  behalf  of  its  integrated French  subsidiaries,  is  the  first  company  to  sign  the  'Fiscal Partnership'  with  the  French  tax  authorities.  By  signing  this partnership in March 2019, L'Air Liquide S.A. and its subsidiaries entered  into  a  trust-based,  transparent  relationship  with  the French  tax  authorities.  This  commitment  continues  without interruption.\n\nThe  Group  ensures  that  its  operations  comply  with  tax regulations, so that it pays an appropriate amount of tax according to  the  place  where  the  value  of  its  business  activity  is  created, without artificially transferring value within low-tax jurisdictions.\n\nThe  Group  does  not  use  opaque  structures  or  entities  in  tax havens  and  does  not  withhold  useful  information  from  the  tax authorities.  It  does  not  use  structures  that  lack  economic  or commercial substance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As  the  Group's organizational structure is decentralized, its intra-group transactions are very limited and do not represent more than 15% of total sales. The Group applies an intra-group cash flow policy that complies with the OECD principles.\n\nAir Liquide complies with the 'Country-by-Country Reporting\" (CBCR) obligations.\n\n## 3.2.3.  Performance, organization and governance of the tax function\n\nThe subsidiaries' tax affairs are the responsibility of their Finance Departments.  Due  to  their  size,  some  subsidiaries  have  a specialized Tax Department reporting to the Finance Department, such as in France, the United States, Germany, China, Canada, Italy,  Benelux  and  Spain.  In  some  cases,  a  geographic  hub Tax Department reporting to the hub's Finance Department has been set  up  to  coordinate  taxation  in  several  countries,  such  as  in South-East Asia and Africa/Middle East.\n\nAll  these  country  or  regional Tax  Departments have a functional link with the Group's Tax Department, which is based at the Head\n\nOffice.  The  latter  coordinates  the  network  of  tax  teams,  in particular  through  regular  meetings  to  identify  significant  issues, provide  the  appropriate  technical  support  and  the  necessary guidance.  As  the  Group's  businesses  make  it  a  significant contributor  to  the  tax  revenues  of  the  countries  in  which  it operates,  and  since  the  Group  is  faced  with  a  high  number  of taxes  and  duties,  and  certain  countries  have  unstable  tax regimes, the Tax Departments conduct a tax watch.\n\nThe  Group  Tax  Department  is  part  of  the  Group's  Finance Department. It maintains links with the various financial, legal and other  organizations  in  order  to  keep  abreast  of  the  Group's operations.  It  participates  in  the  Finance  Committee,  an  internal Group committee, to ensure the tax position complies with the Tax Charter. The Department presents the Group's main tax risks to the Audit and Accounts Committee at least once a year.\n\nIt should be noted that Air Liquide's industrial gas businesses are essentially  very  local  in  nature.  Consequently,  Air  Liquide generates profit and pays its taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the case of transactions between different countries, the  Air  Liquide  legal  entities  in  question  comply  fully  with  the applicable transfer pricing regulations.\n\n## 4.   Respect for human rights and commitment to sustainable development\n\nAir Liquide is committed to respecting human rights in its activities worldwide  and  also  expects  its  business  partners  (customers, suppliers,  distributors,  consultants,  etc.)  to  respect  fundamental human rights. The Group strongly believes that all persons should be  treated  with  respect  and  dignity  and  that  companies  should play  a  role  in  protecting  these  fundamental  rights.  Air  Liquide shares the principles laid down in the International Bill of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles  and  Rights  at  Work,  the  United  Nations Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human  Rights  (UNGPs)  as well as  the  Organization  for  Economic  Co-operation  and Development  (OECD)  Guidelines  for  Multinational  Enterprises. These  promote  an  ethical  and  responsible  business  conduct  in economic  activities  and  professional  relations,  in  particular  in terms of human rights, by encouraging the implementation of due diligence  procedures.  Moreover,  the  commitments  of Air  Liquide and  its  employees  to  human  rights  are  affirmed  in  its  Code  of Conduct and on its website (https://www.airliquide.com/ sustainable-development/human-rights). The Code of Conduct is available  on  the  Group's  website  in  28  languages:  https:// www.airliquide.com/sustainable-development/ethics.  In  addition, the  Supplier's  Code  of  Conduct,  updated  in  2023,  aims  to promote and enforce human rights and sustainable development practices  by  each  of Air  Liquide's  suppliers  and  subcontractors. The  Supplier's  Code  of  Conduct  creates  a  cascade  effect  by requiring  all  their  employees,  suppliers  and  subcontractors  to comply with these principles. The Supplier's Code of Conduct is available  on  the  Group's  website:  https://www.airliquide.com/ sustainable-development/sustainable-procurement.\n\nSince  2014,  Air  Liquide  has  been  committed  to  the  societal responsibility  initiative  of  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact  and its  10  principles  relating  to  human  rights,  labor  standards,  the environment and the fight against corruption. Every year, the Group issues  a  Letter  of  Commitment,  signed  by  the  Chief  Executive Officer,  as  well  as  a  Communication  on  Progress  with  respect  to the strategic and operational implementation of these 10 Principles, which  is  available  on  the  UN  Global  Compact  website:  https:// www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/participants/39281-AirLiquide.\n\nTherefore, Air  Liquide  incorporates  the  various  principles  of  the UN  Global  Compact  in  the  conduct  of  its  activities.  To  find  out more about the measures implemented in terms of:\n\n- \u25a0 human rights and fundamental rights at work, detailed in the Vigilance Plan section of Chapter 2 - page 96, and the main risks  in  terms  of  discrimination  and  Human  Resources management, detailed in the EFPD of the present Chapter 5 pages 344 and 346;\n- \u25a0 the  environment,  detailed  in  the  Vigilance  Plan  section  of Chapter  2  -  page  111  and  the  main  risks  related  to  the environment, detailed in the EFPD of the present Chapter 5 page 319;\n- \u25a0 combating  corruption,  detailed  in  the  EFPD  of  the  present Chapter 5 - page 349.\n\nWithin  the  Global  Compact  France  local  network,  Air  Liquide participates  in  the  human  rights  work  group  which  allows  its members, of all sizes and from all sectors, to share experiences and expertise on the management of human rights risks.\n\nFurthermore, Air Liquide is a signatory of the Responsible Care\u00ae Global  Charter,  an  initiative  of  the  International  Council  of Chemical  Associations  (ICCA),  which  aims  to  improve  the chemical  industry's  global  performance  on  health,  safety  and environmental protection.\n\nSince  2021, Air  Liquide  has  been  a  member  of  the  multisector association Entreprises pour les droits de l'Homme (EDH, https:// www.e-dh.org/en/)  which  brings  together  26  French  companies operating internationally. This association aims to be a forum for reflection and exchange  of best practices for a better understanding  and  integration  of  human  rights  issues  in  the policies and practices of companies.\n\nAir Liquide incorporates human rights stakes into its human rights due diligence process in accordance with the French law on the duty of vigilance of parent companies and contracting companies. The approach is based on principles  advocated  by  international standards  such  as  the  United  Nations  Guiding  Principles  on Business  and  Human  Rights  and  the  OECD  Due  Diligence Guidance  for  Responsible  Business  Conduct.  The  Duty  of Vigilance Department is responsible for coordinating the implementation of this  approach  with  all  functions  concerned  by human  rights  issues  (Human  Resources,  Safety  and  Industrial System,  Procurement,  Sustainable  Development,  Ethics  and",

The  progress  of  the  vigilance  approach  is managed  by  the  Ethics  and  Compliance  Committee  and supervised by the Environment and Society Committee, which is one of the Board of Directors' specialized Committees. Air Liquide thus publishes the reasonable vigilance measures implemented to identify risks and prevent serious violations of human rights in the Vigilance  Plan  in  Chapter  2  of  this  Universal  Registration Document - page 90.\n\nAir Liquide aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, making the Group  part  of  international  efforts  to  limit  global  warming,  as provided  for  by  the  Paris Agreement.  The  Group  recognizes  that the transition to a carbon-neutral economy can also have significant social and societal implications. This transition must be fair, in other\n\nwords it should be carried out considering all stakeholders such as workers,  customers,  suppliers  and  local  communities  in  order  to minimize  negative  impacts  and  promote  positive  impacts.  Air Liquide's  actions  in  favor  of  a  just  transition  are  described  in  a statement available on its website: https://www. airliquide.com/sites/ airliquide.com/files/2023-12/just-transition-en.pdf.\n\nThrough its activities, its engagement and its environmental and social actions, Air Liquide contributes to some of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that the United Nations has defined to eradicate poverty, protect the planet and guarantee prosperity for  all  by  2030.

TAXONOMY REGULATION\n\nThe European Union (EU) Taxonomy Regulation (EU Regulation 2020/852  published  on  June  22,  2020)  defined,  on  a  scientific basis,  a  list  of  economic  activities  and  the  technical  criteria  that allows  said  activities  to  qualify  as  environmentally  sustainable. These  technical  screening  criteria  are  defined  by  the  European Commission  (EC)  in  delegated  act  2021/2139  published  on December  9,  2021  and  delegated  act  2021/2178  published  on December 10, 2021.\n\nThe  initial  list  of  activities  was  established  by  focusing  on  nine macro-sectors that generated more than 93% of the EU's direct greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 (OECD).\n\nComplementary delegated act 2022/1214, published on July 15, 2022, included certain specific nuclear and gas energy activities in the list of economic activities covered by the Taxonomy. The main impact  for  the  Group  is  the  eligibility  of  the  activity  related  to cogeneration of steam and electricity.\n\nThese first three delegated acts deal with economic activities that can  contribute  significantly  to  the  objectives  of  climate  change mitigation and adaptation.\n\nAdditional  delegated  acts  2023/2485  and  2023/2486,  published on November 21, 2023:\n\n- \u25a0 defined  the  list  of  economic  activities  that  can  contribute significantly to the objectives of sustainable use and protection of  water  and  marine  resources,  the  transition  to  a  circular economy,  the  pollution  prevention  and  control,  and  the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems;\n- \u25a0 amended  the  list  of  activities  related  to  climate  change mitigation and adaptation objectives;\n- \u25a0 modified the templates for key performance indicator tables.\n\nIn  addition,  two  frequently  asked  question  documents  were published  on  June  12,  2023  on  minimum  safeguards  and  on October  20,  2023  on  the  Climate  Delegated  Act  and  the Disclosures Delegated Act.\n\nThe  Taxonomy  Regulation  has  created  a  classification  system which  should  serve  as  a  common  language  for  investors  to identify  the  projects  and  conditions  that  will  enable  the  chosen economic  activities  to  have  a  significant  positive  impact  on  the climate and environment. As such, the regulation is a tool aimed at  helping  investors  and  listed  companies,  financial  institutions and  EU  project  sponsors  to  direct  their  investments  toward environmentally  sustainable  activities  as  part  of  the  transition aimed at making the EU climate neutral by 2050.\n\nThe activities listed in the Taxonomy Regulation are referred to as 'eligible'. While these activities are the major contributors to direct GHG emissions, they also have the potential to be improved from a carbon  footprint perspective. As  such,  the  eligibility percentage of an organization, by itself, is not a measure of its sustainability impact.\n\nThe statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community  (NACE)  is  the  standard  used  to  classify  economic activities which are divided into three categories in the Taxonomy Regulation:\n\n- \u25a0 activities for which technical criteria refer to performance levels which comply with climate neutrality and limiting temperature increase  to  1.5  degrees  Celsius  at  a  global  level  (i.e.  in  line with a net zero carbon economy by 2050);\n- \u25a0 transitional  activities  for  which  there  are  no  low-carbon alternatives  for  the  moment  and  for  which  greenhouse  gas emission  levels  are  in  line  with  the  best  performance  in  the sector or industry;\n- \u25a0 enabling activities which improve carbon efficiency or facilitate a significant decrease in emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are presented in the tables below (pages 358 to 363). As a reminder, activities derived from the production of air gases result in almost no direct greenhouse gas emissions and are therefore not eligible under the Taxonomy.\n\nIn  2023,  turnover  eligible  under  the  Taxonomy  amounted  to  3.7  billion  euros  (equivalent  to  13.4%  of  total  consolidated  turnover) compared to 5.2 billion euros (equivalent to 17.5% of total consolidated turnover) in 2022. This change is mainly due to an unfavorable energy impact on the main eligible activities.\n\nAn eligible activity is referred to as 'aligned' if it complies with the following three conditions and if the requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation can be documented:\n\n- \u25a0 it contributes substantially to one or more of the environmental objectives;\n- \u25a0 it does not significantly harm any of the other five environmental objectives;\n- \u25a0 it is carried out in compliance with minimum safeguards.\n\nIn 2023, aligned turnover per the Taxonomy totaled 0.2 billion euros (equivalent to 0.8% of total consolidated turnover and 5.9% of eligible turnover), compared to 0.3 billion euros (equivalent to 1.2% of total consolidated turnover and 6.6% of eligible turnover) in 2022. This change is mainly due to a production site that stood slightly above the threshold set in the substantial contribution criteria and that is consequently no longer aligned in 2023. Eligible non-aligned activities are either activities that do not meet one of the above-mentioned requirements, or for which such compliance could not be reasonably documented, mainly due to lack of sufficient guidance for alignment or difficulty to access required data at the requested granularity.\n\nTurnover from activities not covered by Taxonomy, referred to as 'non-eligible', totaled 23.9 billion euros (equivalent to 86.6% of total consolidated turnover), and notably included the production of oxygen, medical gases and home healthcare.\n\nThese ratios related to the turnover capture the situation of the existing production units. However, by 2035, Air Liquide aims at investing around 8 billion euros to serve the low-carbon and renewable hydrogen markets. These investments start to be made in the framework of the ADVANCE strategic plan, which also foresees 16 billion euros of investment for the energy transition, with at least half of industrial investments of more than 5 million euros dedicated to the Energy Transition. This path is illustrated by the share of aligned capital expenditure among eligible capital expenditure, which stood at 54.8% in 2023 compared to 30.0% in 2022.\n\n## 5.2.   METHODOLOGY\n\nThe  Group  defined  its  methodology  on  the  basis  of  information available as of November 30, 2023. In particular, the methodology does  not  consider  any  recommendations  published  by  the European  Commission  or  other  competent  authorities  after December 1, 2023.\n\n## Key performance indicators (KPIs)\n\nIn accordance with the consolidated financial statements, figures relating to the three KPIs are provided in millions of euros, and the conversion  of  foreign  currencies  is  carried  out  according  to  the same methodology and using the same exchange rates as those used to prepare financial information.\n\n- \u25a0 Turnover:  the  first  Taxonomy  KPI  is  calculated  by  eligible activity  and  by  facility,  based  on  external  turnover  (i.e. excluding  intra-group  sales)  as  determined  and  published  in the  financial  statements  under  the  'Revenue'  line  in  the income  statement.  If  turnover  by  facility  is  not  available,  the entities  apply  a  ratio  based  on  volumes  delivered  by  each facility.  Turnover  corresponds  to  revenue  from  contracts  with customers as defined under IFRS 15 standard.\n- \u25a0 Capital  expenditure  (CapEx):  the  second  Taxonomy  KPI includes  acquisitions  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  and intangible assets completed during the period under consideration, including those stemming  from  business combinations  that  result  in  the  acquisition  of  a  company  or business  consolidated  in  the  Group's  financial  statements. These additions are considered before impairment, depreciation  and  amortization,  and  any  revaluation.  It  is calculated based on the internal management of investments. Investment decisions exceeding 3 million euros are monitored individually  and  their Taxonomy characteristics are presented\n\nto the Resources  and  Investment  Committee.  Capital expenditure related to these investment decisions is monitored on a per-project basis. Capital expenditure of less than 3million euros is monitored by production site.\n\nThe lines  in  the  Financial  Statements  that  correspond  to  the CapEx KPI are included in Note 11 - 'Other intangible assets,' on  the  line  'Total  gross  intangible  assets'  of  the  columns 'Acquisitions' and 'Acquisitions related to business combinations';  and  in  Note  12  -  'Property,  plant  and equipment'  of  the  'Total  property,  plant  and  equipment'  line under the 'Acquisitions' and 'Acquisitions related to business combinations' columns.\n\n- \u25a0 Operating expenses ('OpEx'): the third KPI of the Taxonomy includes:\n- -direct expenses relating to the nature of the following costs, that are necessary for the production of products included in the turnover KPI: Personnel costs related to maintenance, Subcontracted maintenance and installation, Rental  and  leasing  of  real  estate  and  transportation equipment and Purchases of materials related to maintenance.  The  OpEx  KPI  is  calculated  directly  or indirectly,  by  allocating  expenses  on  the  basis  of  the turnover KPI,\n- -expenses  directly  related  to  activities  contributing  to  the environmental  objectives,  such  as  direct  non-capitalized expenses for research and development or consulting fees in  the  context  of  eligible  activities,  such  as  activity  9.3. 'Consultancy  for  physical  climate  risk  management  and adaptation' under the climate change adaptation objective.\n\nIncome  statement  lines  relating  to  the  OpEx  KPI  are 'Purchases,' 'Personnel expenses' and 'Other expenses'.",

It relied upon:\n- -processes applied by the Group, including but not limited to the  Code  of  Conduct,  the  whistleblowing  system  EthiCall, the  Group's  sustainable  procurement  policy,  the  Vigilance Plan, the prevention measures relating to corruption and fair competition,  and  the  tax  risk  management  policy.  These processes are further described in Chapters 2 and 5 of the present Universal Registration Document. Regarding human rights  and  corruption,  the  assessment  encompassed  the supply chain,\n- -the absence of serious negative impact or event related to the four dimensions (notably the absence of serious breach or conviction).\n\nWhere  the  assessment  could  not  be  sufficiently  evidenced,  the Group adopted a conservative approach and did not consider the eligible activity as aligned.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group  is  currently  analyzing  the  scope  of  the additional delegated acts 2023/2485 and 2023/2486, published on November 21, 2023, defining the economic activities contributing to the objectives of transition to a circular economy and pollution prevention  and  control.  These  pose  difficulties  in  assessing  the eligibility  criteria  with  regard  to  the  Group's  business  model,  as well  as  difficulties  in  understanding  the  technical  criteria  for alignment and collecting data necessary for their application. As a result,  no  activity  was  reported  for  these  two  new  objectives  in 2023.\n\nBesides,  no  activity  has  been  identified  as  eligible  for  the objectives of sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources  and  protection  and  restoration  of  biodiversity  and ecosystems.\n\nFinally, these additional delegated acts only require the eligibility of  new  activities  to  be  presented  in  2023;  alignment  is  only required from 2024. Hence, for the sake of clarity, the Group has chosen  to  present  the  contribution  of  new  eligible  activities separately  and  to  exclude  them  from  the  detailed  tables.  The contribution  of  these  new  activities  to  the  climate  change adaptation objective was as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 the  activity  CCA  14.2  'Flood  risk  prevention  and  protection infrastructure'  contributed  by  0.1  million  euros  to  the  eligible capital  expenditure  (equivalent  to  0.0%  of  the  Group's  total capital expenditure),\n- \u25a0 the  activity  CCA  9.3  'Consultancy  for  physical  climate  risk management and adaptation' contributed by 0.1 million euros to  the  eligible  operating  expenses  (equivalent  to  0.0%  of  the Group's total operating expenses).\n\n## 5.3.   TAXONOMY'S KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPI)\n\nThe tables presented below thus cover one of the six environmental objectives: climate change mitigation.\n\nHereafter a recap of the eligibility and alignment ratios for each of the Taxonomy's key performance indicators:\n\n| Proportion (%)                       | Turnover   | Capital expenditure   | Operating expenses   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| KPI - Eligible activities            | 13.4%      | 15.3%                 | 8.1%                 |\n| KPI - Aligned activities             | 0.8%       | 8.4%                  | 1.4%                 |\n| Ratio of aligned/eligible activities | 5.9%       | 54.8%                 | 17.1%                |\n\nAir  Liquide's  eligible  activities  represent  a  small  portion  of  the Group's  activities,  reflecting  the  fact  that the  majority  of  Air Liquide's turnover is generated from activities with almost no direct greenhouse gas emissions within the Group's scope.\n\nThus,  the  eligible turnover per the European  Taxonomy represented  3,694.3  million  euros,  or  13.4%  of  total  turnover  in 2023,  compared  to  5,237.7  million  euros  or  17.5%  of  total consolidated  turnover  in  2022.  Aligned  turnover  per  the  EU Taxonomy amounted to 217.5 million euros in 2023, or 0.8% of total  turnover  and  5.9%  of  eligible  turnover.  It  stood  at  346.2 million euros in 2022, or 1.2% of total consolidated turnover and 6.6%  of  eligible  turnover.  This  change  is  mainly  due  to  an unfavorable energy impact on the main eligible activities.\n\nEligible CapEx represented 562.1 million euros, or 15.3% of the Group's total 2023 capital expenditure compared to 380.6 million euros  or  9.2%  of  the  Group's  total  capital  expenditure  in  2022. They  are  defined  in  paragraph  5.2.:  this  is  related  to  capital expenditure  incurred  during  the  2023  fiscal  year  on  eligible activities  but  stemming from investment decisions made in 2023\n\nor  in  previous  periods. Aligned  CapEx represented 307.9 million euros,  or  8.4%  of  total  CapEx  and  54.8%  of  eligible  CapEx  in 2023,  compared  to  114.3  million  euros  or  2.8%  of  the  Group's total  capital  expenditure and 30.0% of eligible CapEx in 2022. It illustrates the path presented by the Group.\n\nBy 2035, Air  Liquide  aims  at  investing  around  8  billion  euros  to serve the low-carbon and renewable hydrogen markets, covering the primary production, supply chain and logistics, to accompany the  markets  linked  to  the  energy  transition. Air  Liquide  has  also announced  its  ambition  to  develop  3  GW  of  electrolysis  for hydrogen  production  by  2030.  In  addition,  in  the  ADVANCE strategic plan, 16 billion euros will be invested by the Group over the period 2021-2025, with at least half of industrial investments of more than 5 million euros dedicated to the Energy Transition.\n\nEligible OpEx represented  384.4  million  euros,  i.e.  8.1%  of  the Group's operating expenses. Aligned OpEx represented 65.7 million euros, or 1.4% of total OpEx and 17.1% of eligible OpEx.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Aligned turnover relating to hydrogen is mostly due to manufacturing  units  with  a  low  carbon  footprint  and  to  sales  of equipment  supporting  the  development  of  new  usages  of hydrogen  for  the  energy  transition,  in  particular  in  the  mobility sector.  Excluding  the  energy  impact,  aligned  hydrogen  turnover will  increase  as  demand  for  low  carbon  footprint  hydrogen increases,  supported  by  the  rollout  of  policy  and  regulatory frameworks promoting new usages of hydrogen as a key lever to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from sectors such as industry and transport.  In  2022,  turnover  from  hydrogen-related  activities represented  11.8%  of  total  turnover,  thereof  11.2%  from  the manufacture  of  hydrogen.  This  change  is  mainly  due  to  an unfavorable energy impact.\n\nIn  second  position, cogeneration  activity represented  2.9%  of total turnover in 2023. This activity supplies high grade heat to the chemical and petrochemical industry in an efficient manner and as of  today there is no alternative at large scale; this activity is not deemed aligned with respect to the Taxonomy criteria. Air Liquide is assessing the technology options available to decarbonize heat production  as  part  of  the  rollout  of  its  climate  objectives (described  in  paragraph  1.1  of  the  Extra-financial  performance declaration, page 319). In 2022, cogeneration activity represented 4.5% of  total  turnover,  the  change  being  due  to  an  unfavorable energy impact.\n\n## Additional Information\n\n## Activities that may contribute to several objectives\n\nAdditional  delegated  acts  2023/2485  and  2023/2486,  published  on  November  21,  2023,  introduced  new  mandatory  information concerning activities likely to contribute to several environmental objectives.\n\nThe Group has identified only one activity  that  may  meet  several  environmental  objectives:  the  biomethane  production  by  anaerobic digestion  of  bio-waste  activity  may  be  eligible  per  the  climate  change  mitigation  objective  (CCM  5.7)  and  the  transition  to  a  circular economy (CE 2.5).\n\nAs indicated in the paragraph on Methodology, the Group is currently analyzing the scope of these delegated acts and, consequently, has not reported any amounts in 2023 concerning the new objective of Transition to a circular economy. The Group has included this activity under the climate change mitigation objective in the tables and comments presented above.\n\n|     | Proportion of turnover /  Total turnover   | Proportion of turnover /  Total turnover   |\n|-----|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n|     | Alignment per  objective                   | Eligibility per objective                  |\n| CCM | 0.8%                                       | 13.4%                                      |\n| CCA | -%                                         | -%                                         |\n| WTR |                                            |                                            |\n| CE  |                                            |                                            |\n| PPC |                                            |                                            |\n| BIO |                                            |                                            |\n\nCCM:  Climate  Change  Mitigation;  CCA:  Climate  Change  Adaptation;  WTR:  Sustainable  use  and  protection  of  water  and  marine resources; CE: Transition to a circular economy; PPC: Pollution prevention and control; BIO: Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nActivities covering biomethane production through the anaerobic  digestion  of  bio-waste,  landfill  gas  capture  and utilization and use in the transportation sector represented eligible turnover of 93.8 million euros in 2023, with an alignment ratio of 47.1%,  compared  to  100.6  million  euros  in  2022,  with  an alignment  ratio  of  42.7%.  In  line  with  the  Group  sustainability strategy,  these  projects  are  developed  with  clear  sustainability criteria applied globally.\n\nOther  Group  activities ,  which  are  in  a  growth  phase,  are  also eligible, such as the manufacture of low-carbon technologies with eligible turnover representing 86.4 million euros and an alignment ratio  of  23.6%.  The  Engineering  &  Construction  World  Business Unit notably designs and builds treatment plants that are able to reduce the CO2 emissions of various industries, including:\n\n- \u25a0 carbon  capture  plants  which  capture  and  purify  CO2  from offgas and flue gas from industrial processes (refining, cement, steel, etc.) to supply flow compatible with sequestration;\n- \u25a0 plants capable of converting residues (used cooking oil, fats, etc.) into synthetic fuels to replace fossil fuels in motors, and plants  capable  of  transforming  sugar  waste  into  substitute chemicals for fossil-based chemicals.\n\nAs of today, a portion of these eligible activities is considered nonaligned due to insufficient evidence to comply precisely with the detailed requirement of the European Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nMoreover,  the  activities  associated  with  production  of  air  gases, including in particular the production of oxygen, medical gases and home healthcare, are included in the non eligible activities in 2023.",

The frequently asked questions published on October 20, 2023 clarified the requirements.\n\nIn May 2021, the Group issued its first green bond, for an amount of 500 million euros and with a maturity of 10 years (further detailed in section 8.2.2 on page 391). 21 projects were financed by this issue, including 14 related to eligible activities per the Taxonomy, the main difference being that financial investments are not taken into account in the Taxonomy. As a result, the adjustment of key performance indicators in order to avoid double counting at the level of financial companies, only concerned a portion of the projects financed by the green bond issue.\n\nIn addition, the Sustainable Financing Framework grants a period of two calendar years to achieve the full allocation of funds, from the issue date, as well as a refinancing period of up to three calendar years prior to the issue date. However, it should be noted that the key performance indicators of the Taxonomy only cover the current calendar year, from January 1 to December 31, 2023.\n\nThe tables  below  present  the  adjusted  key  performance  indicators,  excluding  the  projects  financed  by  this  issue  from  the  alignment ratios. The ratios for these two indicators were calculated using the total (A + B) as published as the denominator.\n\n| 2023                | A.1.

Sustainable development issues materiality matrix\n\n## 1.1.   APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY\n\nContributing  to  a  sustainable  future  implies  working  with  all stakeholders  and  sharing  responsibilities  openly,  fairly,  and responsibly. Air Liquide is committed to continuously improving its relationship  and  its  dialog  with  stakeholders.  Since  stakeholder priorities  are  constantly  evolving,  the  Group  carries  out  formal materiality  assessments  on  a  regular  basis  to  identify  and prioritize issues that are most important to stakeholders. In 2020, the  Group  conducted  a  consultation  of  its  stakeholders  on Sustainable Development issues.\n\nAll  internal  and  external Group stakeholders were interviewed in most of the geographies in which the Group operates: customers, patient  associations,  suppliers,  investors,  journalists,  NGOs, employee  representatives,  students  and  future  generations, innovation  partners,  focus  groups  of  employees  and  individual shareholders. With the support of a specialized firm, Air Liquide carried out both qualitative interviews and online questionnaires, giving equal weight to each response in its results.\n\nThese consultations were supplemented by analyses concerning extra-financial rating agencies, press reviews, studies of reporting standards and the contribution of a foresight consultant to improve the way in which the Group's various issues and areas of action were presented and defined.\n\n## 1.2.   RESULTS\n\nThe matrix shown below highlighted the following elements:\n\n- \u25a0 21  sustainable  development  issues  are  considered  to  be important  by  stakeholders.  No  question  received  an  average score of less than two on a scale of one to four;\n- \u25a0 14 issues were assessed as major, with a wide consensus of support.  Stakeholders  recognize Air  Liquide's  commitment  in these areas and their integration into Group strategy.\n\nThe issue relative to protection of the habitats and biodiversity is the  only  one  where  the  various  stakeholders  have  significantly differing views. To better understand its impacts and dependencies,  or  lack  thereof, the Group  completed  an assessment along the value chain (described in the EFPD section of the present Chapter 5 - page 336).\n\nCompared to the analysis carried out previously, the materiality matrix showed the emergence in 2020 of social issues or challenges that are largely taken into account in the Group's strategy, such as adaptation to  climate  change  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions  (page  319), diversity and inclusion (page 345 and 346), well-being and quality of life  at  work  (page  344),  remuneration  and  social  protection  (page 346-7). management of external crises (geopolitical or health crises, etc.) (page 83), responsible finance and investment (page 391).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInternal stakeholders with a strategic vision on the topics - importance",

HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nAir Liquide brings together 67,800 women and men of more than 161 nationalities, in 72 countries (1) , who form multicultural teams with a host of skills.\n\nThe Group strives to promote diversity, encourage innovation and employee  engagement,  meet  customers'  expectations  and guarantee Air Liquide's long-term performance.\n\nIn an  environment  undergoing  profound  transformation,  Air Liquide  has  developed  a  Human  Resources  strategy  to  identify, attract, maintain and develop competent employees from all walks of life. This strategy is based on the following three priorities:\n\n- \u25a0 encouraging employee engagement;\n- \u25a0 developing an agile and collaborative structure;\n- \u25a0 anticipating the future of work.\n\n## GROUP HEADCOUNT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n30,000\n\n2014 2017 2016 2015 2020 2019 2021 2022 2023 2018\n\n## 2.2.   EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT\n\n## 2.2.1.  Employees' voices\n\nThere is a direct link between employee engagement and Group customer  satisfaction,  which  is  at  the  heart  of  the  Company program.  Employee  engagement  is  one  of  Human  Resources' priorities.  Air  Liquide  has  launched  a  commitment  monitoring measurement  program,  My  Voice.  It  aims  to  improve  employee experience and well-being. It is based on a simple concept: listen, understand and act. Following the launch of the initiative in Asia Pacific  in  2019,  feedback  is  gathered  annually  from  employees across the entire Group to obtain a better understanding of their expectations and to identify and introduce appropriate measures and, as a result, significantly increase their engagement.\n\nA short survey covering some 20 topics is sent to each employee with  room  to  leave  comments  if  desired.  The  questions  cover areas  such  as  safety,  work-life  balance,  career  development, inclusiveness,  independence,  career  development  and  trust  in management. Answers are completely anonymized to ensure that employees  are  free  to  express  their  thoughts.  Results  are collected  in  real  time,  aggregated  and  analyzed  by  means  of  a shared system for the entire Group. Each manager has access to the  results  from  his  or  her  team  -  provided  that  the  thresholds needed to guarantee confidentiality are respected.\n\nSince  its  launch,  this  program  has  confirmed  Air  Liquide's strengths which contribute to employee commitment and identified opportunities,  particularly  in  the  context  of  the  health  crisis  in order to provide appropriate responses as soon as possible.\n\n(1)\n\nTargeted  actions  are  launched  at  different  levels  in  the organization: with managers and their employees to improve team dynamics, at the level of the entities by management teams, and at the Group level.\n\nAt this last level, the results of the program made it possible, for example, to:\n\n- \u25a0 implement initiatives to improve communication and education on the way the remuneration policy is constructed;\n- \u25a0 strengthen the sharing of information concerning the Group's major  strategic  orientations  with  all  employees,  which  has notably  been  reflected  in  the  communication  about  the ADVANCE strategic plan.\n\nIn  2022, Air  Liquide  launched  an  internal  survey  on  sustainable development.  The  purpose  of  the  survey  was  to  collect  the opinions  of  employees  and  to  measure  their  understanding  and engagement  on  the  subject.  Analysis  of  the  data  collected enabled the Group to enrich its knowledge of the strengths and opportunities for improvement in relation to employee expectations. In 2023, this resulted in targeted actions aimed at responding to employee comments and increasing engagement in sustainable  development,  in  particular  by  setting  up  training sessions or round tables on themes such as the energy transition, carbon neutrality, biodiversity and inclusive purchasing, as well as a global Sustainability Day.\n\n## 2.2.2.  Mobility for skills development\n\nAir  Liquide  is  continuously  looking  to  recruit  diverse  profiles  to build multi-disciplined and complementary teams.\n\nThe Group's diversity is characterized by the fact that there is no 'standard  career  path'.  On  the  contrary,  each  employee  adapts their career path according to their individual goals and the career opportunities offered by the Group. Internal mobility and technical expertise are two major factors in career development.\n\n## THE TECHNICAL COMMUNITY LEADERS PROGRAM\n\nThe Technical Community Leaders (TCL) program enables talents in technical domains to access career paths that offer them both recognition  of  their  technical  expertise  and  opportunities  to develop and evolve in the field of this expertise. Today, Air Liquide has more than 4,700 technical experts,  playing  a  driving  role  in sharing expertise and technical excellence, serving its customers and patients.\n\nThis community of the Group's technology experts contributes to the transfer of technical know-how that Air Liquide will need in the future.\n\nAs part of this TCL program to identify technical talent, 136 new international  experts  were  appointed  in  2023,  in  nine  areas  of expertise  (Large  Industries,  Industrial  Merchant,  Healthcare, Electronics, Engineering & Construction, Innovation and Development  Division,  Industrial  Operations  &  Security,  IT  & Digital,  Hydrogen  Mobility).  The  TCL  program  is  a  key  driver  of innovation  and  a  major  contributor  to  ensuring  the  long-term reliability and safety of its products and operations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Employee performance and remuneration\n\nThe  performance  review  meeting  is  a  key  stage  in  employee development, as it facilitates a discussion between the employee and  their  manager  on  performance  and  development,  the assessment and setting  objectives  for  the  year  ahead.  In  2023, 79% of Group employees had a performance review meeting with their immediate supervisor.\n\nThe comprehensive remuneration of Group employees is based on three criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 the position held;\n- \u25a0 the degree of responsibility;\n- \u25a0 performance.\n\nIn addition, the state of the local market, pay equality and current legislation  are  taken  into  account.  It  is  generally  made  up  of  a basic salary plus additional remuneration and benefits items.\n\nThe variable part of remuneration is structured locally for certain categories  of  employees  to  reward  performance.  In  general,  it depends on parameters such as the Group's earnings, the entity's earnings  and  individual  performance,  which  is  measured  in quantitative  and  qualitative  terms.  By  rewarding  collective  and individual performance, Air Liquide encourages collaboration and contribution to overall earnings.\n\nMost of the managers and professionals have variable pay, which includes sustainable development objectives.\n\nRemuneration  may  also  include  benefits  such  as  death  and disability insurance, health insurance, profit-sharing (2) or solutions to help balance work and family life, which vary by country.\n\nIn  2023, 59%  of  the  Group's  employees  received  an  individual variable portion as part of their remuneration.\n\n15% of managers' variable remuneration is linked to sustainable development  criteria,  such  as  safety,  customer  satisfaction, energy efficiency and equality.\n\nFinally, the top 378 Group executives have a significant portion of their variable remuneration linked to these criteria, notably safety, as well as to the Corporate Sustainability Program targets for their entity.\n\n## 2.2.4.  Transformation of the work environment\n\nThe  Group  ensures  that  it  builds  a  performance-focused, attractive and collaborative work environment while also safeguarding  the  health  and  well-being  of  Group  employees  in their workplace.\n\nThese practices were incorporated into principles that were jointly developed  with  European  social  partners.  In  2019,  the  Group partnered with the European Works Council to develop the 'Care and Perform' initiative, whose purpose is to prevent psychosocial risks. This led to the creation of a charter based on principles of action linked to improvements in work scheduling, workloads and work-life  balance.  The  content  of  this  charter  facilitated  the conclusion of company agreements with social partners in order to  offer  new  services  to  employees.  In  several  European countries,  agreements  on  the  right  to  disconnect  and  work remotely  have  been  concluded  to  meet  specific  needs  and support the transition toward new working conditions.\n\n(2)\n\n## Common Social Coverage\n\nAs  part  of  the  ADVANCE  objectives  announced  in  2022,  Air Liquide's aim is to Act for all by engaging with employees. On this occasion,  the  Group  renewed  its  commitment  to  offering  a common  basis  of  care  coverage  to  all  employees  by  2025 (description in the EFPD section of the present Chapter 5 - page 346).\n\n## Citizen at Work: enabling employees to actively serve their local communities\n\nFor  many  years  and  throughout  the  world,  Air  Liquide's employees  have  been  involved  in  helping  local  communities, either  during  or  outside  their  working  hours,  with  the  support  of subsidiaries'  management  or  the  Foundation.  To  encourage  this even further among its 67,800 employees, the Group has created the Citizen at Work program to give employees the means to act and increase its collective impact (description in the EFPD section of the present Chapter 5 - page 345)\n\n## 2.2.5.  Legal working hours\n\nEach  Group  entity  defines,  in  agreement  with  representative bodies  and  in  line  with  local  regulations,  legal  working  hours which encourage engagement and performance.\n\nIn  2020,  the  Group  launched  the  'Next  Normal'  initiative  to support the transformation of work organization.\n\nWith this project, the entities can provide their employees with:\n\n- \u25a0 a new framework including team management;\n- \u25a0 a supervised remote working policy;\n- \u25a0 reorganization of workspaces;\n- \u25a0 careful  consideration  of  interactions  with  customers  and patients;\n- \u25a0 a new framework for Air Liquide's responsible travel policy.\n\nTo  facilitate  the  rollout  of  the  'Next  Normal'  project,  Air  Liquide developed a reference guide in 2021. First shared with managers, the guide helps the entities to set up new working methods based on  the  initial  global  experience.  Working  groups  were  then organized  with  employees  in  the  entities  to  validate  the commitments.\n\nIn France, the general framework of legal working hours is defined in agreements with the labor unions.\n\nMeanwhile,  the  industrial  businesses,  as  well  as  those  in Healthcare,  include  on-call  systems  that  are  regularly  discussed and are subject to agreements with the labor unions.\n\n## 2.2.6.  Renewing social dialog\n\nAir Liquide is committed to meaningful labor relations in all of its subsidiaries.  This  comes  in  different  forms  according  to  local regulations. In 2023, 87% of Group employees had access to a representation, dialog or consultation structure.\n\nIn  Europe,  the  European  Works  Council  of  Air  Liquide  has  29 employee  representatives  from  12  countries.  It  was  renewed  in 2021 for a term of four years. In 2023, two plenary meetings were held  under  the  chairwomanship  of  a  member  of  the  Executive Committee.  In  addition,  the  Council  Board,  composed  of  five members elected in plenary session, met twice to be informed of and discuss several transnational projects and topics of interest to employees in Europe, in accordance with the founding agreement of the European Works Council.",

        "page_content": "## EXTRA-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DECLARATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL REPORTING\n\n## Relationship with stakeholders\n\nIn  the  first  half  of  2023,  the  Board,  enlarged  to  include  French representatives at the European Works Council, held exceptional meetings  relating  to  the  Group  project  for  the  transformation  of Human Resources processes  and  organization.  The  purpose  of these  meetings  was  to  prepare  the  information-consultation process  concerning  the  reorganization  of  Human  Resources business services centers in  France.  Further  to  the  consultation process  on  the  Group  project  in  2022,  the  European  Works Council, in plenary, delivered an opinion in 2023 on the project in France,  while  dialog  continued  at  local  level  in  accordance  with applicable laws.\n\nIn 2023, the following topics, among others, were presented and discussed  at  European  Works  Council  meetings  thanks  to  the support and direct participation of the relevant internal stakeholders:\n\n- \u25a0 the 'Know Our Safety Risks' initiative;\n- \u25a0 hydrogen mobility projects;\n- \u25a0 the  remote  and  operation  and  optimization  SIO  centers ('Smart and Innovative Operations');\n- \u25a0 R&D results and vision;\n- \u25a0 Human Resources transformation project;\n- \u25a0 monitoring of Care and Perform initiatives;\n- \u25a0 results of the My Voice engagement survey;\n- \u25a0 learning organization;\n- \u25a0 digital security.\n\nEvery  year,  the  Chairwoman  of  the  European  Works  Council issues  a  report  on  various  topics  relating  to  the  Group's businesses.  The  Group's  annual  results,  and  more  specifically those  in  Europe  and  the  results  related  to  extra-financial performance  (e.g.  safety,  reliability,  staff  turnover  rate,  training, diversity), have been presented to the European Works Council.\n\nIn  2023,  after  more  than  a  year  of  meetings  and  exchanges  of opinions  at  the  level  of  the  European  Works  Council  and  its Board,  an  amendment  to  the  Council  founding  agreement  was voted  and  signed  at  the  November  plenary  session.  This  latest amendment integrates the best practices in favor of social dialog developed  within  the  body  through  the  joint  recognition  by Management  and  employee  representatives  of  the  value  of effective labor relations.\n\n## 2.3.   AN AGILE AND COLLABORATIVE STRUCTURE\n\nThe second focus of the Human Resources strategy consists of building an agile and collaborative structure capable of addressing the  challenges  of  a  continuously  changing  world.  This  requires facilitating  cross-divisional  exchanges  within  Group's  teams  to ensure long-term performance.\n\n## 2.3.1.  Inclusion and diversity\n\nDiversity is a priority of Air Liquide's Human Resources strategy and  policy  and  the  Group  considers  it  a  source  of  dynamism, creativity  and  performance.  It  is  a  fundamental  element  of  the organization,  in  terms  of  both  businesses  and  employees,  and drives the Group's long-term performance. The roadmap is based on three pillars:\n\n- \u25a0 setting and monitoring objectives for all entities;\n- \u25a0 mitigating  bias  in  talent  discussions  and  improving  Human Resources processes;\n- \u25a0 promoting a culture of inclusion.\n\nThe Group's objective is to increase diversity among managerial staff  to  better  recognize  the  various  cultures  that  make  up  Air Liquide and to improve gender equality. In this respect, quantified gender  equality  targets  have  been  set  for  the  Group.  The  local entities  took  an  inventory  of  the  current  situation  to  define  an\n\n(3)\n\nobjective  at  the  level  of  the  clusters  and  thus  contribute  to  the overall objective.\n\nThe actions taken by the Group to promote gender diversity are described in the Extra-financial Performance Declaration section, of the present Chapter 5, - page 346 and 347.\n\nThe Group has set several gender equality objectives, aimed at reaching a rate of:\n\n- \u25a0 35%  women  at  the  'Managers  and  Professionals'  level,  by 2025.  These  objectives  are  in  line  with  the  results  obtained over the past ten years, which have seen the share of female 'Managers and Professionals' within the Group increase from 27% in 2013 to 32.0% (3) ;\n- \u25a0 25% of executive positions (senior executives) held by women by 2025.\n\nWith  the  aim  of  a  balanced  distribution  of  the  workforce  by  age group,  as  explained  on  page  348,  Air  Liquide  is  committed  to fostering  better  qualifications  and  training  programs  for  young people  to  facilitate  their  integration  into  the  workplace.  In  this respect,  the  Group  offers  internship  and  work-study  contracts  in France as well as international exchange programs such as the ALLEX  programs  for  managers  and  EVE  for  technicians. Furthermore,  seniors  will  represent  an  increasing  share  of  Air Liquide  employees  in  the  coming  years.  Their  contribution  to mentoring  programs  (notably  the  Technical  Community  Leaders program),  and  training  programs  aimed  at  younger  generations will be further promoted.\n\nIn addition, Air Liquide ensures that its resources are representative  of  the  local  area.  Thus,  161  nationalities  are present  in  the  Group  and  34  among  senior  executives,  as mentioned in the EFPD section of the present Chapter 5 - page 349.\n\nLastly,  'Our  differences  make  our  performance.'  This  slogan carries a strong conviction. The inclusion of disabilities is fully in line  with  the  policy  to  promote  diversity  within  Air  Liquide.  This desire has been embodied since 2007 in successive agreements in France  which  have  advanced  the  policy  of  welcoming, maintaining  and  promoting  the  professional  development  of people with disabilities. More generally, at the European level, the HandivAirsity  initiative  launched  in  2017  aims  to  encourage diversity  by  integrating  people  with  disabilities  into  teams.  The actions  detailed  on  the  subject  of  disability  are  described  in  the Extra-financial Performance Declaration - page 348).\n\nAt  entity  level,  the  Group's  objective  is  therefore  to  have  teams comprising  employees  who  represent  the  environment  in  which they  operate.  Each  entity  is  responsible  for  implementing  action plans specific to its own environment and legal framework, which may  include  many  forms  of  diversity  (skin  color,  ethnic  origin, religion,  sexual  orientation,  etc.).  Through  its  diversity  policy, Air Liquide is strongly committed to fighting any form of discrimination.\n\n## 2.3.2.  A new organizational model for Human Resources Management\n\nIn 2020, Air Liquide launched a global program to transform its HR function, to improve its organization and tools at the same time. This project has three objectives:\n\n- \u25a0 harmonizing,  standardizing  and  digitalizing  HR  processes  to optimize  the  employee  experience  in  all  Air  Liquide  entities, through  the  implementation  of  the  Group's  first  single  and integrated HR information system;\n- \u25a0 pooling and professionalizing HR transactional activities at hub level by creating shared service centers and areas of expertise by entrusting them to centers of excellence;\n\n<!-- image -->",

Network organization\n\nAir Liquide has a decentralized operational structure which relies on  its  hubs  and  clusters  (groups  of  countries  or  entities).  This network structure on a global scale is more agile, fosters initiative and strengthens proximity with customers.\n\nA  collaborative  work  platform  called  'Kite'  has  been  launched throughout  the  Group.  Kite  is  changing  every  year  to  offer  its users  new  services.  Thus,  the  Group  offers  employees  the opportunity  to  set  up  and  access  communities  (Google  Spaces) that  mobilize  employees  on  many  subjects:  expertise,  tools, events, procedures, shared interests, etc. They transform working methods by fostering flexibility, efficiency, diversity and collective intelligence.\n\nThis  network  structure  and  collaborative  platform  have  made  it possible, over the last few years, characterized by the pandemic crisis,  to  maintain  an  efficient  working  structure  and  connections between employees.\n\n## 2.4.   ANTICIPATING THE 'FUTURE OF WORK'\n\nThe  'Future  of  Work'  cornerstone  focuses  on  identifying  the business  lines  and  skills  of  the  future.  To  do  so,  the  Human Resources teams must understand and anticipate trends that are likely to transform our business.\n\n## 2.4.1.  Business lines and skills\n\nThe aim is to implement an efficient action plan to help employees evolve at the same pace as their business line. To support each employee  in  this  new  technological  environment,  Air  Liquide University has developed:\n\n- \u25a0 a Sales Academy, which was set up to strengthen key skills in the Group's business lines;\n- \u25a0 an  'AI  readiness'  program,  which  was  launched  to  develop sensitivity and skills in artificial intelligence within the Group.\n\n## 2.4.2.  Career-long training and development\n\nAir Liquide takes special care to develop its employees' skills and expertise  throughout  their  careers.  Several  ways  of  learning  are provided. Everyone must be proactive in this regard.\n\nIn  2023,  the  percentage  of  Group  employees  who  had  at  least one  day  of  training  during  the  year  was  70%;  this  excludes regulatory training.\n\nThe  online  training  offer  is  upgraded  year  by  year  and  covers many topics such as safety, ethics, Human Resources processes, management, and, more recently, digital technology.\n\nAn online self-learning package (#ILoveLearning) was deployed in 2019 as part of a pilot by Air Liquide University. Since then, over 26,920 employees have used this self-service training.\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF TRAINING TOPICS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough its programs and structure, Air Liquide University, which has now been active for around 15 years, supports the Group's strategic  initiatives  and  promotes  the Air  Liquide  culture.  Today, Air Liquide University is present at Group level and promotes new ways of  learning,  in  both  traditional  and  non-traditional  ways,  in order  to  share  these  ideas  globally.  As  such,  the  Company's various businesses and functions can access tools to design their own programs.\n\nModern teaching  methods  are  coupled  with  formal  and  informal skills, online training, lessons, support, mentoring, codevelopment, etc. The programs are as practical and relevant as possible,  and  use  role  play,  mock  exercises,  workshops,  case studies, guided discussions and various feedback mechanisms.\n\nFollowing  the  health  crisis,  the  digitalization  of  many  business lines and the strengthening of training for employees, in 2023 the Air  Liquide  University  once  again  launched  two  virtual  events open  to  the  entire  Group,  which  revolve  around  nine  themes: Management  &  Leadership,  Sales  &  Marketing,  Operational Excellence,  Innovation,  Climate  &  Energy  Transition,  Personal Development,  Digital  &  IT,  Inclusion  and  Diversity  and  sessions reserved  for  HR  professionals.  This  has  resulted  in  6,300 employees  logged  in  to  over  270  online  sessions:  webinars, virtual classes and learning paths. One of these virtual events is dedicated to peer learning with all sessions offered by Air Liquide internal  facilitators.  For  this  edition,  which  took  place  over  five weeks, more than 150 internal facilitators shared their knowledge with 4,150 participants in 170 sessions organized in different time zones  and  in  multiple  languages.  Thanks  to  the  mini  tutorial program, this year 26 creators of mini tutorials also shared their knowledge  with  more  than  25  micro-learning  videos.  Those sessions are then available in the Learning Management System (LMS), in Workday and on the University website.\n\nThis year, the first face-to-face Campus Europe since the health crisis  was  organized  in  the  Paris  region.  140  participants  from 31 different countries took part in training programs: Management &  Leadership,  Sales  &  Marketing  and  Operational  Excellence. This  event,  organized  over  four  days,  is  a  unique  learning  and networking opportunity for employees.\n\nAs  part  of  the  BeActEngage  program,  the  Group  provides employees with the means to learn throughout their career. As a learning company, Air Liquide also encourages employees to pass on their knowledge and learn from each other, and peer-to-peer learning is an excellent opportunity to broaden their skills.",

These  programs  help  managers  understand  the increasingly volatile and complex world around them and provide the  Group  with  the  relevant  expertise  to  maintain  its  leadership position over the long term.\n\n## 3.   Shareholders: a long-term relationship\n\nShareholders  have  been  contributing  to  and  supporting  the Group's growth since its creation. During the 2016 acquisition of Airgas,  they  once  again  confirmed  their  commitment  to  the Group's  development  through  large-scale  involvement  in  the capital increase in cash with Preferential subscription right. Today, it  is  thanks to their loyal support that Air Liquide can continue to change  and  grow.  Air  Liquide's  long-term  profitable  growth strategy  and  its  commitment  to  its  Shareholders  are  therefore closely  linked.  By  promoting  individual  shareholding,  through various market actions and by offering Shareholders the expertise of its dedicated  department,  Air  Liquide  fosters  a  close\n\nrelationship  on  a  daily  basis,  founded  on  dialog  with  its Shareholders, based on the following key principles:\n\n- \u25a0 promoting long-term share investment;\n- \u25a0 encouraging  Shareholder  loyalty  through  registered  shares and its establishment of a loyalty bonus policy;\n- \u25a0 promoting  discussion  through  meetings  with  Shareholders, whether face-to-face or in digital format;\n- \u25a0 recognizing and promoting the Shareholder's key role.\n\n## DISTRIBUTION OF CAPITAL (AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2023)\n\n|                                        | 2014   | 2015   | 2016   | 2017   |     | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |     | 2023   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----|--------|\n| Individual shareholders                | 37%    | 36%    | 33%    | 32%    |     | 32%    | 32%    | 33%    | 33%    | 35%    | (b) | 34%    |\n| French institutional investors         | 17%    | 18%    | 20%    | 19%    | (a) | 18%    | 17%    | 16%    | 15%    | 14%    |     | 13%    |\n| Non-French institutional investors     | 46%    | 46%    | 47%    | 49%    | (a) | 50%    | 51%    | 51%    | 52%    | 51%    |     | 53%    |\n| Treasury shares                        | > 0%   | > 0%   | > 0%   | > 0%   |     | > 0%   | > 0%   | > 0%   | > 0%   | > 0%   |     | > 0%   |\n| Registered capital                     | 35%    | 36%    | 33%    | 34%    |     | 35%    | 34%    | 34%    | 34%    | 35%    |     | 34%    |\n| Capital eligible for the loyalty bonus | 30%    | 30%    | 26%    | 25%    |     | 26%    | 28%    | 28%    | 28%    | 28%    |     | 28%    |\n\n## 3.1.

In  addition  to  its  steady performance  and  remuneration  policy,  Air  Liquide  promotes  the registration  of  shares  in  order  to  enhance  the  value  of  the investment in shares and build long-term Shareholder loyalty with eligibility for the loyalty bonus.\n\nThe Shareholder Services Department continues to improve the quality  of  service  to  Shareholders.  It  simplifies  administrative procedures by offering more personalized services. It is pursuing initiatives  for  better  and  wider  dissemination  of  strategy  and financial  information,  for  example  by  broadcasting  live  events  to the Group's Shareholders. The latest digital tools are also at the heart  of  this  initiative,  as  they  provide  a  formidable  lever  for multiplication and personalization.\n\nAs proof of this commitment, Air Liquide is the only company to offer, a space  allowing Shareholders  or  people  seeking information  on Air  Liquide  shares  to  discuss  in  person  with  the Shareholder  Relations Advisors:  it  is  the  Shareholders'  Lounge, located at the Company's head office in Paris.\n\nAir Liquide manages a Shareholders' Communication Committee (SCC).  Composed  of  12  Shareholders,  the  SCC  meets  three\n\ntimes  a  year  under  the  Chairmanship  of  the  Chairman  and enables rich discussions with these Shareholder representatives. It is regularly consulted on matters relating to communication with Shareholders. This year, the SCC welcomed one new member for a three-year term. A committee member is part of the Air Liquide Foundation's Project Selection Committee.\n\n## Registered Shareholder services\n\nRegistered  shares  are  eligible  for  a  loyalty  bonus:  Air  Liquide thanks  Shareholders  for  their  loyalty  by  offering  them  a  loyalty bonus  after  holding  their  shares  in  registered  form  for  two  full calendar  years.  This  bonus  provides  a  +10%  increase  in  the amount of dividends paid and +10% more free shares distributed during free share attributions.\n\nAir Liquide is the only CAC 40 non-banking company which keeps managing internally  all  aspects  of  its  shares  on  behalf  of  both  its 133,000 Shareholders who hold their shares directly with Air Liquide ('direct  registered')  and  the  197,000  Shareholders  who  choose  to deposit their shares in a Bank, while being known to the Company ('administered  registered'):  account  keeping,  register  keeping, centralization  of  the  General  Meeting.  It  does  not  charge  any custodial or management fees. Broker fees are among the lowest on the market at 0.1% excluding VAT for transactions made online in the Shareholder Portal and paid for by bank card or direct debit. For  transactions  settled  by  other  forms  of  payment  in  the Shareholder  Portal  or  for  stock  market  orders  placed  by  another means  of  communication  (e.g.  telephone  call  or  online  request), broker fees are 0.18%. The brokerage rate applies with no minimum fee, i.e. regardless of the number of shares purchased or sold.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Taken over a five-year period, including 2020 which was the pandemic year, the stock market performance of Air Liquide's shares was up +96.50% (vs. +59.49% for the CAC 40).\n\nThere have been 31 free share attributions since 1962, i.e. an average of one free share award every two years.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the overall financial performance of the Air Liquide share, i.e. the rate of return on invested capital, or Total Shareholder Return (TSR) (1) , remains well above the performance of its benchmark index:\n\n## END OF 2023 DATA\n\n| TSR (Annual return)           | 5 years   | 10 years   | 20 years   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|------------|------------|\n| Air Liquide registered shares | +17.19%   | +12.90%    | +12.59%    |\n| Air Liquide bearer shares     | +16.87%   | +12.43%    | +12.01%    |\n| CAC 40 reinvested dividends   | +12.88%   | +8.99%     | +7.26%     |\n\nSince its initial public offering in 1913, Air Liquide has always shown a profit and shared the fruits of its growth by rewarding its Shareholders' trust through a remuneration and loyalty policy based on regular dividend distribution, allocation of free shares, and a loyalty bonus program. As a result, more than 50% of earnings over the last 10 years have been distributed to Shareholders by way of dividends.\n\n## 3.3.   RECOGNIZING AND PROMOTING THE SHAREHOLDER KEY ROLE\n\nAir Liquide is committed to defending individual Shareholding and promoting investment in shares, a real challenge for society with a strong  increase  in  the  number  of  individual  Shareholders observed  since  the  health  crisis  of  2020.  The  Group  has supported  initiatives  such  as  those  of  the  ANSA  (Association nationale  des  soci\u00e9t\u00e9s  par  actions),  the  Observatoire  des Actionnaires  d'Avenir  and  the  F2iC  (the  French  Federation  of Individual  Investors  and  Investment  Clubs),  which  contributed  to the  creation  of  the  'PEA  Jeunes',  a  young  person's  personal equity plan under the PACTE law.\n\n## 3.4.   2023 INITIATIVES\n\n## 3.4.1.  Individual Shareholders\n\nClose to 800,000 people are individual Shareholders of the Air Liquide group as of December 31, 2023; they hold 34% of the company's capital.\n\nIndividual Shareholders have been contributing to and supporting the  Group's  growth  since  its  creation.  Shareholders'  trust  and loyalty  are  key  to Air  Liquide's  growth.  For  more than a century, the Group has been dedicated to involving them in its growth and has  fostered  a  long-term  relationship  based  on  transparency, dialog and proximity.\n\nThe website for recruiting new Shareholders, https:// deveniractionnaire.airliquide.com,  continues  to  be  enriched  with new articles in the 'News' section. It presents the performance of Air  Liquide's  shares  and  explains  the  Group's  strategy  in  a  new way. To  show  the  regularity  and  level  of  performance  of  the Air Liquide share, a simulator allows the visitor to position sliders to select  the  duration  and  the  amount  of  the  investment,  then  to compare this performance with that of the Livret A (France's most popular savings account). This simulator is now integrated into the site https://www.airliquide.com/ and aims to attract new individual shareholders.\n\nThe process for opening an online securities account, which has been  a  great  success  since  its  inception,  was  redesigned  and simplified. The new system presents the various stages in a more intuitive  way,  incorporates  automatic  checks  of  the  supporting documents sent and makes it easier to open a securities account more quickly.\n\nAir  Liquide's  digital  presence  continued  to  grow  in  2023  with several new online initiatives. As part of the Boursolive digital fair, Air Liquide took part in the 'Let's Talk Equities' webinar at the end of  June  2023.  This  live  webcast,  available  for  replay,  attracted tens  of  thousands  of  views.  Based  on  the  observation  that  this type of live exchange appeals to part of the Group's audience, Air Liquide organized a second live webinar on October 25, 2023. It attracted  nearly  1,300  live  viewers,  who  asked  more  than  600 questions,  and  was  viewed  thousands  of  times. The  aim  of  this new format is to inform individual Shareholders by answering their questions  and  address  practical  issues  such  as  loyalty  bonuses and  how  to  deal  with  existing  online  frauds.  It  also  makes shareholding  accessible  to  beginners  by  teaching  them  about share ownership and facilitating access to the stock market.\n\nA  series  of  short  videos  (1  minute  30  seconds)  was  launched  in autumn 2023. These films, entitled 'Take action', present in a new way the essential elements shareholders need to make an informed decision. Each episode has been viewed several thousand times, demonstrating  the  interest  of  some  members  of  the  public  in  this format. A second season will be launched in early 2024.\n\nAir  Liquide  is  strengthening  its  presence  on  social  networks. Based on an ecosystem of several social networks, the Group is targeting different audiences  in  different  ways.  Thus,  the multiplication  of  'posts',  information  dedicated  to  Shareholders, the live broadcast and replay of webinars, access to the various 'Take Action' videos, speeches and testimonials from the Group's management  team  all  contribute  to  increasing  Air  Liquide's visibility for its Shareholders or future Shareholders.",

Three meetings were organized  in  2023:  in  Strasbourg  on  June  12, Annecy  on  September  25  and  Bordeaux  on  October  3.  These  meetings,  attended  by several hundred Shareholders, provide an opportunity to talk to the public, answer their many questions and present the company and the main services offered by Air Liquide.\n\n'Investing Day' : in November, Air Liquide took part in the 2023 edition at the Carrousel du Louvre. With a stand attended by several hundred Shareholders, Air Liquide organized presentations dedicated to the Group's shareholding or businesses. The company also took part in several round tables and 'masterclasses' during which speakers answered questions from a large audience of people wishing to learn more about the Group.

Serving customers and patients\n\nIn  an  increasingly  dynamic  and  competitive  environment,  Air Liquide  focuses  its  attention  on  its  customers  and  their satisfaction  in  order  to  provide  them  with  long-term  growth.  To strengthen  this  priority,  the  Group  Customer  Department  is supervised by a member of the Executive Committee.\n\nAs  part  of  its  Healthcare  business,  Air  Liquide  strives  to  offer solutions  that  aim  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  patients  and enable caregivers to focus on their medical duties. This approach is  an  essential  lever  for  improving  the  health  outcomes  expected by patients and is an integral part of the 'Value-Based Healthcare' strategy  of  the  Group.  This  is  how  Air  Liquide  will  be  able  to contribute to a more efficient and virtuous healthcare system for all.\n\nPresent  in  35  countries  around  the  world  for  its  healthcare business, the Group works with all healthcare players to meet the major challenges they face.\n\n## 4.1.   COMMITMENT TO INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS\n\nAir  Liquide  meets  the  needs  of  over  two  million  industrial customers  worldwide.  These  customers  come  from  sectors  as diverse as steel, agri-food, chemicals, water and  waste management, electronics, crafts, etc. The Group's objective is to support  its  customers  by  providing  them  with  services  and solutions  that  are  both  innovative  and  reliable.  This  is  possible thanks to in-depth knowledge of each of their businesses.\n\nThe Group's organization allows each entity and industrial activity to  respond to the specific expectations of local customers within its geographical region, thereby building a close relationship with each  customer.  Customers  demand  flexibility,  responsiveness, service, availability and a genuine long-term partnership.\n\nIn addition, some international customers require fully coordinated global  management  services.  An  organization  dedicated  to strategic accounts helps support these customers and meet their specific  needs.  This  program  relies  on  a  team  of  Strategic Account  Managers  whose  mission  is  to  develop  in-depth knowledge of those customers so that they can better respond to their  needs  and  adopt  a  strategic  alignment  with  their  growth priorities.\n\nTo  assist  us  in  working  with  and  supporting  customers  and meeting their specific needs, the industrial structure is organized into three different activities:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Large Industries\n\nThe  Large  Industries  business  line  supplies  around  500 customers in the metals, chemicals, refining and energy industries with  gas  and  energy  solutions  which  are  essential  to  their  own industrial  production,  enabling  them  notably  to  improve  process efficiency,  make  their  plants  more  environmentally  friendly  and reduce their carbon footprint.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Industrial Merchant\n\nThe  Industrial  Merchant  business  line  serves  over  two  million customers  representing  a  very  diverse  range  of  sectors  and requirements:\n\n- \u25a0 materials and energy;\n- \u25a0 automotive & manufacturing;\n- \u25a0 food & pharmaceuticals;\n- \u25a0 technology & research;\n- \u25a0 craftsmen & retail.\n\nIt  offers  them  comprehensive  solutions  for  implementing  and optimizing industrial processes. Around 95% of the customer base in this sector is small customers who favor simplicity, flexibility and quality of service.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Electronics\n\nThis business area supports its customers in the semiconductor, flat  panel  and  photovoltaic  markets,  drawing  on  its  expertise, worldwide infrastructure and strategic partnerships with manufacturers.  Its  products  and  services  respond  to  growing consumer demand for improved mobility, connectivity, processing power and energy savings.\n\n## 4.2.   COMMITMENT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH PATIENTS, HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND HOSPITALS\n\nAir Liquide is a global player in medical gases, home healthcare services and specialty ingredients.\n\nIn 35 countries, Air Liquide's 16,500 employees in the Healthcare business  units  -  nurses,  researchers,  technicians,  engineers, doctors, data scientists - support two million chronic patients and provide  medical  gases  and  related  services  to  20,000  hospitals and  new  care  facilities, as well as 140,000  healthcare professionals.

Home healthcare\n\nAs a leader in home healthcare in Europe (in number of patients supported), Air Liquide provides care in the home for people with chronic  diseases.  The  Group  provides  respiratory  and  perfusion assistance solutions (e.g. for diabetes or Parkinson's). Thanks to its  expert  multidisciplined  teams,  Air  Liquide  aims  to  increase patients'  autonomy  and  quality  of  life,  improve  their  treatment compliance and lower their risk of relapse or rehospitalization.\n\nThe Home Healthcare business is one of the responses to the shift to  outpatient  care  and  sits  at  the  heart  of  the  healthcare  system between the patient, hospital or other healthcare facilities, doctors, nurses, health insurance organizations, pharmacists and others. It supplies the services, products  and/or  medical  equipment necessary  to  start  treatment  at  the  patient's  home,  following  the medical prescription,  and  trains  patients  and  their  families  in  the proper  use  of  devices.  Air  Liquide  has  three  key  leverages;  its close human proximity to patients at home for nearly 40 years, its technical  knowledge  of  medical  devices  (whether  connected  or not),  and  its  innovative  strength,  particularly  in  digital  solutions. The Group therefore makes a major contribution to the continuum of  care  by  ensuring  regular  support  for  patients  with  chronic conditions. This activity requires focusing on what really matters to the patient to improve their quality of life. To this end, Air Liquide offers  personalized  support  plans,  providing  the  support  each patient needs when he or she needs it.\n\nAir  Liquide's  Home  Healthcare  business  strives  to  meet  these public  health  challenges  as  well  as  the  growing  constraints  on health spending in advanced economies, by avoiding hospitalization  and  developing  a  home  care  offer  using  digital monitoring in particular. In developing economies, Home Healthcare is growing in areas where health systems are being introduced.\n\n## THE ARIADE PROGRAM\n\nARIADE  aims  to  strengthen  the  autonomy  of  people  living  with type 1 and type 2 diabetes by developing differentiated offerings depending on the medical devices. Patients are asked to rate their treatment  experience  and  the  results  obtained  (PREMs  and PROMs) in order  to  demonstrate  the  value  of  the  support.  This support includes a wide range of services such as 24/7 technical support,  home  visits,  the  supply  of  consumables,  training modules, nutritional advice, etc.\n\n## 4.2.2.  Hospital businesses\n\nAir Liquide is one of the world leaders in medical gas production and distribution for hospitals and related services.\n\nWhether in emergency rooms, operating rooms, or intensive care units, Air Liquide's medical gases and associated services make it possible  to  provide  care,  alleviate  pain,  administer  anesthetics and  improve  respiratory  functions.  The  Group's  long-standing partnership with healthcare facilities and healthcare professionals and its expertise in the management of medical gases makes it possible  for Air  Liquide  to  continue  to  develop  a  wide  range  of products  and  services  to  enable  healthcare  teams  to  devote themselves fully to their medical mission with patients. The role of Air Liquide is to always be alongside its partners when they need it most. Today, the Group is going even further in its commitment:\n\n- \u25a0 by guaranteeing supply. In order for healthcare teams to have complete  confidence  in  the  availability  of  medical  gases,  Air Liquide is committed to providing unparalleled reliability of its medical gas supply chains to the point of use, in normal times and in times of crisis.  Supply  is  based  on  a  network  of  local plants  (Air  Separation  Units  (ASUs)  and  filling  plants)  and operational continuity plans. It also includes the 24/7 availability of technical and logistical resources in order to be able  to  react  in  the  event  of  an  emergency.  Technicians, drivers  and  operators  are  trained  and  qualified  to  guarantee the safety and quality of operations;\n- \u25a0 by simplifying the management and use of gases. Air Liquide supports  the  complete  management  of  medical  gases, combining  the  best  of  technology,  innovation,  expertise  and availability  of  its  teams,  so  that  caregivers  in  hospitals  can focus  on  what  they  do  best:  being  there  for  patients.  Air Liquide offers services such as 'Total Gas Management'  (TGM),  which  remains  permanently  at  the hospital in order to optimize the supply of medical gases and monitor  the  different  supply  parameters  so  that  the  hospital can function efficiently;\n- \u25a0 by  moving  towards  carbon  neutrality  by  2050.  Committed  to leading the way by investing in innovative solutions, Air Liquide defines  decarbonization  action  plans  and  roadmaps  in  the various geographies to ensure a reduction in carbon emissions related to medical gases from their production to their use. The Group also offers a range of low-carbon products (starting with liquid oxygen and nitrogen for hospitals) produced using 100% renewable electricity. Finally, Air Liquide supports hospitals to help them reduce their nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions or losses generated by pipe leaks.\n\nAir  Liquide  supports  the  transformation  of  hospital  care  and  the development  of  outpatient  care  with  a  significant  presence  in primary care and other care centers that serve as an alternative to hospitals.\n\n## 4.2.3.  Diversification of care settings\n\nAir Liquide is interested in new alternative care locations between the home and the hospital, because it makes it possible to offer a continuity of care to patients, especially severe ones. The Group is  already  operating  in  this  field  through  its  local  entities  in Germany, for example, with the therapy apartments model, in Italy with  nursing  care  for  patients  with  chronic  conditions,  and  in Poland,  with  a  facility  specializing  in  the  care  of  ventilated patients.\n\nAir Liquide's solutions are also dispensed by certain specialists in doctors' practices, in new care settings other than hospitals, and in retirement homes. Healthcare professionals such as ambulance attendants, general practitioners, dermatologists and dentists are local practitioners who play an essential role in caring for patients at  various  stages  in  their  continuum  of  care.  In  response  to changing  care  settings  and  healthcare  coordination  issues,  Air Liquide  provides  an  offering  tailored  to  their  specific  needs, particularly  in  terms  of  mobility,  ease  of  use  of  their  medical devices, and autonomy in monitoring their treatment.\n\n## 4.2.4.  Societal initiatives in healthcare\n\nOn March 23, 2021, as part of  its  new  sustainability  objectives, the  Group  reaffirmed  its  commitment  to  supporting  patients,  as defined  in  the  'Act  for  health,  by  caring  for  patients'  pillar  of  its ACT  sustainable  development  approach.  In  the  process,  the Group  demonstrates  how  it  is  shaping  the  transformation  of healthcare  worldwide,  through  its  businesses'  contribution  and collaboration with the healthcare ecosystem.",

The Group is committed to improving the quality of life of patients through actions to better understand and know them, listen  to  their  needs  and  feedback  and  strengthen  their  capacity and autonomy in managing their illness.\n\nThe Group is pursuing two sets of concrete measures to improve the care and outcomes that matter most to patients:\n\n- \u25a0 developing initiatives that are no longer only in partnership with patient associations, but above all focused on patients, i.e. that contribute effectively to improving their quality of life;\n- \u25a0 establish personalized support plans.\n\nTo  take  these  measures  further,  Air  Liquide  has  set  up  a  solid global organizational structure in 24 countries (mainly in Europe but also in the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Americas regions). It consists  of  a  multi-disciplinary  working  group  mandated  with building a strategic vision and overseeing the follow-up of action taken using appropriate monitoring indicators, and coordinating an international  champions  network  in  the  countries  responsible  for reporting on the actions.\n\n## Developing initiatives with and for patients\n\ni.e.  based  on  listening  to  the  voices  of  patients,  on  detailed knowledge of their needs and the strengthening of their capacities and  autonomy  so  that  these  initiatives  contribute  effectively  to improving their quality of life.\n\nThese  initiatives  cover  various  pathologies  such  as  diabetes, sleep apnea, Parkinson's disease and other respiratory diseases treated with oxygen and/or ventilation.\n\nSince 2021, Air Liquide's Home Healthcare entities developed 120 patient-centric initiatives, most of which in Europe:\n\n- \u25a0 in Sweden, as part of the development of a new personalized support plan for people living with type 1 diabetes, Nordicinfu Care  has  set  up  an  advisory  board  of  patients  who  may  be called  upon  in  different  ways  (participation  in  focus  groups, response to questionnaires) on topics related to understanding their quality of life, needs and difficulties. The results of these consultations  are  used  to  develop  the  content  of  the  support plan in a partnership of co-creation with patients;\n- \u25a0 in  Germany,  VitalAire  launched  an  advisory  committee  with people  living  with  type  1  diabetes  to  help  develop  home healthcare services and facilitate the daily lives of patients. As a  real  forum  for  dialog,  the  members  of  the  committee  are invited  to  share  their  feedback  on  the  services  and  medical devices made available and to discuss future developments in the treatment of diabetes.\n\n## Establishing personalized support plans\n\nPersonalized  support  plans  mean  that  healthcare  services  are defined based on results that really matter to patients, their health and  their  lifestyle,  and  on  expected  clinical  and  quality-of-life outcomes.\n\nTheses personalized support plans are the foundation of a 'ValueBased Healthcare' approach, to adapt the service to the needs of the patient and improve the outcomes for patients at the best cost for all.\n\nIn 2023, Air Liquide's Healthcare teams wanted to be even more ambitious by selecting only initiatives directly focused on patients,\n\n| Key indicator                                          | As of December 31, 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Percentage of patients with personalized support plans |                           |\n| (treatment adherence & outcome-based care)             | 55%                       |\n| Number of patients with personalized support plans     |                           |\n| (treatment adherence & outcome-based care)             | 1,085,000                 |\n\nAir Liquide has developed two different levels of personalization of the patient experience:\n\n- \u25a0 level  1,  personalization  based  on  data  from  the  medical equipment  provided  to  the  patient.  This  involves  regular monitoring of data from medical equipment (mainly usage data) and  then  adapting  our  service  when  the  results  are  not satisfactory in relation to the use of the equipment recommended for effective treatment. This level of personalized health  services  is  well  developed  in  countries  such  as  France and Spain for sleep apnea. The goal is to extend this level of personalization  to  various  target  countries  and  to  the  different diseases and therapies covered by the Healthcare businesses;\n\n- \u25a0 level 2, personalization based on clinical outcomes and patient quality  of  life.  This  involves  measuring  the  outcomes  that matter  to  patients  and  then  adapting  the  service  when  the outcomes  are  not satisfactory enough. This level of personalization involves understanding the needs and individual characteristics of each patient in order to offer them a  healthcare  service  adapted  to  their  profile  and  defined according to the expected clinical results and quality of life.\n\nAir  Liquide  started  implementing  this  Value-Based  Healthcare model in countries such as Spain and France in 2021, focusing on patients  with  sleep  apnea  and/or  receiving  ventilation  treatment. The  goal  is  to  steadily  develop  this  level  of  personalization  in other  countries  and  for  other  therapies.  Since  then,  pilots  using level 2 personalization have been launched in Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands, Korea, Australia and Brazil, now including a service for the treatment of diabetes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Patients with the most complex needs are identified to set up their personalized  support  plan  in  terms  of  the  frequency  of interactions, their nature (digital, home visits, etc.) and the nature of  the  information  exchanged.  This  program  goes  beyond  the standard service and aims to empower patients, simplify the work of  healthcare  professionals  and  reduce  complications  related  to the disease.\n\n## Improving access to medical oxygen in low- and middle-income countries\n\nAir Liquide intends to rely on its expertise in the supply of medical oxygen to increase access to oxygen for populations in low- and middle-income  countries.  The  Group  favors  initiatives  that  are sustainable in the long term and respect strict ethical guidelines.\n\nRespiratory  infections,  and  pneumonia  in  particular,  are  the leading  cause  of  death  in  children  under  five  in  developing economies.  Acute  phases  can  be  treated  with  antibiotics  and oxygen therapy.\n\nMore  generally,  improving  access  to  medical  oxygen  in  these countries  is  a  priority.  This  need  was  acutely  felt  during  the covid-19 crisis.\n\nThe Group has implemented an 'Access Oxygen' program since 2017, to ensure that rural and suburban populations in low- and middle-income countries have safe, reliable and affordable access to oxygen over the long term.\n\nTo set up a medical oxygen supply infrastructure, Air Liquide relies on:\n\n- \u25a0 Air  Liquide  teams,  which  support  the  rollout  of  the  Access Oxygen solution;\n- \u25a0 international  donors  or  Group  subsidiaries  that  finance  the necessary equipment;\n- \u25a0 local  entrepreneurs  who  implement  Access  Oxygen  in  the beneficiary healthcare structures.\n\nAccess Oxygen offers an oxygen therapy kit, a training program for healthcare personnel with the provision of digital tools (Access Oxygen  application  -  Oxygen  Academy  platform)  and  an equipment maintenance service.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2022,  to  better  structure  its  action  and  effectively support its partners, social entrepreneurs or international organizations,  the  Group  set  up  a  dedicated  subsidiary, Access Oxygen. It will contribute its know-how in the design and operation of adapted, safe, robust and sustainable oxygen solutions.\n\nIn 2023, the Group's teams continued to facilitate access to oxygen:\n\n| Key indicator of oxygen access                                     | As of December 31, 2022   | As of December 31, 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Estimate of the population benefiting from easier access to oxygen |                           |                           |\n| through Air Liquide's 'Access Oxygen' action                       | 1,778,000                 | 2,057,078                 |\n\nTo  this  end,  they  have  carried  out  or  developed  projects particularly in Kenya and South Africa:\n\n## FIRST PILOT PROJECT DEPLOYED IN KENYA\n\nIn July 2022, the NGO Center for Public Health and Development, a partner of Access Oxygen in Kenya, launched a first pilot in the country  with  five  health  facilities  in  the  Bungoma  region.  The financing covers equipment and service costs for a period of six months. In  2023,  the  pilot  was  extended  to  17  additional  health facilities in the Nairobi region, supported by a second funder.\n\nThanks to the rollout of this initial pilot, Air Liquide estimates that around  125,600  people  in  the  region  benefit  from  access  to medical oxygen.\n\n## PARTNERSHIP WITH UNJANI CLINICS IN SOUTH AFRICA\n\nUnjani  Clinics  is  a  network  of  primary  care  clinics  aimed  at improving access to healthcare for middle-class South Africans in rural  and  suburban  areas.  This  network  also  contributes  to  the national  program  for  the  emancipation  of  young  black  women. Unjani  Clinics  is  collaborating  with  VitalAire  South  Africa,  the Group's  Health  subsidiary,  to  extend  the  availability  of  medical oxygen to all clinics in the network, thanks to the 'Access Oxygen' offer.  VitalAire  provides  training  and  helps  increase  the  skills  of medical  personnel  working  with  oxygen  therapy  and  related equipment.  Air  Liquide  also  provides  part  of  the  equipment financing through its subsidiary in South Africa. The 164 clinics of the Unjani network are now equipped with the Access Oxygen kit, which  provides  close  access  to  oxygen  to  more  than  984,000 people in the country.",

        "page_content": "## EXTRA-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DECLARATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL REPORTING\n\nRelationship with stakeholders\n\n## COLLECTIVE ACTION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\n\nAir Liquide works with other players in the international community to support access to oxygen in low- and middle-income countries. Thus, Air  Liquide  is  part  of  the  'Every  Breath  Counts'  coalition, which regularly brings together those involved in oxygen access (NGOs,  lenders,  manufacturers,  service  providers,  etc.)  and contributes  to  its  work.  Air  Liquide  also  collaborates  with  the 'Access  to  Medicine  Foundation',  which  has  experience  in strategies  for  access  to  healthcare  products  in  the  poorest countries. In April 2023, it published its annual report for the first time on the commitment of the main medical oxygen suppliers to open up access to oxygen in low- and middle-income countries. Air  Liquide's  action  is  highlighted  in  this,  with  the  strong involvement  of  its  teams  during  the  covid-19  pandemic  and  the Access Oxygen program.\n\n## 4.3.   FROM LISTENING TO ACTION\n\nSince  2017,  the  Group  has  been  directed  toward  a  customercentric transformation,  boosted  by  a  customer  experience management tool called 'Voice of Customer' (VoC). This solution allows  all  entities  to  regularly  poll  (through  digital  channels)  an unlimited  number  of  customers,  analyze  their  comments  in  real time,  identify  dissatisfied  customers,  contact  them  and  take  the necessary steps to address the reasons for their dissatisfaction. Thanks to the broad sharing of customer comments at every level of  the  Group,  appropriate  action  plans  have  been  identified  and implemented  to  improve  their  experience.  To  date,  VoC  has already been rolled out in 60 Group subsidiaries worldwide.\n\nThe VoC survey is now available in two formats: an annual survey that  covers  all  stages  of  the  customer  experience  and  a  more frequent  transactional  survey  that  measures  satisfaction  at  a particular  stage:  offer,  order,  delivery,  invoicing,  technical  service, etc.  Their  feedback  tells  the  Group  that  its  customers  particularly appreciate the quality and safety of its products and services, and the professionalism and efficiency of the teams in contact with them.\n\nThe  annual  survey  also  allows  to  monitor  two  common  key performance  indicators  at  Group  level,  the  NPS  (Net  Promoter Score\u00ae)  and  the  ESG  (Environmental,  Social  and  Governance) score.  The  NPS  measures  customers'  intention  to  recommend using a simple question: 'On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend Air Liquide as a supplier?' Since the launch of the VoC surveys, Air Liquide has seen a steady improvement in this score across all business lines.\n\nThe  ESG  score  is  part  of  the  Group's  commitment  to  a sustainable future:  supporting  our  customers  and  patients,  while taking  into  account  the  urgency  of  climate  change  and  societal developments. With 50,000 responses collected, the ESG score reached 8.69 points out of 10 in 2023, an improvement over the 2022  results  (8.65  points).  Industrial  Merchant  customers  were asked  about  their  satisfaction  with  Air  Liquide's  contribution  to their  environmental  objectives  (reduction  of  the  environmental footprint,  CO2  emissions,  energy  efficiency).  In  the  Healthcare sector,  patients  and  healthcare  professionals  evaluated  Air Liquide's  ethical  and  responsible  behavior  and  its  respect  for safety regulations, in an area in which patient quality of life and contribution  to  the  effectiveness  of  healthcare  systems  are fundamental.\n\nIn addition to the indicators described above related to the Voice of Customer, other indicators are used to improve the experience provided to customers, in particular to smooth their pathway and reduce to zero all possible points of friction. It is recognized that the more fluid the experience, the lower the risk of the customer changing suppliers.\n\nAn excellent example is the 'Customer Effort Score' used in US operations,  which  consists  of  several  indicators  (up  to  10 individual  operational  indicators)  such  as  open  orders,  blocked invoices,  late  deliveries,  litigation  rate,  etc.  This  indicator  is  not linked  to  a  particular  customer  but  relates  to  a  geography  or  a business  and  is  used  to  assess  the  quality  of  Air  Liquide's activities.\n\nManagers use the indicator to easily identify the areas that create the  most  friction  and  the  opportunities  for  improvement,  so  that they may act accordingly.\n\n## SUCCESSFUL CUSTOMER COMMITMENT\n\n## 280,000\n\ncustomer/patient returns collected since 2017\n\n90% (a)\n\nsatisfied or very satisfied Air Liquide customers\n\n(a) Based on customer satisfaction survey feedback (89% in 2022).\n\nThanks to the feedback from customers and patients collected via VoC, several actions have been implemented at both Group level and locally in the entities to improve their experience.\n\nThus,  when Air  Liquide  France  was  notified  by  its  customers  of the  difficulty  in  finding  the  right  contact  person,  the  'Single Number'  project  was  launched:  from  more  than  25  telephone numbers  available  to  customers,  the  entity  switched  to  a  single number. The agents in charge of customer calls respond directly to approximately 70% of their requests and forward the remaining, more complex requests  to  specialists  for  immediate  processing. Another  example  of  a  project  guided  by  customers'  voices  is improving the invoicing process. Invoices have been digitized and simplified, dividing the number of possible rental ranges by four, facilitating  administrative  processing  and  payment.  Customer service is one of the essential pillars of customer experience. Air Liquide  has  decided  to  redeploy  a  training  course  that  aims  to solidify the fundamentals in all geographies, specifically targeting the Industrial Merchant teams. The 3C training makes it possible to frame in three actions - 'Connect - Counsel - Conclude' - the 20  best  behaviors  to  maintain  when  interacting  with  customers. This is an interactive training focused on concrete examples with many  scenarios.  It  is  provided  internally  by  local  'champions'. This approach not only allows Air Liquide to promote the skills of its  employees  but  also  to  ensure  continuous  and  sustainable monitoring. The 3C training aims to improve the experience of the Group's customers, but also of its employees by supporting them in working in a cooperative environment.\n\nAll these changes were implemented thanks to the commitment of Air  Liquide's  employees.  To  recognize  employees  who  deliver exceptional  customer experiences and the efforts made by both individuals  and  teams  to  serve  and  satisfy  customers  and patients, specific awards, known as 'Customer Mindset Awards', have  been  created  in  several  of  the  Group's  entities.  These events demonstrate how much the customer experience is a vital element at Air Liquide and highlight behaviors that create added value for its customers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Sustainable procurement and suppliers\n\nAir Liquide strives to build long-lasting and balanced relationships with  its  suppliers  in  an  environment  of  mutual  trust.  The  Group attaches great importance to its suppliers' ability to offer long-term partnerships  and  ensure  a  high  level  of  safety,  reliability, competitiveness,  and  innovation,  while  guaranteeing  that  ethics and sustainable development are also taken into account. These principles are set out in the following documents:\n\n- \u25a0 the Sustainable Procurement procedure ,  updated  in  2023, which lays out the guidelines to be applied by the Procurement Departments  to  integrate  ethical,  social  and  environmental aspects  into  their  procurement  processes,  and  defines  the prevention approach for related supplier risks;\n- \u25a0 the Procurement  Code  of  Conduct , available in 11 languages, is mandatory for all Group employees engaged in Procurement activities;\n- \u25a0 the Supplier's  Code  of  Conduct ,  updated  in  2023,  aims  to promote  and  ensure  that  all  suppliers  respect  human  rights, ethics, environmental protection and safety. It is based on the Group's Code of Conduct. The adherence of suppliers to the principles  inscribed  in  the  Supplier's  Code  of  Conduct  is  a prerequisite  to  all  commercial  relation  for  the  supply  of  Air Liquide.  The  revision  aims  to  align  it  with  new  regulatory expectations and changes in practices. In particular, it includes additional articles on conflict minerals and the whistleblowing system. This Code of Conduct is available on the Air Liquide website  (https://www.airliquide.com/sustainable-development/ sustainable-procurement). Translations are carried out according to local needs and made available gradually;\n- \u25a0 a CSR  commitment  clause (covering  compliance  with  the Supplier's  Code  of  Conduct,  safety,  and  the  environment)  is included  in  the  contract  templates  with  suppliers,  including those for framework agreements.\n\n## 5.1.   SUPPLIER MAPPING\n\nAs  part  of  its monitoring  process,  the  Group  maps  its Sustainability-Critical  Suppliers.  In  2023, Air  Liquide  changed  its methodology, retaining only three criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 annual spend;\n- \u25a0 the risk relating to the nature of the supplier's activity;\n- \u25a0 the risk relating to the supplier's country of operations.\n\nFrom 2023, the dependence of suppliers on Air Liquide has been removed  from  the  methodology  for  identifying  SustainabilityCritical  Suppliers.  This  criterion  constitutes  a  risk  individually taken  into  account  in  the  analysis  of  supplier  risks  during  their qualification  and  throughout  the  commercial  relationship,  in accordance  with  the  internal  supplier  relationship  and  risk management procedure.\n\nIn 2023, an evaluation and action plan campaign targeted 52% of the 1,076 suppliers identified as Sustainability-Critical Suppliers.\n\n361 suppliers were assessed. 98 suppliers needing improvement or  non-compliant  have  also  prepared  or  completed  corrective action plans.\n\nThe  actions  carried  out  as  part  of  this  assessment  campaign ensure that Sustainability-Critical Suppliers have systems in place to  avoid  environmental,  human  rights,  and  labor  risks  from occurring  in  their  supply  chain.  It  also  helps  guide  and  support suppliers in their continuous improvement on these issues.\n\n## 5.2.   'PROCURE TO NEUTRALITY', THE CLIMATE ROADMAP FOR PROCUREMENT\n\nIn  its  strategic  plan ADVANCE up to 2025, announced in March 2022,  Air  Liquide  reaffirmed  its  ambition  to  achieving  carbon neutrality  by  2050.  Procurement  has  a  key  role  to  play  in supporting  this  objective  throughout  the  supply  chain  of  the Group's businesses, in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 by supporting its suppliers in the decarbonization of the goods and services that the Group purchases;\n- \u25a0 by helping to reduce the Group's emissions;\n- \u25a0 by  contributing  to  the  development  of  low-carbon  solutions offered to its customers.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Group  Procurement  Department  initiated  a  climate roadmap, 'Procure to Neutrality' based on four pillars:\n\n- \u25a0 measure :  improve  the  greenhouse  gas  emission  calculation methodology (Scope 3), where relevant and feasible;\n- \u25a0 engage buyers, with the training of the procurement community; engage the suppliers of the Group identified based on the basis of a mapping as the most significant in terms of emissions;\n- \u25a0 leverage procurement's contributions to reducing Scopes 1, 2, and 3;\n- \u25a0 reduce :  define  an  objective,  with  the  aim  to  align  with  the Group's carbon neutrality ambitions.\n\nInternally, around 78% of the Procurement community has taken part  in  training  sessions  since  2022  on  key  concepts  for understanding  climate  issues,  carbon  accounting  methodologies and greenhouse gas emission reduction objectives. In addition, a specific  training  module  for  suppliers  was  launched  in  2023  to enable  them  to  commit  to  measurement  actions,  climate  and reduction  objectives.  In  2023,  45%  of  buyers  involved  followed this new module.\n\nIn 2022, Air Liquide launched an action with those of its suppliers most  exposed  to  risks  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Actions continued  in  2023  with  34  dedicated  meetings  organized  with suppliers to engage  them  to  undertake  actions  on  the measurement of emissions, climate objectives and the reduction of their impacts.\n\nIn addition, in 2023, Air Liquide contributed to the training module on Sustainable Procurement developed by Axa Climate School by sharing a business case study on its TCO2 tool. This tool allows the climate maturity of suppliers and CO2 emissions related to the manufacture,  transport  and  use  of  equipment  to  be  integrated. This module is integrated into the selection criteria for suppliers of strategic equipment.\n\n## 5.3.   REDUCING OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS\n\nThe  Group's  Procurement  organizations  strive  to  support  and develop  actions  to  reduce  the  environmental  impact  of  its activities. Numerous initiatives are led by the subsidiaries, such as waste  reduction  or  the  development  of  the  circular  economy. These initiatives  are  shared  throughout  the  Group  to  encourage replication. A few examples can be found below.",

        "page_content": "## Climate Fresk\n\nIn  2023,  training  initiatives  were  put  in  place  locally  to  raise awareness and bring teams together around sustainability topics. In  October,  Air  Liquide  Healthcare  International  Services  and Technology  created  a  team  building  event  around  the  Climate Fresk  bringing  together  30  people  from  different  functions including buyers, engineers and analysts. Collective actions were put in place to strengthen team spirit on shared and sustainable goals for 2024, such as making the train the first choice for travel in  Europe  for  all  supply  business  trips  of  less  than  5  hours  per journey.\n\nOther  similar  initiatives  have  been  carried  out  since  2022  with Climate  Frescoes  held  for  the  Group  Procurement  Department and the Indirect Procurement teams.\n\n## New, more durable paint\n\nIn Brazil, as part of a call for tenders to open up competition for the supply of paint for cylinders, Air Liquide worked to develop a new supplier. This made it possible to approve a quality paint and switch  from  a  solvent-based  solution  to  a  water-based  synthetic enamel.\n\nThis  represents  a  number  of  ecological  advantages.  The  main feature of water-based inks is that they use water to deposit the colorant on the substrate. This avoids the use of polluting solvents and associated CO2 emissions\n\nThe change also improves working conditions and living space, by reducing the use of products that cause allergies or headaches.\n\nThis  project  won  a  GYM Award  in  the  Responsible  Purchasing category.\n\n## Clean Fleet Europe - Light vehicles\n\nThe European Clean Fleet project was launched in March 2023 with the aim of decarbonizing the car fleet, and more specifically so-called 'light' vehicles. This cross-functional project addresses the  issue  of  decarbonization  through  a  number  of  criteria  and levers:\n\n- \u25a0 reducing  the  carbon  footprint,  by  converting  commercial vehicles to electric vehicles where use permits;\n- \u25a0 introducing  a  CO2  emissions  cap  of  130g/km  for  petrol  and non-rechargeable hybrid vehicles;\n- \u25a0 optimising the size of the vehicle fleet, by reviewing the rules governing eligibility for a vehicle.\n\nA target of 25% conversion to electric vehicles by 2027 has been set for France, which accounts for 50% of the European fleet.\n\nTo  achieve  this  target,  arrangements  have  been  put  in  place  to facilitate the installation of charging points at employees' homes. A  new  vehicle  catalogue  has  been  implemented,  including  a reduction in the size of vehicles to reduce fuel consumption, the elimination of diesel engines and the switch to non-rechargeable petrol  hybrid  vehicles  when  use  does  not  allow  a  switch  to electric.\n\nOther  European  countries  have  already  defined  transition ambitions  from  2023,  which  will  apply  to  all  renewals  and  new orders  for  light  vehicles,  or  are  in  the  process  of  defining  a strategy for 2024.\n\nGermany, Austria, Benelux & Switzerland have begun converting their fleets, with a target of 100% of renewals.\n\n## 5.4.   PROCUREMENT RESILIENCE\n\nManaging the risk of supply chain disruption continues to top the list  of  priorities  for  benefits  sought  from  purchases.  With  the resurgence  of  geopolitical  risks,  it  is  essential  to  strengthen  the resilience  of  Air  Liquide's  supply  chain.  This  resilience  -  an organization's ability to recover quickly from difficulties is essential to  ensure  the  continuity  of  operations  and  deliveries  to  patients and customers.\n\nSince 2022, a framework has been in place and shared with all geographies to strengthen the resilience of the supply chain of Air Liquide.  Its  principle  is  to  provide  visibility  across  the  Group's entire supply chain, to introduce agility, in particular to qualify new suppliers, to strengthen collaboration with Operations and to have a  system  of  control.  For  example,  on  the  subject  of  geopolitical risk,  an  analysis  was  carried  out  on  the  number  of  suppliers located  in  countries  at  risk,  who  specifically  serve  Air  Liquide's activities  in  these  countries,  and  those  who  serve  it  in  other geographies. Based on this analysis, the Group quantified the risk and action plans.\n\nThis  process  is  currently  being  merged  with  the  Group's  risk mapping process, which not only concerns supply chain risks but all types of risks and which all subsidiaries apply once a year.\n\n## 5.5.   SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT TRAINING AND AWARENESS\n\nSeveral  measures  have  been  implemented  to  raise  awareness and train buyers in the Group's Sustainable Procurement process, thus strengthening its rollout within the organization. Sustainable Procurement  training  modules  have  been  developed.  They  are aimed  at  Group's  entire  Purchasing  population  and  for  critical suppliers, and serve to:\n\n- \u25a0 show  the  consistency  between  the  Sustainable  Procurement approach and the Group's strategy;\n- \u25a0 explain  the  challenges  of  the  Sustainable  Procurement approach and position it as a source of value creation;\n- \u25a0 present various tools to facilitate the roll-out of this approach.\n\nIn 2023, Air Liquide organized training sessions in French, English and Chinese to raise awareness among buyers and suppliers of the  Group's  Sustainable  Procurement.  Training  courses  are organized by subject and by geography.\n\nA total of 827 employees from the procurement community were trained in 2023 on topics related to sustainability and climate.\n\n## 5.6.   SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT FOR ALL\n\nEach year, in France, Air Liquide organizes a 'Forum des Achats Inclusifs'  (Inclusive  Procurement  Forum),  bringing  together  Air Liquide's  specifiers  and  companies  in  the  disability  sector  to promote purchases from them. In 2023, this event, co-hosted with the Handeco association, was conducted in a digital and face-toface format through a round table and testimonials. More than 200 Air Liquide employees took part in this event.\n\nFor the third time, another event related to inclusive procurement, the  'Inclusive  Procurement  European  Forum',  was  organized  in 2023 by Air Liquide. Nearly 200 participants - from operations and procurement,  as  well  as  suppliers  -  attended  the  meeting  and round  table  with  the  Group  Chief  Procurement  Officer  and  the Europe Procurement Officer\n\nThese two events are detailed in the EFPD section of the present Chapter 5 - page 348.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Relations with civil society: fundamental research, access to employment, solidarity\n\nThe Group is present in 72 countries (1) ,  because  its  production and distribution activities are local. Many years ago, long before defining its sustainable development strategy, the Group decided to act in the regions because it believes that it should participate in  the  economies  of  the  countries  in  which  it  operates,  and  go further  than  the  conduct  of  its  activities.  The  Group,  therefore, carries out various acts to support local populations.\n\nTo  do  this,  it  has  several  means  of  action:  its  Corporate Foundation, which spearheads its charitable actions, and its local subsidiaries or specific projects, such as Access Oxygen.\n\n## 6.1.   THE AIR LIQUIDE FOUNDATION\n\nCreated in 2008, the Air Liquide Foundation works with the Group to carry out missions of general interest. It relies on the Group's teams and skills to support projects of public interest, fundamental research,  access  to  employment,  local  solidarity  or  exceptional initiatives. The  Foundation  is  subject  to  French  law  on foundations. In 2023, the Foundation renewed its fourth mandate until 2027.\n\nThe  Foundation  works  in  the  general  interest,  within  the framework  defined  by  the  law  and  its  articles  of  association,  in accordance  with  its  purpose.  It  shall  not  serve  the  Group's\n\n## 6.1.1.

The Group acts on the ground, as closely as possible to the beneficiaries, thanks to its local teams who  support the associations in their projects and get involved to help beneficiaries, for example, by volunteering  (tutoring, CV writing, language lessons, etc.). |\n\n## 6.1.3. The role of employees in the fondation\n\nEmployees  play  a  major  role  within  the  Foundation.  The  very origin  of  the  Air  Liquide  Foundation  is  based  on  the  direct involvement  of  employees.  This  is  still  one  of  its  distinctive characteristics today. First of all, Group employees participate in the  governance of the Foundation (Board of Directors, Scientific Committee,  Regional  Committee).  However,  their  involvement goes well beyond governance missions.\n\nEmployees  can  all  propose  projects  to  support.  Each  project  is studied  by  a  Manager  who  will  then  ensure  the  monitoring  and final assessment.\n\nIn  the  specific  case  of  scientific  projects,  the  Group's  medical experts,  researchers  at  the  Group's  Research  Center  or  the Group's doctors are involved. They assess and monitor scientific\n\nprojects.  For  projects  in  the  regions,  support  is  provided  by employees who work close to these projects.\n\nOverall, organizations supported by the Foundation will be able to benefit from employees' professional skills. Regarding professional  integration,  the  Foundation's  partnership  with  local Air  Liquide  teams  also  means  that  young  people  without  a network  of  contacts  can  visit  sites,  learn  more  about  technical professions, take up internship offers or talk to sector professionals.\n\nTo  date,  hundreds  of  employees  have  been  involved  in  these actions.  Finally,  many  European  employees  are  involved  in projects  to  support  Ukrainian  refugees,  notably  through  the 'Citizen at Work' program.",

'Shareholder' and 'employee' donors\n\nMany  Air  Liquide  shareholders  and  employees  also  provide financial support to the Group's societal action, through donations to the Air Liquide Foundation. Two initial fundraising events took place in 2021 and then in March 2022 as part of the exceptional program for Ukraine's refugees in Europe.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2023,  the  Foundation  suggested  they  once  again join  in  the  financial  support  of  its  projects  by  raising  funds  to promote  access  to  employment,  through  a  donation  platform. Shareholders and employees responded to this call, contributing more than 35,000 euros, which will be used for projects promoting access to employment from 2024.\n\n## 6.2.   OTHER PROGRAMS CARRIED OUT BY SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## CITIZEN AT WORK PROGRAM\n\nAs part of the ADVANCE program, the Group launched the Citizen at Work initiative in 2022 to enable its employees to actively serve their  local  communities.  This  program  is  gradually  rolling  out across the entire Group to reach 100% of entities by 2025. At the end of 2023, 73% of Group employees already had access to this program. The Citizen at Work program is detailed in the EFPD page 345.\n\nAirgas is the Group's Industrial Merchant subsidiary in the United States.  This  subsidiary  has  a  strong  presence  throughout  the country and it is strongly committed to local communities.\n\nThe Airgas High School Welding Education initiative had another successful  year  in  2023,  supporting  nearly  4,000  students,  i.e. almost as many students as the previous four years combined! An impressive 808 students from the class of 2023 have obtained a job  in  the  field  of  welding  after  graduating  from  high  school, bringing  the  total  number  to  1,071  jobs  since  Airgas  started  to follow this initiative in 2021.\n\nThroughout 2023, Airgas made donations to communities in need as  part  of  the  Citizen  at  Work  program.  As  one  of  the  largest suppliers of safety products in the United States, Airgas donated nearly  2  million  US  dollars  of  PPE  (Personal  Protective Equipment) to emergency preparedness organizations, for use in response to emergencies or natural disasters such as forest fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes and floods across the country. In the wake of the Maui fires in Hawaii, Airgas also donated more\n\nthan 50,000 US dollars in cash and products to affected Hawaiian communities to help them with their reconstruction efforts.\n\nIn  South  Korea,  Air  Liquide  has  set  up  a  student  sponsorship program,  called  ALtogether,  for  four  consecutive  years,  in partnership with JUMP, a local non-profit association that aims to reduce  inequalities  in  education.  In  2023,  Air  Liquide  Korea successfully  concluded  the  program  with  15  employee  mentors from  all  AL  entities  in  Korea,  who  provided  students  with  their valuable  experience.  Among  the  achievements,  15  mentored students and 69 teenagers benefited from 2,700 hours of lessons.\n\nOn Taiwan island, Air Liquide Far Eastern is committed to raising its  employees'  awareness  of  sustainable  development  through various  activities  in  collaboration  with  local  communities.  These included  Climate  Fresco  workshops  and  presentations  on sustainable development covering ecological conservation, environmental protection, the recycling of plastics and sustainable development initiatives by Air Liquide Far Eastern.\n\nAt the same time, Air Liquide Far Eastern forged partnerships with its  customers  to  promote  its  expertise  in  the  field  of  safety  and gases.  This  led  to  the  implementation  of  a  bi-weekly  safety education program in an elementary school in Hsinchu. Over 65 employees participate in this each year, sharing their passion for education  and  professional  knowledge  to  spark  an  interest  in science among students and raise their awareness of safety.\n\nAir  Liquide's  subsidiaries  carried  out  many  other  initiatives  in 2023,  covering  a  wide  range  of  topics  and  geographies:  Air Liquide Singapore organized projects related to aging well, while Air  Liquide  Korea  worked  on  educational  initiatives  relating  to science  for  elementary  schools.  Finally,  in  China,  Air  Liquide subsidiaries made donations to support initiatives such as planting trees and restoration of habitats, and launched an initiative to train Air Liquide employees wishing to qualify as first aiders.\n\nIn  addition  to  their  activities  in  local  communities,  Air  Liquide subsidiaries  also  contribute  to  the  common  good  through donations. In 2023, the cumulative amount of these donations is approximately 5 million euros (2) .\n\n## 6.3.   THE ACCESS OXYGEN PROGRAM\n\nDeployed  by  Air  Liquide  since  2017,  Access  Oxygen  is  an innovative  oxygen  therapy  solution  adapted  to  the  rural  health structures  in  low-  and  middle-income  countries.  This  program  is part of the Air Liquide Group's sustainability objectives announced in 2021. The Access Oxygen program is detailed in this section page 382.\n\n## 7.   Relations with the public sphere\n\nAir  Liquide  actively  contributes  to  the  discussions,  consultations and  work  of  public  authorities  as  well  as  with  professional associations, think tanks and NGOs (non-governmental organizations), in the Group's areas of expertise.\n\nAir  Liquide  produced  and  published  a  Public  Affairs  Charter  in 2021 governing the Group's interactions with public authorities at the national, regional/European and international levels in order to stay ahead of risks related to regulatory changes, identify growth opportunities,  and  involve  Air  Liquide  in  the  public  debate  on sectors in which the Group has a legitimate interest. This policy\n\n(2)\n\nspecifies  that  the  Group  will  work  with  stakeholders  in  a constructive  and  transparent  manner,  following  ethical  rules  and respecting political neutrality. All action is conducted in accordance with guidelines on interest representation. Accordingly,  Air  Liquide  is  listed  (voluntarily  since  2011)  in  the 'Transparency  Register'  of  European  institutions,  in  the  French 'Interest Representatives' register, created in 2017 and managed by  the  High  Authority  of  Transparency  in  Public  Life  (Haute Autorit\u00e9 pour la Transparence de la Vie Publique - HATVP), and in the Lobbying Disclosure Act database of the U.S. Congress.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The task of these managers is to monitor public  initiatives  liable  to  impact  the  Group,  and  to  arrange interactions  with  local  and/or  regional  authorities  to  defend  Air Liquide's interests or promote our climate and healthcare system solutions.  This  network  allows  the  Group  to  work  on  the consistency of the positions expressed on cross-functional issues such  as  the  energy  transition,  the  circular  economy,  health  and innovation in the various parts of the world.\n\nIt should also be noted that the Group ensures it maintains a good relationship  with  its  respective  local  tax  authorities  and  is committed to paying taxes in all its countries of operation.\n\nAir  Liquide's  Public  Affairs  policy  also  aims  to  establish  and develop constructive and sustainable relationships, in Air Liquide's various sectors of operation, with:\n\n- \u25a0 public authorities;\n- \u25a0 professional  bodies  which  represent  the  Group's  industry sectors;\n- \u25a0 other actors such as NGOs and think tanks.\n\nThese  interactions  can  take  place  either  directly  or  through professional  bodies  such  as  the  World  Hydrogen  Council,  the European  Industrial  Gases  Association  (EIGA),  the  European Round  Table  of  Industrialists  (ERT)  and  France  Hydrog\u00e8ne.  Air Liquide asks all its professional organizations to explicitly support the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\n\nSince December 2021, the Air Liquide Public Affairs Charter has been available  on  the  Group's  website  and  can  be  downloaded from the page: https://www.airliquide.com/en/shareholders/ investors-analysts/documents-presentations. In 2023, this Charter was  updated  with  the  release  of  the  Group  positions  on  some issues  related  to  the  energy  transition.  Some  examples  of engagement  with  policymakers  were  also  listed  to  illustrate  the support to these positions in some key geographies.\n\nSince 2022, Air Liquide carries out a periodic review of the main professional  organizations  of  which  it  is  a  member,  including analyses and assessments of the alignment of their positions with the Group's  decarbonization  objectives, as well as their commitment to supporting the Paris Agreement. This review, the\n\nreview  process  and  actions  identified,  are  available  on  the website: https://www.airliquide.com/sustainable-development/ engagement-public-stakeholders. This review was largely expanded  in  2023  with  the  inclusion  of  new  geographies  in  its scope: Australia, China, Germany, Japan, Korea, South-Africa.\n\nPublic projects or events in which the Group participated in 2023 include:\n\n- \u25a0 in France:\n- -the green industry law,\n- -contribution  to  the  discussions  of  the  French  strategy  for decarbonization  of  industry,  in  particular  with  carbon capture & storage (CCS) and the decarbonization of the 50 industrial sites with the highest CO2 emissions,\n- -implementation of mechanisms to support the development of the hydrogen sector: for the production of renewable and low-carbon  hydrogen,  as  well  as  distribution  for  the  lowcarbon mobility market,\n- -contribution  to  the  discussions  of  the  French  public authorities on the update of the French hydrogen strategy with, in particular, the role of imports in relation to the local production of hydrogen,\n- -promotion of the Group's space activities,\n- -the transformation of its home healthcare delivery model, to create  collaborative  approaches  that  will  significantly improve patient benefits, by connecting all stakeholders in the  care  pathway.  In  doing  so,  Air  Liquide  takes  part  in debates  relating  to  the  management  of  pathologies  at home,  for  example,  by  contributing  to  the  production  of qualitative  data  on  the  management  of  diabetes  or  sleep apnea  at  home,  providing  its  support  to  the  General Conference  on  Respiratory  Health  or  contributing  to  the reports of the Institut Montaigne,\n- -Air  Liquide  is  committed  to  working  alongside  patients, healthcare  professionals  and  hospitals  to  make  the healthcare  system  efficient  and  beneficial  for  everyone. Keen  to  place  the  patient  at  the  heart  of  everything  he does, the Group takes an active role in enabling healthcare systems  to  increase  the  value  of  care.  To  do  this,  Air Liquide actively participates in the national and international 'value in health' ecosystem, as partners of the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) and the Chair of Value in Health of the Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9.\n- \u25a0 in Europe:\n- -the European Commission's public consultations,\n- -contributions to the various industrial alliances initiated by the European Commission (hydrogen, aeronautics, space, semiconductors, biogas) and to the Commission's group of experts in the field of energy and on policies and programs related  to  the  EU's  space,  defense  and  aeronautics industries,\n- -participation in Innovation Fund calls for tenders and major projects of common European interest,\n- -support  for  the  initiatives  of  the  International  Diabetes Forum  to  promote  awareness  at  European  level  of  the challenges  related  to  the  disease  and  encourage  the mobilization of the Member States of the Union to improve its management.\n- \u25a0 in the United States:\n- -public  consultations  and  discussions  with  the  Treasury Department  on  the  rules  for  applying  the  CHIPS  and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, in particular,\n- -participation in the regional hydrogen  hubs  (Clean Hydrogen Hubs) of the Department of Energy (DoE),\n- -contributions  to  the  implementation  of  local  regulations  in the  field  of  energy  transition  in  the  main  countries  where the  Group  is  active  (in  particular  California,  Texas  and Nevada).",

        "page_content": "## 8.   Sustainable finance\n\n## 8.1.   OVERVIEW\n\nAfter  issuance  by  Air  Liquide  in  2012  of  the  first  Socially Responsible Investment-certified bond (500 million euros, refinancing the acquisitions of Gasmedi and LVL M\u00e9dical) in the Home Healthcare sector, the financial sector has made significant progress in terms of Sustainable Development.\n\nThe  Paris  Agreement  signed  in  2015,  and  more  recently  the European Taxonomy,  encourage  investors  and  lenders  to  direct their  capital  towards  sustainable  assets  by  placing  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) criteria at the heart of their investment decision strategy. Issuers are encouraged to use financing linked to CSR criteria. Sustainable financial instruments now represent a significant  share  of  all  bond  market  issues,  a  share  that  is expected to increase in the coming years.\n\nThere are currently two main sustainable financing mechanisms:\n\n- \u25a0 credit  lines,  bonds  and  loans  backed  by  extra-financial performance indicators ('KPIs'), for which the funds raised are not dedicated to specific investments or expenses but whose cost depends on the achievement of these KPIs;\n- \u25a0 'Green',  'Social'  and  'Sustainable'  bonds  or  loans,  in  which the funds raised are dedicated to specific projects.\n\nNon-governmental organizations such as the International Capital Market  Association  (ICMA)  have  also  published  guidelines  to ensure  the  transparency  and  credibility  of  the  developing  CSR financial market.\n\n## 8.2.   INITIATIVES\n\nAs  part  of  its  growth  strategy  combining  financial  and  extrafinancial  performance,  in  March  2021,  Air  Liquide  presented objectives  for ACT  in  favor  of  a  sustainable  future. Air  Liquide's responsible  and  sustainable  growth  model  also  applies  to  its financial  policy.  The  Group  is  thus  turning  to  the  opportunities offered by the finance market by acquiring new responsible and sustainable financial instruments.\n\n## 8.2.1.  Alignment of the syndicated credit line with three CSR objectives (2019)\n\nIn December 2019, the Group introduced a mechanism in its 2.5 billion euro syndicated credit line aimed at correlating the costs of this  credit  line  with  three  of  its  CSR  objectives  in  the  fields  of carbon  intensity,  gender  diversity,  and  safety.  This  indexation mechanism  consists  of  an  increase  or  decrease  in  the  cost  of financing and commissions paid according to the achievement of objectives set annually for each criterion.\n\nThe  environmental  and  societal  performance  criteria  are  as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group's carbon intensity;\n- \u25a0 the proportion of women among engineers and executives;\n- \u25a0 the frequency rate of accidents resulting in lost time.\n\nSince  the  implementation  of  this  correlation  mechanism,  Air Liquide  benefited  from  a  reduction  in  the  cost  of  its  syndicated credit line in 2020 and 2021, thanks to the achievement of these three  CSR  objectives.  In  2022,  only  two  CSR  objectives  were\n\nachieved; this result was largely expected by the Group, given the acquisition of Sasol's Air Separation Units in South Africa on June 24, 2021.\n\n## 8.2.2.  Implementation of a Sustainable Financing Framework and first green bond (2021)\n\nFollowing  the  announcement  of  its  sustainability  objectives  in March  2021,  Air  Liquide  also  implemented  a  Sustainable Financing  Framework  in  May  2021.  This  framework  makes  it possible  to  support  the  financing  and  refinancing  of  assets  and projects intended to have a clear benefit for the environment and society.  It  is  aligned  with  the  'Sustainability  Bond  Guidelines 2018',  'Green  Bond  Principles  2018',  'Social  Bond  Principles 2020',  'Social  Loan  Principles  2021'  and  the  'Green  Loan Principles  2021'  overseen  by  the  ICMA  (International  Capital Market Association), and validated by the Sustainalytics agency.\n\nThis initiative reflects a threefold ambition for the Group:\n\n- \u25a0 align its financing strategy with its sustainability objectives;\n- \u25a0 contribute to the development of sustainable finance;\n- \u25a0 diversify its investor base.\n\nThis responsible and sustainable financing framework enables the Group to  raise  funds  through  bond  issues,  loans  and  any  other instrument dedicated to financing sustainable projects.\n\nMoreover, as part of this 'Sustainable Financing Framework', the Group completed its first green bond issue in May 2021, raising 500  million  euros  to  finance  and  refinance  several  sustainable development  projects,  most  notably  in  hydrogen,  biogas  and oxygen.\n\n## 8.2.3.  Signing of a green financing loan for low-carbon hydrogen production (2023)\n\nWithin the context of its project to build two low-carbon hydrogen production  units  and  related  infrastructure,  Shanghai  Chemical Industry Park Industrial Gases Co., Ltd (SCIPIG), a subsidiary of the Group Air Liquide, signed a bilateral green loan for 500 million RMB (68  million  euros  equivalent)  with  a  banking  partner.  This green  loan  follows  the  China-EU  Common  Ground  Taxonomy, with  stringent  criteria  on  hydrogen  production  and  an  emission threshold for the definition of low-carbon hydrogen.\n\nIt is the first green loan worldwide to support low-carbon hydrogen production in alignment with the new China-EU Common Ground Taxonomy.\n\nFinally,  as  part  of  the  management  of  its  cash  surpluses,  Air Liquide  now  favors  sustainable  investment  vehicles,  such  as Socially  Responsible  Investment  (SRI)  certified  funds  or  funds likely  to  promote  environmental and social characteristics. While this  allocation  does  not  currently  apply  to  the  majority  of  its investments,  the  Group  intends  to  support  market  dynamics  by relying on a growing range of investment vehicles eligible under Articles  8  and  9  of  Regulation  (EU)  2019/2088  on  sustainable development disclosures  in  the  financial  services  sector  (known as the 'Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation').\n\n<!-- image -->",

LIST OF PRODUCTION UNITS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT\n\nThe environmental indicators that are most representative of the Group's activities and part of Air Liquide's Sustainable Development reporting are described below. They cover a total of 678 Air Liquide production units worldwide.\n\n| Type of  production units                             |   Number  of production  units | Applications and environmental footprint                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Large Air  Separation Units  (ASUs)                   |                            449 | Large Air Separation Units produce oxygen, nitrogen and argon, with some sites also producing  rare gases such as krypton and xenon. These plants 'without chimneys' do not use any combustion processes. They are particularly  environmentally friendly, as they emit no CO2, sulfur oxide (SOx), or nitrogen oxide (NOx). They use electricity almost exclusively: worldwide they use around 4,800 MW equivalent at any  given moment. The electricity purchased from our energy suppliers and consumed by the Air  Separation Units is the source of indirect emissions (Scope 2). The cooling systems of these                      |\n| Hydrogen  and carbon  monoxide units  (HyCO)          |                             57 | Large hydrogen and carbon monoxide production units also produce steam for some customers.  The raw material used is primarily natural gas and a quantity of water required for the reaction  that produces hydrogen. Carbon monoxide is an essential raw material in the chemical industry  for producing plastics. The desulfurization of hydrocarbons to produce fuels with reduced sulfur  content is one of the main applications of hydrogen. These units emit CO2 and nitrogen oxides  (NOx),  but  virtually  no  sulfur  oxides  (SOx).  They  also  consume  electricity  and  their  cooling  circuits require back-up water. |\n| Cogeneration units                                    |                             15 | Cogeneration  units  produce  steam  and  electricity  simultaneously.  They  consume  natural  gas  and  water,  mostly  converted  into  steam  and  supplied  to  customers.  The  steam  can  be  condensed  at  these  customers'  facilities  and  then  reused  in  the  cogeneration  unit.  In  most  cases, the electricity produced is supplied to the local electricity distribution network, which in  some  countries  can  be  used  to  power  the  Group's  other  units.  Combustion  of  natural  gas  produces  CO2  and  leads  to  low  nitrogen  oxide  (NOx)  emissions,  but  virtually  no  sulfur  oxide      |\n| Acetylene units                                       |                             52 | These units produce acetylene, a gas primarily used in metal welding and cutting. 50 of these  units produce this gas through the decomposition of a solid (calcium carbide) using water. Two  units fill cylinders with this gas, which is supplied by another industrial company. This process  produces  lime,  at  least  90%  of  which  tends  to  be  recycled  in  industrial  and  agricultural  applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Nitrous oxide units                                   |                              9 | Nitrous  oxide  is  used  primarily  as  an  anesthetic  gas  in  the  healthcare  sector  and  as  a  sweetening agent in the food industry. It is produced from ammonium nitrate in solid form or as a  water-based solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Carbon dioxide  liquefaction and  purification units  |                             61 | These units liquefy and purify carbon dioxide, which has many industrial applications, especially  in the food industry, where it is used to deep-freeze foods or produce carbonated beverages. Carbon dioxide is most often a by-product of chemical units operated by other manufacturers. In  certain cases, it is found naturally in underground deposits. In other cases, it comes from the Group's hydrogen and carbon monoxide units. It is purified and  liquefied  in  Air  Liquide  units  consuming  electricity  and  cooling  water.  Carbon  dioxide  is  thus                                                             |\n| Production units  for Specialty  Ingredients business |                              5 | These  production  units  for  Specialty  Ingredients  business  are  located  in  France,  China  and  United-States  and  belong  to  Seppic  (Specialty  Ingredients  business).  These  units  consume  natural gas, electricity and water. Combustion of natural gas produces small amounts of CO2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Engineering &  Construction units                     |                              4 | Units  for  the  Engineering  &  Construction  business  taken  into  account  in  this  reporting  are  located at five sites in France, China and the United Arab Emirates. They are mainly used for the  construction of air separation columns and cryogenic tanks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Biogas units                                          |                             26 | These units process waste to produce biogas, a renewable energy source. Biogas is produced  during  the  methanization  of  biomass:  household  waste,  industrial  and  agricultural  waste  and  sewage  sludge. Air  Liquide  is  aware  of  the  potential  of  this  process  in  terms  of  the  energy  transition and is therefore working on global solutions dedicated to the valorization of biogas and  which meet the needs of farmers, waste treatment managers and the agro-industry.                                                                                                                                    |",

The decrease is due to lower-than-anticipated oxygen production in South Africa, lower volumes in Japan,  and  maintenance  of  high-capacity  units  in  China  and  the  USA.  The  Group  has  continued  to  increase  its  voluntary  supply  of renewable electricity. However, the resulting drop in CO2 emissions was largely offset by an increase in emissions factors for the share of electricity consumed on the power grid.\n\nOver 80% of the Group's direct emissions are in Europe and the Americas, due to cogeneration units and hydrogen production capacity.\n\nIndirect emissions are mostly linked to installed capacity of air gases production in the various regions and to the electricity mix of the local grid. The importance of coal-based power generation in Asia and South Africa explains the relative importance of Scope 2 emissions in these regions, which account for over 70% of the Group's indirect emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Scope 3\n\nScope 3 emissions correspond to Air Liquide's indirect emissions from its value chain (outside of Scope 2 emissions) and are separated into 15 different categories that can be split between the upstream and the downstream of the value chain.\n\n| Scope 3 categories  (a)                                      | 2022 (in thousands of tonnes CO \u2082 -eq.)   | 2023 (in thousands of tonnes CO \u2082 -eq.)   |    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----|\n| 1 - Purchased goods and services                             | 3,161                                     | 3,057                                     | *  |\n| 2 - Capital goods                                            | 1,035                                     | 1,017                                     | *  |\n| 3 - Energy (not included Scope 1 or 2)                       | 8,749                                     | 8,467                                     | *  |\n| 4 - Upstream transportation and  distribution                | 541                                       | 489                                       | *  |\n| 6 - Business travel                                          | 49                                        | 71                                        | *  |\n| 7 - Employee commuting                                       | 73                                        | 73                                        | *  |\n| 10-11 - Processing and use of sold  products  (b)            | 7,282                                     | 5,985                                     | *  |\n| 13 - Downstream leased assets                                | 1,244                                     | 1,916                                     | *  |\n| TOTAL SCOPE 3 EMISSIONS  (in thousands of tonnes of CO2-eq.) | 22,134                                    | 21,075                                    | *  |\n\nAir Liquide's Scope 3 emissions are mainly linked to (i) category 3, which includes upstream emissions linked to natural gas and other energy materials used by the Group as raw materials or energy sources, as well as indirect emissions linked to electricity purchases not included in Scope 2, all reported in category 3, and (ii) the use of products sold, mainly CO2 and N2O reported in category 11.\n\nCategory 3 is virtually stable in 2023 compared with 2022, due to slightly lower electricity consumption. Category 11 is also stable in 2023 compared with 2022.\n\nThe increase in category 13 emissions is due to inclusion of units for which the Group has estimated average annual emissions for the first time in 2023. It should be noted that for these units, energy is supplied by the customers, who do not communicate the relevant data.\n\n## 1.2.3.  Reporting of emissions avoided\n\n|                                                                                                 | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   |   2022 |   2023 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Emissions avoided due to the optimization of our assets  (in millions of tonnes)                | 4.6    | 3.6    | 3.3    |    3.2 |    4   |\n| Emissions avoided to improve our customers' energy footprint  (in millions of tonnes)           | 12.2   | 11.2   | 11.8   |   10.1 |    8.2 |\n| TOTAL AVOIDED EMISSIONS  (in millions of tonnes) (a)                                            | 16.8   | 14.8   | 15.1   |   13.3 |   12.2 |\n| Emissions avoided due to the use of hydrogen for fuels desulfurization  (in millions of tonnes) |        |        |        |   64.1 |   64.9 |\n| TOTAL AVOIDED EMISSIONS INCLUDING END USES  (in millions of tonnes)                             |        |        |        |   77.4 |   77.1 |\n\nEmissions reductions delivered to the Group's customers are lower than those of 2022, mainly due to a reduction in the supply of oxygen for oxy-combustion in certain steel markets.\n\nBased on other methodological approaches that consider the reduction of black carbon emissions through the use of ultra-low sulfur fuels, and by attributing these avoided emissions to the hydrogen used for desulfurization in refineries, Air Liquide's avoided emissions amount to 77.1 Mt CO2 (see Reporting methodology page 403).\n\n## 1.2.4.  Scopes calculation methodology\n\n## Scope 1\n\nThe majority of Air Liquide's Scope 1 emissions are from its hydrogen production and cogeneration units. Scope 1 emissions are the difference in carbon content between the natural gas consumed by these units and the carbon content of their products. Air Liquide also records direct emissions from the combustion of fuel in its truck fleet, as well as gas losses from its CO2 and nitrous oxide production units.\n\n## Scope 2\n\nAir Liquide now accounts for its Scope 2 emissions on a 'market basis.' Since 2021 the Group has improved the way it accounts for indirect emissions from electricity and steam purchases by moving from a 'location-based' approach based on the average emissions intensity of the national grid to a much more precise and specific approach known as the 'market-based' method, linked directly to supply contracts. In the absence of contractual information, when all or part of a site's electricity supply comes from the grid, a residual emission factor is used, in accordance with best practices. In the absence of reliable data on the residual mix, the grid emission factor is used, the latter accounting for approximately 40% of emissions. By using this method, the Group is adopting the Scope 2 emissions accounting method  recommended  by  the  GHG  Protocol.  The  Group's  electricity  procurement  initiatives,  particularly  those  to  voluntarily  procure renewable electricity, are now directly reflected in the reported Scope 2 emissions figures.",

The variation in efficiency for hydrogen production is mainly due to maintenance shutdowns and strong variations in volumes depending on the month of the year. The energy efficiency variation does not include the volume aspect nor the recent improvement of quality on efficiency data.\n\n## 1.6.

DISCHARGES INTO AIR AND WATER\n\nThe 3 main pollutants identified in the Air Liquide activities and monitored at Group level are:\n\n- \u25a0 NOx: In an industrial context, nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions come from the oxidation of the nitrogen of the air during a non-ideal combustion of a fuel. It is a by-product of the combustion released to the atmosphere with the smoke.\n- \u25a0 SOx: In an industrial context, sulfur oxides (SOx) emissions come from the oxidation of the sulfur components included in the fuel by the oxygen in the air during a non-ideal combustion of a fuel. It is a by-product of the combustion released to the atmosphere with the smoke.\n- \u25a0 VOCs are any compounds:\n- -containing at least the element carbon and one or more of hydrogen or halogen, or oxygen, sulfur phosphorus, silicon, with the exception of carbon oxides and inorganic carbonates and bicarbonates;\n- -having a vapor pressure of 0.01 kPa or more at 293.15 \u00b0K, or having a corresponding volatility under the particular conditions of use.\n\nMethane (CH4) is usually considered as a VOC but is excluded from the definition of this specific indicator because it is considered and reported as a greenhouse gas (GHG) for reporting purposes.\n\n## DISCHARGES INTO AIR AND WATER ( in tonnes)\n\n|                                                                              | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Discharges into air: NOx (nitrogen oxides)                                   | 5,043  | 3,727  | 3,720  | 3,922  | 3,169  |\n| Discharges into air: SOx (sulfur oxides)                                     | <100   | <100   | <100   | <100   | <100   |\n| Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) discharged into the atmosphere  (estimate) | 299    | 236    | 206    | 208    | 211    |\n| Discharges to water: oxidizable matter                                       | <1000  | <1000  | 3,734  | 2,841  | <1000  |\n| Discharges to water: suspended solids                                        | <1000  | <1000  | <1000  | <1000  | <1000  |\n\n## 1.8.   WASTE AND BY-PRODUCTS\n\nAir Liquide wishes to be part of a process of continuous improvement of its environmental footprint regarding waste. To this end, in 2019, the  reporting  of  waste  and  by-products  changed  to  provide  a  more  comprehensive  view  of  the  types  of  waste  generated  and  their management.\n\nThis approach focuses on the three main hazardous waste groups at each site, allowing a better appreciation of the main environmental impacts associated with waste in each location. This new approach is to be refined in the coming years, in order to provide a view that will allow this environmental footprint to be managed more effectively within the Group.\n\n|                      | % of sites which mentioned it as one of  their three main hazardous waste   |                                   |                  |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|\n| Main hazardous waste | categories                                                                  | Treatment mode                    | Volume concerned |\n| Oils                 | 47%                                                                         | Recycling                         | 53%              |\n| Paints and solvents  | 40%                                                                         | Incineration with energy recovery | 22%              |\n| Batteries            | 72%                                                                         | Recycling                         | 45%              |\n\nFor non-hazardous waste, the main waste groups are metal, paper, wood and plastics. More than half of the Group's sites provide a selective collection of this waste. More than 98% of metal is recycled at all sites.\n\n|                                                                                                                | 2019   | 2020   |     | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   |     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----|--------|--------|--------|-----|\n| Non-hazardous waste and by-products                                                                            |        |        |     |        |        |        |     |\n| Annual quantity of lime produced (extracted by dry equivalent)  by the acetylene production units  (in tonnes) | 31,247 | 27,966 |     | 31,281 | 23,298 | 22,977 | (c) |\n| % recycled                                                                                                     | >90%   | >90%   |     | >90%   | >87%   | >85%   |     |\n| Metal waste  (in tonnes)  (a)                                                                                  | 20,632 | 6,861  | (b) | 11,755 | 8,450  | 10,180 | *   |\n| % recycled                                                                                                     | >99%   | >99%   |     | >99%   | >99%   | >99%   |     |\n| TOTAL NON-HAZARDOUS WASTE AND BY-PRODUCTS  (estimate in tonnes)                                                | 51,879 | 34,827 |     | 43,036 | 31,748 | 33,157 |     |",

GHG EMISSION QUOTA SYSTEMS\n\nAir  Liquide  is  present  in  a  number  of  regions  that  have implemented or are in the process of implementing quota systems for  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  These  regulatory  developments are being followed by the Air Liquide teams to make sure that the Group's  activities  comply  with  the  obligations  associated  with these quota systems.\n\n## 4.1.1.  In Europe\n\nIn  the  European  Union,  the  European  ETS  (Emission  Trading Scheme)  directive  established  a  system  of  greenhouse  gas emission quotas in 2005, in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol and  the  European  Union's  climate  change  objectives.  After  an initial phase from 2005 to 2007 and a second phase from 2008 to 2012, a third phase, covering the period from 2013 to 2020, has made it possible to expand the scope of industrial facilities subject to  the  ETS. The ETS has entered its fourth phase, covering the period  2021-2030,  which  carries  an  increase  in  the  reduction factor. A provisional agreement from December 2022 on the next revision  of  EU  ETS  in  the  context  of  the  Fitfor55  package, assumes the reduction of emissions from the stationary industry by 62% by 2030 compared to 2005.\n\nFor  Air  Liquide,  in  2022,  this  directive  affected  all  of  its cogeneration  sites  in  Germany,  France  and  the  Netherlands,  as well  as  all  of  the  Group's  large  hydrogen  production  sites  in Europe. With regard to hydrogen production units, a portion of the CO2  emission  quotas  is  allocated  for  free  according  to  a benchmark established for the top-performing European facilities. Air Liquide acquires the remaining CO2 quotas from the market or its  customers  in  order  to  cover  the  hydrogen  production  site emissions  not  covered  by  the  free  allocations  and  for  all emissions from cogeneration sites. As hydrogen is expected to be included in new  rules  called Carbon  Border  Adjustment Mechanism  (CBAM),  revised  ETS  rules  will  lead  to  gradual phasing-out of the free allowances (to zero in 2034) for hydrogen installation.\n\nFrom October 1, 2023, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will apply to EU companies. The CBAM is a regulatory instrument included in the European Union's climate package (Fit for  55),  imposing  a  tariff  on  carbon  emitted  by  the  production  of certain goods produced outside the EU and then imported into EU territory.\n\nImplementation  of  the  CBAM  begins  with  a  reporting  obligation during the transition period, from October 1, 2023 to December 31, 2025. As part of this obligation, Air Liquide will have to identify the entities concerned by its application. From January 1, 2026, the transitional period will be replaced by the introduction of  a  mechanism  for  paying  an  import  duty  on  carbon  emitted outside the EU for the production of goods.\n\n## 4.1.2.  In China\n\nFrom  2013,  the  Chinese  government  had  launched  pilot  ETS programs.  A  national  carbon  market  was  launched  on  July  16, 2021.  Since  2022  the  market  also  include  the  electricity  sector, the  steel  and  cement  industry.  Other  industries  (such  as  the chemical  industry)  are  expected  to  be  included  in  the  national system over the coming years. China allocates all companies their emission  quotas.  The  allocation  is  based  on  a  national\n\ncomparative analysis with each emitter allocated quotas equal to their  verified  emissions.  This  approach  means  that  China  is  not yet  a  cap-and-trade  system.  Nevertheless,  companies  that succeed in reducing the carbon intensity of their production can generate a surplus of tradeable quotas.\n\n## 4.1.3.  In Canada\n\nThe federal pricing system has two parts: a regulatory charge on fossil  fuels  like  gasoline  and  natural  gas,  known  as  the  fuel charge, and a performance-based system for industries, known as the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS).\n\nThe  Government  of  Canada  has  confirmed  that  the  carbon pollution pricing systems in Quebec, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and  Labrador,  the  Northwest  Territories,  and  British  Columbia continue to meet the federal benchmark stringency requirements, and  as  of  2021,  New  Brunswick  has  a  carbon  pollution  pricing system  that  also  meets  the  benchmark  requirements.  As  of January 1, 2022, Ontario's provincial output-based pricing system applies alongside the federal fuel charge.\n\nAir Liquide Canada is a market participant in the Quebec cap-andtrade  system,  a  voluntary  participant  in  the  Ontario  provincial OBPS  and  a  mandatory  participant  in  the  Alberta  provincial OBPS.\n\n## 4.1.4.  In Kazakhstan\n\nThe  national  quota  allocation  plan  for  2021  came  into  effect  on January 13, 2021. A revised version came into effect on January 1,  2022. A  revised  version  came  into  force  on  January  1,  2022. The emissions trading system (ETS) applies to all direct emitters of more 20,000 t CO2/year.\n\n## 4.1.5.  In California\n\nThe  California  GHG  Cap-and-Trade  system  was  established through  the  Assembly  Bill  32  (AB32)  for  the  period  2013-2020, and the first  compliance  period  started  in  2013.  In  2017,  a  new bill, AB398, authorizes the California Air Resource Board (CARB) to  continue  enforcing  the  Cap-and-Trade  regulation  over  the period 2021 through 2030. The fundamentals of the AB32 remain unchanged with AB39.\n\n## 4.1.6.  Synthesis\n\nOther countries, such as South Korea have also implemented a national  emission  quota  exchange  system.  In  2018,  a  CO2 taxation system was put in place in Singapore.\n\n|                                        | 2023                  | 2023                               |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|\n| System (in thousands of tonnes of CO \u2082 | Allowances  Allocated | Allowances  Purchased  (estimated) |\n| California CaT                         | 940                   | 216                                |\n| EU ETS  (a)                            | 2,556                 | 2,222                              |\n| Kazakhstan ETS                         | 151                   | -                                  |\n| Korea ETS                              | 214                   | 33                                 |\n| China ETS  (b)                         | 1,602                 | 15                                 |\n| Canada ETS                             | 583                   | 6                                  |\n\n- (b) On Scopes 1 and 2.\n\n<!-- image -->",

MARKET AUTHORIZATION REGULATIONS\n\nThe distribution of substances, products and articles is part of the product  stewardship  approach  developed  by  the  chemical industry.\n\nIn terms of market authorizations, Air Liquide is mainly affected by two  regulations:  chemical  substances  (REACH)  and  fluorinated gases (F-gas).\n\n## 4.2.1.  European REACH regulation Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006\n\nREACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of CHemicals)  is  a  European  Union  regulation  that  governs  the registration,  notification,  restriction  and  authorisation  of  chemical substances  produced  in  or  imported  into  the  European  Union. Air Liquide also ensures that the raw materials used and placed on the market comply with the REACH regulation.\n\n## REACH registration of chemical substances\n\nAny chemical substance imported into or manufactured in Europe in  excess  of  one  ton  per  year  must  be  registered  with  the European  Chemicals  Agency,  ECHA.  Each  manufacturer  or importer must have its own registration.\n\nThe European REACH regulation came into effect in 2007, and the registration procedures for existing substances manufactured or imported in excess of one ton per year were scheduled to run until May 31, 2018. After this date, the obligations relating to the maintenance  and  updating  of  files  continue  in  the  event  of production or import in a higher tonnage band, during the review of  registration  files  by  the  authorities,  during  administrative updates  and  when  new  information  on  risks  to  humans  or  the environment comes to light.\n\nThe same obligations  will  apply  to  all  new  substances  from  the first ton produced or imported into Europe.\n\nAir Liquide's main products, such as oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, CO2, helium and rare gases, are exempt from registration under REACH.\n\nAir Liquide is lead registrant for several substances, in particular specialty  gases  for  the  Electronics  business  (NF3,  CF4,  C4F8, SiF4\u2026).  Air  Liquide  is  ordinary  registrant  for  several  other substances: carbon monoxide, acetylene, methanol, lime, nitrous oxide, ultra-pure fuels have been registered under this regulation by each subsidiary concerned.\n\nIn  addition,  Seppic,  manufacturers  of  specialty  ingredients  for health and beauty, is subject to REACH regulations for some of its substances.  Seppic  has  anticipated  the  implementation  of  the European REACH regulation and ensures continued compliance with  the  regulation.  In  parallel  with  the  European  dossiers submitted within the framework of the REACH regulation, Seppic also ensures compliance with similar regulations outside Europe.\n\nIn  2023,  Group  sales  subject  to  registration  under  REACH  are representing less than 1% of Group turnover.\n\n## Restriction under REACH of the use of chemical substances\n\nAir Liquide is mainly impacted by restrictions relating to the use of solvents used to distribute acetylene. The solvent DMF is subject to  a  restriction  under  a  European  regulation  of  November  2021 that requires occupational exposure  during  cylinder  filling operations  to  be  monitored.  NMP,  a  potential  substitute,  is  also subject to restricted use as of May 2020.\n\n## Authorization under REACH: transitional authorization of chemical substances\n\nTransitional authorizations before permanent cessation of use in Europe  apply  to  SVHC  (Substances  of  Very  High  Concern) substances included in the candidate list for authorization.\n\nAir Liquide does not distribute substances subject to authorization. These SVHCs are essentially contained in articles distributed for the commissioning or production of gases.\n\n## Notification in the SCIP database of items placed on the market\n\nThe  WFD  (Waste  Framework  Directive)  requires  distributors  of articles containing SVHCs, as defined by REACH, above 0.1% by weight,  to  fill  out  a  database  called  SCIP,  where  the  article  is described and the location of the SVHC substance is designated. There is no threshold limit as for REACH notifications.\n\nThis  SCIP  database  will  be  used  at  the  end  of  the  article's  life when it is dismantled by waste treatment or recycling centers as part of the circular economy.\n\nAir Liquide now requires its equipment suppliers to inform it of the presence and precise location of all elementary parts containing SVHCs.\n\n## 4.2.2.  Regulation F-GAS (2014) Regulation (EU) No. 517/2014\n\nThis European regulation only applies to fluorinated gases placed on the market within the Union. It imposes marketing quotas on HFC (hydrofluorocarbon)-type  gases  because  of  their  very  high global  warming  potential.  The  other  gases  concerned  by  this regulation are monitored and are therefore subject to a reporting obligation.\n\nAir Liquide mainly markets this type of gas for the electronics and medical sectors. Fluorinated gases used in the electronics sector are destroyed before discharge into the atmosphere and therefore their use is exempted from the quota system.\n\n## 4.2.3.  Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals\n\nThe Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of  Chemicals, better known as GHS, was created by the United Nations.  This  system  sets  out  the  classification  of  chemical products according to the types of danger that they represent and provides standardized hazard information, including labeling.\n\nThis  labeling  must  provide  key  information  concerning  health, safety  and  environmental  protection  to  everyone  who  handles  a hazardous product or who could be exposed to one.\n\nIn the countries in which GHS is implemented in local regulations, Air Liquide subsidiaries have implemented the principles of GHS in terms  of  product  compliance  in  accordance  with  the requirements set out in local regulations.\n\n## 4.2.4.  Seveso Directive 3\n\nThis  European  directive  concerns  the  prevention  of  major industrial risks. It applies to any facility where certain hazardous substances are present above certain quantities. These facilities are  classified  into  two  categories  according  to  the  quantity  of substances  present:  Seveso  3  'upper  tier'  and  'lower  tier.'  In Europe,  96  'lower  tier'  and  29  'upper  tier' Air  Liquide  sites  are concerned, mainly because of oxygen storage.\n\nSeveso  regulations  apply  mainly  in  Europe,  but  if  the  Seveso 'upper tier' criteria were to be applied worldwide, 86 other Group sites would be covered.",

        "page_content": "## 5.   Reporting methodology\n\n## 5.1.   PROTOCOL AND DEFINITIONS\n\nIn the absence of a relevant and recognized protocol for industrial gas operations, Air Liquide has created its own protocol to define its reporting methods  for  Human  Resources,  safety  and environmental  indicators.  This  protocol  includes  all  of  the definitions,  measurement  procedures  and  collection  methods  for this information.  In  line  with  the  Group's  commitment  to continuous improvement, Air Liquide is gradually completing this work to adjust its Sustainable Development indicators protocol to reflect changes in the Group.\n\nThis  protocol  is  based  on  the  general  principles  defined  by  the Group with  regard  to  scope,  responsibilities,  controls  and  limits, and  establishes  definitions,  departmental  responsibilities,  tools and  data-tracing  methods  for  each  indicator.  This  document  is regularly updated.\n\nMoreover,  this  protocol  takes  into  account  all  the  Group's formalized  procedures  in  the  framework  of  the  Industrial Management  System  (IMS)  and  the  global  protocol  for  Group Policies,  Codes  and  Procedures  called  the  BlueBook.  This reporting protocol makes it possible to cover the information listed in articles L. 22-10-36 and R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code,  except  for  the  fight  against  food  waste,  food  insecurity, respect for animal welfare, commitments to responsible, fair and sustainable  food  and  the  promotion  of  the  practice  of  physical activities  and  sports.  Due  to  its  industrial  activity,  these  subjects are not considered a priority by Air Liquide.\n\nIn  2021,  following  the  publication  of  enhanced  Sustainable Development  objectives,  new  indicators  were  developed  for monitoring  the  corresponding  action  plans  and  the  degree  to which the objectives are achieved.\n\n## 5.2.   SCOPE AND CONSOLIDATION METHODS\n\nEnvironmental and Human Resources indicators are consolidated worldwide  for  all  companies  integrated  within  the  financial consolidation scope. Entities accounted for by the equity method are excluded from the reporting scope.\n\nSafety indicators are consolidated worldwide for all companies in which  Air  Liquide  has  operational  control  or  is  responsible  for safety management.\n\nApart from these general rules, there are some specific ones:\n\n- \u25a0 information on  the  impact  of  transportation  (kilometers traveled, CO2 emitted) is calculated based on data collected in the main countries where the Group is established;\n- \u25a0 information on avoided kilometers and avoided CO2 emissions through on-site Air Separation Units and efficiency measures pertains  to  fully  consolidated  subsidiaries  within  the  financial consolidation scope;\n- \u25a0 environmental  and  energy  indicators  for  the  main  types  of production  units  operated  by  the  Group  cover  about  99%  of the Group's Gas & Services revenue and 98% of the Group's total revenue;\n- \u25a0 for  environmental and energy indicators, production units are included in the reporting system from the effective date of their industrial commissioning;\n\n- \u25a0 electricity consumption and the indirect CO2 emissions related to it are only taken into account when Air Liquide pays for this energy.  Energy  consumption  of  on-site  units  and  water consumption specific to the sale of treated water (which is not part  of  the  Group's  core  business)  are  excluded  from  the consolidation  scope  of  the  data.  When  the  Group  has cogeneration units in a country where ASUs are available, the indirect  emissions  from  the  electricity  of  these  units  are adjusted to take into account self-consumption;\n- \u25a0 the segmentation between advanced economies and developing economies, used for direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, is the same as that used by the Finance Department;\n- \u25a0 the 2020 base used to monitor the targeted -33% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2035 has been restated following significant changes in the scope regarding industrial  gas  manufacturing units;\n- \u25a0 the avoided CO2 emissions reported on the climate benefit of using hydrogen to desulfurize fuels due to lower black carbon emissions are calculated using methodologies widely used by the  industries  reporting  these  climate  benefits,  and  via extrapolations to Group data.\n\n## 5.3.   DATA COLLECTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nThe environmental, safety and Human Resources indicators are produced by several data collection systems in the Group, each under the responsibility of a specific department:\n\n- \u25a0 the energy consumption and CO2 emissions indicators for the main  Air  Separation  Units  and  cogeneration,  hydrogen  and carbon  monoxide  units  are  tracked  by  the  Large  Industries business line using a dedicated Intranet tool;\n- \u25a0 as  a  complement,  environmental  and  safety  reporting  is carried  out  by  the  Safety  and  Industrial  System  Department using a dedicated Intranet tool, and includes:\n- -for all entities, the Group's accident reporting data,\n- -for  the  units  of  the  Large  Industries  business  line,  other environmental  indicators  (atmospheric  emissions,  water consumption, discharge to water, etc.),\n- -for  the  smaller units (acetylene, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide  units  and  Hygiene  and  Specialty  Ingredients businesses),  the  Engineering  &  Construction  business units,  the  Research  and  Development  sites  and  the Technical  Centers,  all  indicators  (energy,  atmospheric emissions, water consumption, discharge to water, etc.);\n- \u25a0 indicators  on  Industrial  Merchant  transportation  are  the responsibility of this business line;\n- \u25a0 indicators  on  transportation  for  Medical  Gases  and  Home Healthcare  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Healthcare  business line;\n- \u25a0 among the subjects covered by the French 'Grenelle 2' law, soil  pollution  and  the  consideration  of  noise  pollution  are  not relevant for the Industrial Gas business, given the size of the Group's  sites  and  the  noise  levels  generated.  They  are therefore not mentioned in this report;\n- \u25a0 Human Resources indicators, included in the Group's general accounting  consolidation  tool,  fall  under  the  responsibility  of the Human Resources Department.\n\n<!-- image -->",

CONTROLS\n\nEach department in charge of collecting data is responsible for the indicators  provided.  Control  occurs  at  the  time  of  consolidation (review of changes, inter-entity comparisons).\n\nCompliance  with  the  CO2  trajectory  is  ensured  by  the  Finance Department  with  the  support  of  the  Sustainable  Development Department  through  the  management  and  monitoring  of  CO2 budgets, as part of a reporting process with responsibilities clearly assigned  to  the  various  entities  involved  (operations  for  data collection,  industrial  management  teams  for  verification  and variance analysis by the Finance Department).\n\nSafety and energy indicators are tracked monthly. Where the data reported are inconsistent or missing, an estimated value may be used by default.\n\n## 5.5.   METHODOLOGICAL LIMITS\n\nThe  methodologies  used  for  certain  environmental,  safety  and Human Resources indicators can have certain limits due to:\n\n- \u25a0 the  representativeness  of  the  measurements  taken  and required estimates. This is particularly the case for indicators regarding  avoided  CO2  emissions,  water  consumption, kilometers avoided per on-site unit, and training;\n- \u25a0 the absence  of  nationally  or  internationally  recognized definitions,  in  particular  for  indicators  on  managers  and professionals and social performance indicators.",

Independent verifier's report\n\n## REPORT BY ONE OF THE STATUTORY AUDITORS, APPOINTED AS AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY, ON THE VERIFICATION OF THE NON-FINANCIAL INFORMATION STATEMENT\n\nThis is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditor's report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking readers. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023\n\nIn our capacity as Statutory Auditor of the company L'AIR LIQUIDE (hereinafter the 'Entity'), appointed as independent third party ('third party')  and  accredited  by  the  French Accreditation  Committee  (Cofrac),  (Cofrac  Inspection Accreditation,  n\u00b03-1862,scope  available  at www.cofrac.fr)),  we  have  undertaken  a  limited  assurance  engagement  on  the  historical  information  (observed  or  extrapolated)  in  the consolidated  non-financial  statement,  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Entity's  procedures  (hereinafter  the  'Guidelines'),  for  the  year ended December 31, 2022 (hereinafter the 'Information' and the 'Statement', respectively), presented in the group management report pursuant to the legal and regulatory provisions of Articles L. 225-102-1, R. 225-105 and R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed as described under the 'Nature and scope of procedures' and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that cause us to believe that the consolidated non-financial statement is not prepared in accordance with the applicable regulatory provisions and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\n## Preparation of the non-financial performance statement\n\nThe absence of a commonly used generally accepted reporting framework or a significant body of established practice on which to draw to  evaluate  and  measure  the  Information  allows  for  different,  but  acceptable,  measurement  techniques  that  can  affect  comparability between entities and over time.\n\nConsequently, the Information needs to be read and understood together with the Guidelines, summarised in the Statement.\n\n## Inherent Limitations in Preparing the Information\n\nThe Information may be subject to uncertainty inherent to the state of scientific and economic knowledge and the quality of external data used. Some information is sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions or estimates used for its preparation and presented in the Statement.\n\n## The entity's responsibility\n\nManagement is responsible for:\n\n- \u25a0 selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Information;\n- \u25a0 preparing a Statement pursuant to legal and regulatory provisions, including a presentation of the business model, a description of the main  non-financial  risks,  a  presentation  of  the  policies  implemented  considering  those  risks  and  the  outcomes  of  said  policies, including key performance indicators and the information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green taxonomy);\n- \u25a0 preparing the Statement by applying the Entity's 'Guidelines' as referred above; and\n- \u25a0 implementing internal control over information relevant to the preparation of the Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Statement has been prepared by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Responsibility of the Statutory Auditor, appointed as an independent third party\n\nBased on our work, our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on:\n\n- \u25a0 the compliance of the Statement with the requirements of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code;\n- \u25a0 the fairness of the information provided pursuant to part 3 of sections I and II of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code, i.e.  the  outcomes  of  policies,  including  key  performance  indicators,  and  measures  relating  to  the  main  risks,  hereinafter  the 'Information.'\n\nAs we are engaged to form an independent conclusion on the Information as prepared by management, we are not permitted to be involved in the preparation of the Information as doing so may compromise our independence.\n\nIt is not our responsibility to report on:\n\n- \u25a0 the  Entity's  compliance  with  other  applicable  legal  and  regulatory  provisions  (particularly  with  regard  to  the  information  set-out  in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green taxonomy), the French duty of care law and against corruption and tax evasion);\n- \u25a0 the fairness of information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green taxonomy);\n- \u25a0 the compliance of products and services with the applicable regulations.",

Furthermore, an allocation of free shares on the basis of one free share for  10  shares  held,  as  well  as  the  application  of  a  loyalty bonus, are planned for 2024.\n\nThe ex-dividend date will be May 20, 2024. The dividend will be paid on May 22, 2024.\n\nIn accordance with article 117 quater of the French Tax Code, it is specified  that  ordinary  and  loyalty  dividends  paid  to  individuals with  their  tax  residence  in  France  are  fully  subject  to  the  single flat-rate  withholding  tax  of  12.8%.  Nonetheless,  at  the  express,\n\nirrevocable  and  global  request  of  the  Shareholder,  these dividends may be subject to the progressive income tax rate and shall  therefore  be  eligible  for  the  40%  allowance  referred  to  in section 2\u00b0 of paragraph 3 of article 158 of the French Tax Code, which  is  applicable  under  certain  conditions.  In  all  cases,  these ordinary  and  loyalty  dividends  shall  also  be  subject  to  social contributions at a rate of 17.2%.\n\nIn addition, Shareholders who have held their shares in registered form  for  at  least  two  years  as  of  December  31,  2023,  and  who retain such shares in registered form up to the dividend payment date,  shall  be  entitled,  for  such  shares  (i.e.  a  total  number  of 145,320,778 shares at December 31, 2023), to a loyalty dividend of 10% compared with the dividend paid to the other shares, i.e. an additional dividend of 0.32 euros per share.\n\nThe  difference  between  the  loyalty  dividend  calculated  on  the number of shares known to exist at December 31, 2023, and the loyalty  dividend  actually  paid  will  be  allocated  to  the  retained earnings account.\n\nYou are also asked to record the distributable profit for the fiscal year,  consisting  of  the  profit  for  the  2023  fiscal  year  of 977,202,213 euros plus retained earnings available at December  31,  2023  of  3,671,836,412  euros,  i.e.  4,649,038,625 euros.\n\nWe  propose  to  appropriate  the  distributable  earnings  for  fiscal year 2023, i.e. 4,649,038,625 euros, as follows:\n\n| Legal reserve                             | 586,579 euros       |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Retained earnings                         | 2,923,495,707 euros |\n| Dividend (including the loyalty dividend) | 1,724,956,339 euros |\n\n## Distribution\n\nIn accordance with French law, we wish to remind you that the distributions made in respect of the last three fiscal years were as follows:\n\n|                   | Total amount  distributed  (a) (in euros)   | Number of shares  concerned  (b)   | Dividend distributed eligible in its entirety for the 40%  deduction referred to in article 158-3-2\u00b0  of the French Tax Code  (c) (in euros)   |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fiscal year 2020  |                                             |                                    |                                                                                                                                                |\n| Ordinary dividend | 1,302,566,991                               | 473,660,724                        | 2.75                                                                                                                                           |\n| Loyalty dividend  | 35,573,380                                  | 131,753,261                        | 0.27                                                                                                                                           |\n| Fiscal year 2021  |                                             |                                    |                                                                                                                                                |\n| Ordinary dividend | 1,378,344,007                               | 475,291,037                        | 2.90                                                                                                                                           |\n| Loyalty dividend  | 39,148,116                                  | 134,993,503                        | 0.29                                                                                                                                           |\n| Fiscal year 2022  |                                             |                                    |                                                                                                                                                |\n| Ordinary dividend | 1,544,178,299                               | 523,450,271                        | 2.95                                                                                                                                           |\n| Loyalty dividend  | 43,256,757                                  | 149,161,232                        | 0.29                                                                                                                                           |\n\n- (a) Theoretical values calculated based on the number of shares as of December 31 for each fiscal year.\n- (b) Number of shares expressed historically as of December 31 for each fiscal year.\n\nThe amounts effectively paid after adjustment were as follows:\n\n- - fiscal year 2020 - ordinary dividend: 1,298,589,273 euros for 472,214,281 shares;

loyalty dividend: 42,571,128 euros for 146,796,994 shares.\n- The adjustment especially arises from the change in the number of treasury shares, from the final determination of the loyalty dividend taking into account shares sold between January 1 and the ex-dividend date, from the exercise of options over this same period and the capital increase reserved for employees.\n- (c) Applicable, under certain conditions, when the progressive income tax rate is chosen.",

2014, to allow the Company to repurchase its own shares in order to:\n\n- \u25a0 cancel them;\n- \u25a0 tender  them  following  the  exercise  of  rights  attached  to marketable  securities  conferring  entitlement  to  Company shares by redemption, conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or any other means;\n- \u25a0 implement (i) any share purchase option plans or (ii) plans for free share attributions, or (iii) any employee share ownership transactions  reserved  for  members  of  a  Company  Savings Plan,  performed  through  the  transfer  of  shares  acquired previously

contract  in  accordance  with  an  Ethics Charter  recognized  by  the  French  financial  market  authority ( Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers ).\n\nThe  buyback  by  the  Company  of  its  own  shares  was  also intended to enable the implementation of any market practice that may be permitted  by  the  French  financial  market  authority  and, more generally,  the  achievement  of  any  other  transaction  which would comply with the regulations in force.\n\nThe  maximum  purchase  price  was  set  at  250  euros  per  share, and the maximum number of shares that could be bought back was set at 10% of the total number of shares making up the share capital as of December 31, 2022, namely 52,345,027 shares for a maximum total amount of 13,086,256,750.00 euros, subject to the

acquired on February 21, 2023.\n\nShares registered in the name of the Company as of December 31, 2023\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company directly owned 1,100,477 shares valued at an average purchase price of 136.89 euros, i.e. a balance sheet value of 150,648,995 euros. These shares, each with a par value of 5.50 euros, represent 0.21% of the Company's share capital.\n\nThe 1,100,477 treasury shares are fully assigned for implementation of any performance share plans.\n\nUnder the liquidity contract, as of December 31, 2023, a total of 2,100  shares  were  on  the  balance  sheet  for  a  net  value  of 369,251 euros.\n\nIt  is  specified  that  the  shares  held  by  the  Company  were  not reallocated  during  the  2023  fiscal  year  for  purposes  other  than those initially planned at the time of their buyback.\n\n- B.  Description of the share buyback program submitted to the General Meeting (pursuant to articles 241-1 et seq . of the General Regulation of the French financial market authority ( Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers ) - Draft resolution\n\nAs the authorization granted by the Ordinary General Meeting of May 3, 2023 was partially used, the Board proposes to replace it with a new authorization to allow the Company to repurchase its own shares in order to:\n\n- \u25a0 cancel them, subject to the adoption of the 17 th resolution;\n- \u25a0 tender  them  following  the  exercise  of  rights  attached  to marketable  securities  conferring  entitlement  to  Company shares by redemption, conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or any other means;\n- \u25a0 implement (i) any share purchase option plans or (ii) plans for free share attributions, or (iii) any employee share ownership transactions  reserved  for  members  of  a  Company  Savings Plan,  performed  under  the  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in articles  L.  3331-1 et  seq .  of  the  French  Labor  Code  through the transfer of shares bought back previously by the Company under this resolution, or providing for free share attributions in respect of a contribution in shares by the Company and/or to replace the discount, or (iv) share grants to employees and/or Company Officers and those of affiliated companies;",

In  this  case,  the Company  would  inform  its  Shareholders  by  means  of  a  press release.\n\nThe maximum purchase price will be set at 300 euros (excluding acquisition costs) per share with a par value of 5.50 euros, and the maximum number of shares that can be bought back will be set  at  10%  of  the  total  number  of  shares  making  up  the  share capital  as  of  December  31,  2023,  i.e.  52,451,677  shares  with  a par  value  of  5.50  euros,  for  a  maximum  total  amount  of 15,735,503,100 euros, subject to the legal limits.\n\nAs  in previous years, the resolution stipulates that the authorization does not apply during takeover bid periods. These shares may thus be purchased at any time, excluding the periods for takeover bids on the Company's share capital, on one or more occasions  and  by  all  available  means,  either  on  or  off  a  stock exchange,  over-the-counter,  including  the  purchase  of  blocks  of shares, or through the use of derivative financial instruments, and, if applicable, by all third parties acting on behalf of the Company, under  the  conditions  stipulated  in  the  provisions  of  the  final paragraph of article L. 225-206 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nShares bought back may be commuted, assigned or transferred in any  manner  on  or  off  a  stock  exchange  or  over-the-counter, including  the  sale  of  blocks  of  shares,  in  accordance  with  the applicable regulations.\n\nAs own shares do not confer entitlement to a dividend, the amount of the unpaid dividends will be allocated to retained earnings.\n\nThis  authorization  shall  be  granted  for  a  period  of  18  months starting from the date of this General Meeting. It shall be valid as of the date of the Board of Directors' meeting called to decide on the  implementation  of  the  share  buyback  program  and,  at  the latest,  as  of  November  3,  2024.  It  supersedes  the  authorization granted by the Ordinary General Meeting of May 3, 2023, in its 4 th resolution with respect to its non-utilized portion.\n\nPursuant  to  the  provisions  of  article  241-2  II  of  the  General Regulation of the French financial market authority ( Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers , AMF), during the completion of the buyback program,  any  change  in  any  of  the  information  listed  in  this document will be brought to the attention of the public as soon as possible, in accordance with the terms set out in article 221-3 of the General Regulation of the French financial market authority, in particular by posting it on the Air Liquide website: www.airliquide.com.\n\n## Renewal of the term of office of two Directors\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  currently  comprises  14  members: 12  members  appointed  by  the  General  Meeting,  including  five foreign  nationals  (i.e.  42%)  and  five  women  (i.e.  42%),  and  two Directors representing the employees. With 10 Directors qualified as independent, the percentage of independent Directors is 83%.\n\nIn the 5 th resolution, you are asked to renew the term of office as Director  of  Ms  Kim  Ann  Mink  for  a  period  of  four  years.  An American national,  Ms  Kim Ann  Mink  has  been  an  independent Director on the Board of Directors since May 2020 and a member of  the  Remuneration  Committee  since  September  2021.  Having spent  most  of  her  career  in  major  international  groups  in  the chemicals  industry, where  she  held  various  management positions, Ms Kim Ann Mink brings her experience in the fields of research and innovation and her managerial skills to the Board of Directors, in addition to her scientific expertise.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Board  has  been  assured  that Ms  Kim Ann  Mink will continue to be available to participate assiduously in the work of  the  Board.  In  2023,  Ms  Kim  Ann  Mink's  attendance  rate  at Board meetings was 100%. During her current term of office, her overall attendance rate at Board meetings was 100%.\n\nIn the 6 th resolution, you are asked to renew the term of office as Director  of  Ms  Monica  de  Virgiliis  for  a  period  of  four  years.  A French-Italian  national,  Ms  Monica  de  Virgiliis  has  been  an independent Director on the Board of Directors since February 15, 2023,  following  her  provisional  appointment  by  the  Board  of Directors  ratified  by  the  General  Meeting  of  May  3,  2023, replacing  Ms  Anette  Bronder  for  the  remainder  of  her  term  of office,  i.e.  until  the  end  of  this  Meeting.  She  has  also  been  a member  of  the  Environment  and  Society  Committee  since  May 2023. Ms Monica de Virgiliis brings to the Board of Directors her experience of more than 15 years in the Electronics business, her skills  in  the  field  of  technology and energy, her managerial skills and her commitment to energy transition.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Board  has  been  assured  that  Ms  Monica  de Virgiliis  will  continue  to  be  available  to  participate  assiduously in the work of the Board (1) .  Since her appointment to the Board of Directors  on  February  15,  2023,  Ms  Monica  de  Virgiliis' attendance rate at Board meetings has been 100%.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  qualified  Ms  Kim  Ann  Mink  and Ms Monica de Virgiliis as independent Directors.\n\nIn  addition  and  for  information,  the  term  of  office  of  Ms  Fatima Tighlaline as Director representing the employees expires at the end  of  this  General  Meeting.  During  its  plenary  meeting  of November  9,  2023,  the  European  Works  Council  renewed  the term  of  office  as  Director  representing  the  employees  of Ms Fatima Tighlaline for a period of four years expiring at the end of  the  2028  General  Meeting,  which  will  approve  the  financial statements for the 2027 fiscal year.\n\nAt  the  end  of  this  General  Meeting,  subject  to  approval  by  the Meeting  of  all  the  resolutions  proposed,  the  Board  of  Directors composition  would  therefore  remain  unchanged  at  14  members: 12 members appointed by the General Meeting, most of whom are independent (i.e. 83% independent Directors), including five women (i.e.  42%),  five  foreign  nationals  (i.e.  42%)  and  two  Directors representing the employees.\n\n## Regulated agreements\n\nDuring the 2023 fiscal year, no new regulated agreements were submitted for the prior approval of the Board of Directors.\n\nAs provided by law, the Board of Directors carried out an annual review  of  agreements  approved  and  concluded  during  previous fiscal years which continued to be applied during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe terms of office of Ms Kim Ann Mink and Ms Monica de Virgiliis expire at the end of this Meeting.",

It  is specified  that  no  exceptional  remuneration  was  paid  or awarded to him in 2023;\n- \u25a0 in  the  9 th resolution  to  approve  the  fixed,  variable  and exceptional  elements  of  the  total  remuneration  and  other benefits paid in 2023 or awarded in respect of the 2023 fiscal year to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier as Chairman of the Board of Directors. It is specified that no variable remuneration, LTI or exceptional remuneration were paid or awarded to him in 2023.\n\nThese elements of remuneration are described in the Report on Corporate  Governance  included  in  Chapter  3  of  the  2023 Universal Registration Document. They were paid or awarded in line with the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting on May 3, 2023.\n\n## Approval of information relating to the remuneration of corporate officers stated in article L. 22-10-9-I of the French Commercial Code\n\nIn accordance with article L. 22-10-34 I of the French Commercial Code,  you  are  asked  to  approve  the  10 th resolution on  the information  relating  to  the  remuneration  of  the  Company's corporate officers (Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board of  Directors  and  Directors)  listed  in  article  L.  22-10-9  I  of  the French Commercial Code.\n\nThis information includes in particular elements which establish the link between  the  Executive  Officer's  remuneration  and  the Company's performance, as well as communication of remuneration ratios, both on the legal scope and on an expanded scope.\n\nThis  information  is  described  in  the  Report  on  Corporate Governance  included  in  Chapter  3  of  the  2023  Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Approval of the remuneration policy applicable to corporate officers\n\nPursuant to article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code, you  are  asked  to  approve  the  remuneration  policy  applicable  to corporate officers.\n\nThe elements of this policy, including the remuneration policy for Executive  Officers  and  non-executive  Company  officers,  their application to each Company Officer and the policy applicable to Directors, are described in the Report on Corporate Governance in Chapter 3 of the 2023 Universal Registration Document, in the section  entitled  'Remuneration  policy  applicable  to  corporate officers'.\n\nThe  approval  of  the  remuneration  policy  is  the  subject  of  the 11 th resolution  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  (applicable  to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow), the 12 th resolution for the Chairman of the Board  of  Directors  (applicable  to  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier)  and  the 13 th resolution for the Company's Directors.\n\n## Setting of the total annual remuneration of Directors\n\nThe  14 th resolution  sets  the  amount  of  the  total  annual remuneration of Directors authorized per fiscal year. It should be noted that,  by  decision  of  the  General  Meeting  of  May  5,  2020, this amount  was  increased  to  1.3  million  euros.  On  the recommendation  of  the  Remuneration  Committee,  the  Board  of Directors  proposes  to  set  the  amount  of  the  total  annual remuneration that may be allocated to the Directors at 1.5 million euros, from 2024.\n\nThe proposed increase  takes  into  account  in  particular  the  new composition  of  the  Board  of  Directors  which,  since  the  recent appointments approved by the General Meeting of May 3, 2023, now  comprises  14  members,  including  12  appointed  by  the General Meeting, and the evolving regulatory context requiring an increased  number  of  meetings  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and/or certain Committees.\n\nThe  remuneration  comprises  fixed  remuneration  and  variable remuneration based on lump-sum amounts per meeting, thereby taking into account the actual participation of each Director in the work of the Board and its Committees, as well as a fixed amount per trip  for  Directors  who  are  not  residents.  For  more  details  on these  items,  see  information  presented  in  the  Company's  2023 Universal  Registration  Document,  in  Chapter  3  'Corporate governance', in the section entitled 'Remuneration of L'Air Liquide S.A.  corporate  officers'  in  the  paragraph  headed  'Remuneration of the non-Executive Directors (including information mentioned in article  L.  22-10-9-I  of  the  French  Commercial  Code)'  and  in  the section  entitled  'Remuneration  policy  applicable  to  corporate officers,' in the paragraph headed  'Remuneration  policy applicable to Directors.'\n\n## Appointment of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and the company KPMG S.A. as Statutory Auditors in charge of certifying the sustainability information\n\nAs  from  2025,  the  Company  will  publish  information  on sustainability  for  the  2024  fiscal  year  in  application  of  the provisions  of  Order  no.  2023-1142  of  December  6,  2023  on  the publication and certification of information relating to sustainability and  the  environmental, social and  corporate governance obligations of commercial companies, transposing Directive (EU) no. 2022/2464 (known as 'CSRD'). The first publication relating to this  information  will  appear  in  the  2024  Universal  Registration Document.\n\nIn this context, on the recommendation of the Audit and Accounts Committee formulated following discussions with the Environment and Society Committee in a joint session of the two Committees, the  Board  of  Directors  proposes  that  the  General  Meeting appoints the college currently in charge of certifying the accounts as  Statutory  Auditors  in  charge  of  certifying  the  Company's sustainability information and issuing a certification report on this information.  The  15 th and  16 th resolutions  therefore  propose  the appointment of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and the company KPMG S.A. to these functions respectively.",

The term of office of the two companies would  thus  expire  at  the  end  of  the  Ordinary  General  Meeting called to approve the 2027 financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As  in  2022,  in  order  to  provide Shareholders  with  the  right  to  express  an  opinion  on  such  a capital  increase  during  periods  of  takeover  bids,  it  is  proposed that  this  delegation  of  authority  be  suspended  during  periods  of takeover bids. On the basis of this resolution, an allocation of free shares at the rate of one free share for 10 shares held, as well as the application of a loyalty bonus, are planned for 2024.\n\n## Capital increase reserved for employees with cancellation of Shareholder preferential subscription rights\n\nIn  accordance  with  legal  provisions,  these  draft  resolutions  are submitted  again  to  the  vote  at  the  General  Meeting.  The  two resolutions proposed to the General Meeting are identical to those approved on May 3, 2023.\n\nThe  previous  employee  shareholding  operation  took  place  in November 2023, in accordance with the authorization given by the 21 st resolution  of  the  General  Meeting  of  May  3,  2023  (see  the Supplementary Board of Directors' Report, Chapter 3 - pages 218 to  220).  The  subscription  price  of  the  shares  was  126.49  euros (134.40 euros in the United States) per share. 22,093 employees (and  retirees)  in  57  countries  representing  32.49%  of  eligible employees  subscribed  to  this  operation.  The  General  Meeting, having  read  the  Board  of  Directors'  Report  and  the  Statutory Auditors'  Special  Report,  is  therefore  asked  to  authorize  the Board  of  Directors  to  decide  on  one  or  more  share  capital increases, at the time or times and in the proportions that it deems appropriate, via the issuance of ordinary shares of the Company, as  well  as  other  marketable  securities  granting  access  to  the Company's share capital, reserved for:\n\n- \u25a0 under  the  19 th resolution,  the  members,  from  the  Company and the French or foreign companies which are affiliated to it within  the  meaning  of  article  L.  225-180  of  the  French Commercial Code and article L.  3344-1  of  the  French  Labor Code,  of  a  Company  or  Group  Savings  Plan  (directly  or through  a  Company  mutual  fund  or  any  other  structures  or entities permitted by applicable legal or regulatory provisions). The delegation shall be valid for a period of 26 months starting from the date of this General Meeting;\n- \u25a0 under the 20 th resolution,  a  category of beneficiaries, defined as any bank or subsidiary of such an institution mandated by the Company, which would subscribe to shares, or other share capital issued by the Company pursuant to the 19 th resolution, with  the  sole  intent  of  enabling  employees  and  corporate officers of foreign companies, affiliated to the Company within the  meaning  of  article  L.  225-180  of  the  French  Commercial Code  and  article  L.  3344-1  of  the  French  Labor  Code,  to benefit from a plan with an economic profile comparable to an employee  share  ownership  scheme  that  would  be  set  up  in connection  with  a  share  capital  increase  undertaken  in accordance  with  the  19 th resolution  of  this  General  Meeting, taking  into  account  the  regulatory  and  fiscal  and/or  social framework  applicable  in  the  country  of  residence  of  the employees  and  corporate  officers  of  the  aforementioned foreign companies. The delegation shall be valid for a period of 18 months starting from the date of this General Meeting.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  shall  be  competent  to  determine,  within those categories, the identity of the beneficiaries of these share capital increases.\n\nThe total amount of share capital increases likely to be performed in  accordance  with  these  two  resolutions  may  not  exceed  a maximum nominal amount of 22 million euros, corresponding to the  issue  of  a  maximum  of  4  million  shares.  Furthermore,  the maximum nominal amount of share capital increases likely to be performed on the basis of these two resolutions shall be deducted from the overall limit stipulated in paragraph  2  of  the 19 th resolution  of  the  Extraordinary  General  Meeting  of  May  3, 2023. In  the  event  that  they  are  used,  the  proposed  resolutions will  automatically  result  in  the  cancellation  of  the  Shareholders' preferential  subscription  rights  in  favor  of  the  above-mentioned beneficiaries.\n\nThe  subscription  price  of  the  shares  that  would  be  issued pursuant  to  these  two  resolutions  may  not  exceed  the  average, determined pursuant to the provisions of article L. 3332-19 of the French  Labor  Code,  of  the  opening  trading  prices  for  the Company's  share  during  the  20  stock  exchange  trading  days preceding the date of the decision setting the opening date for the subscription to a share capital increase made on the basis of the 19 th resolution,  or  be  more  than  20%  lower  than  such  average, bearing in mind that the General Meeting will officially authorize the Board of Directors, if deemed appropriate, to reduce or cancel the aforementioned discount, within especially the legal, regulatory  and  tax  limits  under  the  applicable  foreign  law.  In accordance with article L. 3332-21 of the French Labor Code, the Board  of  Directors  may  provide  for  the  attribution,  on  a  bonus basis,  to  the  beneficiaries  referred  to  in  the  19 th resolution,  of shares  to  be  issued  or  already  issued  or  other  marketable securities  granting  access  to  the  Company's  share  capital  to  be issued  or  already  issued,  in  respect  of  (i)  the  contribution  that could  be  paid  in  accordance  with  the  regulations  governing Company or Group Saving Plans, and/or (ii)  where  appropriate, the discount.",

Consequently, the exemption provided for by the articles of association in the event of exceptional circumstances, according  to  which  the  age  limit  of  the  Chairman  may  be increased to 72 years (instead of 70 years), upon the discretion of the Board, when the Chairman of the Board of Directors does not also assume the role of Chief Executive Officer, would be deleted.\n\nUnder the 22 nd resolution you are asked to amend article 12 of the articles of association accordingly.\n\n<!-- image -->",

loyalty dividend: 37,480,931 euros for 138,818,263 shares;\n- - fiscal year 2021 - ordinary dividend: 1,372,465,400 euros for 473,263,931 shares; loyalty dividend: 39,396,398 euros for 135,849,648 shares;\n- - fiscal year 2022 - ordinary dividend: 1,540,365,457 euros for 522,157,782 shares; loyalty dividend: 42,571,128 euros for 146,796,994 shares.\n- The adjustment especially arises from the change in the number of treasury shares, from the final determination of the loyalty dividend taking into account shares sold between January 1 and the ex-dividend date, from the exercise of options over this same period and the capital increase reserved for employees.\n- (c) Applicable, under certain conditions, when the progressive income tax rate is chosen.\n\nPursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  articles  of  association,  a  loyalty dividend of 10%, i.e. 0.32 euros per share with a par value of 5.50 euros, shall be granted to shares which have been held in registered form since December 31, 2021, and which remain held in this form continuously until May 22, 2024, the dividend payment date.\n\nIn accordance with article 117 quater of the French Tax Code, it is specified  that  ordinary  and  loyalty  dividends  paid  to  individuals with  their  tax  residence  in  France  are  fully  subject  to  the  single flat-rate  withholding  tax  of  12.8%.  Nonetheless,  at  the  express, irrevocable  and  global  request  of  the  Shareholder,  these dividends may be subject to the progressive income tax rate and shall  therefore  be  eligible  for  the  40%  allowance  referred  to  in section 2\u00b0 of paragraph 3 of article 158 of the French Tax Code,\n\nwhich  is  applicable  under  certain  conditions.  In  all  cases,  these ordinary  and  loyalty  dividends  shall  also  be  subject  to  social contributions at a rate of 17.2%.\n\nThe  total  amount  of  the  loyalty  dividend  for  the  145,320,778 shares which have been held in registered form since December 31, 2021, and which remained held in this form continuously until December 31, 2023, amounts to 46,502,649 euros.\n\nThe  total  loyalty  dividend  corresponding  to  those  of  the 145,320,778  shares  that  cease  to  be  held  in  registered  form between January 1, 2024 and the May 22, 2024 dividend payment date, shall be deducted from the aforementioned amount.",

The  objectives  of  the  share  buyback  program  are  detailed  below  in  the 4 th resolution and the buyback program description included in the 2023 Universal Registration Document available on the Company's website, www.airliquide.com, prior to the General Meeting.\n\nIn 2023, the buyback program resulted in the purchase of 550,000 shares, representing 0.11% of the capital at December 31, 2022 and the cancellation of 120,000 shares. Over the past 10 years, share buybacks have represented on average less than 0.5% of the share capital per year.\n\nAdditionally, under the liquidity contract, 665,461 shares were purchased and 673,861 were sold in fiscal year 2023. As of December 31, 2023, 2,100 shares were held under the liquidity contract.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  the  Company  directly  owned  1,100,477  shares,  fully  assigned  to  the  objective  of  implementation  of  any performance share plans. These shares represent 0.21% of the Company's share capital. They do not have any voting rights and their related dividends are allocated to retained earnings.\n\nThe authorization referred to in the 4 th resolution provides  that  the  maximum  purchase  price  is  set  at 300  euros  per  share  and  the maximum number of shares that can be bought back is limited to 10% of the total number of shares comprising the share capital as of December 31, 2023, i.e. 52,451,677 shares, for a maximum total amount of 15,735,503,100 euros.\n\nIn keeping with previous practices, the Board of Directors intends to use this authorization for the purpose of employee share ownership transactions,  in  particular  for  the  purpose  of  performance  share  plans  in  favor  of  employees  and  Executive  Officers.  Subject  to  the approval of the 17 th resolution, treasury shares may also be canceled to offset, in the long term, the potential dilutive impact resulting from capital increases relating to employee shareholding transactions.\n\nThe Board also intends to maintain the liquidity contract in place, in line with the French financial market authority ( Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers ) regulations.\n\nAs in previous years, the resolution stipulates that the authorization does not apply during takeover bid periods.\n\n## Fourth Resolution\n\n## (Authorization granted to the Board of Directors for a period of 18 months to allow the Company to trade in its own shares)\n\nThe General Meeting, deliberating according to the quorum and majority required for Ordinary General Meetings, having noted the Board of Directors' Report, in accordance with articles L. 22-10-62 et seq . of the French Commercial Code and the directly applicable provisions of European Commission Regulation No. 596/2014 of April  16,  2014,  authorizes  the  Board  of  Directors  to  allow  the Company to repurchase its own shares in order to:\n\n- \u25a0 cancel  them,  subject  to  the  adoption  of  the  seventeenth resolution;\n- \u25a0 tender  them  following  the  exercise  of  rights  attached  to marketable  securities  conferring  entitlement  to  Company shares by redemption, conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or any other means;\n- \u25a0 implement (i) any share purchase option plans or (ii) plans for free share attributions, or (iii) any employee share ownership transactions  reserved  for  members  of  a  Company  Savings Plan,  performed  under  the  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in articles  L.  3331-1 et  seq. of  the  French  Labor  Code  through the transfer of shares bought back previously by the Company under this resolution, or providing for free share attributions in respect of a contribution in shares by the Company and/or to replace the discount, or (iv) share grants to employees and/or Executive Officers of the Company and of affiliated companies;\n- \u25a0 maintain an active market in the Company's shares pursuant to  a  liquidity  contract  in  accordance  with  the  market  practice recognized by the French financial market authority.\n\nThe  buy-back  by  the  Company  of  its  own  shares  shall  be  also intended to enable the implementation of any market practice that may be permitted  by  the  French  financial  market  authority  and, more generally,  the  achievement  of  any  other  transaction  which would  comply  with  the  regulations  in  force.  In  this  case,  the Company  would  inform  its  Shareholders  by  means  of  a  press release.\n\nThe  General  Meeting  sets  the  maximum  purchase  price  at  300 euros (excluding acquisition costs) per share with a par value of 5.50  euros,  and  the  maximum  number  of  shares  that  can  be bought back at 10% of the total number of shares making up the share capital as of December 31, 2023, or 52,451,677 shares with a  par  value  of  5.50  euros,  for  a  maximum  total  amount  of 15,735,503,100 euros, subject to the legal limits.\n\nThese  shares  may  be  purchased  at  any  time,  excluding  the periods for takeover bids on the Company's share capital, on one or more occasions and by all available means, either on or off a stock  exchange,  over-the-counter,  including  the  purchase  of blocks  of  shares,  or  through  the  use  of  derivative  financial instruments, and, if applicable, by all third parties acting on behalf of the Company, under the conditions stipulated in the provisions of  the  final  paragraph  of  article  L.  225-206  of  the  French Commercial Code.\n\nShares bought back may be commuted, assigned or transferred in any  manner  on  or  off  a  stock  exchange  or  over-the-counter, including  the  sale  of  blocks  of  shares,  in  accordance  with  the applicable regulations.\n\nAs own shares do not confer entitlement to a dividend, the amount of the unpaid dividends will be allocated to retained earnings.",

It should be noted that, by decision  of  the  General  Meeting  of  May  5,  2020,  this  amount  was  increased  to  1.3  million  euros.  On  the  recommendation  of  the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors proposes to set the amount of the total annual remuneration that may be allocated to the Directors at 1.5 million euros, from 2024.\n\nThe  proposed  increase  takes  into  account  in  particular  the  new  composition  of  the  Board  of  Directors  which,  since  the  recent appointments approved by the General Meeting of May 3, 2023, now comprises 14 members, including 12 appointed by the General Meeting,  and  the  evolving  regulatory  context  requiring  an  increased  number  of  meetings  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and/or  certain Committees.\n\nThe remuneration comprises fixed remuneration and variable remuneration based on lump-sum amounts per meeting, thereby taking into account the actual participation of each Director in the work of the Board and its Committees, as well as a fixed amount per trip for Directors  who  are  not  residents.

        "page_content": "## Resolutions 15 and 16 Appointment of PriceWaterhouseCoopers Audit and KPMG S.A. as Statutory Auditors in charge of certifying the sustainability information\n\n## Purposes\n\nAs from 2025, the Company will publish information on sustainability for the 2024 fiscal year in application of the provisions of Order no. 2023-1142 of December 6, 2023 on the publication and certification of information relating to sustainability and the environmental, social and corporate governance obligations of commercial companies, transposing Directive (EU) no. 2022/2464 (known as 'CSRD'). The first publication relating to this information will appear in the 2024 Universal Registration Document.\n\nIn this context, on the recommendation of the Audit and Accounts Committee formulated following discussions with the Environment and Society Committee in a joint session of the two Committees, the Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting appoints the college currently in charge of certifying the accounts as Statutory Auditors in charge of certifying the Company's sustainability information and issuing a certification report on this information. The 15 th and 16 th resolutions therefore propose the appointment of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and the company KPMG S.A. to these functions respectively.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of article L. 821-26 of the French Commercial Code, this certification assignment will respectively be carried out in the name of PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and in the name of KPMG S.A. by a natural person partner, shareholder or manager of the concerned company, duly registered on the list of Statutory Auditors authorized to perform the certification of sustainability information  held  by  the  Haute  autorit\u00e9  de  l'audit  (French  national  audit  authority),  as  provided  for  in  article  L.  821-13  of  the  French Commercial Code.\n\nFollowing an internal selection process, open to the two Statutory Auditors, the Board of Directors considered that, in addition to the appropriate  geographical  coverage  offered  by  the  two  companies  of  Statutory  Auditors,  their  good  understanding  of  Air  Liquide's challenges  and  operations  as  part  of  their  assignment  to  certify  the  Group's  financial  statements  would  be  particularly  useful  in  the implementation of the new regulations, and would allow to strengthen the connectivity between financial and sustainability information.\n\nFor all practical purposes, it is specified that in the context of this recommendation, the Audit Committee was not influenced by a third party and that no contractual clause that had the effect of restricting its choice was imposed on it.\n\nPursuant  to  the  transitional  provisions  of  Order  no.  2023-1142  of  December  6,  2023,  it  is  proposed  that  the  term  of  office  of PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and KPMG S.A. in respect of the sustainability information certification assignment be the same as that of the remaining term in respect of their financial statement certification assignment. The term of office of the two companies would thus expire at the end of the Ordinary General Meeting called to approve the 2027 financial statements.\n\n## Fifteenth Resolution\n\n## (Appointment of the company PriceWaterhouseCoopers Audit as Statutory Auditor in charge of certifying the sustainability information)\n\nThe General Meeting, deliberating according to the quorum and majority  conditions  required  for  Ordinary  General  Meetings, having noted the Board of Directors' Report, decides, pursuant to articles  L.  821-40  et  seq.  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  to appoint the company PriceWaterhouseCoopers Audit as Statutory Auditor in charge of certifying the sustainability information.\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of article L. 821-44 of the French Commercial Code and in accordance with article 38 of Order no. 2023-1142  of  December  6,  2023  on  the  publication  and certification  of  sustainability  information  and  the  environmental, social  and  corporate  governance  obligations  of  commercial companies, the duration of this term of office will be equivalent to that  of  the  remaining  term  in  respect  of  the  financial  statement certification assignment and will end at the close of the Ordinary General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the 2027 fiscal year.\n\n## Sixteenth Resolution\n\n## (Appointment of the company KPMG S.A. as Statutory Auditor in charge of certifying the sustainability information)\n\nThe General Meeting, deliberating according to the quorum and majority  conditions  required  for  Ordinary  General  Meetings, having noted the Board of Directors' Report, decides, pursuant to articles  L.  821-40  et  seq.  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  to appoint the company KPMG S.A. as Statutory Auditor in charge of certifying the sustainability information.\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of article L. 821-44 of the French Commercial Code and in accordance with article 38 of Order no. 2023-1142  of  December  6,  2023  on  the  publication  and certification  of  sustainability  information  and  the  environmental, social  and  corporate  governance  obligations  of  commercial companies, the duration of this term of office will be equivalent to that  of  the  remaining  term  in  respect  of  the  financial  statement certification assignment and will end at the close of the Ordinary General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the 2027 fiscal year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  supersedes  the  authorization granted by the Extraordinary General Meeting of May 3, 2023, in its eighteenth resolution with respect to the non-utilized portion of such authorization.\n\nFull  powers  are  granted  to  the  Board  of  Directors,  with  the possibility  of  sub-delegation  under  the  conditions  set  by  law,  to implement  this  authorization,  deduct  the  difference  between  the carrying amount of the shares canceled and their nominal amount from  all  reserve  and  additional  paid-in  capital  accounts  and  to carry out the necessary formalities to implement the reduction in capital which shall be decided in accordance with this resolution and amend the articles of association accordingly.\n\nThe  difference  between  the  carrying  amount  of  the  canceled shares and their nominal amount will be allocated to any reserve or additional paid-in capital accounts.\n\n## Resolution 18 Share capital increase through capitalization of additional paid-in capital, reserves, profits or any other amounts\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Combined General Meeting of May 4, 2022 authorized the Board of Directors, for a period of 26 months, to increase the share capital, on one or more occasions, through the incorporation of additional paid-in capital, reserves, profits or other amounts, including with a view to free shares attributions for Shareholders.\n\nThis authorization was partially used in 2022: the Company allocated one free share for 10 existing shares following a capital increase by incorporation of a sum of 268 million euros deducted from the 'Issue premiums' item, thus creating 48,905,499 new shares (amount including the 10% increase, i.e. one additional free share for every 100 existing shares held in registered form for more than two full calendar years).\n\nThe aim of the 18 th resolution is  to  renew  this  authorization  up  to  a  maximum  of  320  million  euros. As  in  2022,  in  order  to  provide Shareholders with the right to express an opinion on such a capital increase during periods of takeover bids, it is proposed that this delegation of authority be suspended during periods of takeover bids. On the basis of this resolution, an allocation of free shares at the rate of one free share for 10 shares held, as well as the application of a loyalty bonus, are planned for 2024.",

The  total  nominal amount of share capital increases likely to be performed under these resolutions is 22 million euros, corresponding to the issue of a maximum of 4 million shares, or 0.76% of the share capital as at December 31, 2023. This amount shall be deducted from the nominal limit of 470 million euros, i.e. around 16% of the share capital, as stipulated in the 19 th resolution of the Extraordinary General Meeting of May 3, 2023 (or any resolution which would replace it at a later date), relating to the overall limit for share capital increases likely to be performed on delegation to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe 19 th resolution outlines the conditions of share capital increases reserved for members of a Company or Group Savings Plan; it is accompanied in the 20 th resolution by  a  similar  provision  for  Group  employees  and  corporate  officers  based  abroad  who  could  not benefit from the shareholding mechanism which will be established pursuant to the 19 th resolution .\n\nThese two delegations will be valid for a period of 26 months for the 19 th resolution and for a period of 18 months for the 20 th resolution . They shall result in the waiver by Shareholders of their preferential subscription rights in favor of the concerned beneficiaries.\n\nThe  previous  employee  shareholding  operation  took  place  in  November  2023,  in  accordance  with  the  authorization  given  by  the 21 st resolution of the General Meeting of May 3, 2023. The subscription price of the shares was 126.49 euros (134.40 euros in the United States)  per  share.  22,093  employees  (and  retirees)  in  57  countries  representing  32.49%  of  eligible  employees  subscribed  to  this operation.\n\nThe Group wishes to continue increasing the involvement of employees in its development. These employee share ownership offers contribute significantly to increasing employee motivation and a sense of belonging to the Group.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2023,  the  share  capital  held  by  employees  and  former  employees  of  the  Group  is  estimated  at  2.9%  of  which  2.1% corresponds to shares subscribed by employees during capital increases reserved for employees or held through dedicated mutual funds.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consequently, the exemption provided for by the articles of association in the event of exceptional circumstances, according to which the age limit of the Chairman may be increased to 72 years (instead of 70 years), upon the discretion of the Board, when the Chairman of the Board of Directors does not also assume the role of Chief Executive Officer, would be deleted.\n\nUnder the 22 nd resolution you are asked to amend article 12 of the articles of association accordingly.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the Shareholders,\n\nIn our capacity as Statutory Auditors of your Company, and in compliance with articles L. 228-92 and L. 225-135 et seq. of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), we hereby report to you on the proposed delegation of authority to the Board of Directors for the issue of ordinary shares and other equity securities giving rights to the Company's share capital, without preferential subscription rights and reserved for the category of beneficiaries set out below, an operation upon which you are called to vote.\n\nThe  issue  is  reserved  for  any  financial  institution  or  subsidiaries  thereof  appointed  by  your  Company  and  which  would  subscribe  to shares,  or  other  equity  securities  issued  by  your  Company  pursuant  to  this  resolution,  with  the  sole  aim  of  allowing  employees  and Executive Officers of foreign companies related to the Company, within the meaning of articles L. 225-180 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and L. 3344-1 of the French Labor Code (Code du travail), to benefit from a share ownership or investment mechanism  with  a  similar  economic  profile  to  any  employee  share  ownership  plan  implemented  in  connection  with  a  share  capital increase, pursuant to the nineteenth resolution of this Shareholders' Meeting, taking into account the locally applicable regulatory, tax and/or social framework for employees and Executive Officers of the above-mentioned foreign companies.\n\nThe maximum nominal amount of share capital increases likely to be performed under this resolution may not exceed 22 million euros (corresponding to the issue of a maximum of 4 million shares), it being specified that:\n\n- \u25a0 the  total  amount  of  share  capital  increases  that  may  be  carried  out  immediately  or  in  the  future  pursuant  to  the  nineteenth  and twentieth  resolutions  of  this  Combined  Shareholders'  Meeting,  may  not  exceed  the  aforementioned  nominal  amount  of  22  million euros;\n- \u25a0 the maximum nominal amount of share capital increases that may be carried out pursuant to the nineteenth and twentieth resolutions, will be deducted from the overall limit of 470 million euros stipulated in the nineteenth resolution of May 3, 2023 Shareholders' Meeting (or any resolution which may subsequently replace it).\n\nYour Board of Directors proposes that, on the basis of its report, the shareholders delegate to it the authority, for a period of 18 months as from the date of this  Combined Shareholders' Meeting, to decide one or several issuances and cancel your preferential subscription rights to the shares to be issued. Where applicable, the Board of Directors will be responsible for setting the final terms and conditions of any such issue.\n\nIt  is  the Board of Directors' responsibility to prepare a report in accordance with articles R. 225-113 et seq. of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). It  is  our  responsibility  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  fairness  of  the  information  taken  from  the  financial statements,  on  the  proposed  cancellation  of  preferential  subscription  rights  and  on  certain  other  information  relating  to  this  issue, contained in this report.\n\nWe have performed the procedures that we deemed necessary in accordance with professional standards applicable in France to such engagements.  These  procedures  consisted  in  verifying  the  information  provided  in  the  Board  of  Directors'  Report  pertaining  to  the transaction and the methods used to set the issue price of the shares to be issued.\n\nSubject to a subsequent examination of the terms and conditions of the proposed issue, we have no matters to report on the methods used to set the issue price of the securities given in the Board of Directors' Report.\n\nSince the final terms and conditions of the issue have not been set, we do not express an opinion in this respect or consequently, on the proposed cancellation of shareholders' preferential subscription rights.\n\nIn accordance with article R. 225-116 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), we will prepare an additional report in the event that the Board of Directors uses this delegation of authority.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine et Paris-La D\u00e9fense, March 4, 2024 The Statutory Auditors French original signed by\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nOlivier Lotz\n\nC\u00e9dric Le Gal\n\nKPMG S.A.\n\nVal\u00e9rie Besson\n\nLaurent Genin",

It may also be increased by exercising the  rights  attached  to  marketable  securities  granting  access  to share capital, under the conditions stipulated by law.\n\nIn  accordance  with  prevailing  legal  provisions,  unless  otherwise decided  by  the  General  Meeting,  the  shareholders  have,  in proportion  to  the  amount  of  shares  they  own,  a  preferential subscription right to the shares issued in cash in order to increase share capital.\n\nThe  share  capital  may  also  be  reduced  under  the  conditions stipulated  by  law,  in  particular,  by  reducing  the  par  value  of  the shares,  or  by  reimbursing  or  redeeming  shares  on  the  stock exchange  and  by  canceling  shares,  or  by  exchanging  existing shares for new shares, in an equivalent or lesser number, with or without the same par value, and with or without a cash balance to be paid or received. The General Meeting may always compel the shareholders  to  sell  or  purchase  existing  shares  to  permit  the exchange  of  existing  shares  for  new  shares,  with  or  without  a cash balance to be paid or received, even if such reduction is not a result of losses.\n\n## Article 6: Shares\n\nIf  the  new  shares  are  not  fully  paid  up  upon  issuance,  calls  for payment  shall  be  performed,  on  dates  set  by  the  Board  of Directors,  by  means  of  announcements  posted  one  month  in advance in one of the Paris official legal publications chosen for the legal publication of the Company's deeds.\n\nShares not fully paid up shall be held as registered shares until they are fully paid up.\n\nEach payment on any subscribed shares will be registered in an account opened in the name of the subscriber.\n\nAll late payments shall automatically bear interest, for the benefit of the Company, as of the due date, without any formal notice or legal  action,  at  the  legal  interest  rate,  subject  to  any  personal action  that  the  Company  may  take  against  any  defaulting shareholder and the compulsory execution measures provided by law.\n\n## Article 7: Type of shares\n\nPaid-up  shares  are  registered  as  registered  shares  or  bearer shares depending on the choice of the shareholder.\n\nThe  provisions  of  the  aforementioned  paragraph  also  apply  to other securities of any nature issued by the Company.\n\n## Article 8: Rights and obligations governing shares\n\nShareholders  shall  not  be  liable  above  the  amount  of  their subscription.\n\nShare ownership automatically binds shareholders to the articles of association and the decisions of the General Meetings.\n\nSubject to legal and regulatory restrictions, voting rights attached to the shares are proportionate to the capital quota they represent and each share confers the right to one vote. In accordance with\n\nthe  option  provided  for  in  article  L.  22-10-46  of  the  French Commercial  Code,  double  voting  rights  will  not  be  conferred  to paid-up shares and for which a nominative registration for at least two years in the name of the same shareholder can be proved.\n\nAny share grants entitlement, during the Company's term, as in the event of liquidation, to the payment of an identical net amount for any distribution or redemption.\n\nShares  are  freely  transferable  under  the  conditions  provided  by law.\n\n## Article 9: Identification of shareholders\n\nThe  Company  may  avail  itself  at  any  time  of  the  legal  and statutory  provisions  in  force  permitting  the  identification  of  the owners of shares conferring immediately or in the future the right to vote in General Meetings, as well as the number of shares they own.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  legal  obligations  to  notify  the  Company,  any person,  acting  alone  or  jointly,  coming  in  direct  or  indirect possession of a fraction of the Company's capital or voting rights equal  to  or  greater  than  2%,  or  a  multiple  of  2%  of  capital  or voting  rights  (including  above  the  5%  threshold),  is  required  to inform the Company within fifteen days as of the date on which the threshold is exceeded  and,  as  the  case  may  be, independently  of  the  effective  transfer  date  of  share  ownership. The  person  shall  state  the  number  of  shares  and  marketable securities granting entitlement to capital that he or she owns on the date of notification. Any decrease below the 2% threshold or a multiple  of  2%  of  capital  or  voting  rights  shall  be  notified  in  the same manner.\n\nTo  determine  share  capital  and  voting  rights  thresholds,  the crossing of which must be declared under the previous paragraph, assimilation  rules  set  out  in  article  L.  233-9  of  the  French Commercial Code are applied.\n\nIn  the  event  of  a  failure  to  meet  this  additional  notification obligation, one or several shareholders, owning a fraction of the Company's capital or voting rights amounting to at least 2%, may, at  a  General  Meeting,  request  that  the  shares  exceeding  the fraction  which  should  have  been  reported,  be  stripped  of  their voting rights for any General Meeting held until the end of a twoyear period following the date on which the notice is rectified. The request is recorded in the Minutes of the General Meeting.\n\n## Article 10: Co-ownership and usufruct\n\nAs  all  shares  are  indivisible  from  the  point  of  view  of  the Company,  all  joint  owners  of  shares  are  required  to  be represented  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  Company  by  a  single  owner  selected from among them or proxy under the conditions provided by law.\n\nThe  voting  right  attached  to  the  share  is  exercised  by  the beneficial  owner  at  both  Ordinary  and  Extraordinary  General Meetings. However, the bare-owner shall be entitled to attend all General  Meetings.  He  or  she  may  also  represent  the  beneficial owner at General Meetings.\n\nThe heirs, creditors, trustees or successors of a shareholder may not, on any grounds whatsoever, call for the affixing of seals on the  Company's  assets  and  securities,  request  the  distribution thereof, or interfere in any manner whatsoever in its administration.\n\nIn order to exercise their rights, they must consult the Company's records and decisions of the General Meetings.",

As  an  exception  to  this  rule, the  members  of  the  first  Board  of  Directors  who  exercised functions as members of the Supervisory Board in the Company under its former mode of administration shall be appointed for a period equal to the remaining term of their mandate as members of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors may be re-elected.\n\nEach  Director  must  own  at  least  500  registered  shares  in  the Company during the term of his functions. If, on the date of his appointment,  a  Director  does  not  own  the  required  number  of shares  or  if,  during  his  term,  he  ceases  to  own  them,  he  is deemed  to  have  resigned  with  immediate  effect  if  he  has  not rectified  the  situation  within  the  time  limit  stipulated  in  the regulations in force.\n\nIn the event of a vacancy of one or more seats due to death or resignation,  the  Board  of  Directors  may,  between  two  General Meetings, make temporary appointments. Provisional appointments made by the Board of Directors are subject to the approval of the next Ordinary General Meeting. If the number of Directors falls below the legal minimum, the remaining Directors must immediately convene an Ordinary General Meeting in order to make up the numbers of the Board.\n\nNo individual over the age of 70 shall be appointed as a member of the Board of Directors if his appointment increases the number of the members of the Board of Directors who have passed this age  to  over  one  third.  If  during  their  term,  the  number  of  the members of the Board of Directors who have passed 70 years of age  exceeds  one  third  of  the  Board's  members,  the  oldest member  of  the  Board  of  Directors  who  has  not  carried  out management  functions  in  the  Company  is  deemed  to  have resigned at the end of the Annual General Meeting held following the occurrence of this event.\n\nDuring  the  Company's  term,  Directors  are  appointed  and  their mandates renewed under the conditions provided by law.\n\nThey may be dismissed by the Ordinary General Meeting at any time.\n\n## Director(s) representing employees\n\nIn  accordance  with  statutory  requirements,  if  the  number  of members of the Board of Directors, calculated in accordance with article L. 225-27-1-II of the French Commercial Code, is less than or equal to eight, the Group Committee in France shall proceed to appoint a Director representing employees.\n\nIf the number of members of the Board of Directors, calculated in accordance with article L. 225-27-1-II of the French Commercial Code, is more than eight, and provided this criterion is still fulfilled on the date of the appointment, a second Director representing  employees  shall  be  appointed  by  the  European Works Council.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf the number of members of the Board of Directors, calculated in accordance with article L. 225-27-1-II of the French Commercial Code, was originally more than eight members but becomes less than  or  equal  to  eight  members,  the  Director  appointed  by  the European  Works  Council  shall  remain  in  office  until  his  term  of office expires.\n\nAs an exception to the foregoing, the Director representing employees appointed by virtue of this clause is not required to hold at least 500 registered shares during his term of office.\n\nThe  Director  representing  employees  shall  be  appointed  for  a four-year term expiring at the close of the General Meeting called to  approve  the  Financial  Statements  for  the  previous  year  and which is held in the year in which his term of office expires.

It determines his remuneration and sets his  term  of  office  which  may  not  exceed  his  term  of  office  as Director. The Chairman may be re-elected.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  performs  the  duties entrusted  to  him  by  law.

He ensures that the Company's bodies operate properly and, in particular, that the Directors are able to fulfill their assignments.\n\nThe  Board  may  also  appoint  from  among  its  members  one  or more  Vice  Chairmen,  whose  term  of  office  shall  be  determined within  the  limit  of  their  term  as  Director  and  whose  role  it  is, subject  to  the  legal  provisions  applicable  in  the  event  of  the temporary impediment or death of the Chairman, to convene and chair  Board  meetings  or  chair  General  Meetings  in  accordance with these articles of association when the Chairman is impeded.\n\nNo Director who does not also assume the role of Chief Executive Officer may be appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors after the age of 70 (or 72 if the Board decides at its discretion to derogate  from  this  limit  in  exceptional  circumstances).  If,  during the  term  of  office,  this  age  limit  is  reached,  the  Chairman's mandate shall terminate at the close of the General Meeting held to approve the Financial Statements for the year during which he has reached the age limit.",

They may also be re-elected.\n\nThe  Board  may  appoint  a  secretary  who  need  not  be  a shareholder or one of its members.\n\n## Article 13: General Management\n\n## Management organization\n\nIn accordance with the law, the Company's General Management is assumed either by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or by any other physical person, Director or not, appointed by the Board of Directors and who assumes the role of Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe  choice  between  either  of  the  two  General  Management organizations described above is made by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors makes its decision relating to the choice of General Management organization under the quorum and majority conditions stipulated in article 14 of these articles of association. The shareholders and third parties are informed of the Board of Directors' decision  under  the  conditions  stipulated  by  the regulations in force.\n\nWhen the  Company's  General  Management  is  assumed  by  the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors must appoint,  among  its  members  considered  as  independent  by  the Board  of Directors, a Lead  Director. The  conditions of appointment,  the  tasks  and  powers  of  the  Lead  Director  (in particular, if applicable, the power to ask to convene a meeting of the  Board  of  Directors),  are  set  out  in  the  Board  of  Directors' internal regulations.\n\nThe choice made by the Board of Directors remains valid until it decides otherwise.\n\nThe Board of Directors will review, as necessary, the choice made each time the mandate of the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer comes up for renewal.\n\n## Chief Executive Officer\n\nIf  the  Company's  Chief  Executive  Officer  is  assumed  by  the Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  following  provisions relating to the Chief Executive Officer are applicable (apart from the situation referred to in article 12 paragraph 5).\n\nThe Board of Directors sets the term of office and determines the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nNo individual over the age limit set by law may be appointed as Chief Executive Officer. If, during the term of office, this age limit is reached, the Chief Executive Officer's mandate shall terminate at the close of the General Meeting held to approve the Financial Statements for the year during which he has reached the age limit set by law.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer may be dismissed at any time by the Board  of  Directors.  The  discharge  of  a  Chief  Executive  Officer who  does  not  assume  the  role  of  Chairman  may  give  rise  to damages if decided without reasonable cause.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer may always be re-elected.\n\n## Powers of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer is vested with the broadest powers to act in all circumstances on behalf of the Company within the limit of  the  Company's corporate purpose, the articles of association, and  subject  to  the  powers  expressly  granted  by  law  to  General Meetings and the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for defining the decisions of the  Chief  Executive  Officer  that  require  its  prior  approval.  The Board of Directors' prior approval should be sought particularly for external  acquisitions  or  sales  of  interests  or  assets,  and  for investment commitments, in each case under the conditions and exceeding the amounts corresponding to an efficient operation of the Company as set by the Board of Directors. It should also be sought  for  financing  operations  of  any  amount  likely  to substantially  alter  the  Company's  financial  structure  and  for  any decision  likely  to  substantially  alter  the  Company's  strategic orientations determined by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Senior Executive Vice-Presidents\n\nOn  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's  proposal,  whether  he  be Chairman of the Board of Directors or any other person, the Board of Directors may appoint one or more physical persons as Senior Executive Vice-Presidents to assist the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe maximum number of Senior Executive Vice Presidents is set at three.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  Board  of Directors determines the scope and term of the powers granted to the Senior Executive Vice Presidents and sets their remuneration.\n\nThe Senior Executive Vice Presidents have the same powers as the Chief Executive Officer vis-\u00e0-vis third parties.\n\nIn  the  event  of  impediment of the Chief Executive Officer or the cessation of  his  functions,  the  Senior  Executive  Vice  Presidents shall  maintain,  unless  decided  otherwise  by  the  Board  of Directors, their functions and powers until a new Chief Executive Officer is appointed.\n\nThe Senior Executive Vice Presidents may be dismissed at any time  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  at  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's proposal. They are subject to the age limit provided by law.\n\nSenior Executive Vice-Presidents may be re-elected.\n\n## Article 14: Board of Directors' Meetings and deliberations\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  meets  as  often  as  the  interest  of  the Company so requires, by notice from its Chairman or in the case of impediment, from the oldest Vice Chairman, if one or more Vice Chairmen have been appointed, at the Head Office or in any other location indicated in the Notice of Meeting.\n\nThe agenda is set by the Chairman and may only be finalized at the time of the meeting.\n\nDirectors representing at least one third of members of the Board of Directors may, while specifying the meeting's agenda, ask the Chairman to summon the Board if it has not met for more than two months.\n\nLikewise,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  if  he  does  not  chair  the Board of Directors, may ask the Chairman to summon the Board of Directors on any specified agenda.\n\nThe Chairman is bound to the requests made to him.",

It is resumed if this reserve is ever used.\n\nThe  distributable  profits  are  made  up  of  the  annual  net  profits, less previous losses, as well as the sums to be placed on reserve pursuant to law, plus the profit carried forward.\n\nFrom these profits, a deduction is made of the amount necessary to pay the shareholders, as a first dividend, 5% of the sums paidup on their shares, and not amortized, and 5% of the sums from premiums on shares issued  in  cash,  and  appearing  in  a  'share premium'  account,  without  it  being  possible,  if  the  profits  of  a given  year  do  not  permit  this  payment,  for  the  shareholders  to claim such amounts from the profits of subsequent years.\n\nThe General Meeting may decide to earmark any portion of the available  surplus  of  said  profits  it  wishes  for  the  creation  of general or special providence or reserve funds, under any name whatsoever or even simply as an amount carried forward.\n\nThe balance constitutes a surplus fund which is intended for the distribution  of  the  second  dividend  as  well  as  the  amount provisionally assessed as necessary to pay a 10% increase to the registered shares satisfying the following conditions.\n\nStarting on January 1, 1996, the shares registered at December  31  of  each  year  in  registered  form  for  at  least two  years,  and  which  remain  registered  until  the  date  of  the payment  of  the  dividend,  will  entitle  their  owners  to  collect  a dividend  per  share  which  is  10%  higher,  rounded  down  if necessary  to  the  lower  centime,  than  the  dividend  per  share distributed in respect of other shares, provided that the amount of the dividend per share prior to any increase is at least equal to the amount of the dividend per share prior to any increase distributed in the preceding year, adjusted to take into account the change in the  number  of  shares  from  one  year  to  the  next  resulting  in  a capital increase by capitalizing premiums, reserves or profits or a share split.\n\nIn  the  event  that,  starting  on  January  1,  1996,  the  Board  of Directors,  with  the  approval  of  the  shareholders  decides  to increase the capital by capitalizing reserves, profits or premiums, the registered shares held on December 31 prior to the attribution for at least two years and that remain held until the day before the share attribution date will entitle their owners to an attribution of shares which is 10% higher than the attribution made in favor of other shares, and according to the same procedure.\n\nThe new shares created in this manner will be comparable in all respects  to  the  existing  shares  from  which  they  are  issued,  for calculating the entitlement to the higher dividends and the higher attributions.\n\nThe increases defined in each of the two preceding paragraphs may  be  modified  or  eliminated  by  simple  decision  during  the Extraordinary  General  Meeting,  according  to  the  procedures  it determines.\n\nPursuant to law, the number of shares eligible for these increases shall  not  for  any  given  shareholder  exceed  0.5%  of  the Company's share capital.\n\nThe General Meeting held to approve the Financial Statements for the year shall have the possibility of granting to each shareholder, for all or part of the dividend or interim dividends, an option for payment of the dividend or interim dividends in either cash or shares.",

They appoint and determine the powers of one or more liquidators.\n\nThe liquidators may, pursuant to a decision of the shareholders, transfer to another company or sell to a company or to any other entity or person, all or part of the assets, rights and obligations of the dissolved Company.\n\n## Section VIII\n\n## DISPUTES\n\n## Article 23: Disputes\n\nAll  disputes  which  may  arise  during  the  Company's  term  or liquidation, either between the shareholders and the Company or among the shareholders themselves, regarding Company affairs, are  settled  in  accordance  with  law  and  submitted  to  the jurisdiction of the competent Paris courts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  duly  constituted General  Meeting  retains the same prerogatives during the liquidation as during the Company's term. In  particular,  it  has  the  power  to  approve  the  accounts  of  the liquidation and to grant a discharge thereof.\n\nAfter  the  Company's  commitments  have  been  settled,  the  net proceeds  from  the  liquidation  are  used  first  to  fully  redeem  the shares, and the surplus is then distributed equally among them.\n\nFor this purpose, in the event of disputes, all shareholders shall elect domicile in Paris, and all summonses and notices are duly served at this domicile.\n\nFailing  election  of  domicile,  summonses  and  notices  are  validly served at the Office of Public Prosecution of the French Republic at the Paris judicial court.",
