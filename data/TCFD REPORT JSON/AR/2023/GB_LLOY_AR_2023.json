        "page_content": "## Helping Britain Prosper provides us with a great opportunity for future success\n\n## Overview\n\nAs a financial services provider with more than 27 million customers, we have a financial relationship with over half of all adults in the UK and a strong presence in communities around the country. We play an integral role in the UK financial system and are in a unique position to deliver on our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper, whilst delivering long-term, sustainable returns for our shareholders. During 2023, our purpose has been more visible in our actions than ever before. We remain focused on helping people and businesses finance their ambitions and grow whilst proactively supporting our customers, colleagues and society to navigate the current environment.\n\n## Shareholder returns\n\nGenerating strong and sustainable earnings in the long-term is imperative. We have made good progress on our strategy, whilst continuing to deliver a robust financial performance in 2023. We continue to feel that our share price does not fully reflect the financial performance and outlook of the Group.\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of returns for our shareholders both through share price appreciation and capital returns. I am pleased to announce that the Board has recommended a total ordinary dividend of 2.76 pence per share for 2023, an increase of 15 per cent on 2022, in line with our progressive and sustainable dividend policy. The Board has also announced its intention to implement an ordinary share buyback of up to \u00a32.0 billion in 2024. Implementation of the buyback helps us grow dividend per share in future periods. Based on the total ordinary dividend and the intended ordinary share buyback, the total capital return for 2023 equates to \u00a33.8 billion. The mix of capital return between dividends and buybacks aims to meet the needs of all shareholders.\n\n## Our purpose and strategy\n\nWhile the external environment remains uncertain, our ambitious strategy announced in February 2022 remains the right one, underpinned by a strengthened connection between our strategic goals, clear financial targets, purpose and culture. I am pleased with the Group's strategic achievements in 2023. Our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper means addressing social issues impacting our customers, investing in regional productivity and creating long-term, sustainable growth for the country. Building an inclusive and sustainable future is at the heart of this.\n\nWhile more progress needs to be made on the transition to net zero, our progress will create significant opportunities for the Group, enabling us to share the benefits with all of our stakeholders. During 2023, the Group partnered with the charity Crisis to call for one million more social homes to be built over the next decade. Safe, affordable and sustainable homes are a fundamental human need and an important part of supporting the transition in a way that is fair and inclusive.\n\n## Our culture\n\nThroughout 2023, the Board has listened to our people to better understand how it feels to work for the Group, the role our culture plays and what improvements could be made. While we have seen a drop across some of our employee engagement metrics in 2023, reflecting uncertainty created by our transformation, there continues to be positive feedback about the Group's culture, with our colleagues feeling the Group is inclusive, safe and respectful.\n\nWe were pleased to be the first FTSE 100 company to set targets to increase both gender and ethnic diversity at senior levels and we maintain our commitment to these stretching targets. In 2023, the Group also announced an additional target, to double the representation of senior colleagues with disabilities, the first public commitment of its kind to be launched by a UK bank.\n\n## Directors\n\nI would like to thank Alan Dickinson and Lord Lupton, who will both retire at the 2024 annual general meeting, for the significant contributions that they have made over many years. I am pleased to report that Nathan Bostock will be appointed as a nonexecutive director of the Group and, subject to regulatory approval, Chair of Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc, in each case with effect from 1 August 2024. Read more on Board changes on page 72 .\n\nWe aim to ensure that the composition of the Board represents a diverse mix of experiences and backgrounds, enhancing the quality of Board deliberations and decisions. I am pleased to say that we meet the FTSE Women Leaders and Parker Review recommendations.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nOur approach to remuneration aims to provide a clear link to delivery of the Group's strategic objectives whilst delivering higher, more sustainable returns for our shareholders. We have also carefully considered how best to support our colleagues. In 2023, we announced a two-year pay proposal for 2024 and 2025 to provide greater certainty to our colleagues. In light of the immediate cost of living challenges, there has also been an additional cash award for c.44,000 colleagues to support our most junior colleagues. We believe our reward package is fair and competitive. More information can be found in the directors' remuneration report on pages 108 to 132 .\n\n## Summary\n\nI am immensely proud of how Lloyds Banking Group colleagues have supported our customers and made a positive contribution across our communities, while setting about the change we need for our long-term success. I am confident that the Group\u03e0s purpose, customer focus and unique business model, alongside our continued strategic delivery will ensure the Group can deliver higher, more sustainable returns for our shareholders, alongside serving the interests of our broader stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Stakeholder engagement takes place at all levels within the Group and is an important part of how we are delivering on our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper. The Board continues to engage both directly and indirectly with many of its stakeholders. This engagement helps to provide a better understanding of stakeholders' points of view and the impact the Group has on their day-to-day lives. Read more about the engagement of Board members with stakeholders on pages 82 and 83 .\n\nThe Board requires stakeholder implications to be considered by senior management in all proposals submitted to the Board from across the Group, both within the papers and as part of the accompanying presentations.\n\nSenior management routinely provides the Board with details of stakeholder interaction and feedback through their regular business updates and in their interactions both inside and outside of the board room. Managing stakeholder interests also forms a key part of the Board's delegation of the day-today management of the business to senior management.\n\nThroughout 2023 the Board's key stakeholders remained the same as they were in 2022.\n\n## Key Board discussions and decisions\n\n## Stakeholder key:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCommunities & environment\n\nSuppliers\n\nRegulators & government\n\nCustomers & clients\n\nShareholders\n\nColleagues\n\n## Cost of living\n\nStakeholder impact\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe rising cost of living, including high levels of inflation and higher interest rates, was a key area of concern for many customers, clients and colleagues during 2023. The Board continued to consider the impacts upon these stakeholders, including the impacts on the Group's mortgage customers and clients with lending facilities and the action being taken to provide them with the necessary support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## S e c t io n 1 72 ( 1) s t at e m e n t\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis section ( pages 03 to 05 ) is our Section 172(1) statement for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act), describing how the directors have had regard to the matters set out in section 172(1) (a) to (f) of the Act when performing their duty to promote the success of the Company under section 172. Further detail on key stakeholder interaction is also contained within the directors' report on pages 82 to 83 .\n\nThe directors remain mindful in all their deliberations of the long-term consequences of their decisions, as well as the importance of the Group maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct and the Board engaging with, and taking account of the views of, key stakeholders.\n\nThe five key Board decisions outlined in this section (cost of living, Consumer Duty, Senior Independent Director appointment, the Tusker acquisition and environmental sustainability) evidence how the Board is engaged in key decisions.\n\nThe Group's support to customers and clients has been driven by our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper and has evolved as the Board and the Group have sought to better understand the varying impacts of the rise in the cost of living. The support provided included the offer of interest free overdraft facilities in certain circumstances, facilitating specialist third party support and forbearance options.\n\nThe Board was keen that particular support be provided to our mortgage, business and corporate clients. There has been a number of tailored means of assistance developed accordingly, with the understanding that the right support will help these customers become more financially resilient in the long-term, which is good for the business. This included the Group's participation in the Government-led Mortgage Charter, a sector-wide initiative to support those struggling with mortgage repayments.\n\nThe Board was also very aware of the feedback from colleagues on the impact of the current cost of living pressures on their personal finances. In order to provide colleagues with greater certainty while the economic environment remains uncertain, the Board was pleased to support the Group's commitment to a two year pay deal. This provided guaranteed minimum pay awards in 2024 and 2025 for the majority of our colleagues. In addition, we had a particular focus on colleagues in more junior roles who also received a further ad hoc cash award in December 2023.\n\nThe Board will continue to monitor the challenges which the rising cost of living causes our stakeholders as the Group continues to work with our regulators and our peers to ensure the most appropriate support can be provided to customers, clients and colleagues.",

In doing so, the Board acknowledged the strong alignment between the Group's purpose, values and existing customercentric approach and the regulator's ambition to assist customers in achieving their financial objectives, while preventing customer harm.\n\nThe Board received several updates during the year on progress with meeting the regulator's requirements. This included reviewing the regulator's feedback and the steps taken by senior management in fully embedding the approach and ensuring improved customer outcomes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Senior Independent Director appointment\n\nThe Board was mindful of the scale of the programme of work and the resulting risks to delivery and considered the approach to potential actions to mitigate those risks. The Board was pleased with the Group's successful delivery of the initial stages of the programme. The Board also considered the approach the Group would take as the programme moves into its second implementation period ending in July 2024 and also the approach which would be taken to ensure that focus remains strong in this area as it transitions into 'business as usual', which will be supported by the Group's strong focus on purpose. The Board will continue to be updated on progress prior to July 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStakeholder impact\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board started a search for a successor to Alan Dickinson in the role of Senior Independent Director in early 2023. In doing so the Board was mindful of its obligations to, and the needs of, the Group's external stakeholders and its ambitions to build an organisation truly driven by Helping Britain Prosper when making the decision for this important role.\n\nThe appointment process was led by the Chair, with input from the wider Board and the support of the Board's Nomination and Governance Committee. The suitability of candidates was considered against agreed criteria, including the range of skills and prior related experience potential candidates would bring. A final recommendation was then made to the Board for its agreement.\n\nAfter an extensive review of both external and internal candidates, the decision was made for Cathy Turner to succeed Alan Dickinson in the role of Senior Independent Director. In doing so the Board recognised Cathy's broad ranging executive and non-executive experience. This included her extensive experience in dealing with investors and with the sometimes competing interests of a variety of stakeholder groups.\n\nThe Board agreed that Cathy would provide invaluable support to the Chair and undertake the other aspects of the role to a high standard.",

In early 2023 the opportunity to acquire Tusker, a business providing salary sacrifice car schemes for ultra-low emission vehicles, was presented to the Board.\n\nThe Group is committed to helping Britain build a more sustainable society. The Board therefore considered how the acquisition would align with the Group's existing business at acceptable risk and enable the Group to offer a bespoke product to its commercial clients to support those clients in their own transitions to net zero. The acquisition would also support the Group's ambitions to achieve its net zero emissions targets by 2050 or sooner through promotion of the use of electric and ultra-low emission vehicles as well as its growth ambitions for financing of electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.\n\nFrom an investor perspective, the Board considered a number of factors, including how Tusker was positioned for growth, the projected return on the Group's investment and the potential synergies with the Group's existing business, including supplier relationships. Other stakeholder considerations included the Group's regulators, with the FCA and Prudential Regulation Authority briefed in advance of the transaction.\n\nThe Board was pleased to support the transaction and provided final approval with the acquisition being announced on 22 February 2023.\n\n## Environmental sustainability\n\nStakeholder impact\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBuilding a more sustainable future is a core part of our purposedriven strategy and how we are Helping Britain Prosper. It is a key source of opportunity for the Group as well as risk management. As such, the Board has considered the importance of the Group's commitments to net zero, including both our emissions reduction targets and our role as a member of the Net Zero Banking Alliance. The Board received regular updates on the progress made in all areas related to our sustainability ambitions and has provided valuable challenge as we work towards meeting our commitments.\n\nThe Board is keenly aware of the importance of the Group's own ambitions as we support our customers and our clients through their transitions to net zero and the vital link this represents to delivering on the Group's climate ambitions. The Board has therefore encouraged further action to fully embed climate considerations into all of the Group's decision making, recognising the breadth of the action which needs to be taken and the importance of moving from target setting to action at scale. This recognises that there are many growth opportunities in helping our customers and clients transition to a net zero economy, while future-proofing our balance sheet.\n\nThe Board has encouraged clarity in the role that all areas of the Group will take as we transition to net zero. This has included ensuring cross-Group capabilities are fully utilised and emphasising the importance which bold decision making will play. In doing so the Board recognises the particularly important role which financial services organisations will take in supporting low carbon ambitions, including in key areas such as the housing and transport markets.\n\nThe Board is very aware of the challenges and risks to delivering on our commitments and has considered these throughout the course of the year. Further detail of the role of the Board in this area can be found in the report of its Responsible Business Committee on page 107 .\n\n<!-- image -->",

We continued to deliver on our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper, supporting both our customers and shareholders. We are seeing real evidence of strategic progress as we transform the business and have increased confidence in delivering the 2024 and 2026 strategic commitments. Our purpose-driven strategy is helping people and businesses across the UK finance their ambitions and grow whilst enabling us to build a more sustainable and inclusive business. This progress has been underpinned by continued strategic investment and contributed to a financial performance that has driven strong capital generation and increased shareholder distributions.\n\nThe Group delivered a robust financial performance in 2023, meeting our guidance. Income growth has been supported by a higher banking net interest margin and good momentum in underlying other income. We continued to manage costs tightly despite ongoing inflationary pressures. Asset quality remained strong. As a result, we delivered strong capital generation, enabling the Board to recommend a final ordinary dividend of 1.84 pence per share, implying a total dividend for the year of 2.76 pence. This is 15 per cent up year-on-year and in line with our progressive and sustainable dividend policy. In addition, the Group has announced a share buyback programme of up to \u00a32.0 billion. In combination, this is a total capital return of up to \u00a33.8 billion, or c.14 per cent of the Group's market capitalisation.\n\nWith continued cost of living pressures we know that 2023 was challenging for many. We were proactive in providing support. By using data and insights to gain a deeper understanding of customer needs, we contacted 7.5 million customers and around 600,000 businesses to help with their financial resilience. Alongside, we contacted more than 15 million deposit customers to ensure they are aware of their savings options, supported by our enhanced propositions, including attractive rates and products. We also recognise the importance of supporting our colleagues. We have agreed a two-year pay deal and paid an additional cash award to around 44,000 colleagues. This is alongside refreshed flexible working policies that balance the needs of our people and the strategic aims of the Group.\n\nWe remain fully focused on supporting customers, whilst delivering strong strategic progress and sustainable returns, guided by our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper.\n\nCharlie Nunn, Group Chief Executive\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWatch   Charlie's message, as he reflects on supporting our stakeholders in 2023 and beyond.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Robust financial performance, in line with guidance\n\nStatutory profit after tax was \u00a35.5 billion. The significant year-on-year increase was because of both robust 2023 performance and in particular a 2022 restatement in line with IFRS 17 accounting changes. Strong net income of \u00a317.9 billion was up 3 per cent, driven by a higher banking net interest margin in line with guidance and 10 per cent growth in underlying other income, offset by higher operating lease depreciation. Operating costs of \u00a39.1 billion increased in line with guidance, reflecting higher planned strategic investment, severance charges, new businesses and inflationary pressures. Remediation increased to \u00a3675 million and included a \u00a3450 million provision for the potential impact of the recently announced FCA review into historical motor finance commission arrangements. This charge includes estimates for costs and potential redress. There remains significant uncertainty as to the extent of any misconduct and customer loss, if any, the nature of any remediation action, if required, and its timing. Hence the impact could materially differ from the provision, both higher or lower. We saw strong asset quality with credit performance across portfolios broadly at or favourable to pre-pandemic levels. The impairment charge of \u00a3308 million includes a significant write-back and improved economic assumptions. Excluding these the asset quality ratio was 29 basis points, still in line with our guidance.\n\nThe Group's balance sheet was resilient in the face of a challenging operating environment. Excluding the impact of securitisations, loans and advances were flat. Within the mortgage book strong customer retention in fixed products was more than offset by continued roll-off from reversionary products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our strong commitment to sustainability\n\nLloyds Banking Group is committed to Helping Britain Prosper by identifying profitable solutions to building a more inclusive and sustainable future for people and businesses in the UK.\n\nWe believe that focusing on our purpose and doing right by our customers, colleagues and communities will help us identify new areas of growth, build a more resilient and profitable business and deliver higher, more sustainable returns for shareholders.\n\nThere was also growth in unsecured Retail lending and Motor Finance. The Group saw growth of over 12 per cent in assets under administration within Insurance, Pensions and Investments, including \u00a35.1 billion of net new money. Customer deposits decreased \u00a33.9 billion to \u00a3471.4 billion, although were largely stable in the second half of the year. Retail deposits were down \u00a32.4 billion, which included an \u00a311.3 billion reduction in Retail current accounts, and a \u00a312.4 billion increase in Retail savings balances supported by an enhanced savings proposition and proactive customer communications. In Commercial Banking, deposits were 1 per cent lower at \u00a3162.8 billion, reflecting targeted growth in Corporate and Institutional Banking offset by a reduction in Small and Medium Businesses.\n\n## Delivery of our purpose-driven strategy\n\nWe have a clear strategic vision to become a customer-focused digital leader and integrated financial services provider able to capitalise on new opportunities at scale. Our strategy is purposedriven, with a clear focus on areas where we can profitably grow and make the greatest impact in Helping Britain Prosper in a sustainable and inclusive way. We believe our day-to-day business activities that are helping customers finance their ambitions and growth are underpinned by our purpose. In that context, we also have particular initiatives that highlight the alignment of purpose and strategy.\n\nIn 2023, we launched a partnership with Crisis, the national charity for people experiencing homelessness. This is a hugely important cause for us given our business focus and unique ability to enact change. We have launched a cross-industry initiative to back our joint call for 1 million additional social and affordable homes. Since 2018 we have supported more than \u00a317 billion of new funding to the social housing sector, including \u00a32.7 billion in 2023. We are also aware of the importance of creating a fully inclusive organisation within our Group that is representative of modernday Britain. We have pledged to double the representation of senior colleagues with disabilities by 2025, in addition to our existing significant commitments on gender and race.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Group Chief Executive's review continued\n\nIn December, I joined global businesses and policy makers at COP 28 to discuss how to accelerate the environmental transition. Reaching net zero relies on government, industry and society acting together with certainty, pace and focus. We are realistic that insufficient progress in policy commitments will limit the Group's ability to achieve the net zero ambitions to which we remain committed.\n\nWe have made significant headway on our sustainability agenda in 2023, in particular exceeding our target for \u00a315 billion of sustainable financing within our Corporate and Institutional Banking franchise, originally set for the end of 2024. We are continuing to challenge ourselves and have set a new Commercial Banking target of \u00a330 billion of sustainable financing for 2024 to 2026, which will take the cumulative total within the division to \u00a345 billion by 2026. This is alongside new emissions reduction targets for Commercial and Residential Real Estate, Road Passenger Transport and Agriculture lending.\n\nWithin our Retail business we have continued to support customers in reducing their emissions by growing our low carbon transport business through the acquisition of Tusker. We now finance 1 in 8 ultra low emission vehicles on UK roads. We have also launched a solar panel proposition with Effective Home to expand our home retrofitting ecosystem.\n\n## Our performance\n\nRobust financial performance with continued business momentum and good strategic progress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Alternative performance measures\n\nTo supplement our statutory results, we use a number of alternative performance measures. Unless otherwise stated, commentary within the strategic report is given on an underlying basis. Further information is set out on page 67 of the annual report and accounts.\n\nWe increasingly recognise the need to expand our sustainability strategy to broader environmental goals and have launched our first pledge to halt and reverse nature losses in our own green spaces. Overall, our sustainability strategy represents a significant strategic and commercial opportunity, consistent with our purpose.\n\nStepping back, in the context of a fast changing external environment, it is clear that our purpose-driven strategy remains the right one. By focusing on Helping Britain Prosper we can deliver our strategic goals and produce higher, more sustainable returns to the benefit of all of our stakeholders. To achieve this, we are investing significantly in the transformation of the business. In February 2022 we committed to \u00a33 billion of incremental investment in the three years to 2024 and \u00a34 billion to 2026.\n\nDuring 2023, the Group invested a further \u00a31.3 billion as part of this plan and delivered tangible growth and cost outcomes that leave us well placed to meet our 2024 and 2026 financial commitments. We have started to demonstrate this successful execution to the market with two strategic seminars last year and two further seminars planned in the first half of 2024 as we continue to build confidence around our progress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00a35.5bn\n\nStatutory profit after tax, up 41 per cent vs 2022\n\n\u00a33.8bn\n\nTotal capital return including an ordinary dividend of 2.76 pence per share, up 15 per cent vs 2022\n\n68.2pts\n\nAll-channel net promoter score, up 0.8 points vs 2022\n\n15.8%\n\nReturn on tangible equity, above guidance\n\n40.1%\n\nWomen in senior roles, up 2.4pp vs year end 2021\n\n21.5m\n\nDigitally active users, up 9 per cent vs 2022",

        "page_content": "## Driving revenue growth and diversification\n\nAround two-thirds of our strategic investment is weighted towards growth and our ambition to generate c.\u00a30.7 billion of additional revenues by 2024 and c.\u00a31.5 billion by 2026. The Consumer business will deliver approximately 30 per cent of these incremental revenues and, as shown in the seminar in October, we are making strong progress in deepening and innovating within this business. We are the UK's largest digital bank, and now have 21.5 million digitally active users, up 17 per cent since 2021 and significantly exceeding our 2024 target of more than 10 per cent growth. This creates significant opportunities to deepen our customer relationships using data and insights. For example, we have personalised our communications to make them more targeted, with 18 million customers registered for marketing. We have also launched new propositions such as our mobile-first home onboarding journey and our home ecosystem, both of which are improving our retention of customers and our ability to offer complementary products such as protection insurance.\n\nIn 2023 we completed our acquisition of Tusker, a stand-out business in the salary sacrifice market for predominantly ultra-low emission vehicles helping us both meet our net zero ambitions and deliver capability and growth in an area in which we were underweight. Tusker has already grown its fleet by around 60 per cent since acquisition.\n\nWe have made good progress on our mass affluent business in 2023, launching \u03dfLloyds Bank 360\u03e0, a mobile-first proposition that includes a holistic view of wealth, educational materials and financial coaching. In addition, we launched Ready-Made Investments, a proposition made possible through Embark, which we acquired in 2022. The mass affluent customer base continues to grow, now at more than 2.5 million customers, from just over 2 million at the end of 2021.\n\nFrom a Commercial Banking perspective we continue to transform the business to help companies finance their growth and navigate an increasingly tough environment. Within our Small and Medium Businesses franchise we have made significant strides in our multi-year journey to build a front-toback digital business, including mobile-first onboarding and personalised cash flow insights. We are continuing to deliver targeted growth in our Corporate and Institutional Banking business through serving additional client needs, particularly by extending our competitive advantage in transaction banking, and expanding our institutional footprint. This has helped deliver more than 20 per cent growth in Corporate and Institutional Banking underlying other income since full year 2021 as we build momentum with sustainable and capital efficient growth.\n\n## Investing in efficiency and enablers to improve delivery\n\nStrengthening cost and capital efficiency in the context of growing and diversifying our revenues is crucial. We have guided to c.\u00a31.2 billion of gross cost savings by 2024, an increase from the original \u00a31 billion as we look to mitigate inflationary pressures. In 2026 we are targeting a below 50 per cent cost:income ratio. We have made strong progress against our 2024 cost saving target, and have now realised around 60 per cent of the savings. This has been achieved through continued investment in digital solutions and improving cost-to-serve by, for example, reducing our office footprint by more than 20 per cent since the end of 2021 and optimising our branch footprint. This active cost management is helping us deliver our guided cost outcomes at a time of heightened inflationary pressure.\n\nIn respect of capital efficiency we have continued to demonstrate risk-weighted assets discipline and careful balance sheet management whilst pursuing new growth opportunities through investments in capital-lite and fee generating business. We are also reducing the claims on our use of capital, including for example eliminating our pension deficit, with no further deficit contributions in this triennial period.\n\nWe are investing in maximising the potential of people, technology and data, the key enablers of our strategy. Investing in the talent, skills and capabilities needed for long-term growth is critical.\n\nWe have made more than 2,500 new hires in technology and data roles in 2023 and we have completed a senior leadership development programme centred around the organisational shifts we need in order to successfully execute our strategy. We are transforming our change process in the pursuit of increased efficiency and responsiveness. Since the start of our strategy, we have decommissioned more than 400 legacy technology applications and more than doubled the number of APIs we have created as we continue to migrate onto cloud-based platforms.\n\nIn conclusion, our purpose-driven strategy and strong business model ensures that we can continue to support customers and achieve our societal and strategic goals whilst delivering against our financial targets. We are successfully transforming the bank and will thereby continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders.\n\n## Grow with purpose\n\nOur colleagues are fundamental to the delivery of the Group's growth strategy which includes our ambition to be a purposedriven business.\n\nWe recognise our culture is a fundamental enabler. Throughout the year, we have been further embedding our purpose and values across the organisation, helping colleagues understand how our values guide not only the way we work together, but also how we make decisions.\n\nIn 2023, we completed a senior leadership development programme centred around the organisational shifts we need to make to Grow with Purpose. 340 leaders were brought together in sessions throughout the year, and immersed in our purpose, strategy and behaviours that we need to role model, setting clear expectations of our senior leadership population.\n\nIn driving the change, senior leaders are supported by a movement of more than 6,300 Catalysts across the business. These changemakers role model our values and purpose, share stories and drive improvements by challenging the status quo.\n\n## 2024 guidance\n\nWe are progressing well towards our ambition of generating higher, more sustainable returns for shareholders and are on track to achieve our 2024 strategic financial outcomes. Based on our current macroeconomic assumptions the Group expects:\n\n- \u00b7 Banking net interest margin of greater than 290 basis points\n- \u00b7 Operating costs c.\u00a39.3 billion\n- \u00b7 Asset quality ratio of less than 30 basis points\n- \u00b7 Return on tangible equity c.13 per cent\n- \u00b7 Capital generation of c.175 basis points\n- \u00b7 To pay down to a CET1 ratio of c.13.5 per cent\n\n## 2026 guidance\n\nBased on the expected macroeconomic environment and confidence in our strategy, the Group is maintaining its medium-term guidance for 2026:\n\n- \u00b7 Cost:income ratio of less than 50 per cent\n- \u00b7 Return on tangible equity of greater than 15 per cent\n- \u00b7 Capital generation of greater than 200 basis points\n\nThe Board continually reviews the appropriate level of ongoing capital to hold. Based on regulatory, economic and business considerations, the Group now expects to pay down to c.13.0 per cent by the end of 2026.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Charlie Nunn,\n\nGroup Chief Executive",

        "page_content": "## Our external environment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Market context\n\nThe UK economy saw modest but resilient performance in 2023, with initial estimates indicating growth of 0.1 per cent. This was despite a large increase in interest rates intended to prevent elevated inflation becoming an entrenched problem after the surge in global energy and food prices caused in large part by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Two elements were key to this resilience - government support to households, via an energy price cap, credits to energy accounts and 'cost of living' payments to lower-income households; and an unusually tight labour market after the pandemic, which enabled pay growth to accelerate to broadly match inflation.\n\nWhile inflation fell rapidly in the second half of 2023, the cost of living squeeze is still ongoing. Energy prices are still around 50 per cent higher than 2021, and food prices broadly 30 per cent higher. As the UK imports a significant proportion of both, these cost increases reduce UK spending power by around 3 per cent. Government support protected households from some of the impact across 2022 and 2023, but this is not planned to continue through 2024. The reduction in living standards has been spread out to make it more manageable but with further impact to come. Also, interest rate rises to date have not yet had their full impact, with many households yet to refinance fixed-rate mortgages at higher rates.\n\nThe UK economy in 2024 is thus expected to echo its 2023 growth performance. GDP growth is likely to remain subdued, the unemployment rate is likely to continue drifting upwards by around 1 percentage point, and house prices are expected to edge downwards by around 2 per cent. Inflation should continue to fall, returning much closer to its target level of 2 per cent than its 7 per cent average of 2023, allowing the Bank of England to start reducing Bank Rate during the year. There are, of course, significant risks to this view, not least via consequences of any escalation of wars in Ukraine or the Middle East.\n\n## UK economic growth\n\n% GDP growth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Office for National Statistics 0.1%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWeak economic growth and high interest rates in 2023 translated into subdued growth in our key markets. Housing transactions were around 14 per cent lower than normal levels, and mortgage and household deposit balances broadly flat. Consumer credit balances have only partially recovered their fall during the pandemic. SMEs continued to pay down debt after the large increase under the government-guarantee schemes during the pandemic, so non-financial companies\u03e0 deposits declined for a second year. Financial companies' deposits also declined, as they purchased gilts sold by the Bank of England as it reverses 'quantitative easing' undertaken during the pandemic. Growth in our markets in 2024 is expected to follow these trends, albeit slightly improved.\n\n## Our response\n\nGiven our UK focus, the Group's prospects are closely linked to the performance of the UK economy. Despite this, our business model and strategy, in particular the strength and resilience of our customer franchise, balance sheet and prudent approach to risk, position us well.\n\nIn line with our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper and a clear customer focus, we are helping people and businesses finance their ambitions and growth whilst proactively providing support to those most affected by changes to the economic environment.\n\nIn addition to revenue benefits from higher interest rates, our strategy and transformation will deliver growth and diversification, even in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, improving the sustainability of returns. At the same time, we are accelerating efficiency measures to offset inflationary pressures on our cost base, consistent with our ongoing discipline in this area.\n\n## UK housing market, 2023\n\n% house price growth (Dec vs Dec basis)\n\nSource: Halifax\n\n1.7%\n\n<!-- image -->",

Despite falling inflation, these challenges will continue to be a factor in the coming year, with many customers refinancing fixed rate mortgages into a higher rate environment. Customers are adapting to these changes and we continue to support our customers' and clients\u03e0 financial resilience.\n\nUse of digital services and platforms remains high in financial services context, responding to customers' underlying needs for convenient and personalised experiences. Customers' expectation of seamless, simple and relevant digital financial services continues to be set by their experiences from across their lives. Customers' underlying focus on good service and value is reflected in changes in deposit behaviour, which has seen a movement from current accounts to higher yielding term deposits as customers seek greater returns.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe continue to support our customers enabling them to invest and grow. We have proactively contacted 7.5 million customers most in need of support since April 2022. We have also contacted more than 15 million savings customers to inform them about their savings options. We have also innovated our product offering with limited withdrawal products, which balances customers\u03e0 desire for greater returns with flexibility in accessing funds should they need it. Given our market presence and the financing opportunities available, we continue to develop our propositions to support customers in managing their finances and our Your Credit Score feature has seen 3.2 million new customers, to reach 8.8 million customers registered.\n\nOur strategy seeks to respond to customers' growing digital preferences and maintain our position as the UK's largest digital bank, serving our 21.5 million digital active users. Recognising the importance of customer engagement and satisfaction, we will trial new branch formats (such as kiosks) during the coming year to enable more efficient and flexible points of presence to continue to serve our customers.

To deliver across diverse stakeholder needs, it remains critical for organisations to be representative of modern-day Britain, and create an inclusive environment. Alongside, the UK continues to focus on climate change and the integrated approach to sustainability, moving beyond climate and recognising the importance of nature and biodiversity. There is continued regulatory focus on the impact of climate risk, demonstrating progress through understandable, relevant and reliable sustainability disclosures.\n\n## Our response\n\nCreating an inclusive and sustainable future is core to our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper. Building on our scale and position in recognising the sustainable financing opportunities, we are aiming to make a meaningful and positive difference for our stakeholders and through this deliver profitable growth and long-term value for our shareholders. We are focused on supporting our customers in building financial resilience, enhancing digital capabilities and strengthening the growth in our customer propositions. Given our UK housing market presence, we have the capabilities and external relationships to drive positive change and support the growth in delivering sustainable quality housing.\n\nOur success is dependent on our colleagues and how we represent communities we serve. Continued progress against our diversity targets allows us to create more inclusive products, services and solutions. Environmental sustainability is fundamental to our purpose. We have set three new targets for our agriculture, commercial and residential real estate and road passenger transport portfolios, complementing our existing sector targets to better assess the risk to our business. We are actively working with clients through our new credible transition plan initiative and have launched the Group\u03e0s first sustainable financing framework to support our growth in sustainable lending.\n\n## Sustainable lending and investment targets\n\n<!-- image -->",

Customers and clients are able to interact with platforms that have financial services embedded within them, with new technology intermediaries such as payments providers connecting these customer interfaces with banking providers.\n\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has developed at rapid pace over the year and has seen rising prominence. Firms across industries are seeking to deploy GenAI to realise potential customer experience improvements and productivity efficiencies. There is also a continuing debate about the risks that development of GenAI poses, with high relevance to financial services, for example through new types of customer fraud.\n\nIn the longer term, technologies such as tokenisation and distributed ledgers could reshape the core activities of banks, including activities in storing and transferring value. These technologies are beginning to see greater use within the existing financial system. This is primarily in capital markets, for example through digital bond issuance and more efficient repo transactions. Furthermore, the Bank of England, alongside other central banks, continues to explore development of a digital currency, which could have implications for the financial system.\n\n## Change in channel usage versus 2018\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1     First part of 2021 includes effects of national lockdown.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe are investing in our consumer mobile app and will launch an enhanced version in 2024. This will provide improved customer experience with interactive tools, personalised insights and conversational prompts. We continue to develop value adding services around our core strengths. For example, our home ecosystem has seen strong customer usage and we are targeting 10 per cent growth in active users as we continue to build out functionality. In parallel, in responding to the changing ways in which our products reach our customers, we will launch an embedded lending proposition in partnership with NewDay. We continue our multi-year journey to build a front-to-back digital franchise for our SME business, improving client experience with enhanced app functionality.\n\nWe continue to invest in the technology transformation of our business to fully realise the value of our customer data assets and improve organisational agility. For example, since full year 2021, we have decommissioned more than 10 per cent of legacy applications. Continued investment has realised business and customer benefits, with interactions with our enhanced mobile messaging service more than doubling to 6 million. Further, as technology evolves we are engaging with the Bank of England as it explores the development of digital currencies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n87%",

Regulation, new technologies and customer adoption of digital has supported the development of new competitors and business models in recent years. Competition with traditional incumbent banks remains high. Higher interest rates has spurred significant competition in deposits and current account switching as customers and clients seek better returns, and mortgages competition remains elevated given the smaller market.\n\nNew and increasingly profitable neo banks, serving both retail and small business clients, continue to broaden their propositions and scale across markets, including international banks growing their UK presence.\n\nThe growth in digital platforms presents new opportunities for accessing customers outside of the traditional financial services journeys, spanning both consumer and business segments. Regulations such as Open Banking are enabling new providers, including the Big Tech firms, to integrate financial services into their own digital services, providing customers with convenience and new distribution channels.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe continue to invest to deepen and innovate in Consumer, with 21.5 million digitally active users and strong participation in intermediary led markets. Our strong foundations of customer relationships, combined with innovation, enable us to meet a broader range of customer needs, in particular growing in higher value segments by creating a new mass affluent offering. For example, during the year we launched ready-made investments through Embark, offering customers simple and affordable investments. We have evolved our products and pricing in deposits, resulting in more customers trusting us with their savings and balances increasing in the year.\n\nIn our SME business, we are focused on diversifying and digitising our business front-to-back. For example, we have launched a mobile-first onboarding journey for sole traders and limited companies that has reduced account opening time by up to 15 times. Furthermore, new payments solutions have supported more than 20 per cent growth in new merchant services clients.\n\nDisciplined sector focus and enhancements to our Corporate and Institutional business' Lending, Transaction Banking and Markets propositions have strengthened our competitive positioning and we have grown underlying other income by more than 20 per cent since full year 2021. We are focused on connecting our clients to wider Group solutions, such as workplace pensions and transport. For example, the acquisition of Tusker has allowed us to extend our salary sacrifice car schemes to our clients.\n\n## Market context\n\nThe UK financial services sector remains highly regulated with continued regulatory reform anticipated in 2024.\n\nCustomer treatment: Fair treatment of customers remains a priority for the FCA, and the introduction of Consumer Duty in 2023 requires an outcomes focused approach to prioritise customers' needs. We're also continuing to liaise closely with the FCA and Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) on historic motor commission arrangements.\n\nCapital regulation: In December 2023, the PRA published the first tranche of near-final rules on implementing the Basel 3.1 reforms, with the remaining rules to be published in 2024; these will lead to significant changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets. CRD IV models also remain subject to further development and PRA approval.\n\nPayments and technology: The HM Treasury commissioned 'Future of Payments Review' was published in November 2023, making several recommendations including a national strategy for the future of payments to be published in 2024.\n\nESG: We continue to enhance our sustainability reporting in line with the FCA listing rules and Companies Act requirements. Our 2023 progress is highlighted on pages 30 to 38 , as well as within our non-financial and sustainability information statement on page 46 .\n\nRing-fencing: The Government has proposed changes to the framework, reflecting the recommendations made in the ring-fencing and proprietary trading independent review.\n\nHMT's Smarter Regulatory Framework: In July 2023, HM Treasury published its delivery plan, prioritising a number of reforms including Solvency II, Securitisation and Prospectus Regulations; many of these form part of the Government package of Edinburgh Reforms.\n\nOther: A number of other initiatives are in progress or expected which seek to address, amongst other things: access to cash, capital markets reforms, the boundary between advice and guidance, and sustainable financing.\n\n## Our response\n\nAs a Group we always seek to comply with all applicable regulation and engage with regulators on all aspects to improve outcomes. Given the Group's customer-focused, sustainable and low risk business model, it is well placed to meet these requirements.",

In 2023, we continued to capture a more regular and complete picture of sentiment.\n\nOur regular pulse surveys, which focus on timely topics, gave us insights into the processes and bureaucracy that hamper effective working, and also sentiment around change. In May we heard from almost 60 per cent of our colleagues on our new flexible working arrangements, and we used this data to inform our flexibility offering.\n\nOur annual autumn survey was completed by 81 per cent of the colleagues and gave us a complete view on our progress with purpose, strategy and culture. Despite engagement declining by 12 points compared to 2022 due to changes to our flexible working arrangements, our in-year advocacy measure (employee net promoter score) is moving in a positive direction. Additionally, perceptions of our line managers remain strong and the cultural changes we had made have been received positively by colleagues.\n\nDuring the year the Group communicated directly with colleagues detailing Group performance, changes in the economic and financial environment, and updates on key strategic initiatives. Meetings were held throughout the year between the Group and our recognised unions. Please see page 82 for further examples of how the Board engages with the Group's workforce and why the Board considers those arrangements to be effective.\n\nFor 2023, the Remuneration Committee approved Group Performance Share awards for colleagues, and colleagues are eligible to participate in HMRC-approved share plans which promote share ownership by giving employees an opportunity to invest in Group shares.

        "page_content": "## Diversity, equity and inclusion\n\nThe Group aims to create a more inclusive future for our customers, colleagues and communities. We will continue to create a fully inclusive organisation that is representative of modern-day Britain, where differences are embraced, and everyone can reach their potential. We remain committed to driving this vital work forward and ensure we are a business that reflects the society it serves to best achieve our purpose, Helping Britain Prosper.\n\nIn September 2023, we launched our Inclusive Everyday campaign which brings to life our Group values and how inclusion is central to creating conditions for success and increased productivity. We know that raising awareness and education are the key levers which will help us unlock future progress. Our colleagues have now completed mandatory training promoting how to create an inclusive workplace and around 2,500 colleague Mental Health Advocates have been identified and trained.\n\nOur focus on diversity, equity and inclusion is a source of pride for our colleagues with a large participation of colleagues as members of one or more of our colleague diversity networks. This success is reflected in our latest colleague engagement survey results, where 76 per cent of colleagues agreed that the Group is an inclusive place to work.\n\n## Our approach to flexible working\n\nFlexibility Works is an important part of our transformation, as we strive to create a place where people love to work and feel supported in the moments that matter, while ensuring we are set up in the right way to meet the needs of our customers. All colleagues have access to a range of flexible working options, depending on their role. These include everyday flexibility, flexible bank holidays, compressed working, hybrid working, and reduced hours.\n\nWe also provide support for families of different shapes and sizes, through paid family leave, foster carers leave and support during extremely challenging times for colleagues such as fertility, miscarriage, stillbirth, and loss of a child. Our flexible working approach helps colleagues who need ongoing support either for their own health or as a carer to a family member.\n\n## Gender diversity\n\nWe have seen an increase in women in senior roles to 40.1 per cent during 2023, showing progress towards meeting our 2025 ambition of 50 per cent. We set our ambition to achieve gender diversity in our senior leadership knowing it was stretching and ambitious. We recognise that the journey will be challenging and we may not reach total parity by 2025, but we remain focused on actions that support this ambition and which will help us achieve this as soon as we can.\n\nWe continue to publish our Gender Pay Gap annually. Continued progress has been made in closing the Gender Pay Gap, with the gap reducing by 2.6 per cent to 26.7 per cent (April 2022 to April 2023), the largest improvement since we started reporting.\n\nWe continue to be proud co-sponsors of the FTSE Women Leaders Review and have exceeded their target to have at least 40 per cent women on boards and in leadership teams. In 2023, we are compliant with the FCA Listing Rule 9.8.6R(10) and (11).\n\nFurther information on the diversity of our Board can be found on page 73 of this report.\n\n## Ethnic diversity\n\nIn 2023 we have shown progress towards meeting our goals of increasing the representation of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues to 13 per cent, and Black representation in senior roles to at least 3 per cent by 2025. In 2023, we have increased the representation of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues in senior roles from 10.2 to 11.3 per cent and the representation of Black Heritage colleagues in senior roles from 1.4 to 1.7 per cent. The Board continues to meet the Parker Review recommendation of at least one Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic Board member.\n\nOur Race Action Plan, launched in 2020 to drive recruitment, progression and cultural change across the Group, continues to drive focus. As part of this plan, we also work beyond our own internal boundaries by actively supporting Black Heritage communities through our partnerships with Foundervine and the Black Business Network. As a Group we have continued to meet our commitment to publish our Ethnicity Pay Gap report and our race advisory panel continues to play a critical role in helping us to shape our initiatives.\n\nMore information on our Race Action Plan progress can be found on page 63 of the 2023 sustainability report .\n\n## Disability\n\nOur aim is for the Group to be a leader in disability inclusion and to create an inclusive and accessible working environment in which all colleagues have access to a psychologically safe environment and equal opportunities, and where everyone is supported to reach their full potential.\n\nIn April 2023, we committed to doubling the number of colleagues with disabilities in senior management roles by 2025. Since launching our goal, we have seen a significant uplift in colleagues sharing their disability data with us. We believe the announcement of our goal has played a key role in this, raising awareness and encouraging colleagues to share their disability data with us.\n\nAt the time of setting our goal, 6 per cent of our senior management colleagues had shared that they had a disability, making our ambition to double representation feel like the right first step. At the end of 2023, 12.4 per cent of our senior management colleagues had shared their disability, meaning that we have achieved our representation of senior colleagues with disabilities goal earlier than anticipated. We will continue to encourage our colleagues with disabilities and neurodiverse conditions to share their data with us across the course of 2024, helping us to build a true picture of the diversity of colleagues within our organisation, whilst continuing to strive for greater representation.\n\nWe are proud to be recognised as an inclusive employer for people with disabilities. The Group continues to hold the Business Disability Forum Gold Standard, in addition to being recognised as a Disability Confident Leader by the Department for Work and Pensions. We offer specific career development opportunities, and workplace adjustments for colleagues with disabilities, in addition to opportunities to join our colleague network, Access.\n\n## Sexual orientation and gender identity\n\nWe continue to focus on building an inclusive and open working environment for our LGBTQ+ colleagues. Our LGBTQ+ colleague network, Rainbow, continues to play a pivotal role in our approach to supporting our LGBTQ+ colleagues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details can be found in our sustainability report",

Guided by our Group strategy, we are focusing on areas where we can have impact, supporting the UK's transition through our lending, investments, products and services.\n\nOur environmental sustainability strategy aligns with the Group's strategic priorities of Grow, Focus, Change, with sustainability embedded into how we as a Group operate. In developing targets, our first transition plan and assessing the Group's risks and related opportunities to support our customers, the need to move from a sector focus to a system-led approach has become clear. The Group sees climate strategy as both an opportunity for the business to grow in support of our customers and a means of risk management in pursuit of our strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have four systems where we believe we can leverage our scale and reach in the market and the different financial services that we offer to consider climate and environmental issues across and between each system. These systems are focused on where we live through greening the built environment, how we move through low carbon transport, how we farm with a more sustainable farming and food system, and through the energy we use with an energy transition fundamental to broader decarbonisation. The delivery of our strategy and oversight of the related risks and opportunities is governed through our Board and executive committees; further details of our sustainability governance structure can be found on page 84 .\n\nWe continue to evolve how we identify, assess and manage climate-related risks and opportunities. While we are progressing on all ambitions to date, there are significant challenges and external dependencies in many of our sectors and systems that will need to be addressed for us to achieve our targets and our overall ambition to reduce the emissions we finance by more than 50 per cent by 2030.\n\n## Climate resilience\n\nWe have undertaken scenario analysis to assess the resilience of the Group's strategy, building on the lessons learnt from the Bank of England\u03e0s 2021 Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES). This included an initial assessment of the sectors most exposed to climate-related risks. This exercise has demonstrated that the Group has relatively low commercial lending exposure to some of the main sectors most negatively impacted by climate change. Similar analysis has also been undertaken on the Group's investment portfolio. This assessment has supported the focus for the Group's environmental sustainability strategy and emission reductions targets. This analysis has also informed consideration of climate risk in the Group's calculation of expected credit losses. This has included a top-down sector-level assessment for our commercial clients, as well as assessment of flood risk and affordability impacts relating to retrofitting costs based on energy performance certificates (EPCs) for our Homes portfolio. These estimated impacts are below the Group's materiality thresholds; therefore, no adjustments have been made to the expected credit losses measured as at 31 December 2023. On this basis, the Group's business model is also considered to be resilient against the risks from climate change.\n\nFurther details on this analysis can be found in the Climate Risk Scenario Analysis update in Risk Management pages 154 to 157 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Our sustainability objectives             |                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                          |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Group strategic  priorities               | Grow  Drive revenue  growth and  diversification                                                                                                                                                    | Focus  Strengthen   cost and capital  efficiency                                                                                                                                                           | Change  Maximise the   potential of people,  technology   and data       |\n| environmental  sustainability  objectives | \u00b7 Capitalising on   sustainable financing and  investment opportunities  \u00b7 Improving access to   quality housing                                                                                    | Reducing emissions and  monitoring our sustainability- related risks to manage   costs and mitigate against  \u00b7 Embedding sustainability   in all that we do \u00b7 Supporting and engaging  with our colleagues | \u00b7 future losses Core business                                            |\n| Environmental  ambitions and  targets     | \u00b7 2030 and 2050 ambition and targets: bank financed emissions, including 10 bank sector 2030  emission reduction targets \u00b7 2030 and 2050 ambition and targets: Scottish Widows financed emissions \u00b7 | \u00b7 2030 and 2050 ambition and targets: bank financed emissions, including 10 bank sector 2030  emission reduction targets \u00b7 2030 and 2050 ambition and targets: Scottish Widows financed emissions \u00b7        | 2030 and 2050 targets: for our own operations and supply chain emissions |",

These can either be acute (event driven such as floods or storms), or chronic (longer-term shifts such as rising sea levels or droughts)\n- \u00b7 Transition risks due to the changes associated with moving towards a low carbon economy, including changes to policy, legislation and regulation, technology and market, or legal risks from failing to manage the transition\n\nThe impacts from climate risk largely manifest through other principal risks that the Group faces, therefore consideration of climate-related risk is integrated into some of our wider risk management processes. Further information on climaterelated risks and how we identify, assess and manage them can be found on pages 154 to 157 in Risk management.\n\n## How we identify, assess and manage opportunities\n\nOne of the main risks facing the Group is the failure to adequately support the transition to net zero. We have the responsibility to manage our own operational emissions and the opportunity to support our colleagues and customers to transition, noting our biggest opportunities are in relation to the areas where we have the largest lending including residential mortgages and our real estate sector. The identification, assessment and management of these opportunities is undertaken on a regular basis by our functional-level and divisional teams, and approval of new initiatives governed in line with our sustainability governance structure.\n\nThe time frames applied for considering the impact of climaterelated opportunities is aligned with those used for business planning: short term: 0-1 year, medium term: 1-5 years, long term: 5+ years. We note that the timing is partly dependent on external factors such as UK government policy and regulation, technology developments, as well as our customers' response. The following is an indicative list of the climate-related opportunities that we have incorporated or will aim to incorporate in the medium to long term across the Group.\n\n| Opportunity                                                                                                                                                                             | Driver                                                  | Time   horizon        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Increasing consumer preference for sustainable  products including in relation to our pension  offering, sustainability-linked loans, financing  of EVs and home improvements           | Transition  (Technology,  Market)                       | Short,  medium,  long |\n| Providing finance to support investment  in climate-related technology                                                                                                                  | Transition  (Technology,  Market)                       | Medium,  long         |\n| Develop products to promote climate  resilience such as the Build Back Better  scheme for home insurance                                                                                | Physical  Transition  (Technology,  Market)             | Short,  medium,  long |\n| Reducing the emissions from our direct  operations                                                                                                                                      | Transition  (Reputation,  Technology,  Market)          | Short,  medium  long  |\n| Develop industry partnerships to help drive  energy-efficient solutions for our customers and  build knowledge on how we can further support  our customers and suppliers to transition | Transition  (Technology,  Market,  Policy,  Reputation) | Short,  medium,  long |\n\nWe have identified opportunities to:\n\n- 1. Respond to increasing customer preference for sustainable products. We recognise the growing sentiment for sustainability-linked products as a key opportunity and are progressing against our sustainable financing and investment targets to deliver against our identified opportunities.\n- 2.  Support investment in climate-related technology, mobilising our net zero origination programme to monitor and identify the most significant transition technologies.\n- 3.  Develop products to promote climate resilience, engaging in this opportunity though the Build Back Better scheme for home insurance and our efforts in greening the built environment through our products and services.\n- 4. Embrace the opportunity to reduce emissions from our own operations; we remain focused on removing all use of natural gas from our estate, replacing gas boilers with low-carbon heating technologies and creating more sustainable branches in communities across the UK.\n- 5.  Develop industry partnerships, such as with the Soil Association Exchange and Octopus Energy, which help build knowledge on how we can further support our customers and suppliers to transition.\n\nFurther details of our opportunities can be found within the sustainability report  .\n\n## Metrics and targets 1,2\n\nOur lending portfolio means our biggest exposure to sectors at increased climate risk is in relation to our residential mortgages and our real estate sector. For further details of our lending to sectors with increased climate risk see page 110 of our sustainability report . The scale of our emissions varies across different areas of the business. A breakdown of our Group's absolute emissions is shown below. Our emissions footprint has guided our approach to assessing the risks and opportunities and where we have the biggest role to play. We calculate our emissions in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, further detail in our Sustainability Metrics Basis of Reporting .\n\n| Area of the Group                         |   Absolute  emission  (MtCO2e) |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Bank financed emissions (2022)            |                           22   |\n| Scottish Widows financed emissions (2022) |                           10.2 |\n| Supply chain emissions (2022/23)  \u221a       |                            0.8 |\n| Own operation emissions (2022/23)  \u221a      |                            0.1 |\n\nWe have set several ambitions across our own operations, supply chain and lending and investments to support the decarbonisation of our business in line with the Paris agreement to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nPlease refer to our sustainability report   for further detail on our system-led transition plans and environmental progress throughout 2023.",

        "page_content": "Our emissions and financing targets drive the delivery of our environmental strategy. With these targets supporting management of our climate-related risks and opportunities, notably the risk 'failure to support the transition to net zero'. Our 2023 balanced scorecard applies a meaningful 10 per cent weighting to environmental measures, having key performance measured by assessing the progress against our targets and sustainable financing and investments. From 2024 the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) will include a weighting of 15 per cent against environment measures, reflecting that the transition to a low carbon economy is core to the Group strategy. Further details on the balanced scorecard and LTIP process can be found on page 124 .\n\n## Our emissions targets Bank ambition\n\nWork with customers, government and the market to help reduce the carbon emissions we finance by more than 50 per cent by 2030 on the path to net zero by 2050 or sooner.\n\n## MtCO2e reduction\n\n| 2018   | We are here   | 2030 target   |\n|--------|---------------|---------------|\n|        | 25.7%         | 50%           |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur overall bank emissions reduction ambition is supported by 10 sector-specific targets covering our highest emitting sectors. These targets are supported by sector-specific transition plans which detail how we are supporting our customers and clients to transition in these areas.\n\n## Scottish Widows\n\nTarget halving the carbon footprint 1,2 of all of our investments by 2030 on the path to net zero by 2050.\n\n## tCO2e/\u00a3m reduction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 2019   | We are here   | 2030 target   |\n|--------|---------------|---------------|\n|        | 33.3%         | 50%           |\n\n- 1 Carbon footprint is a measure of carbon intensity calculated as absolute value of emissions applicable to an investment divided by the value of investment.

A key refinement was the exclusion of VAT from our spend data used to calculate supplier emissions.\n\nOne year on from announcing our ambition to reduce supply chain emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 on our path to net zero by 2050, or sooner, we have seen an increase of 16 per cent in our disclosed supply chain emissions. This increase has been driven by business growth and investment that has resulted in a 21 per cent increase in spend with suppliers from \u00a34.0 billion to \u00a34.9 billion compared to our baseline year.\n\nThis highlights the limitations of a spend based methodology which relies on average carbon emission factors per \u00a31 of spend and supports our objective of moving towards supplier-specific carbon emissions data. This will allow us to more readily assess the progress of our suppliers against our ambition by decoupling spend from emissions, reflecting the actions taken by suppliers to decarbonise their business activities. Further details are found within the sustainability report .\n\n## Own operations\n\nDemonstrating our commitment to managing our own operations emissions, this year, we have also reviewed and redefined our operational net zero target for 2030. We have increased our commitment to reduce operational Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions from 75 per cent to at least 90 per cent by 2030, based on our 2018/19 baseline. We recognise that there is more that we can do to minimise the environmental impact of our direct operations, and have introduced a new pledge for nature across our operations. Further details can be found within the sustainability report .\n\n## Direct carbon emissions reduction 6\n\nNet zero carbon operations by 2030\n\n| 2018/2019   | We are here   | 2030 target   |\n|-------------|---------------|---------------|\n|             | 47.8%         | 90%           |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 6 Scope 1 and 2 emissions, market-based approach for electricity Scope 2.

Scope 3 categories 1, 2, 4 and 15 are excluded.\n\nIn 2022/23, our overall market-based carbon emissions were 123,499 tonnes CO2e, 30.2 per cent lower since 2018/19 and a 5.0 per cent increase since 2021/22, mainly driven by higher business travel and commuting related carbon emissions.",

A strong risk management culture is crucial to keep the Group, our colleagues and our customers safe and secure from existing and emerging risks.\n\n## Our approach to risk\n\nThe Group's business model is based on a prudent approach to risk, which guides participation decisions while safeguarding our colleagues, customers and the Group. An overview of risk management is included in this section, with the detailed risk management section from pages 138 to 196 , which provides:\n\n- \u00b7 A detailed overview of how risk is managed within the Group, including the approach to risk appetite\n- \u00b7 The framework by which these risks are identified, managed, mitigated and monitored\n\n## Risk profile and performance\n\nThe Group has remained committed to maintaining support for its customers despite challenges with the rising cost of living and economic uncertainties in the global and domestic markets.\n\nThe Group's loans and advances continue to be well positioned and heightened monitoring is in place to identify signs of affordability stress. The mortgage book remains resilient with arrears below 2019, with the new Mortgage Charter providing additional enhanced support to customers during 2023.\n\nUnsecured and Commercial Banking portfolios continue to exhibit stable new to arrears and default trends broadly at, or below, pre-pandemic levels. Commercial Real Estate is demonstrating resilience and is well diversified with no speculative commercial development lending.\n\nAs part of the Group's strategy, there will be continuing investments in technology and infrastructure. The Group's operational resilience risks remain a key area of focus, particularly relating to cyber risk and supply chain management.\n\nThe Group has overseen the embedding of its operational risk and control framework during 2023 and its oversight of management of financial crime risks and consumer fraud.\n\nClimate risk remains a key priority for the Group, with positive progress in 2023 and a commitment to continued focus in 2024.\n\nThe Group has enhanced the monitoring of progress against its strategic ambitions, alongside ongoing development of capabilities for measuring and managing key risks.\n\n## Our enterprise risk management framework\n\nThe enterprise risk management framework (ERMF) is the foundation for the delivery of effective and consistent risk control across the whole Group. It enables proactive identification, active management and monitoring of the Group's risks, which is supported by our risk and control self-assessment approach.\n\nThe ERMF is regularly updated to ensure it remains in line with regulation, law, corporate governance and industry good practice. The Board and senior management are responsible for the approval of the ERMF, together with Group-wide risk principles and policies. The effectiveness of the ERMF is assessed annually with the results reported directly to the Board.\n\nThe Board and senior management set and embed a positive culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. The Group's Code of Ethics and Responsibility and our established values, reinforce colleagues' accountability for the risks they take, their responsibility to explore customers' needs and consistently deliver good customer outcomes.\n\nRisk appetite is defined within the Group as the amount and type of risk that the Group is prepared to seek, accept or tolerate in delivering its strategy. The Board is responsible for approving the Group's Board risk appetite statement annually. Board level risk appetite metrics are augmented further by executive-level metrics and cascaded into detailed business metrics and limits.\n\nThe Group adopts a continuous risk management approach, from identifying the risks through risk and control selfassessment , and managing the risks through to producing appropriate, accurate and focused risk reporting. The Group ensures that the appropriate risk resources and capabilities are in place, with colleagues provided with the necessary training to give them the skills they need.\n\nGovernance is maintained through delegation of authority from the Board down to individuals. Senior executives are supported by a committee-based structure which is designed to ensure open challenge and enable effective Board engagement and decision making.\n\nThe three lines of defence model defines the responsibilities and accountabilities for risk management, with effective independent oversight and assurance. Business lines have primary responsibility for the identification and management of risks, Risk division provides oversight and challenge, and Group Internal Audit provide independent assurance to the Board and Audit Committee.\n\nMore information on the Board's responsibilities can be found on page 93 and our executive and Risk committees on pages 141 to 142\n\n.\n\n|   Enterprise risk management framework | Enterprise risk management framework     |                                                                                                                          |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      1 | Role of the Board and  senior management | The Board delegates executive authorities to   ensure there is effective oversight of risk management.                   |\n|                                      2 | Risk culture and the  customer           | The appropriate culture ensures performance,   risk and reward are aligned.                                              |\n|                                      3 | Risk appetite                            | The framework ensures our risks are managed   in line with our risk appetite.                                            |\n|                                      4 | Risk and control self-  assessment       | The identification, measurement and control of our risks form  an integral part of our risk and control self-assessment. |\n|                                      5 | Risk governance                          | The governance framework supports a consistent   approach to enterprise-wide behaviour and decision making.              |\n|                                      6 | Three lines of defence                   | The robust approach to monitoring oversight and assurance  ensures effective risk management across the Group.           |",

Downside risks from economic and regulatory headwinds, including the impact of further Retail secured CRD IV model updates, are being closely monitored.

In addition, individual emerging risks themes have been taken to key executive-level committees throughout 2023, including the Board Risk Committee, with actions assigned to monitor more closely their future manifestation and potential opportunities.\n\nThe emerging risk themes were also considered as part of the annual financial planning cycle. Geopolitical risks, and how these may generate second order impacts for the Group, have been a focus.\n\nMany emerging and horizon risk topics are reviewed on a recurring basis, alongside ongoing activity addressing their impacts. However, it is acknowledged that the nature of the emerging risks will evolve and could drive future trends in the long term which the Group will need to prepare for.\n\n## Emerging risks\n\n## Customer propositions and societal expectations\n\nThe potential impacts of a failure to adapt our propositions to the continually evolving expectations and demographic of consumers, the evolution of and expectations relating to cybercrime, the threats posed by technology-enabled players and the risk of market disintermediation.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance expectations\n\nInvestor, shareholder and public perception of the Group's i) awareness of the ecological and environmental impacts associated with its operations and investments, ii) ability to offer sustainable financing options and services at pace, against a continuously evolving environmental and regulatory backdrop, and iii) role in supporting the UK to transition to a low carbon economy.\n\n## Global macroeconomic and geopolitical environment\n\nInability to navigate changing international regulations, including sanction and trade compliance, economic fragmentation, deglobalisation, and geopolitical events that may impact operations, customers and suppliers.\n\n## Strategic workforce vision\n\nFailure to evolve the structure and skill set of a dynamic workforce in line with the Group's strategy, whilst maintaining pace with the industry and delivering strong customer outcomes.\n\nThe 2023 emerging risk landscape has been simplified, combining emerging and strategic risks into a single view (see below), enabling greater management concentration on developing the appropriate responses. The Group will continue to monitor emerging and horizon risks, exploring how they may impact its future strategy, and how it can continue to best protect its customers, colleagues and shareholders.\n\nFor further information on the Board Risk Committee's Chair Report, see pages 101 to 106 .\n\nFor further information on how the Group is managing key emerging risks through its strategy, see page 144 .\n\n## Digital currencies and tokenisation\n\nFailure to keep pace with the potential expansion of decentralised financial systems, launch of private sector or government-backed digital currencies, growth of blockchain technologies and asset tokenisation and adoption of technologies which support the mainstream utilisation of blockchain technologies.\n\n## Generative AI and ethical data practices\n\nFailure to keep pace with technological advancements relating to Generative AI and machine learning whilst balancing the competing requirements to i) maximise customer opportunities through adoption, ii) maintain trust and confidence in customer data privacy, iii) protect our customers from fraud and economic crime, iv) ensure transparency on data ethics practices, v) adhere to evolving data protection regulations and vi) prepare for potential business model disruptions caused by adoption of the technology.\n\n## Operational elasticity\n\nFailure to adequately prepare for the aggregate threat posed by cyber-attacks, disruption of service, third- or fourth-party supplier failure, technology outages or severe data loss.\n\n## UK political and macroeconomic environment\n\nFailure to anticipate the longer-term impacts of a weak UK economy, quantitative tightening, change in government and the resulting policy and regulatory shifts (a bank levy, for example) and the potential consequences of the UK becoming less attractive to external investors.",

The planning process takes account of the Group's business objectives, the risks taken to seek to meet those objectives and the controls in place to mitigate those risks to ensure they remain within the Group's overall risk appetite.\n\nThe Group's annual planning process comprises the following key stages:\n\n- \u00b7 The Board reviews and agrees the Group's strategy, risk appetite and objectives in the context of the operating environment and external market commitments\n- \u00b7 The divisional teams develop their operating plans, ensuring that they are in line with the Group's strategy and risk appetite\n- \u00b7 The financial projections and the underlying assumptions in respect of expected market and business changes, and future expected legal, accounting and regulatory changes, are subject to rigorous review and challenge from both divisional and Group executives\n- \u00b7 In addition, the Board obtains independent assurance from the Risk division over the alignment of the plan with Group strategy and the Board's risk appetite. This assessment performed by the Risk division also identifies the key risks to delivery of the Group's operating plan\n- \u00b7 The planning process is also underpinned by a robust capital and funding stress testing framework. This framework allows the Group to assess compliance of the operating plan with the Group's risk appetite\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe going concern of the Company and the Group is dependent on successfully funding their respective balance sheets and maintaining adequate levels of capital.\n\nIn order to satisfy themselves that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future, the directors have reviewed the Group's operating plan and its funding and capital positions, including a consideration of the implications of climate change.\n\nThe scenarios used for stress testing are designed to be severe but plausible, and take account of the availability and likely effectiveness of mitigating actions that could be taken by management to avoid or reduce the impact or occurrence of the underlying risks. The Group conducts internal stress testing and completes the PRA regulatory exercises. In 2023, stress tests have considered a range of economic conditions covering multiple outlooks and differing economic paths, including persistently high interest rates, and falling interest rates. Group stress results are segmented to provide insight, inform risk appetite, and allow for development of mitigating actions. In considering the likely effectiveness of such actions, the conclusions of the Board's regular monitoring and review of risk and internal control systems, as discussed on pages 138 to 196 , is taken into account. Further information on stress testing and reverse stress testing is provided on page 143 .\n\n- \u00b7 Stress testing outputs are presented to the Board Risk Committee for review and challenge. All regulatory exercises are approved by the Board\n- \u00b7 The final operating plan, Risk division assessment and the results of the stress testing are presented to the Board for approval. Once approved, the operating plan drives detailed divisional and Group targets for the following year\n\nThe directors have specifically assessed the prospects of the Company and the Group over the current plan period. The Board considers that a three-year period continues to present a reasonable degree of confidence over expected events and macroeconomic assumptions, while still providing an appropriate longer-term outlook. Information relevant to the assessment can be found in the following sections of the annual report and accounts:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group's principal activities, business and operating models and strategic direction are described in the strategic report on\n\n## pages 02 to 46\n\n- \u00b7 Emerging risks are disclosed on page 44\n- \u00b7 The principal risks, including the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing credit, capital, liquidity and funding, are provided in the risk management section on pages 138\n\n## to 196\n\n- \u00b7 The Group's approach to stress testing and reverse stress testing, including both regulatory and internal stresses, is described on page 143\n\nBased upon this assessment, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years to 31 December 2026.\n\nThe directors have also taken into account the impact of further stress scenarios as well as a number of other key dependencies which are set out in the risk management section under principal risks and uncertainties: funding and liquidity on page 41 and pages 180 to 185 and capital position on pages 147 to 153 . Additionally, the directors have considered the capital and funding projections of the Company.\n\nAccordingly, the directors conclude that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the approval of the financial statements and therefore it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.",

        "page_content": "## Summary of Group results\n\n## Statutory results\n\nThe Group's statutory profit before tax for 2023 was \u00a37,503 million, with the increase on the prior year materially driven by the restatement of earnings for the IFRS 17 accounting change in 2022. In addition, 2023 has benefited from higher net income and a significantly lower impairment charge, partly offset by increased operating expenses as expected. Statutory profit after tax was \u00a35,518 million.\n\nThe Group's statutory income statement includes income and expenses attributable to the policyholders of the Group's long-term assurance funds, investors in the Group's non-participating investment contracts and third party interests in consolidated funds. These items materially offset in arriving at profit before tax but can, depending on market movements, lead to significant variances on a statutory basis between total income and net finance income in respect of insurance and investment contracts from one period to the next. In 2023, due to market conditions, the Group recognised net gains on policyholder investments within total income, which were materially offset by the corresponding net finance expense in respect of insurance and investment contracts.\n\nTotal income, after net finance income in respect of insurance and investment contracts for the year was \u00a318,629 million, an increase of 20 per cent on 2022, largely reflecting an exceptional charge in the prior year under IFRS 17 from contract modifications in Insurance, Pensions and Investments. Net interest income of \u00a313,298 million was up 3 per cent on the prior year, driven by stronger margins and higher average interest-earning assets, including growth in the open mortgage book, Retail unsecured and European retail business. Other income amounted to a gain of \u00a322,107 million in 2023, compared to a loss of \u00a318,268 million in 2022. Net finance income in respect of insurance and investment contracts was a loss of \u00a316,776 million in the year compared to a gain of \u00a320,887 million in 2022, reflecting improved equity and debt markets.\n\nThe Group maintained its focus on cost management, whilst increasing strategic investment as planned. Total operating expenses of \u00a310,823 million were 17 per cent higher than in the prior year. This reflects higher planned strategic investment, severance charges, new business costs and inflationary effects. In 2023 the Group recognised remediation costs of \u00a3675 million (2022: \u00a3255 million) relating to pre-existing programmes and a provision for the potential impact of the recently announced FCA review into historical motor finance commission arrangements. The higher operating lease depreciation charge reflected the declines in used car prices (notably in the fourth quarter), impacting portfolio valuations and gains on disposals, the depreciation cost of higher value vehicles and the Tusker acquisition in the first quarter and its subsequent growth.\n\nImpairment was a net charge of \u00a3303 million in 2023 (2022: \u00a31,522 million). The decrease includes a significant write-back following the full repayment of debt from a single name client, in addition to a credit from modest revisions to the Group's economic outlook compared to the deterioration in the economic outlook captured last year.\n\nThe Group recognised a tax expense of \u00a31,985 million in the year, compared to \u00a3859 million in 2022, reflecting increased profits. The prior year included a \u00a3222 million benefit in relation to tax deductibility of provisions made in 2021.\n\nLoans and advances to customers fell by \u00a35.2 billion during 2023 to \u00a3449.7 billion, in the context of securitisations of \u00a35.2 billion, including \u00a32.5 billion of legacy Retail mortgages (\u00a32.1 billion in the closed mortgage book) during the first quarter and \u00a32.7 billion of Retail unsecured loans in the fourth quarter. Excluding these movements, loans and advances to customers were stable. During the fourth quarter, loans and advances to customers reduced by \u00a32.4 billion, mainly due to the impact of the securitisation of \u00a32.7 billion of Retail unsecured loans.\n\nCustomer deposits at \u00a3471.4 billion decreased by \u00a33.9 billion (1 per cent) since the end of 2022. This includes a decrease in Retail current account balances of \u00a311.3 billion as a result of higher spend and a more competitive savings market, including the Group's own savings offers. In Retail savings and Wealth, balances have increased by a combined \u00a38.9 billion, with a significant proportion transferred from the Group's current account customer base given attractive customer offers. Commercial Banking deposits were down \u00a31.0 billion during 2023, reflecting targeted growth in Corporate and Institutional Banking offset by a reduction in Small and Medium Businesses. The trend of customer deposit mix change within the Group was slower in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.\n\nTotal equity of \u00a347,365 million at 31 December 2023 increased from \u00a343,911 million at 31 December 2022. The movement reflected attributable profit for the year, movements in the cash flow hedge reserve and the issuance of other equity instruments, partially offset by market movements impacting pensions, alongside dividends paid and the impact of the share buyback programme. In February 2023, the Board decided to return surplus capital in respect of 2022 through a share buyback programme of up to \u00a32 billion. This commenced in February 2023 and completed on 25 August 2023 with c.4.4 billion (c.7 per cent) ordinary shares repurchased.",

        "page_content": "## Underlying results A\n\nThe Group's underlying profit for 2023 was \u00a37,809 million, an increase of 11 per cent compared to \u00a37,028 million in the prior year.  Growth in net income and a lower underlying impairment charge was partly offset by expected higher operating costs and remediation. Underlying profit in the fourth quarter was down 14 per cent compared to the third quarter, with the impairment credit more than offset by lower underlying net interest income, higher operating lease depreciation and higher total costs, impacted by the bank levy, severance charges and remediation.\n\n## Net income A\n\n|                                           | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   | Change %   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------|\n| Underlying net interest income            | 13,765    | 13,172    | 5          |\n| Underlying other income 1                 | 5,123     | 4,666     | 1 0        |\n| Operating lease depreciation 2            | (956)     | (373)     |            |\n| Net income A,1                            | 17,932    | 17,465    | 3          |\n| Banking net interest margin A             | 3.11%     | 2.9 4%    | 17bp       |\n| Average interest-earning banking assets A | \u00a3453.3bn  | \u00a3452.0bn  |            |\n\nNet income of \u00a317,932 million was up 3 per cent on the prior year, with higher net interest income and underlying other income, partially offset by an increased charge for operating lease depreciation. Net interest income in the year of \u00a313,765 million was up  5 per cent, driven by a stronger banking net interest margin of 3.11 per cent (2022: 2.94 per cent), in line with guidance and higher average interestearning banking assets. The net interest margin benefited from UK Bank Rate increases and higher structural hedge earnings from the rising rate environment, partly offset by expected headwinds due to deposit mix effects and asset margin compression, particularly in the mortgage book. Average interest-earning banking assets at \u00a3453.3 billion modestly increased compared to 2022 although slightly lower than the fourth quarter of 2022 as expected. The increase in average interest earning assets in the year was due to the open mortgage book, Retail unsecured and the European retail business, offset by closed mortgage book run-off and continued repayments of government-backed lending in the Small and Medium Businesses portfolio. Net interest income in 2023 included non-banking interest expense of \u00a3311 million (2022: \u00a3111 million), which continues to increase as a result of higher funding costs and growth in the Group's non-banking businesses.\n\nNet interest income in the fourth quarter of \u00a33,317 million was lower than the third quarter, with a lower net interest margin of 2.98 per cent (three months to 30 September 2023: 3.08 per cent) from mortgage pricing and deposit mix headwinds, including in Small and Medium Businesses, partly mitigated by the structural hedge and a modest reduction in average interest earning assets. The Group expects the banking net interest margin for 2024 to be greater than 290 basis points with average interest-earning assets over 2024 expected to be greater than \u00a3450 billion.\n\nThe Group manages the risk to earnings and capital from movements in interest rates by hedging the net liabilities which are stable or less sensitive to movements in rates. The notional balance of the sterling structural hedge was \u00a3247 billion (31 December 2022: \u00a3255 billion, 30 September 2023: \u00a3251 billion) with a weighted average duration of approximately three-and-a-half years (31 December 2022: approximately three-and-a-half years), representing a modest notional balance reduction in the second half of the year, consistent with guidance. The Group expects a further modest reduction in the notional balance during 2024, stabilising over the course of the year. The Group generated \u00a33.4 billion of total income from sterling structural hedge balances in 2023, representing material growth over the prior year (2022: \u00a32.6 billion). The Group expects sterling structural hedge earnings in 2024 to be c.\u00a30.7 billion higher than in 2023.\n\nUnderlying other income in 2023 of \u00a35,123 million was 10 per cent higher compared to \u00a34,666 million in 2022. This was driven by growth across Retail, Commercial Banking and Insurance, Pensions and Investments. Underlying other income was broadly stable in the fourth quarter versus the third, with consistent business unit performance and some impact from severe weather event claims in the Insurance business.\n\nRetail underlying other income was up 25 per cent on 2022, due to higher current account and credit card activity, improved Lex performance and growth from the acquisition of Tusker. Within Commercial Banking 8 per cent growth in the year reflected improved performance in capital markets financing and trading. Insurance, Pensions and Investments underlying other income was 26 per cent higher than the prior year driven by business growth, favourable market returns and the accounting unwind benefit of adding a drawdown feature in 2022 to existing longstanding and workplace pension business. In Equity Investments and Central Items underlying other income was impacted mainly by higher funding costs on structured medium term notes in issue (offset by interest income earned on the placement of the funds raised) and to a limited extent by subdued exit markets affecting the Group's equity investment businesses.\n\nThe Group delivered good organic growth in Insurance, Pensions and Investments and Wealth (reported within Retail) assets under administration (AuA), with combined \u00a35.4 billion net new money in open book AuA over the year. In total, open book AuA now stand at c. \u00a3179 billion.\n\nOperating lease depreciation of \u00a3956 million increased compared to the prior year (2022: \u00a3373 million). This reflects the declines in used car prices (notably in the fourth quarter), impacting portfolio valuations and gains on disposals, the depreciation cost of higher value vehicles and the Tusker acquisition in the first quarter and its subsequent growth. The \u00a3371 million charge in the quarter is elevated due to a sharp reduction in used car prices and updated residual value provisions. Before the provision increase the charge would have been c.\u00a3270 million in the fourth quarter, from which modest further increases are expected in 2024 as this charge nears normalisation and growth continues.",

Operating costs were in line with guidance at \u00a39,140 million, up 5 per cent, with higher planned strategic investment, severance charges, new business costs and inflationary impacts, partially mitigated by continued cost efficiency. Operating costs were higher in the fourth quarter than in the third, impacted by the bank levy as well as severance charges. The Group's cost:income ratio, including remediation, for the year was 54.7 per cent, compared to 51.1 per cent in the prior year. Operating costs are expected to be c.\u00a39.3 billion in 2024, reflecting severance charges and slightly higher than expected inflation. This does not include a potential cost increase of around \u00a30.1 billion, driven by a sector wide change to the way in which the Bank of England charges for supervisory costs. If enacted, this will result in an equivalent, offsetting net interest income gain and have a net neutral profit impact.\n\nThe Group recognised remediation costs of \u00a3675 million in the year (2022: \u00a3255 million), with \u00a3541 million in the fourth quarter, in relation to pre-existing programmes and the potential impact of the recently announced FCA review into historical motor finance commission arrangements. There have been no further charges relating to HBOS Reading and the provision held continues to reflect the Group's best estimate of its full liability, albeit uncertainties remain.\n\nThe Group has recognised a charge of \u00a3450 million for costs and potential redress in light of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) section 166 review of historical motor finance commission arrangements and sales across several firms announced in January 2024. The review follows the recent decisions by the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) in favour of the customer in relation to motor finance commission complaints. The charge includes estimates for operational and legal costs, including litigation costs, together with estimates for potential awards, based on various scenarios using a range of assumptions, including for example, commission models, commission rates, applicable time periods (between 2007 and 2021), response rates and uphold rates. Costs and awards could arise in the event that the FCA concludes there has been misconduct and customer loss that requires remediation, or from adverse litigation decisions. However, while the FCA review is progressing there is significant uncertainty as to the extent of misconduct and customer loss, if any, the nature and extent of any remediation action, if required, and its timing. The ultimate financial impact could therefore materially differ from the amount provided, both higher or lower. The Group welcomes the FCA intervention through an independent section 166 review.\n\n## Underlying impairment A\n\n|                                                         | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   | Change %   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------|\n| Charges (credits) pre-updated MES 1                     |           |           |            |\n| Retail                                                  | 1,064     | 773       | (38)       |\n| Commercial Banking                                      | (487)     | 122       |            |\n| Other                                                   | (12)      | 20        |            |\n|                                                         | 565       | 915       | 38         |\n| Updated economic outlook                                |           |           |            |\n| Retail                                                  | (233)     | 600       |            |\n| Commercial Banking                                      | (24)      | 395       |            |\n| Other                                                   | -         | (400)     |            |\n|                                                         | (257)     | 595       |            |\n| Underlying impairment charge A                          | 308       | 1,510     | 8 0        |\n| Asset quality ratio A                                   | 0. 07%    | 0.3 2 %   | (0.25) bp  |\n| Total expected credit loss allowance (at end of year) A | 4,337     | 5,284     | 18         |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAsset quality remains strong with credit performance across portfolios relatively stable in the quarter and remaining broadly at, or favourable to pre-pandemic experience. Underlying impairment was \u00a3308 million (2022: \u00a31,510 million), resulting in an asset quality ratio of 7 basis points. The fourth quarter impairment credit of \u00a3541 million includes the impact of a significant write-back following the full repayment of debt from a single name client. The charge for 2023 also benefits from a net \u00a3257 million multiple economic scenarios (MES) release (2022: \u00a3595 million charge), including a \u00a3188 million release in the fourth quarter, reflecting modest revisions to the Group's economic outlook. Given this outlook and ongoing portfolio resilience, the Group now expects the asset quality ratio to be less than 30 basis points in 2024.\n\nThe pre-updated MES impairment charge was \u00a3565 million (2022: \u00a3915 million), including a net \u00a3487 million release in Commercial Banking largely driven by the significant write-back in the fourth quarter. Excluding this, the equivalent asset quality ratio for the year was 29 basis points, also in line with guidance of less than 30 basis points. Compared to the prior year, while performance has been resilient, there has been modest deterioration from a low base, primarily in legacy variable rate UK mortgage portfolios. The impairment charge also includes the impact of higher discount rates reducing the value of future recoveries, as well as the expected credit loss (ECL) allowance build from Stage 1 loans rolling forward into a deteriorating economic outlook.",

        "page_content": "In UK mortgages, new to arrears were relatively stable throughout 2023, having increased slightly at the start of the year. Flows to default increased through the year, also largely driven by legacy variable rate customers as mentioned above, with trends stabilising in the second half. Unsecured portfolios continue to exhibit stable new to arrears and default trends broadly at, or below pre-pandemic levels. The Commercial Banking portfolio's credit quality remains resilient with limited deterioration.\n\nThe ECL allowance of \u00a34.3 billion (31 December 2022: \u00a35.3 billion) continues to reflect a probability-weighted view of economic scenarios built out from the base case and its associated conditioning assumptions. Consistent with prior years, a 30 per cent weighting is applied to the base case, upside and downside scenarios and a 10 per cent weighting to the severe downside. GDP growth remained subdued at 0.5 per cent in 2023 and is expected to remain low in future years with unemployment expected to rise modestly to 5.2 per cent by the end of 2024. House prices proved more resilient in the second half of the year than previously assumed and as a result the latest base case assumes a more modest fall in 2024 of 2.2 per cent (30 September 2023: 2.4 per cent).\n\nOverall, judgemental adjustments to ECL at \u00a30.1 billion have reduced by \u00a30.3 billion in the year. Notably, reductions related to adjustments now captured within models and the impact of taking a larger negative adjustment reducing ECL to reflect resilient corporate insolvency rates within the portfolio. Key judgemental adjustments remain in place to cover continued risks from higher base rate and inflationary pressures in the Retail portfolios as well as risks from current valuations in certain Commercial Real Estate segments.\n\nStage 2 assets have reduced in the year to \u00a356.5 billion (31 December 2022: \u00a365.7 billion), with 91.3 per cent of Stage 2 loans up to date (31 December 2022: 92.7 per cent). Stage 3 assets at \u00a310.1 billion have reduced in the fourth quarter and relative to the end of 2022 (31 December 2022: \u00a310.8 billion). These reductions in Stage 2 and Stage 3 include the impact from asset transfers from Stage 2 to Stage 1 as a result of improvements in the economic forecasts and the securitisations of legacy Retail mortgages in the first quarter and Retail unsecured loans in the fourth quarter, as well as the full repayment of debt from a large single name client in Stage 3.\n\n## Restructuring, volatility and other items\n\n|                                       | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   | Change %   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------|\n| Underlying profit A,1                 | 7,809     | 7,028     | 11         |\n| Restructuring                         | (154)     | (80)      | (93)       |\n| Volatility and other items 1          |           |           |            |\n| Market volatility and asset sales 1   | 35        | (1,978)   |            |\n| Amortisation of purchased intangibles | (80)      | (70)      | (14)       |\n| Fair value unwind                     | (107)     | (118)     | 9          |\n|                                       | (152)     | (2,166)   | 93         |\n| Statutory profit before tax 1         | 7,503     | 4,782     | 57         |\n| Tax expense 1                         | (1,985)   | (859)     |            |\n| Statutory profit after tax 1          | 5,518     | 3,923     | 4 1        |\n| Earnings per share 1                  | 7.6p      | 4.9p      | 2.7p       |\n| Return on tangible equity A,1         | 15.8%     | 9.8%      | 6 . 0  p p |\n| Tangible net assets per share A,1     | 50.8p     | 46.5p     | 4.3p       |\n\nRestructuring costs for the year were \u00a3154 million (2022: \u00a380 million) and include costs relating to the integration of Embark and Tusker, as well as one-off costs to ensure the continuity of some customer communication services following the administration of a key supplier. Volatility and other items were a net loss of \u00a3152 million for the year (2022: net loss of \u00a32,166 million). This comprised \u00a335 million positive market volatility and asset sales, \u00a380 million for the amortisation of purchased intangibles (2022: \u00a370 million) and \u00a3107 million relating to fair value unwind (2022: \u00a3118 million). Market volatility and asset sales included positive banking volatility, partly offset by negative impacts from insurance volatility. Volatility and other items in 2022 included an exceptional charge under IFRS 17 from contract modifications in Insurance, Pensions and Investments, predominantly in the second half, following the addition of a drawdown feature to existing longstanding and workplace pensions as a significant customer enhancement.\n\nFurther information on the reconciliation of underlying to statutory results is included on page 68.\n\nThe return on tangible equity for the year was 15.8 per cent (2022: 9.8 per cent), reflecting the Group's robust financial performance. The Group expects the return on tangible equity for 2024 to be c.13 per cent. Earnings per share were 7.6 pence for the year (2022: 4.9 pence).\n\nTangible net assets per share as at 31 December 2023 were 50.8 pence, up from 46.5 pence at 31 December 2022. The increase resulted from higher profits, cash flow hedge reserve unwind and a reduction in the number of shares following the share buyback programme announced in February 2023, partly offset by a negative market impact on the pensions accounting surplus, and capital distributions. Tangible net assets per share were 3.6 pence higher than at 30 September 2023 given continued profitability and an increase in the cash flow hedge reserve following interest rate movements, partly offset by pensions surplus changes. The share buyback programme in respect of 2022 completed on 25 August 2023, with c.4.4 billion (c.7 per cent) ordinary shares repurchased.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe Group recognised a tax expense of \u00a31,985 million in the year (2022: \u00a3859 million) reflecting the increased profits. The prior year included a \u00a3222 million benefit in relation to tax deductibility of provisions made in 2021.  The Group expects a medium-term effective tax rate of around 27 per cent, which includes the impact of the reduction in the rate of banking surcharge and the increase in the corporation tax rate from 19 per cent to 25 per cent, both of which came into effect on 1 April 2023. An explanation of the relationship between the tax expense and the Group's accounting profit for the year is set out in note 19 on page 252 .",

Excluding these movements, loans and advances to customers were stable, with \u00a34.7 billion growth across unsecured, UK Motor Finance and European retail lending, offset by a \u00a30.7 billion reduction in the open mortgage book, a \u00a31.8 billion reduction in the closed mortgage book and a \u00a34.7 billion reduction in Small and Medium Businesses, principally from repayment of government-backed lending. During the fourth quarter, loans and advances to customers reduced by \u00a32.4 billion, mainly due to the impact of the securitisation of \u00a32.7 billion of Retail unsecured loans. Securitisation activity is conducted to manage risk on the balance sheet and to offset regulatory capital pressures, where market opportunities allow net present value positive transactions for the Group.\n\nCustomer deposits at \u00a3471.4 billion decreased by \u00a33.9 billion (1 per cent) since the end of 2022. This includes a decrease in Retail current account balances of \u00a311.3 billion as a result of higher spend and a more competitive savings market, including the Group's own savings offers. In Retail savings and Wealth, balances have increased by a combined \u00a38.9 billion, with a significant proportion transferred from the Group's current account customer base given attractive customer offers. Commercial Banking deposits were down \u00a31.0 billion during 2023, reflecting targeted growth in Corporate and Institutional Banking offset by a reduction in Small and Medium Businesses. The trend of customer deposit mix change within the Group was slower in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.\n\nThe Group has a large, high quality liquid asset portfolio held mainly in cash and government bonds, with all assets hedged for interest rate risk. The Group's liquid assets continue to significantly exceed regulatory requirements and internal risk appetite, with a stable and strong liquidity coverage ratio of 142 per cent (31 December 2022: 144 per cent) and a strong net stable funding ratio of 130 per cent (31 December 2022: 130 per cent). The loan to deposit ratio of 95 per cent, broadly stable on 2022, continues to reflect a robust funding and liquidity position and offers the potential for lending growth.

        "page_content": "The Group's pro forma CET1 capital ratio at 31 December 2023 was 13.7 per cent (31 December 2022: 14.1 per cent pro forma). Capital generation before regulatory headwinds during the year was 223 basis points, reflecting strong banking build, the \u00a3250 million dividend received from the Insurance business and other movements. These impacts were partially offset by risk-weighted asset increases (before CRD IV model updates within Retail secured and net of optimisation) and the full year payment (\u00a3800 million) of fixed pension deficit contributions made to the Group's three main defined benefit pension schemes. Regulatory headwinds of 50 basis points largely reflect a \u00a35 billion risk-weighted assets adjustment for part of the impact of Retail secured CRD IV model updates. They also reflect the end of IFRS 9 static transitional relief and the reduction in the transitional factor applied to IFRS 9 dynamic relief. Capital generation after the impact of these regulatory headwinds was 173 basis points. This benefited by just under 30 basis points from an impairment credit driven by a significant write-back in the fourth quarter which was materially offset by around 15 basis points in relation to the \u00a3450 million charge arising from the potential impact of the FCA review of historical motor finance commission arrangements.\n\nThe impact of the interim ordinary dividend paid in September 2023 and the accrual for the recommended final ordinary dividend equated to 86 basis points, with a further 98 basis points utilised to cover the accrual for the announced ordinary share buyback programme and 9 basis points for variable pension contributions reflecting the payment to address the \u00a3250 million residual aggregate deficit in the fourth quarter. The acquisition of Tusker utilised 21 basis points of capital.\n\nExcluding the Insurance dividend received in February 2024 and the full impact of the announced ordinary share buyback programme, the Group's CET1 capital ratio at 31 December 2023 was 14.6 per cent (31 December 2022: 15.1 per cent).\n\nThe Group expects capital generation in 2024 to be c.175 basis points after taking further expected in-year regulatory headwinds and reaffirms guidance for capital generation in 2026 of greater than 200 basis points.\n\nRisk-weighted assets have increased by \u00a38.2 billion during the year to \u00a3219.1 billion at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: \u00a3210.9 billion). This includes the impact of Retail secured CRD IV model updates of \u00a35 billion, of which a further \u00a32 billion was recognised in the fourth quarter. Excluding this, lending, operational and market risk increases, a modest uplift from credit and model calibrations and other movements were partly offset by optimisation, including capital efficient securitisation activity within the balance sheet. In relation to the Retail secured CRD IV models, it is estimated that a further \u00a35 billion increase will be required over 2024 to 2026, noting that this will be subject to final model outcomes. The Group's risk-weighted assets guidance for 2024 remains unchanged at between \u00a3220 billion and \u00a3225 billion.\n\nThe PRA provided an update to the Group's Pillar 2A CET1 capital requirement during the fourth quarter, with the requirement remaining at around 1.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets. In July 2023 the Group's countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) rate increased to 1.8 per cent (from 0.9 per cent) in total following the increase in the UK CCyB rate to 2 per cent (from 1 per cent). As a result, the Group's regulatory CET1 capital requirement is now around 12 per cent. The Board's revised view of the ongoing level of CET1 capital required to grow the business, meet current and future regulatory requirements and cover economic and business uncertainties is now 13.0 per cent (previously 13.5 per cent). This continues to include a management buffer of around 1 per cent. In order to manage risks and distributions in an orderly way, the Board therefore expects to pay down to c.13.5 per cent by the end of 2024 before progressing towards paying down to the revised capital target of 13.0 per cent by the end of 2026.\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe Group has completed the triennial valuation of its main defined benefit pension schemes as at 31 December 2022. Following a fixed contribution of \u00a3800 million in the first half of 2023, a residual aggregate deficit of \u00a3250 million was agreed with the Trustee which the Group paid in December 2023. There will be no further deficit contributions, fixed or variable, for this triennial period (to 31 December 2025).\n\n## Dividend and share buyback\n\nThe Group has a progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy whilst maintaining the flexibility to return further surplus capital through buybacks or special dividends.\n\nIn February 2023, the Board decided to return surplus capital in respect of 2022 through a share buyback programme of up to \u00a32 billion. This commenced in February 2023 and completed on 25 August 2023 with c.4.4 billion (c.7 per cent) ordinary shares repurchased.\n\nThe Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 1.84 pence per share, which, together with the interim ordinary dividend of 0.92 pence per share totals 2.76 pence per share, an increase of 15 per cent compared to 2022, in line with the Board's commitment to capital returns. The Board has also announced its intention to implement an ordinary share buyback of up to \u00a32.0 billion which will commence as soon as is practicable and is expected to be completed by 31 December 2024.\n\nBased on the total ordinary dividend and the intended ordinary share buyback the total capital return in respect of 2023 will be up to \u00a33.8 billion, equivalent to c.14 per cent 1 of the Group's market capitalisation value.\n\n- 1 Market capitalisation as at 16 February 2024.\n\n## Other financial information\n\n## Post-tax return on average assets\n\n|                                   |   2023 % |   2022 1 % |\n|-----------------------------------|----------|------------|\n| Post-tax return on average assets |     0.63 |       0.44 |\n\n## Share buyback in respect of 2022 results\n\nDuring 2023, the Group completed a \u00a32 billion share buyback programme, in respect of 2022 results, with c.4.4 billion shares purchased at an average price of 45.59 pence per share. Through a reduction in the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, share buybacks have the effect of increasing earnings per share and, depending on the average price paid per share, can either increase or decrease the tangible net assets per share. The share buyback in respect of 2022 results had the effect of increasing the earnings per share by 0.3 pence and increasing the tangible net assets per share by 3.3 pence.",

IFRS requires that changes in both the value of the liabilities and investments are reflected within the income statement. The value of the liabilities does not move exactly in line with changes in the value of the investments. As the investments are substantial, movements in their value can have a significant impact on the profitability of the Group. Management believes that it is appropriate to disclose the division's results on the basis of an expected return. The impact of the actual return on these investments differing from the expected return is included within insurance volatility. Insurance volatility on business accounted for under the Variable Fee Approach (largely unit-linked pensions business) is deferred to the CSM, other than where the risk mitigation option is applied. Policyholder interests volatility is driven by the additional management charges made to some life product customers to cover the extra tax on their products. Underlying profit therefore includes the expected charge or credit for the year, with the variance to expectation included in volatility.\n\nDuring 2023 the movement in the Insurance volatility line above was driven by increases to equity market levels which resulted in profit from application of the risk mitigation option. At total level this was more than offset by losses from hedging arrangements.\n\nThe Group manages its Insurance business exposures to equity, interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, inflation and market movements within the Insurance, Pensions and Investments division. It does so by balancing the importance of managing the impacts to both capital and earnings volatility.",

Also included are income and expenses not attributed to other divisions, including residual underlying net interest income after transfer pricing (which includes the recharging to other divisions of the Group's external AT1 distributions), in period gains from gilt sales and the unwind of associated hedging costs.\n\nNet income for the year was higher compared to 2022, with stronger underlying net interest income partly offset by weaker underlying other income. Underlying net interest income benefited from the effect of rising rates on income earned from the placement of funds raised through the issuance of structured medium-term notes (offset within underlying other income by the increased funding costs of the notes) as well as higher internal recharges to other divisions as a result of increased AT1 distribution costs. Underlying other income was weaker, primarily due to higher funding costs and also subdued exit markets affecting the Group's equity investment businesses. Total costs of \u00a3163 million in 2023 were higher than in 2022, in part due to the costs of business growth in equity investment businesses, including Citra Living.\n\nUnderlying impairment was a \u00a35 million credit compared to a \u00a3392 million credit in 2022. The credit in 2022 relates to the release of the expected credit loss central adjustment of \u00a3400 million held at the end of 2021. This adjustment was not allocated to specific portfolios and was applied in respect of uncertainty in the economic outlook, relating to the risks of COVID-19.",

This is to enable a comprehensive understanding of the Group and facilitate comparison with peers. The Group Executive Committee, which is the 'chief operating decision maker' (as defined by IFRS 8 Operating Segments) for the Group, reviews the Group's results on an underlying basis in order to assess performance and allocate resources. Management uses underlying profit before tax, an alternative performance measure, as a measure of performance and believes that it provides important information for investors. This is because it allows for a comparable representation of the Group's performance by removing the impact of items such as volatility caused by market movements outside the control of management.\n\nIn arriving at underlying profit, statutory profit before tax is adjusted for the items below, to allow a comparison of the Group's underlying performance:\n\n- \u00b7 Restructuring costs relating to merger, acquisition and integration activities\n- \u00b7 Volatility and other items, which includes the effects of certain asset sales, the volatility relating to the Group's hedging arrangements and that arising in the Insurance business, the unwind of acquisition-related fair value adjustments and the amortisation of purchased intangible assets\n- \u00b7 Losses from insurance and participating investment contract modifications relating to the enhancement to the Group's longstanding and workplace pension business through the addition of a drawdown feature\n\nThe analysis of lending and expected credit loss (ECL) allowances is presented on both a statutory and an underlying basis and a reconciliation between the two is shown on page 164 . On a statutory basis, purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) assets include a fixed pool of mortgages that were purchased as part of the HBOS acquisition at a deep discount to face value reflecting credit losses incurred from the point of origination to the date of acquisition. Over time, these POCI assets will run off as the loans redeem, pay down or losses crystallise. The underlying basis assumes that the lending assets acquired as part of a business combination were originated by the Group and are classified as either Stage 1, 2 or 3 according to the change in credit risk over the period since origination. Underlying ECL allowances have been calculated accordingly. The Group uses the underlying basis to monitor the creditworthiness of the lending portfolio and related ECL allowances.\n\nThe Group calculates a number of metrics that are used throughout the banking and insurance industries on an underlying basis. These metrics are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies and are not any more authoritative than measures presented in the financial statements, however management believes that they are useful in assessing the performance of the Group and in drawing comparisons between years. A description of these measures and their calculation, is given below. Alternative performance measures are used internally in the Group's Monthly Management Report.\n\n| Asset quality ratio                                                | The underlying impairment charge or credit for the period in respect of loans and advances to customers, both drawn  and undrawn, expressed as a percentage of average gross loans and advances to customers for the period.

        "page_content": "## Chair's introduction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSince the Group launched its strategy in February 2022, the environment in which we operate has changed significantly. The Board is acutely aware that macroeconomic uncertainties, societal challenges and geopolitical tensions are having a profound impact on people, businesses and society. It is in this context that the Group remains committed to its strategy, including delivering higher, more sustainable returns for our shareholders, aligned to our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper. Strong governance provides the foundation for the Group to help our customers finance their ambitions and grow whilst navigating this challenging external environment. At the same time, it ensures we address the environmental, social and economic concerns of our wider stakeholders in an effective and appropriate manner.\n\nDuring 2023, the Board has overseen the executive's continued delivery of the Group's strategic transformation and has focused on sound risk management, including a review of operational resilience. The strength of our organisation also depends on our people and our culture and we are conscious of the impact that the strategic implementation is having on our colleagues. Listening sessions with colleagues during 2023 provided valuable insight on how colleagues are experiencing our culture and, crucially, on how our leaders are being empowered to drive the fast-paced change required for the successful delivery of our strategy.\n\nOn the topic of culture at Board level, I have been particularly pleased by the open and collaborative relationship the Board has continued to develop with the executive. Together with providing constructive challenge on strategic implementation, the Board encourages the executives to share new plans at an early stage in order for the Board to provide feedback as those plans evolve.\n\nBelow I highlight some of the governance activities that took place during 2023.\n\n## Board oversight of strategy\n\nAs I mentioned above, the Board has overseen the continued implementation of the Group's strategy, providing feedback on the sequencing of changes and investment priorities, together with monitoring key performance indicators - read more on page 81 .\n\n## Focus on risk management\n\nGiven the scale of change required to deliver the Group's strategic transformation, the Board, the Board Risk Committee and the Group's Information Technology and Cyber Advisory Forum (ITCAF) have each played a vital role in evaluating change and execution risk and overseeing operational resilience requirements. Read more on risk management on pages 101 to 106 .\n\n## Promoting a healthy culture\n\nBuilding on previous years' commitments to promoting a values-led culture, the Board has deepened its understanding of colleague and customer sentiment. Further details on the Board's role in overseeing the embedding of a healthy corporate culture can be found on page 86 .\n\n## Diversity, equity and inclusion\n\nInclusion lies at the heart of the Group's purpose and increasing diversity in the broadest sense, including diversity of thought and background, remains a priority for the Board. Further information on progress made on diversity, equity and inclusion throughout all levels of the organisation is set out on pages 94 to 96 and 107 .\n\n## Climate ambitions\n\nThe Board, through its Responsible Business Committee, has overseen the Group's sustainability strategy. The Group now has 10 sector-specific Net Zero Banking Alliance targets together with its overall banking ambition and investment target. In addition to our supply chain ambition, a further three new pledges for water, waste and nature were announced in November for our own operations. Further details can be found on pages 84 and 107 .\n\n## Board and Committee changes\n\nSuccession planning and the composition of the Board are important components of good governance. Alan Dickinson and Lord Lupton will retire at the 2024 annual general meeting after serving nine years and almost seven years respectively on the Board. We are deeply grateful to Alan for the wisdom and insight he has brought to the Board over a long period as both Deputy Chair and formerly as Senior Independent Director and in the many important Committee roles he has held and to James for his leadership as the inaugural Chair of Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc and for his significant contribution to the Board. They leave with our thanks and best wishes for the future.\n\nCathy Turner took over from Alan Dickinson as Chair of the Remuneration Committee and as Senior Independent Director in September 2023.\n\nNathan Bostock will be appointed as a non-executive director of the Group and, subject to regulatory approval, Chair of Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc, in each case with effect from 1 August 2024. Nathan was Chief Executive Officer of Santander UK from 2014 until 2022 and, prior to that, an executive director and Group Chief Financial Officer of The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and previously its Chief Risk Officer. Nathan\u03e0s financial services experience and UK banking market knowledge will be invaluable to his roles with the Group.\n\nRead more about Board and Committee changes on page 94 .\n\n## Ring-fencing governance\n\nAlthough this is Lloyds Banking Group plc's corporate governance report, I would like to thank Nigel Hinshelwood, Sarah Bentley and Brendan Gilligan for their continued and valued contribution as non-executive directors of Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc (the Ring-Fenced Banks), which represent the majority of the Group's banking activities. Further details regarding ring-fencing governance are set out on pages 76 and 87 .\n\n## Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Company's statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 can be found on page 71 .\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nUnderstanding and meeting the Group's responsibilities and duties to shareholders, customers and the communities we serve is central to our purpose and remains of utmost importance. Read more about Board stakeholder engagement on pages 82 to 83 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sir Robin Budenberg,\n\nChair",

The Board approved the Group's current strategy in February 2022 and you can read more about how the Board has overseen the implementation of the new strategy by the Group Chief Executive, supported by the wider executive management team, on page 81 .\n\nThe Group's role as a sustainable and inclusive business is central to its purpose. The Responsible Business Committee oversees the Group\u03e0s sustainability ambitions, with specific reporting and risk management responsibility in relation to sustainability-related matters (including climate) shared with the Audit Committee and Board Risk Committee. This ensures appropriate coordination and cooperation on these matters. Read about our sustainability governance structure on pages 84 to 85 .\n\nThe Board is also responsible for ensuring that the Group's culture is aligned with its purpose, values and strategy. Read more about how the Board assesses and monitors the Group's culture on page 86 .\n\nThe Board retains ultimate responsibility for ensuring the necessary resources are in place to meet agreed objectives. The effective management of risk is central to the Group's strategy, supported by the Group's enterprise risk management framework, which is discussed in the risk management report on pages 138 to 196 .\n\nThe Board recognises that engaging with, and acting on the needs of, the Group's stakeholders is key to achieving the strategy and long-term objectives of the Company.

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance Framework\n\nThe key decisions and matters reserved for the Board's approval, such as the Group's long-term strategy and priorities, are set out in the Group's Corporate Governance Framework, which is reviewed periodically by the Board. The Board is supported by its committees which make decisions or recommendations on matters as delegated to them under the Corporate Governance Framework, including Board appointments, the effectiveness of internal controls and the risk management framework, financial reporting, governance and remuneration policies. This enables the Board to spend a greater proportion of its time on strategic, forward-looking matters. Read more about the Corporate Governance Framework on page 95 .\n\nEach Board Committee comprises non-executive directors only and has an experienced chair. The Committees are managed on the same basis as the Board. The structure of each Committee seeks to facilitate open discussion and debate and ensure adequate time for Committee members to consider all proposals.\n\nThe executive directors make decisions within the parameters and principles set out in the Corporate Governance Framework, which aims to ensure that decisions are made by management under the correct authority. However, where appropriate, any activity can be brought to the full Board for consideration, even if the matter falls within agreed executive parameters.\n\nThere are executive committees established to support the Group Chief Executive (Group Chief Executive Committees), in particular the Group Executive Committee. Read about the Group Chief Executive Committees on pages 141 to 142 and see the Group Executive Committee members and attendee on page 77 .\n\n## Board meetings in 2023\n\nDuring 2023 there were nine Board meetings. There are separate boards and board committees of Lloyds Banking Group plc, Lloyds Bank plc, Bank of Scotland plc and HBOS plc, but most meetings of these companies are held concurrently and we refer to this as the 'Aligned Board Model'. As most of the Group's business sits within the Ring-Fenced Banks, the interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks, the Group and HBOS plc are aligned in most circumstances. This model is supported by a number of safeguards to enable us to operate in this way including the appointment of three RingFenced Bank only non-executive directors and a Ring-Fenced\n\nBank Risk Officer, all of whose primary focus is on protecting the interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks. Read more about the Group's governance structure and ring-fencing governance arrangements on page 87 .\n\nUpdates are provided to the Board by the Committee Chairs as well as by the Chair, the Group Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Risk Officer, and the Chairs of the Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc and Scottish Widows Group Limited boards. The Chair holds a number of meetings with the non-executive directors without the executive directors present.\n\nThe Group has a comprehensive and continuous forward agenda setting and escalation process in place to ensure that the Board has the right information at the right time and in the right format to enable the directors to bring their experience and influence to make the right decisions. The Chair leads the process, assisted by the Group Chief Executive and Company Secretary. The process ensures that sufficient time is allocated for strategic discussions and business critical items.\n\nThe process of escalating issues and agenda setting is regularly reviewed as part of the Board evaluation with enhancements made to the process, where necessary, to ensure it remains effective.\n\nThe Chair and the Committee Chairs ensure Board and Committee meetings are structured to facilitate open discussion, debate and challenge. If directors have concerns about the Company or a proposed action which cannot be resolved, their concerns are recorded in the Board minutes. Also, on resignation, non-executive directors are encouraged to provide a written statement of any concerns to the Chair, for circulation to the Board.

        "page_content": "## How governance contributes to the delivery of our strategy\n\nOur governance arrangements contribute to the development and delivery of our strategy in various ways, including by creating accountability and responsibility, information flow and independent insight from the non-executive directors.\n\nThe Board is responsible for establishing the Group's strategy and reviews the delivery of that strategy by the Group Chief Executive, supported by the wider executive management team.\n\nIn 2022 the Board approved a new strategy and in 2023 the Board reviewed aspects of the strategic transformation including opportunities and risks to delivery.\n\nThe below diagram illustrates the different ways in which the Board oversees implementation of the Group's strategy.\n\n## Board meetings\n\nStrategy has been regularly discussed at Board meetings both as part of the updates from the Group Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer and the Group Chief Operating Officer and as specific agenda items. These include updates on the progress made with the Group\u03e0s strategic transformation and on business-specific strategies such as those for the Consumer Relationships, Mass Affluent, and Insurance, Pensions and Investments (IP&I) businesses.\n\n## One-to-one discussions with management\n\nNon-executive directors have discussed the strategy at one-to-one meetings with members of senior management such as the Group Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer and the CEOs of the different businesses. This provides the non-executive directors with the opportunity to explore particular matters in greater detail outside of Board meetings.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nA number of the Board Committees have oversight of aspects of the Group's strategy. For example, the Board Risk Committee considers updates on the performance of the Group's change programme being undertaken as part of the strategy including the related execution risks and the Audit Committee provides oversight to the strategic development of the reporting environments and benefits from the independent insight provided by internal and external audit, supporting rigorous review of strategic change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategy offsites\n\nTwo strategy offsites gave the Board the opportunity to receive detailed updates on topics relating to the Group's strategic transformation, to discuss those topics with the executive management team and to provide challenge and feedback to the executive team to inform the executive team's planning and implementation.\n\n## June strategy offsite\n\nTopics at the June offsite included the Consumer Relationships strategy, the Business and Commercial Banking strategy, the external environment (including artificial intelligence) and its implications for the Group, and early views on the IP&I business from its newly appointed CEO.\n\nOutcomes of the offsite included feedback to the executive team on prioritisation of transformation initiatives and on the execution plans for the Consumer Relationships strategy and feedback on the early views of the IP&I CEO on the IP&I business.\n\n## November strategy offsite\n\nTopics at the November offsite included an update on purpose, the external environment (including the technology landscape and Generative Artificial Intelligence) and its implications for the Group, an update on strategic transformation (including on the Group's operational resilience work) and business strategy updates for the Consumer Lending business and the Business and Commercial Banking business.\n\nOutcomes of the offsite included feedback to the executive team on articulation of the Group's purpose, opportunities to revisit the pace of the strategic transformation and digital identification propositions.",

These events included sessions on the challenges of running a small business, the issues faced by vulnerable customers, the pressures for customers dealing with financial difficulties and the challenges of managing finances in retirement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nColleagues remain central to the delivery of the Group's strategic ambitions and the Board continues to recognise this in its engagement with them. Engagement this year included a variety of sessions across the Group to discuss topical issues relating to challenges both at and outside of work.\n\nAs in 2022, the Board's Responsible Business Committee has been the designated body for workforce engagement, providing focus, but with the Board retaining a commitment for individual Board members to engage with colleagues directly throughout the year. The Board considers these arrangements to be effective as they enable a broader range of colleague engagement activities, as described in this section.\n\nThe Responsible Business Committee reports regularly to the Board on all of its activities, including on its colleague engagement agenda. The Board will continue to consider its arrangements for engaging with the Group's workforce to ensure they remain effective and to encourage meaningful dialogue between the Board and colleagues.\n\n- \u00b7 Sessions were hosted by both the Chair and the Group Chief Executive, complemented by engagement sessions led by other senior leaders with feedback shared with the wider Board. The Group Chief Executive also held sessions with colleagues from a number of specific business areas across the Group\n\n- \u00b7 Board members attended a range of other events held for the Group's senior leaders and other colleague network events\n\nA number of activities took place under the programme, which included meetings with customers and clients and conversations with colleagues.

This ensures appropriate Board level coordination and cooperation on these matters.\n\nClimate risks and opportunities are identified, assessed and managed by business unit level teams governed via functional and divisional level steering groups and committees.\n\n## Our sustainability governance structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 The Chair of the Scottish Widows Board sits on the Group Board. The Scottish Widows CEO sits on the Group Executive Committee and will update the Group Executive Committee on relevant insurance matters which can include papers for Group Executive Committee approval.\n- 2 The Chair of the Responsible Business Committee, Amanda Mackenzie, is a non-executive director on the Board, a member of the Remuneration Committee, the Nomination and Governance Committee and, as of 1 January 2024, the Audit Committee, and ensures that sustainability is discussed and considered by the Board. Amanda has extensive experience in ESG matters, including helping launch the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\n- 3 The Group Net Zero Committee and the Group Risk Committee provide oversight from an environmental perspective only.\n\nThe Responsible Business Committee oversees the Group's delivery of its purpose including the delivery of our sustainability strategy (including climate-related matters). Training has been provided to Committee members on upcoming sustainability regulation and themes of nature and biodiversity. For further details see the sustainability report .\n\nOne of the key areas of Board level involvement in 2023 was the approval of three additional Net Zero Banking Alliance sector targets and enhancement of our operational emissions targets. The Responsible Business Chair statement provides an overview of the Responsible Business Committee's involvement in the Group's sustainability progress and performance - read more on page 107 .\n\nWe engage proactively with investors and other key stakeholders throughout the year on our sustainability priorities and plans. Given net zero and sustainability are at the heart of our purposedriven strategy, with ambitious climate targets reflected in strategic objectives, the good progress already being made in this area and the Group's existing focus on disclosure, transparency and engagement, the Board does not believe it is necessary to propose a separate climate vote at the Company's 2024 annual general meeting at this time. We will continue to be transparent on our sustainability strategy, targets, plans and progress. We will continue to consider on a regular basis whether to propose a climate vote.\n\n## Executive level governance\n\nThe accountable executive for the Group's sustainability strategy is the Chief Sustainability Officer and Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, with relevant teams in place to drive this strategy forward. There are three key committees that provide management oversight from an executive level: the Group Net Zero Committee, the Group Risk Committee and the Group Executive Committee. These are supported by a number of divisional and function-level teams who consider sustainability topics.\n\n## Group Executive Committee and Group Net Zero Committee governance\n\nUpdates on the key areas of the Group's sustainability strategy are provided to the Responsible Business Committee by the Group Executive Committee on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe Group Net Zero Committee provides direction and oversight of the Group environmental sustainability strategy, including particular focus on the net zero transition and nature strategy, as well as oversight of the Group's approach to meeting external environmental commitments and targets, including progress in relation to the requirements of the Net Zero Banking Alliance.\n\n## Group Risk Committee governance\n\nResponsibility for overseeing the management of financial risks from climate change rests with the relevant Chief Risk Officers across the Group, who have Senior Management Function (SMF) responsibility covering the Ring-Fenced Banks (Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc), Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets and the Solvency II regulated entities in Scottish Widows Group (under Scottish Widows Group, the Finance Director has additional SMF responsibilities to manage the risks while the Chief Risk Officer has oversight).\n\nClimate risk is considered through the Group's monthly risk reporting to the Group Risk Committee, in addition to standalone updates on a half-yearly basis which inform discussions at the Board Risk Committee. Relevant updates are also provided across the Group's key legal entities, as required. Additional engagement on relevant climate-related matters is undertaken through the existing risk governance structure, for example, sector risks and opportunities related to climate are presented and discussed at senior credit forums.\n\nProgramme governance is also in place for oversight of plans to develop the Group's climate risk management and scenario analysis capabilities.",

These Committees meet at least quarterly with sustainability matters, including climate, discussed at a number of these meetings.\n\n## Lloyds Banking Group plc Board\n\n## Responsible Business Committee\n\n## Audit Committee\n\n## Board Risk Committee\n\n## Topics discussed\n\n- \u00b7 Approval of our environmental strategy update, sector targets and methodology for three additional Net Zero Banking Alliance sector targets\n- \u00b7 Approval of external sector statement updates\n- \u00b7 Review of proposals for enhancement of our operational emission targets including a more ambitious direct carbon emissions reduction and approval of new water, waste and nature pledges\n- \u00b7 Monitoring of progress across the Group on implementation of credible transition plan efforts\n- \u00b7 Discussion of sustainabilityrelated opportunities across the Group\n- \u00b7 Update on nature-related matters and the impact on our Group sustainability strategy\n\nFor further detail on other sustainability-related matters discussed in 2023 see the Responsible Business Committee report on page 107\n\n## Topics discussed\n\n- \u00b7 Review of new regulations including International Sustainability Standards Board, Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and Climaterelated Financial Disclosures\n- \u00b7 Activity to assess impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the financial statements including quantification of impacts of climate risk on Expected Credit Loss\n- \u00b7 Understanding the control environment embedded to support 2023 sustainability reporting\n- \u00b7 Review of integrated sustainability reporting for the Group in 2023\n- \u00b7 Climate data requirements were discussed at a joint Audit and Risk Committee Forum\n\nFor further detail on matters discussed in 2023 see the Audit Committee report on pages 97 to 100\n\n## Non-executive director visits\n\nAmanda Mackenzie (Chair of the Responsible Business Committee) and Lord Lupton (member of the Responsible Business Committee) visited West Yorkshire in July 2023.\n\nTheir first stop was Halifax Town Centre and the Group\u03e0s Trinity Road site, where the Group has recently implemented a new energy solution for the site. The Group has removed its natural gas reliance there by introducing a ground source heat pump utilising the natural water that runs below Halifax Town Centre.\n\nAmanda Mackenzie and Lord Lupton then visited the Halifax branch on Commercial Street, Leeds and met with colleagues. The branch had recently gone through a full transformation to make the branch sustainable, change the internal design and layout to the latest style and improve the digital approach in branch to support customer education.\n\nSir Robin Budenberg (Group Chair and a member of the Responsible Business Committee) visited the Group\u03e0s office on Old Broad Street in London in December 2023 to witness first-hand how sustainability is at the heart of the Group\u03e0s office refurbishment project there. Using the latest air-source heat pumps to warm and cool the building, the Group aims to reduce energy use on the site by an estimated 63 per cent, fully supporting our carbon and energy reduction pledges. The Group has been able to recycle or repurpose 99 per cent of the waste that came out of the building.\n\n## Topics discussed\n\n- \u00b7 Overview of activities to meet regulatory expectations, with detailed updates on key areas (e.g. credit integration, scenario analysis)\n- \u00b7 Approvals of Board risk appetite for climate risk\n- \u00b7 Update on net zero strategies including trade-offs between different decisions\n- \u00b7 Update on the Group's approach to embedding climate risk in its enterprise risk management framework\n- \u00b7 Climate data requirements were discussed at a joint Audit and Risk Committee Forum\n\nFor further detail on matters discussed in 2023 see the Board Risk Committee report on pages 101 to 106\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the culture element of the programme our Board is provided with a range of events and listening sessions with colleagues, giving the Board valuable insight to inform its decision making. Towards the end of 2022, the decision was made to align topics for colleague sessions to key themes arising from colleague surveys.\n\nOne session focused on leaders, assessing the impact our Grow with Purpose Programme has had on them leading the transformation of our business. The discussion focused on how leaders are communicating the strategic direction and what barriers are getting in the way of driving fast-paced change.\n\nAnother session focused on our strategy, our colleagues' understanding of it and the impact it is having on customers. This session also looked at the cost of living challenges and how colleagues feel they are being supported by the Group with these challenges.\n\nThe Board continues to monitor culture progress and colleague sentiment and engagement by drawing insight from colleague engagement surveys and monthly pulse surveys.\n\n## We gathered insight\n\nWe looked at data and insights from the following sources:\n\n- \u00b7 Colleague surveys: 81 per cent of colleagues responded to our annual all-colleague survey in November\n- \u00b7 Conducted monthly pulse surveys with 25 per cent of the organisation each time to focus on key topics\n- \u00b7 Analysed sentiment from internal and external sources including nearly 200,000 comments from our annual survey\n- \u00b7 Tapped into sentiment being expressed about the world of work online to see external trends and influences\n- \u00b7 Refocused existing metrics to create a culture dashboard focusing on the internal and external environment - and developed this at an organisation and business area level\n\n## Consumer Duty\n\n2023 has seen the implementation of Consumer Duty. This has included the design and management of the culture workstream for Consumer Duty which was delivered successfully for 31 July 2023, the date on which Consumer Duty came into force for the Group, and continues to be embedded through our ongoing Consumer Duty culture work. This work has been in multiple phases:\n\n- \u00b7 All-colleague training and was completed by more than 99 per cent of colleagues by the end of July 2023\n- \u00b7 Creation of four in-depth modules covering the four Consumer Duty outcomes - almost 100,000 module completions recorded in aggregate\n- \u00b7 Design and implementation of workshops for leaders. 60 workshops delivered and attended by over 1,200 leaders\n\n\u00b7\n\n## Board monitoring of culture progress\n\n## New for 2023: Culture Dashboard\n\nOur Group Culture Dashboard is a new development introduced in November 2023, measuring the connection between high performing teams, change readiness and customer outcomes. The Culture Dashboard tracks both quantitative and qualitative insights and recommends actions to drive progress that will help the Group to Grow, Focus and Change.\n\n81 %\n\ncolleag ue su rvey response rate\n\n200 , 000\n\ncolleague sur v ey comments analysed",

        "page_content": "## Group structure and ring-fencing governance arrangements\n\nThe subsidiaries of the Group are structured into the following sub-groups under Lloyds Banking Group plc, providing effective governance for the business undertaken in each sub-group:\n\nSince 1 January 2019, UK legislation has required large UK banks to separate personal banking services, such as current and savings accounts, from riskier activities, such as investment banking, in other parts of their business. This is called ring-fencing.\n\nThe Group's structure and governance arrangements meet these regulatory requirements. As mentioned on page 76 , Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc are the banks within the Group which have been included within the ring-fence (together, the RingFenced Banks). The governance structure focuses on ensuring:\n\n- \u00b7 Independent decision making by the Ring-Fenced Banks' boards - on any matters where there might be a conflict between the interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks and the interests of another part of the Group and that any such conflicts are identified and appropriately managed\n- \u00b7 Risks affecting the Ring-Fenced Banks are considered and managed from the Ring-Fenced Banks' perspective - including maintenance of the capital adequacy and liquidity of the Ring-Fenced Banks\n- \u00b7 Clear and effective governance at both Ring-Fenced Bank and Lloyds Banking Group plc level - including second and third lines of defence in respect of risk management\n- \u00b7 Ring-Fenced Banks sub-group containing Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc (including the Halifax and MBNA businesses), serving both their UK personal and commercial customers\n- \u00b7 Non-Ring-Fenced Bank sub-group - Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc - which provides products and services to Group customers that are not allowed within the ring-fence, as well as serving financial institutions\u03e0 customers and holding certain of the Group's subsidiaries and branches outside the UK\n- \u00b7 Insurance sub-group under Scottish Widows Group Limited (including Scottish Widows Limited)\n- \u00b7 Equity sub-group under LBG Equity Investments Limited (including Lloyds Development Capital (Holdings) Limited)\n\nAs mentioned on page 76 , the boards of the Ring-Fenced Banks comprise all of the Group directors plus three additional independent non-executive directors: Nigel Hinshelwood (Senior Independent Director), Sarah Bentley and Brendan Gilligan. These Ring-Fenced Bank-only directors are independent of the management and the rest of the Group and their role is to act exclusively in the best interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks. They therefore play a crucial role in the governance structure, with an enhanced role in managing any potential conflicts between the Ring-Fenced Banks and the Group.\n\n## Lloyds Banking Group plc simplified sub-group structure\n\n## Lloyds Banking Group Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Getting closer to customers and clients\n\nThe Board remains very conscious of the challenges our customers and clients continue to face. During the year the Board reviewed and discussed an update dedicated to the impact of the increased cost of living on customers and clients, how the Group had supported, and would support, customers and clients and the Group's engagement with the Financial Conduct Authority on lenders' commitments to support borrowers.\n\nDuring the year the Board also received additional updates from management on the impacts of the increased cost of living on customers and clients across our businesses.\n\nDuring 2023, Board members have attended customer and client engagement sessions to deepen their understanding of the day-to-day challenges our customers and clients face. The topics explored at these sessions included the increased cost of living, the lives of vulnerable customers and customers in financial difficulty and the challenges of managing a small business in the current environment.\n\nLBG Equity\n\nInvestments Limited Equity Investments\n\n<!-- image -->",

The diversity of skills, experience and background on the Board enables the Board to provide constructive challenge and strategic guidance and to offer specialist advice.\n\nThere is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and the executive leadership of the Group - please refer to the role summaries below. The responsibilities of the Chair, Group Chief Executive, Senior Independent Director, Board and Committees are agreed by the Board and publicly available on the Group's website on our corporate governance page  . The Chair periodically refreshes membership of the Committees.\n\n## Monitoring independence\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee monitors whether there are any relationships or circumstances which may affect a director's independence. Following the most recent review of independence, the Committee concluded that all non-executive directors are independent in character and judgement and are independent directors for the purposes of the Code. For further details of the review in respect of Alan Dickinson, noting his long service, please see page 95 . Sir Robin Budenberg was independent on appointment when assessed against the circumstances set out in provision 10 of the Code.\n\n## Monitoring time commitments\n\nNon-executive directors are advised of time commitments for the Board and relevant Committees prior to their appointment and are required to devote such time as is necessary to discharge their duties effectively. The time commitments of the directors are considered by the Board on appointment and annually thereafter and, following the most recent review, the Board is satisfied there are no directors whose time commitments are considered to be a matter for concern.\n\nExternal appointments, which may affect existing time commitments to the Board and its Committees, must be agreed with the Chair and prior Board approval must be obtained. During 2023, Amanda Mackenzie was appointed a non-executive director of The British Land Company PLC. The Board considered the time commitment and potential conflicts involved prior to Amanda accepting the role and was satisfied that she would continue to have sufficient time to commit to her Group Board and Committee appointments. The executive directors do not have any significant external appointments. Information on directors\u03e0 attendance at meetings can be found on page 79 .\n\n## The right information and support\n\nThe Chair, supported by the Company Secretary, ensures that Board members receive appropriate and timely information. All directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary and the Group provides access, at its expense, to the services of independent professional advisers in order to assist directors in their role. Board Committees are also provided with sufficient resources to discharge their duties.\n\n## Non-executive directors\n\nThe independent non-executive directors challenge management constructively and help develop and set the Group's strategy. They actively participate in Board decision making and scrutinise management performance. The non-executive directors satisfy themselves on the integrity of financial information and review the Group's risk exposures and controls. The non-executive directors, through the Remuneration Committee, also determine the remuneration of executive directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSir Robin Budenberg leads the Board and promotes high standards of corporate governance. He leads in building an effective and complementary Board and sets the Board's agenda. The Chair also leads Board succession planning and seeks to ensure effective communication with shareholders.\n\n## Executive directors\n\n## Company Secretary\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCharlie Nunn manages and leads the Group on a day-to-day basis, making decisions on matters affecting the operation and performance of the Group's business and the delivery of the Board's approved strategy. He delegates aspects of his authority, as permitted under the Corporate Governance Framework, to other members of the Group Executive Committee.\n\nUnder the leadership of the Group Chief Executive, William Chalmers makes and implements decisions in all matters affecting the management of financial resources. He provides specialist knowledge and experience to the Board. Together with Charlie Nunn, he designs, develops and seeks to implement strategic plans and deals with the day-to-day operations of the Group.\n\nAs Company Secretary, Kate Cheetham advises the Board on matters relating to governance, ensuring good information flows and that comprehensive practical support is provided to directors. She is also responsible for maintaining the Group's Corporate Governance Framework and organising directors' induction and training. Both the appointment and removal of the Company Secretary are matters for the Board as a whole.\n\nAs Deputy Chair, Alan Dickinson supports the Chair in representing the Board and deputises for the Chair. The Deputy Chair may also represent the Group\u03e0s interests to official enquiries and review bodies.\n\n- Senior Independent Director\n\nCathy Turner\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs Senior Independent Director, Cathy Turner is a sounding board for the Chair and Group Chief Executive. She acts as a conduit for the views of other non-executive directors and conducts the Chair's annual performance appraisal. She is available to help resolve shareholders' concerns and will attend meetings with major shareholders and financial analysts to understand issues and concerns.",

The Nomination and Governance Committee assesses the skills, experience and knowledge of the non-executive directors on an individual basis and on a collective basis - please see page 73 for the results of the latest collective assessment, which was approved on 24 January 2024. Having the right balance of skills and experience helps to ensure directors discharge their duties effectively.\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee leads the process for Board appointments, which makes recommendations to the Board. Open advertising and/or an external search consultancy is used for the appointment of the Chair and non-executive directors.\n\nAppointments are made on merit and due consideration is given to diversity in its broadest sense, including gender, social, regional and ethnic backgrounds and cognitive and personal strengths.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee ensures plans are in place for orderly succession to both Board and senior management positions and oversees the development of a diverse pipeline for succession. More information about the work of the Nomination and Governance Committee on succession planning can be found on pages 94 to 95 .\n\nAll directors are subject to annual re-election.

On appointment, each director receives a formal and tailored induction. There is also a programme of ongoing training for directors.\n\n## Induction\n\nNew non-executive directors receive a tailored induction that focuses on the Group's culture and values, stakeholders, strategy, structure, operations and governance with an emphasis on ensuring that the induction brings the business and its issues alive, taking account of the specific role the director has been appointed to fulfil and their skills and experience to date.\n\nAn induction pack is provided containing key corporate documents and information relating to the Group covering aspects such as the role of a director (including relevant Group policies such as anti-bribery, conflicts of interest, expenses, gifts and hospitality and share dealing), the Board and its Committees, financials and strategy, governance, risk management, culture, shareholders and training.\n\n## Group training modules\n\nNon-executive directors are asked to complete training modules on a quarterly basis. In 2023, these modules were on:\n\n- \u00b7 Modern slavery\n- \u00b7 Fighting economic crime - advanced anti-bribery\n- \u00b7 Security\n- \u00b7 Conduct rules\n- \u00b7 Speak Up (the Group's whistleblowing programme)\n\n## Audit and Risk Committee Forum for non-executive directors\n\nIn November 2023 there was the second meeting of the Audit and Risk Committee Forum, which was attended by members of the Group, Insurance and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets Audit Committees and Board Risk Committees as well as colleagues from the business.\n\nThe aims of this informal forum were to have interactive discussion to gain a shared understanding and appreciation of common areas of interest and to network.\n\nThe topics discussed were risk and control environment, model risk management, supplier risk management and climate data.\n\n## Committee training\n\nCommittee-specific training is agreed by Committee Chairs as and when needed such as that provided to the Audit and Risk Committee Forum - please read more at the bottom of this page.\n\n## New role training\n\nDirectors who take on new roles, such as Cathy Turner taking over as Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Remuneration Committee, or change roles during the year attend induction or handover meetings in respect of those new roles.\n\n## Other training\n\nTraining sessions have been offered across a range of topics of particular interest that were chosen to complement the Board agenda and facilitate advanced discussion. Where training was offered online, the sessions have been recorded and made available to all directors. The topics are produced based on the level of knowledge and experience of Board members. Key topics during 2023 included:\n\n- \u00b7 Group Customer Dashboard\n- \u00b7 Senior Managers and Certification Regime\n- \u00b7 Market abuse including disclosure of inside information\n- \u00b7 Consumer Duty\n- \u00b7 Recovery and resolution plans\n- \u00b7 Nature (sustainability and climate)\n- \u00b7 Data ethics\n- \u00b7 Tax\n- In addition to the above,\n- a board incident management exercise was undertaken.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe directors are committed to their own ongoing professional development and the Chair discusses training with each nonexecutive director at least annually.

        "page_content": "## Audit, risk and internal control\n\n## Audit and risk\n\nThere are formal policies and procedures in place designed to ensure the independence and effectiveness of the internal and external audit functions. Group Internal Audit is a single independent internal audit function, reporting to the Audit Committee. Further detail can be found in the sections headed 'Group Internal Audit' and 'Auditor independence and remuneration' on page 100 .\n\nThe Board has delegated a number of responsibilities to the Audit Committee, including monitoring and reviewing financial reporting, the effectiveness of internal controls and the risk management framework, whistleblowing, the internal audit process and the external auditor's process. The Audit Committee reports regularly to the Board on its activities and its report for 2023, confirming how it has discharged its duties, can be found\n\n## on pages 97 to 100 .\n\nRequirements that the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable are considered during the drafting and reviewing process and the Board has concluded that the 2023 annual report meets this requirement. The Board is supported in this by its Audit Committee and a sign-off process involving different sections of the annual report being approved for inclusion by senior management, with additional review by the Group Disclosure Committee. The statement of directors' responsibilities can be found on page 136 and the statement of the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements can be found on page 209 . Related information on the Company's business model and strategy can be found on pages 1 to 45 .\n\nThe Board is responsible for the Group's risk management and internal controls systems, including the determination of the nature and extent of risk the Company is willing to take. Risk is further managed through the Board-approved risk management framework, as discussed in the risk management report on\n\npages 138 to 196 . The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its risk governance and oversight responsibilities, including by the provision of advice to the Board on risk strategy and overseeing the development, implementation and maintenance of the Group's overall risk management framework, strategy, principles and policies and its risk appetite. The Board Risk Committee reports regularly to the Board on its activities and its report for 2023, confirming how it has discharged its duties, can be found on pages 101 to 106 .\n\n## Internal control Board responsibility\n\nThe Board is responsible for, and monitors, the Group's risk management and internal control systems. These are designed to facilitate effective and efficient operations and to ensure the quality and integrity of internal and external reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and for the determination of the nature and extent of the principal risks the Group is willing to take in order to achieve its strategy. The directors and senior management are committed to maintaining a robust control framework as the foundation for the delivery of effective risk management. The directors acknowledge their responsibilities in relation to the Group's risk management and internal control systems and for reviewing their effectiveness.\n\nIn establishing and reviewing the risk management and internal control systems, the directors carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Company, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity and reputation, the likelihood of a risk event occurring and the costs of control. The process for identification, evaluation and management of the emerging and principal risks faced by the Group is integrated into the Group's overall enterprise framework for risk. The risk identification, evaluation and management process is designed to also identify whether the controls in place result in an acceptable level of risk. At Group level, a consolidated risk report, risk appetite dashboard and report by the Chief Risk Officer are reviewed and regularly debated by the Group Risk Committee and the Board Risk\n\nCommittee, with formal updates provided to the Board to ensure that they are satisfied with the overall risk profile, risk accountabilities and mitigating actions. The report and dashboard provide a view of the Group\u03e0s overall risk profile, key risks and management actions, together with performance against risk appetite and an assessment of emerging risks which could affect the Group's performance over the life of the operating plan. Information regarding the main features of the internal control and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting process is provided within the risk management report on pages 138 to 196 .\n\nBest practice in relation to risk management continues to evolve and throughout 2023 the Group has identified a number of enhancements to its risk management arrangements that are proposed to be implemented as part of continuous improvement. To support the Board's approval, the Board Risk Committee has reviewed the 2023 plan and recommended approval of the proposals.\n\nThe Board Risk Committee and the Board concluded that the Group's risk management arrangements throughout 2023 were adequate overall and provided assurance that the risk management systems put in place were responsive to the Group\u03e0s risk profile and strategy. The Board is confident that the enhancements proposed will ensure that the Group's risk management arrangements will be sufficiently robust to meet developing risk management best practice for the future.\n\n## Control effectiveness review\n\nAll material controls are recorded and assessed on a regular basis in response to triggers or at least annually. Control assessments consider both the adequacy of their design and operating effectiveness. Where a control is not effective, the root cause is established and action plans implemented to improve control design or performance. Control effectiveness against all residual risks is aggregated by risk category, reported and monitored via the monthly Key Risk Insights or Consolidated Risk Report (CRR). The Key Risk Insights/CRR are reviewed and independently challenged by the Risk division and provided to the Risk Division Executive Committee and the Group Risk Committee. On an annual basis, a point in time assessment is made for control effectiveness against each risk category and across the sub-groups. The Operational Risk System, Key Risk Insights or CRR are the sources used for this point in time assessment and a year-on-year comparison on control effectiveness is reported to the Board Risk Committee and the Board.\n\n## Reviews by the Board\n\nThe effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems is reviewed at least annually by the Board, the Board Risk Committee and the Audit Committee, which also receive reports of reviews undertaken by the Risk division and Group Internal Audit. The Audit Committee receives reports from the Company's auditor, Deloitte LLP (which include details of significant internal control matters that they have identified) and has a discussion with the auditor at least once a year without executives present to ensure that there are no unresolved issues of concern. The Group's risk management and internal control systems are regularly reviewed by the Board Risk Committee and the Board and are consistent with the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting issued by the Financial Reporting Council. There is also an annual independent Control Effectiveness review by Group Internal Audit which is reviewed by the Board Risk Committee and the Audit Committee. These reports have confirmed they have been in place for the year under review and up to the date of the approval of the annual report. The Group, Ring-Fenced Bank sub-group and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets have achieved full compliance with BCBS 239 risk data aggregation and risk reporting requirements and actively continue to maintain this status.",

Inclusion continues to lie at the heart of the Group's purpose and, in its ongoing assessment of the composition of the Board and its Committees, inclusion and diversity remain key considerations. Continuing to meet and exceed industry targets for Board diversity demonstrates our commitment, with the Committee's role central to achieving this. Details of the Board diversity policy are set out on page 96 .\n- Q What aspects of succession planning have the Committee focused on in 2023?\n- A Last year's report highlighted that September 2023 would see Alan Dickinson having served nine years on the Board. Consequently, a key focus has been the succession arrangements for Alan's roles, which led to Cathy Turner being appointed as Senior Independent Director during the year and the appointment of Nathan Bostock as a non-executive director to replace Alan's core banking experience on the Board. Further consideration continues to be given to Board Committee membership as well as non-executive director recruitment. The Committee also considered succession planning for senior executives, building on the additional focus on this during 2022. See page 95 for more details.\n- Q What are the key areas of focus for the Committee in 2024?\n- A In addition to succession planning, the year ahead will see a focus on seeking to continue enhancing inclusion and diversity at both Board and executive levels. Composition of the Board and its Committees, and overseeing implementation of actions arising from the Board evaluation, will also be given appropriate attention.\n\n## Introduction\n\nAs highlighted in my introduction to the corporate governance report on page 72 , Cathy Turner was appointed as Senior Independent Director during the year. Cathy's appointment to this role helps demonstrate not only our commitment to diversity across the Board's senior roles, but also how strong succession planning can, amongst other things, play its part in providing candidates for different Board roles.\n\nBeyond Board and executive succession planning, other key areas of focus for the Committee this year have included Board effectiveness and training, composition of the Board's Committees and implementation of actions arising from the 2022 externally facilitated Board evaluation process. All of these areas are covered in more detail throughout this report.\n\n## Committee purpose and responsibilities\n\nThe purpose of the Committee is to keep the Board's governance, composition, skills, experience, knowledge, independence and succession arrangements under review and to make appropriate recommendations to the Board to ensure the Company's arrangements are consistent with the highest corporate governance standards.\n\n## Board and Committee changes\n\nAlan Dickinson and Lord Lupton have notified the Board that they do not intend to seek re-election at this year's annual general meeting having served nine and almost seven years respectively on the Board. Nathan Bostock will be appointed as a nonexecutive director and, subject to regulatory approval, Chair of Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc, in each case with effect from 1 August 2024. Cathy Turner succeeded Alan Dickinson as Senior Independent Director and also as Chair of the Remuneration Committee on 13 September 2023, at which point Alan ceased to be a member of the Remuneration Committee. At the same time, Cathy was appointed as a member of the Nomination and Governance Committee and, as announced on 25 January 2024, Cathy was appointed as a member of the Board Risk Committee with effect from 1 February 2024. Details of the selection process for Cathy's appointment as Senior Independent Director can be found on page 96 . As announced on 18 December 2023, Amanda Mackenzie was appointed as a member of the Audit Committee with effect from 1 January 2024.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nConsideration has been given to tenure of Board members and potential future Board retirements and the impact of these on membership of the Board and its Committees, with particular attention given to succession arrangements for Alan Dickinson and Lord Lupton, as detailed above. The Committee's ongoing review of the structure, size and composition of the Board and its Committees helps ensure that the appropriate mix of knowledge, skills, experience and diversity is maintained. A summary of Board and Committee composition and attendance can be found on page 79 .\n\nThe Committee also continues to consider the overall health and diversity of the executive talent pipeline, together with detailed executive succession planning. Key considerations include, for example, cultural and strategic capabilities which will help deliver the strategic aims of the Group's transformation programme. Further details on the Committee's approach to succession planning can be found on page 95 .\n\n## Board effectiveness and training\n\nAn internally facilitated Board evaluation has been conducted this year, overseen by the Committee. Full details of how the review was undertaken, and its outcomes, are provided on page 90 , together with a summary of progress against the actions arising from the 2022 external Board evaluation process carried out by\n\nDr Tracy Long on page 91 . The Committee considered the outcomes of the review and agreed, and recommended to the Board for approval, the actions arising from the review. During 2024, the Committee will continue to oversee implementation of the remaining actions from the 2022 review, together with outcomes from the 2023 review. The Committee has also undertaken an annual review of its effectiveness, the findings of which, together with the outcomes of the Board evaluation process as relevant to the Committee, were considered by the Committee at its January 2024 meeting; it was considered that the performance of the Committee continues to be effective.",

        "page_content": "The Committee also oversees training undertaken by the non-executive directors. The Chair discusses training with each non-executive director at least annually and, as set out in the summary of Board training on page 92 , training sessions have been offered across a range of topics which complement the Board agenda, in addition to mandatory training requirements. Learning and engagement opportunities have been undertaken by all non-executive directors in relation to material aspects of the Group's business.\n\n## Independence and time commitments\n\nBased on its assessment for 2023, the Committee is satisfied that, throughout the year, all non-executive directors remained independent 1 in character and judgement, and are independent directors for the purposes of the Code. Having served nine years on the Board in September 2023, the Committee gave specific and particularly rigorous consideration to Alan Dickinson's independence. On the basis of the continued robust and constructive challenge and oversight provided in his role, facilitated by his deep knowledge of the Group and significant retail and commercial banking experience, the Committee confirmed Alan\u03e0s continued independence as a non-executive director. During the processes leading to the appointment of Cathy Turner as Senior Independent Director, consideration was given to Cathy's independence and overall time commitments to ensure that her other appointments could continue to be appropriately accommodated. Nathan Bostock's independence was considered as part of the appointment process and it was determined that he would be independent for the purposes of the Code. As discussed on page 88 of the corporate governance report, consideration is also given to time commitments when directors seek to take on any additional external appointments.\n\nIn recommending directors for re-election at the annual general meeting, the Committee has reviewed the performance of each non-executive director and their ability to continue meeting the time commitments required, taking into consideration individual capabilities, skills and experiences and any potential conflicts of interest that have been disclosed. The external roles held by all directors were considered to be appropriate. Fuller details of any conflicts of interest can be found on page 133 .\n\n## The Group's Corporate Governance Framework\n\nThe most recent annual review of the Corporate Governance Framework was finalised in April 2023. This review continued to build upon the simplification of the framework achieved during 2022, while ensuring it remains compliant with relevant obligations and best practice.\n\nAs part of its broader governance responsibilities, the Committee considered regular updates on developments in corporate governance during the year, including the Edinburgh Reforms, the Financial Reporting Council's consultation on proposed changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code, FCA and PRA consultations on Diversity & Inclusion in the financial sector and the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023. The Committee also considered correspondence with shareholders on governance issues.\n\n## UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Company applied the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 for the year ending 31 December 2023 and complied with all the provisions. A table in relation to the Company's compliance can be found on page 71 .\n\nThe Committee reports to the Board on how it discharges its responsibilities and makes recommendations to the Board, all of which have been accepted during the year. The Committee's terms of reference can be found on the corporate governance page   on our website.\n\n## Committee composition, skills and experience\n\nTo ensure a broad representation of experienced and independent directors, membership of the Committee currently comprises the Chair, Deputy Chair, Senior Independent Director (who is also the Chair of the Remuneration Committee) and the Chair of the Responsible Business Committee, together with a further independent non-executive director (who is the Chair of Scottish Widows Group).\n\n- 1 The Chair was independent on appointment. Under the Code, thereafter the test of independence is not appropriate in relation to the Chair.\n\nThe Senior Independent Director of the Ring-Fenced Banks also attends meetings as an observer in order to provide insights on matters relevant to the Ring-Fenced Banks when required and as part of his role in the Group's overall governance structure.\n\nThe Group Chief Executive attends meetings as appropriate. Details of Committee membership and meeting attendance during the year can be found on page 79 .\n\n## Succession planning\n\nSuccession planning, at both Board level and across key senior management roles, continued to be a core area of consideration for the Committee during 2023, with a particular focus on succession arrangements for Alan Dickinson.\n\nEffective succession planning assists the Group in delivering on its strategic objectives over the medium and longer term by ensuring the desired mix of skills and experience of Board members and executives, this being particularly important as we continue to drive forward delivery of the Group's strategic and cultural transformation. The Board remains committed to ensuring the development of a diverse pipeline of current and future leaders across the Group's executive and management levels, through the provision of a range of development opportunities.\n\nAt an executive level, the Chair is responsible for developing and maintaining a succession plan for the Group Chief Executive who is, in turn, primarily responsible for developing and maintaining succession plans for key leadership positions in the senior executive team. As part of its regular oversight and review of the adequacy and effectiveness of succession arrangements for executive directors and members of the senior executive, the Committee received and discussed regular updates from the Group Chief Executive covering executive succession planning arrangements. These demonstrated the continuing strength and effectiveness of the Group's senior management succession planning, through the depth and diversity of the succession plans covering key senior management roles.\n\nThe Committee also supports the Chair in keeping the composition of the Board and its Committees under regular review and in leading the appointment process for nominations to the Board. This helps ensure continued focus on increasing the overall diversity of the Board and capacity for future succession planning, bearing in mind tenure of Board members and potential future retirements from the Board. The appointment process set out on the following page helps illustrate how this works in practice. In contemplating succession arrangements for Alan Dickinson as Senior Independent Director, the Committee considered both external and internal candidates, before making the recommendation to the Board that Cathy Turner be appointed as Senior Independent Director. Cathy's breadth of executive and non-executive experience was a key factor, helping demonstrate the strength of our succession planning arrangements and recruitment processes. In addition to the appointment of Nathan Bostock, the Committee continues to give consideration to the appointment of further non-executive representation to the Board.\n\nThe Chair leads an ongoing assessment of the Board's technical and governance skill set, on both an individual and collective basis, using a Board skills matrix to track the Board's strengths and to identify any gaps in the desired collective skills profile of the Board. Consideration is given to a range of factors such as the Group's future strategic direction and helping to ensure that due weight is given to diversity in its broadest sense. The skills matrix is considered in the appointment of all Board members. The Group's diversity commitments and outcomes of the Board evaluation process are also taken into consideration.\n\nSuccession planning also plays a key role in the recognition and promotion of diversity across the Board and senior management, further supported by a range of policies across the Group which promote the engagement of under-represented groups within the business in order to help continue to build a diverse talent pipeline.

        "page_content": "## Nomination and Governance Committee report continued\n\n## Appointment process - non-executive directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee leads the process for the appointment of nonexecutive directors, making recommendations to the Board for the appointment of preferred candidates. The process involves open advertising and the engagement of an external search firm to assist with the identification of potential candidates, based on criteria identified by the Committee. This generates a list of potential candidates for consideration, from which a short list of candidates is selected who are then interviewed by the Chair, with further interviews and meetings then being held with other members of the Board, as deemed appropriate. After further consideration the Committee makes its recommendations to the Board for formal approval. This is a formal, rigorous and transparent process, leading to appointments being made on merit and objective criteria, with due consideration being given to a broad range of factors such as diversity of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and personal strengths and the Group's future strategic direction.\n\nThere were no additional non-executive directors appointed to the Board during 2023. The process described above has been followed in the appointment of Nathan Bostock; the Group will report further on that appointment process in its 2024 annual report.\n\nThe Committee gave particular consideration to the Senior Independent Director role recognising that, by September 2023, Alan would have served nine years on the Board. The Committee delegated authority to the Chair to lead the formal interview and selection process for this role and, supported by Alan, consideration was given to both external and internal candidates against criteria identified by the Committee. Russell Reynolds Associates, who were engaged in the process of identifying external candidates for consideration, as well as the process which resulted in Nathan Bostock's recruitment, have no connection with the Group or individual directors other than conducting leadership search and succession planning services and facilitating leadership performance services. The Committee was kept informed on progress and discussions were held with other Board members, from which the consensus view was a preference for an internal candidate, unless a significantly stronger external candidate was identified. The Chair subsequently canvassed all directors for their views and interviewed the candidates for the role, before the matter was further discussed by the Committee. This led to the Committee's recommendation, and the Board's approval, of the appointment of Cathy Turner as Senior Independent Director. Further information on this process can also be found on page 4 .\n\n## Board diversity policy\n\nThe Board diversity policy (the Policy) sets out the Board's approach to diversity and provides a high-level indication of the Board's approach to inclusion and diversity in senior management roles which is governed in greater detail through the Group's policies.\n\nThe Board places great emphasis on ensuring that its membership reflects diversity in its broadest sense. Consideration is given to the combination of demographics, skills, experience, race, age, gender, educational and professional background and other relevant personal attributes on the Board to provide the range of perspectives, insights and challenge needed to support good decision making.\n\nNew appointments are made on merit, taking account of the specific skills and experience, independence and knowledge needed to ensure a rounded Board and the diverse benefits each candidate can bring to the overall Board composition.\n\nObjectives for achieving Board diversity are reviewed on a regular basis. On gender diversity, the Board is committed to maintaining at least four women Board members and over time will aim to reach 50 per cent representation of men and women on the Board to match the 50 per cent ambition that the Group has set for women in senior roles. Reflecting these aspirations, the Board will also aim to meet the recommendations set out by the FTSE Women Leaders. Currently, this Policy is not applied to Board Committees individually, although we strive to apply similar representation across the Committees. The Board is comfortable that the diversity of the Board is reflected across Committee memberships and that this remains an ongoing consideration. The representation of women on the Board is currently 45 per cent (based on five directors being women and six directors being men). As at 31 December 2023, the Group meets the three board diversity targets identified under Listing Rule 9.8.6R(9), namely that the Board comprises at least 40 per cent women, at least one of the chair, the chief executive, the senior independent director or the chief financial officer is a woman and at least one member of the Board is from a Minority Ethnic background. Further information disclosed in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(10) and (11) can be found on page 136 .\n\nThe Group has also set a target of 13 per cent of senior roles to be held by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic executives by 2025. The Board will therefore aim to reflect this goal with regard to Board members. As at 31 December 2023, the Board continues to meet the Board level recommendation of the Parker Review with two Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Board members. As noted, the Board places high emphasis on ensuring the development of diversity in the senior management roles within the Group and supports and oversees the Group's ambition of achieving 50 per cent of senior roles held by women by 2025 and of 13 per cent of senior roles held by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues by 2025 (including a minimum of 3 per cent of senior roles being held by Black Heritage colleagues). This is underpinned by a range of policies within the Group to help provide mentoring and development opportunities for women and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues and to ensure unbiased career progression opportunities. Progress on this objective is monitored by the Board and built into its assessment of executive performance.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the representation of women within the Group Executive Committee and their direct reports was 46.2 per cent in total (with 46.7 per cent for the Group Executive Committee and 46.2 per cent for their direct reports). The representation of women across all senior roles was 40.1 per cent, and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic representation in senior roles was 11.3 per cent. The Group's Race Action Plan, which was launched during 2020, aims to drive cultural change, recruitment and progression across the Group. This includes a goal to increase Black representation in senior roles from 0.6 per cent to at least 3 per cent by 2025. As at 31 December 2023, we have increased the representation of Black Heritage colleagues in senior roles to 1.7 per cent. Further details of the Race Action Plan, and the Group's further achievements in championing inclusion and diversity in its widest sense, can be found on page 31 .\n\nA copy of the Policy is available on the social sustainability page on our website and further information on the Board's broader approach to inclusion and diversity as part of its strategic priorities and continued investment in being a leading inclusive employer can be found on pages 30 to 32 .",

The Committee has received regular updates from management on progress with the Finance transformation and has also heard from Internal and External Audit. The Committee has also had the opportunity to consider further areas which are key to supporting the transformation, including finance talent and succession plans.\n- Q How has the Committee supported the Group's sustainability reporting during the year?\n- A Throughout the year, the Committee has remained close to the developments in narrative reporting and how this is continuing to translate into financial statement disclosures. Progress on enhanced reporting processes and control environment across the social and environmental spectrum has been monitored, alongside development of new targets through to internal monitoring and external disclosure. The Committee supports the commitment to continuous improvement in sustainability reporting, which will remain a priority in 2024 given the pace of change with external standards.\n- Q Why has the work of the Committee been important in managing the impact of uncertainty on the Group's pension schemes?\n- A With an uncertain economic environment, including increased interest rates, the Committee continued to focus on the key valuation inputs to the accounting presentation of the Group's pension schemes. This included consideration of the underlying assumptions, in particular those relating to demographics and rates of inflation. The Committee noted the results of the triennial valuation of the main schemes as at 31 December 2022, which were also shared with the Board.\n\n## Introduction\n\nI am pleased to report on how the Committee has discharged its responsibilities during what has been another busy year and I would like to start by thanking Committee members for their ongoing contributions to and continued support of the Committee\u03e0s work. The Committee has also benefited from the participation of Ring-Fenced Bank-only directors, who attend the Committee as observers, bringing insight on matters relevant to the Ring-Fenced Banks. Also, I would like to welcome Amanda Mackenzie, who became a member of the Committee on 1 January 2024.\n\nThe Committee has again during 2023 worked closely with other Board Committees, in particular in matters relating to the Group's sustainability ambitions and climate-related disclosures. I am pleased to report that the joint Audit and Risk Forum, which was formed in 2022 to discuss governance topics of common interest, met again in 2023 providing an opportunity for both Committees to share thinking on areas of common interest.\n\nLooking forward to 2024, in addition to our core responsibilities, the Committee will continue to monitor areas of continuous improvement on an end-to-end basis, and the audit plan to deliver focus from a risk perspective.\n\n## Committee purpose and responsibilities\n\nThe purpose of the Committee is to monitor and review the formal arrangements established by the Board in respect of the integrity of the financial reporting and narrative reporting of the Group and the Company. The Committee also monitors and reviews the independence and effectiveness of the internal and external audit functions, the effectiveness of the internal controls and the risk management framework and the adequacy and security of the arrangements for whistleblowing.\n\nThis includes the statutory audit of the consolidated financial statements and the independence of the statutory external auditor. The Committee reports to the Board on how it discharges its responsibilities and makes recommendations to the Board, all of which have been accepted during the year. A full list of responsibilities is detailed in the Committee's terms of reference, which can be found on our corporate governance page   on the Group's website.\n\nIn satisfying its purpose, the Committee undertakes the functions detailed within Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 7.1.3R. During the year the Committee considered a number of matters relating to the Group\u03e0s financial reporting. These matters are summarised on the following pages, including discussion of the conclusions the Committee reached, and the key factors considered in reaching these conclusions.\n\nIn addition, the Committee considered a number of other matters not related directly to financial reporting, including internal controls, internal audit and external audit. These matters are also discussed in detail on the final page of the report.",

The most significant judgemental adjustment in 2023 has been in respect of inflationary pressures and interest rate risk. The Group continues to benefit from investment in ECL models, overseen by the Committee, to deliver impact assessments and sensitivity analysis more quickly and accurately. This has been particularly relevant given the constantly changing economic outlook in 2023. Note 24 to the financial statements includes details of the Group\u03e0s ECLs allowances, including those resulting from judgemental adjustments (31 December 2023: \u00a328 million; 31 December 2022: \u00a3330 million), and a discussion of the improvements the Group has made to its consideration of climate risk on the ECL The Committee has reviewed management's rationale for these provisions and has challenged whether their inclusion and quantification are appropriate. It also considered management\u03e0s assessment of climate risk impacts on ECL and the conclusion that no adjustment was required.\n\nConclusion: The Committee was satisfied that the impairment provision and the disclosures provided in the financial statements were appropriate.\n\n## Allowance for impairments on loans and advances\n\n- 31 December 2023:\n\n\u00a34,084 million\n\n31 December 2022:\n\n\u00a34,903 million\n\nThe Committee undertook an annual review of its effectiveness, the findings of which, together with the outcomes of the Board evaluation process as relevant to the Committee (which, for 2023, was internally facilitated) were considered by the Committee at its January 2024 meeting. It was considered that the performance of the Committee continues to be effective.\n\nWhile the Committee's membership comprises the non-executive directors noted on page 79 , all non-executive directors may attend meetings as agreed with the Chair of the Committee.\n\nThe Group Financial Controller, Chief Internal Auditor, the external auditor, the Group Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Risk Officer also attend meetings as appropriate. Details of Committee membership and meeting attendance can be found on page 79 .",

Specific related matters that the Committee considered for the year included:\n\n- \u00b7 The effectiveness of systems for internal control, financial reporting and risk management\n- \u00b7 The extent of the work undertaken across the Group to ensure that the control environment continued to operate effectively\n- \u00b7 The major findings of internal investigations into control weaknesses, fraud or misconduct and management's response, along with any control deficiencies identified through the assessment of the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting under the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). Specifically the Committee continued to closely monitor the deficiencies identified in respect of privileged and user access across certain business applications and associated IT infrastructure and the Group's plans to address the control findings identified\n\nThe Committee was satisfied that internal controls over financial reporting were appropriately designed and operating effectively.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets (RWA) and regulatory reporting\n\nThe focus on the quality of regulatory reporting continues to be high on the PRA's agenda. To date, a number of skilled person independent reviews have been commissioned across the industry to review the governance, controls and processes supporting the regulatory reporting framework within firms. Across the first, second and third lines of defence management continue to focus on strengthening the control environment in regulatory reporting with a link to longer-term and strategic initiatives also being considered.\n\nThe ongoing programme of external assurance on regulatory reporting commissioned by the Committee has to date focused on risk-weighted assets. Management have provided regular updates to the Committee over the year to highlight progress made in improving the reporting control environment across a number of regulatory reports.",

        "page_content": "## Audit Committee report continued\n\n## IFRS 17\n\nThe Committee has received updates throughout the year on both the financial and controls impact of the Group\u03e0s adoption of IFRS 17. It reviewed the Group's transition document published in April 2023, which included the significant judgements and estimates, including those relating to the drawdown feature added to some of the Group's pension products, that affect the reported amounts and the accounting policy choices made by the Group.\n\n## Restoring trust in audit and corporate governance\n\nDuring the year the Committee has received updates on the responses of the Government and the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) to the white paper 'Restoring trust in audit and corporate governance'. The Committee recognises the importance of an effective corporate reporting and governance framework that is proportionate and does not significantly impact the attractiveness of the UK as a place to do business. The Committee is supportive of the Government's decision to withdraw the draft Companies (Strategic Report and Directors' Report) (Amendment) Regulations 2023 so that it can deliver a more targeted, simpler and effective framework for both businesses and investors.\n\nThe Group notes that on 22 January 2024 the FRC issued a revised UK Corporate Governance Code which will be effective from 1 January 2025 apart from the updates to the provision on the monitoring and review of a company's risk management and internal control framework which are effective from 1 January 2026.\n\n## Speak Up (the Group's whistleblowing service)\n\nThe Committee received and considered reports from management on the Group's whistleblowing arrangements. The Committee reviewed the reports to ensure there are arrangements in place which colleagues can use in confidence and without fear of retaliation. In addition, colleagues are able to report concerns about inappropriate and unacceptable practices; these arrangements are well publicised and there is proportionate and independent investigation of such matters or appropriate follow-up. The Committee reported on its consideration of whistleblowing arrangements to the Board.\n\n## Sustainability reporting\n\nThe Committee discussed and challenged the Group's progress with sustainability related reporting. Developments in UK companies regulation requirements for climate-related financial disclosure alongside emerging environmental sustainability reporting frameworks have been considered, assessing the near term and future impacts on external disclosures. As previously, the Committee benefited from a dedicated teach-in session focusing on the Group's capabilities and progress with the production of climate and sustainability reporting and associated data, the enhanced control environment, and the developments with governance and assurance. Further discussion on sustainability governance can be found on pages 84 to 85 .\n\n## Group Internal Audit\n\nIn monitoring the activity, role and effectiveness of the internal audit function and their audit programme the Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 Approved the annual audit plan and budget, including resource\n- \u00b7 Reviewed progress against the plan through the year with updates including quarterly reports on the activities undertaken and six-monthly updates as a result of reviews by the internal audit Quality Assurance team\n- \u00b7 Considered the major findings of significant internal audits, and management's response\n- \u00b7 Monitored the progress of internal audit's coverage of key risk themes across the Group, including strategic delivery, cultural transformation, cost of living, Consumer Duty, supplier partnerships, capital efficiency, transition to net zero and data quality\n- \u00b7 Continued to monitor completion of enhancements identified by the third party who assessed the effectiveness of the internal audit function in 2021\n\n## Finance strategy and transformation\n\nSignificant investment has been committed to transform the Finance function, including the near-term deliverables of a new General Ledger across the Group in 2025 in addition to the transformation of processes and procedures across the financial data landscape and costs and investment management. This multi-year transformation journey incorporates significant improvements and efficiencies to the Group, with the Committee receiving timely updates with regard to the proposed plans, progress with them, and the associated financial and non-financial benefits.\n\n## Auditor independence and remuneration\n\nThe Committee is responsible for establishing the Group's policies and procedures designed to protect the independence and objectivity of the external auditor. In April 2023, the Committee reviewed its non-audit services policy; no substantive changes were made to the policy.\n\nThe policy details those services that the auditor is permitted to carry out and pre-approves certain of these services provided the fee is below a threshold; all other permitted services must be specifically approved in advance by the Committee. Prior to the engagement of the auditor for a permitted service, the policy requires that senior management confirms whether the Committee has pre-approved the service or specific approval is required. The total amount of fees paid to the auditor for both audit and non-audit related services in 2023 and further information on the policy is disclosed in note 17 to the financial statements.\n\n## External auditor\n\nFollowing an external audit tender in 2018, Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) was appointed as auditor of the Company and the Group with effect from the 2021 financial year. Mike Lloyd is the statutory audit partner for the Group and attends all meetings of the Committee.\n\nThe Committee oversees the relationship with the external auditor including its terms of engagement and remuneration and monitors its independence and objectivity. During 2023, the Committee reviewed Deloitte's audit plan, including the underlying methodology, and Deloitte\u03e0s risk identification processes. In its assessment of Deloitte's performance and effectiveness, the Committee has considered: Deloitte's interactions with the Committee; the responses to a questionnaire issued to the Group's businesses, Finance, Risk and Internal Audit; and the FRC's Audit Quality Inspection Report published in July 2023. The Committee concluded that it was satisfied with the auditor's performance and recommended to the Board a proposal for the reappointment of the auditor at the Company's annual general meeting.\n\n## Statutory Audit Services compliance\n\nThe Company and the Group confirm compliance with the provisions of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, which relates to the frequency and governance of tenders for the appointment of the external auditor and the setting of a policy on the provision of non-audit services, for the year to 31 December 2023. There are no plans as at the date of this report to conduct a tender exercise for external audit services.\n\n## Audit Committees and the External Audit: Minimum Standard\n\nWhile not mandatory the Group is broadly compliant with Audit Committees and the External Audit: Minimum Standard published by the FRC in May 2023.",

The Committee continues to use deep dives to focus on specific topics of interest. Areas such as credit and market risk, and the associated impacts of continued high interest rates and inflation, climate risk, cyber and data risks and economic crime prevention have all featured highly on the Committee's agenda during the year, with consideration being given to actions being taken by management to not only mitigate risks, but to ensure appropriate support for customers and businesses. Further information is set out on the following pages, within the commentary on each risk type.\n- Q In recognition of the external environment, what further consideration has the Committee given to progress with implementation of the Group's strategic transformation and how successful delivery of the transformation could be impacted?\n- A The Committee received regular progress updates on the roup's strategic transformation throughout the year. It also onsidered a number of deep dives on the Group's control nvironment, together with a range of areas core to ensuring he Group's operational resilience is maintained. This ensures he Committee has an appropriate view of overall progress nd visibility of core areas such as the Group's critical business rocesses and important business services. These updates nd deep dives provide the Committee with the opportunity to hallenge management on progress and action being taken o mitigate risks. Further information on a number of these areas s covered throughout this report. G c e t t a p a c t i\n- Q What are the key areas of focus for the Committee in 2024?\n- A The Committee will continue to focus on broadly the same areas as have been central to its discussions this year. As part of the Committee's forward planning of activities, regular reviews are undertaken of areas that the Committee wishes to give additional focus to through, for example, the use of deep dives. This provides an appropriate balance between forward planning and flexibility, helping ensure focus on the Group\u03e0s most material risk types and any other areas of specific interest. The year ahead will see a broad range of topics covered, with these anticipated to include areas such as operational resilience, the Group's control environment, credit reviews in key sectors, climate risk and people risks, amongst others.\n\n## Introduction\n\nI am pleased to report on how the Committee has discharged its responsibilities during the year and would like to thank fellow Committee members for their valued contributions throughout the year. I also take this opportunity to welcome Cathy Turner, who was appointed as a member of the Committee with effect from 1 February 2024. The external environment continued to present a variety of challenging, and evolving, considerations for the Committee, with areas such as cost of living and continued high interest rates, inflationary pressures and macroeconomic uncertainties which notably included the failure of a small number of banks, driving impacts across the broader economy.\n\nThe Committee has continued to focus on risks related to delivery of the Group's strategy, including various aspects of operational and technology resilience, data and cyber risks, people risks and supply chain management, together with overall change and execution risk. Additional oversight is also given to a number of these areas through the IT and Cyber Advisory Forum, which supports the Committee.\n\nConsideration has also been given to credit risk, with deep dives across various areas of the business, alongside regular reporting and updates from the Chief Risk Officer assessing the overall credit environment and economic crime where the Committee considered the impacts and mitigating actions being taken. The Committee was also kept updated on progress with implementation of the Group's Consumer Duty Programme and progress on new prudential modelling requirements relating to credit risk capital models and market risk models. Each of these areas is covered in more detail throughout this report.\n\n## Committee purpose and responsibilities\n\nThe Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its risk governance and oversight roles and responsibilities. The Committee is also responsible for ensuring the risk culture is fully embedded and supports at all times the Group's agreed risk appetite, including the extent and categories of risk which the Board considers as acceptable for the Group to bear. A review and update of the Committee's terms of reference was completed during the year, with no material changes being made.\n\nThe Committee is responsible for reviewing and reporting its conclusions to the Board on the Group's risk management framework, which captures risk principles, policies, methodologies, systems, processes, procedures and people.",

        "page_content": "## Board Risk Committee report continued\n\nThis also includes the review of new, or material, amendments to risk principles and policies and overseeing any action resulting from material breaches of such policy. During the year, the Committee discussed the development of the Group's broader risk management framework and risk taxonomy, which will be an area of further focus in 2024.\n\nMore details on the Group's wider approach to risk management can be found in the risk management section on pages 137 to 196 . Full details of the Committee's responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference, which can be found on the corporate governance page  . on our website.\n\n## Committee composition, skills, experience and operation\n\nThere were no changes to the membership of the Committee during the year. As announced on 25 January 2024, Cathy Turner, Senior Independent Director, was appointed as a member of the Committee with effect from 1 February 2024. Two of the three designated independent non-executive directors of the RingFenced Banks also attend meetings as observers in order to provide insights on matters relevant to the Ring-Fenced Banks when required and as part of their role in the Group's overall governance structure. The Chief Risk Officer has full access to the Committee and attends all meetings. The Chief Internal Auditor and members of the executive also attend meetings as appropriate. Details of Committee membership and meeting attendance can be found on page 79 .\n\nThe Committee undertook an annual review of its effectiveness, the findings of which, together with the outcomes of the Board evaluation process as relevant to the Committee (which, for 2023, was led by the Company Secretary), were considered by the Committee at its January 2024 meeting; it was considered that the performance of the Committee continues to be effective. Details of the Board evaluation process can be found on page 90 .\n\nAs the most senior risk committee in the Group, the Committee interacts with other related risk committees, including the executive Group Risk Committee. These interactions help ensure the appropriate escalation of relevant matters to the Committee for review and consideration.\n\n## Matters considered by the Committee\n\nDuring 2023, the Committee considered a wide range of risks facing the Group and its Ring-Fenced Banks, both current and forward-looking, across all key areas of risk management, in addition to risk culture and risk appetite. The Committee continues to focus on key risk topics through, for example, the use of deep dives to provide greater analysis of particular topics and associated risks.\n\nThe following pages provide a summary of the risks considered by the Committee, together with an outline of the material factors considered and the conclusions which were ultimately reached. The Committee continues to be supported by the IT and Cyber Advisory Forum, which dedicates additional time and resource to reviewing and challenging risks associated with IT infrastructure, IT strategy, IT resilience and cyber risks. The Chair and other members of the Committee attend this Forum.\n\nThe Board Risk Committee Chair is a member of the Audit Committee, in addition to the Audit Committee Chair being a member of the Board Risk Committee; this close interaction continues to help ensure that common issues of interest are addressed appropriately. A further Group-wide Audit and Risk Committee Forum was held during the year, following a similar forum in 2022. This provided an opportunity for members of both Committees to discuss key areas of common interest and enhances interaction across these Committees. Further information about this Forum can be found on page 92 . There continues to be regular interaction with other Board Committees, in particular, with the Responsible Business Committee on climate risk and Consumer Duty, and with the Remuneration Committee on the alignment of remuneration to risk performance. This is further illustrated in the table of Board Committee cross-membership set out on page 89 of the corporate governance report.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed regular updates from the nonRing-Fenced Bank and Insurance sub-groups, headed up by Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc and Scottish Widows Group Limited respectively, summarising key discussions and decisions taken at the relevant entities' risk committees.\n\n| Risk type                      | Key issues                                                                                                                                                                                        | Committee review and conclusions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Conduct risk                   | Conduct risk                                                                                                                                                                                      | Conduct risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Rectifications  and complaints | The Group's management  of customer rectifications;  resolving customer  complaints in a timely  and fair manner, together  with eradicating the  complaint causes  through root cause  analysis. | During 2023, the Committee received updates on the Group's complaints and  rectifications performance.

The next year will be important in ensuring we continue to support colleagues, customers and communities and deliver on our focus areas of providing access to quality housing, unlocking regional development, greening the built\n\nenvironment and promoting financial resilience and inclusion.\n\n- Q What role does nature play in your environmental\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- sustainability ambitions?\n- A P rotecting and restoring nature goes hand-in-hand with supporting the low carbon transition and Helping Britain Prosper. We've made strong progress this year, building an expert team and hiring our first Group Head of Nature. In 2024, we will be working with colleagues, customers and clients to manage our nature-related risks, capitalise on opportunities and embed nature into our decision making.\n\n## Introduction\n\nI am pleased to report on the Committee's work in 2023 and I would like to thank members for their contributions. We will continue to review progress against our inclusion and diversity aspirations and rigorously support our sustainability plans in 2024. The strong foundations we have laid will continue to shape how we do business to create a more sustainable and inclusive future. This is a key part of how we will grow our business profitably and provide long-term, sustainable value for shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\n## Committee purpose and responsibilities\n\nThe purpose of the Committee is to support the Board in overseeing the Group's policies, performance and priorities as a responsible business. We will continue our oversight of the Group's work in 2024, as well as reacting to key emerging topics for our industry, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics. The Committee's terms of reference can be found on our corporate governance page   on the Group's website.\n\n## Access to housing\n\nWe are one of the largest funders of UK house building and in the course of 2023 supported \u00a32.7 billion of new funding to the social housing sector. In addition, this year, we launched a charity partnership with Crisis and together we are calling for one million new social homes to be built in the next decade. Our colleagues have actively engaged with our new partnership and we exceeded our fundraising goal of \u00a31 million in 2023.\n\n## Environmental sustainability\n\nThe Committee provides oversight of the Group's environmental sustainability strategy, sharing responsibility with the Audit Committee and Board Risk Committee. In 2023, we recommended to the Board an updated environmental sustainability strategy and three new sector targets for road passenger transport, agriculture and commercial & residential real estate. We have also launched enhanced operational emissions goals, including a more ambitious direct carbon emissions reduction target alongside new water, waste and nature pledges. More detail on our sustainability progress can be found in the sustainability report .\n\n## Consumer Duty\n\nThe Committee is the designated body that fulfils the Board\u03e0s responsibility for Consumer Duty oversight. As the Board Consumer Duty champion, I worked alongside the Committee to provide oversight of the Group's Consumer Duty implementation plan to meet the first of the FCA\u03e0s two Consumer Duty deadlines in July 2023 for new and open products. Consumer Duty sits at the heart of everything we do and we will continue our close work with the business as we approach the FCA's second deadline for closed products in July 2024.\n\n## Colleagues and culture\n\nOur colleagues play a vital role in the delivery of the Group's strategic ambitions. The Committee, as the designated body for workforce engagement, supports the Group's wider engagement strategy, reporting at least annually to the Board on the key themes and issues we're hearing from our colleagues. This year we discussed the long-term journey we are on to transform our culture, with change readiness a key theme. Engaging our colleagues in our transformation is key to driving the Group's success. Please refer to page 82 for more details on our colleague engagement activities.\n\n## Diversity, equity and inclusion\n\nThe Committee received regular updates on our diversity, equity and inclusion performance in 2023 and are pleased by the continued progress in increasing the representation of women and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues in senior roles. The latest FTSE Women Leaders Review report confirmed women are represented in over 40 per cent of our senior roles, meeting the review's recommendation. In April 2023, we also announced a further goal to double the representation of senior colleagues with a disability by 2025. We have asked the executive to continue to progress towards our commitments as we work to build a more inclusive organisation.\n\n## Committee composition, skills, experience and operation\n\nThe Committee met on four occasions in 2023 and is composed of independent non-executive directors and is attended by the Group Chief Executive. It benefits from a range of perspectives, insight and experience, with representatives from Group Internal Audit and the Chief Operating Office attending meetings as appropriate. Details of Committee membership and meeting attendance can be found on page 79 . Sarah Bentley joined the Responsible Business Committee of each of the Ring-Fenced Banks in January and I joined our Audit Committee to support the Committee's sustainability-related reporting responsibilities.\n\nThe findings of the internal annual review of effectiveness were considered by the Committee at its January 2024 meeting. Based on the evaluation, the feedback was that the performance of the Committee continues to be effective.",

We recognise the continued commitment of our colleagues and announced changes to our reward package providing greater certainty in what remains a fast-changing economic environment. This latest two-year pay deal means that between August 2022 and April 2025 we will have provided a minimum \u00a35,000 1 pay award and \u00a32,000 1 in cash support, worth a total of around 35 per cent of salary, for our colleagues at lower grades.\n\n## Remuneration content\n\nChair's statement\n\npages 108 to 109\n\nRemuneration at  a  glance\n\npages 110 to 111\n\n2023 annual report on remuneration\n\npages 112 to 127\n\n2023 Directors' Remuneration Policy summary\n\npages 128 to 132\n\n## Supporting our colleagues\n\n- \u00b7 Agreed a multi-year pay proposal for 2024 and 2025 reflecting our continued desire to support colleagues during uncertain times\n- \u00b7 Made a \u00a3500 1 payment in December 2023 to around 44,000 colleagues recognising immediate cost challenges\n- \u00b7 Consolidated a significant portion of our Group Performance Share (annual bonus) into base salary for around 32,000 colleagues giving more certainty and delivering reward faster\n\n## Dear shareholder\n\nOn behalf of the Board, it is my pleasure to present the directors' remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2023. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Alan Dickinson for his commitment and contribution to the work of the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) during his time as Chair.\n\n## Supporting our customers and colleagues in 2023\n\nHelping Britain Prosper has been central to all that the Group has done in 2023, focusing on delivering for customers, clients and shareholders. This has meant providing support through a tough and uncertain economic period which, whilst inflationary pressures have eased somewhat, remains an uncertain outlook for 2024 for many of our customers and colleagues. Our colleagues have worked tirelessly to support our customers, clients and communities as they continue to navigate this fast-changing environment.\n\nWe remained committed to our ambition to be the Best Bank for Customers; we proactively targeted support for customers facing economic uncertainty, directly contacting around 675,000 mortgage customers to encourage a review of their options, contacted 7.5 million customers since April 2022 to offer support and enhance financial resilience and, contacted more than 15 million customers on their savings options.\n\nThe Group delivered a robust financial performance in 2023 enabling a total ordinary dividend of 2.76 pence per share for 2023 and its intention to implement an ordinary share buyback of up to \u00a32.0 billion in 2024, benefiting our 2.2 million shareholders, including most of our employees.\n\nRecognising the continued commitment of our colleagues, the Committee has reflected on how our overall reward package meets both their needs and the needs of the Group and, as a result, we have made a number of changes over 2023. For our more senior colleagues, including our executive directors, we are introducing greater performance differentiation in variable reward, including the return to a performance-based Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for our Group Executive Committee members which will deliver stronger alignment and accountability for the delivery of our purpose-driven strategy. For our junior colleagues we've kept things simple, giving more certainty and delivering reward faster, with a continuing focus on supporting those impacted most by increased day-to-day living costs.\n\nRecognising the importance of certainty of earnings for many employees, in July 2023, we consolidated a significant portion of our annual bonus, the Group Performance Share (GPS) into base salary for around 32,000 colleagues. We also consolidated our 4 per cent Flex cash allowance into base salary for the majority of colleagues, further simplifying their reward package.\n\nOver the course of 2023 we have worked closely with our recognised unions, Accord and Unite, to agree an industryleading, multi-year pay deal for 2024 and 2025, reflecting our continued commitment to support colleagues and to help them plan for the future. To recognise the immediate cost of living challenges, we made a further \u00a3500 1 payment in December 2023 to around 44,000 colleagues who, including this payment, will receive average pay increases of between 9.1 per cent and 14.4 per cent cumulatively over the two years. The overall increase to our total pay costs over this two-year period will be lower at 8.2 per cent, as we continue to direct spend to our lowest paid colleagues. As part of our multi-year pay commitment, we will also raise our minimum salary across the Group to \u00a325,000 1 by April 2025, all part of delivering on our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper.\n\nOur two-year pay deal means that between August 2022 and April 2025, we will have provided a minimum \u00a35,000 1 pay award and \u00a32,000 1 in cash support, worth a total of around 35 per cent of salary, for our colleagues at lower grades.",

        "page_content": "## 2023 variable reward outcomes\n\nIn 2023, we are seeing real evidence of strategic progress as we transform the business and have increased our confidence in delivering the 2024 and 2026 commitments and growth. As a result of our robust financial performance this year, the Committee has approved a GPS pool of \u00a3384 million. This is a lower absolute pool than in 2022 because of the consolidation referred to above. On a like-for-like basis, including the consolidation of variable pay, the 2023 pool would be higher than 2022. Ensuring colleagues share in the success of the Group is an important element of our remuneration approach.\n\nThe approved pool includes the impact of a provision for the potential impact of the recently announced FCA review into historical motor finance commission arrangements.\n\nIn 2021, Long Term Share Plan (LTSP) awards were granted to around 600 colleagues and the Committee has determined that these should vest in full. In making this decision, the Committee considered several elements to satisfy itself that the vesting is appropriate. It noted that, during the 'pre-grant test' this award was reduced by up to 40 per cent to reflect the Group\u03e0s performance in 2020, the share price at the time of award and the wider experience of our shareholders. Furthermore, the vesting is subject to a \u03dfpre-vest test\u03e0 consisting of three financial underpins and four key questions. Finally, there was careful consideration whether an adjustment for windfall gains would be appropriate and it was concluded that given the award was initially reduced by up to 40 per cent, granted at a share price of 39.3015 pence which is higher than the 31.2 pence over the pandemic period and consistent with our share price range over the performance period (33-55 pence), no windfall gain has arisen and therefore no further adjustment would be appropriate. More detail is provided on page 115 .\n\n## Executive directors' remuneration outcomes\n\nCharlie Nunn, Group Chief Executive (GCE) continues to show strong leadership in all aspects of the business and consistently demonstrates the Group's values. He has led the strategic and cultural transformation which has maintained momentum whilst the Group has also navigated a challenging external environment. Once again, Charlie has overseen the Group's robust financial performance and achievement of broader Group balanced scorecard (BSC) targets whilst maintaining a strong regulatory and risk environment.\n\nLikewise, William Chalmers, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), has played a critical role in the development, communication and execution of our new strategy, as well as embedding and delivering a strong commercial, capital and investment discipline across the Group.\n\nThe Committee determined that the GPS (annual bonus) awards for the GCE and CFO should be in line with the Group\u03e0s performance as assessed by the Group BSC of 80.3 per cent of maximum, with resultant awards of \u00a31,277,372 and \u00a3920,658 respectively. This BSC outcome was inclusive of a downward adjustment in recognition of the external factors which benefited the 'reduction in carbon emissions' measure. Further details are outlined on page 113 .\n\nIn 2021, William Chalmers was granted an LTSP award of 75 per cent of salary, a reduction of 40 per cent versus the typical award recognising the Group's performance in 2020. In line with the outcome for other participants set out above, William's award will vest in full. 2021 LTSP awards were granted prior to Charlie Nunn joining the Group and therefore he did not receive an award.\n\nThe 2023 Group BSC outcome also acts as part of a 'pre-grant test' for our 2024 LTIP awards. Given our robust 2023 performance, the Committee has determined to grant LTIP awards to the GCE and the CFO of 300 per cent of salary in line with the policy approved at the last AGM.\n\nThe vesting outcome of the LTIP award will be subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets (see page 124 ) measured over the period 2024 to 2026.\n\n## Strengthening the Group's performance culture\n\nThe pivot towards a more demanding, high-performance culture is critical in delivering against the ambitious strategy we announced in 2022; returning to a performance-related LTIP directly aligns with that objective. We appreciated your overwhelming support having achieved 96 per cent support for the Remuneration Policy at the AGM in 2023.\n\nOur principal reason for reintroducing an LTIP is to deliver stronger alignment between variable reward outcomes and the creation of shareholder value through the delivery of our strategy and the deepening of our relationships with our customers. Accordingly, the Committee has given careful consideration to the choice of LTIP performance measures ensuring that they are both stretching and transparent.\n\nAs set out in our Directors' Remuneration Policy (DRP) approved at the 2023 AGM, 50 per cent of the LTIP outcome will be weighted to robust measures directly linked to our financial performance as we build to higher and more sustainable returns - Return on Tangible Equity, Capital Build and relative Total Shareholder Return (rTSR).\n\nRecognising that the delivery of our refreshed strategy is critical to the creation of value for shareholders and our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper, a further 35 per cent of the LTIP will depend on performance against our four strategic growth pillars - Deepen and innovate in Consumer, Create a new mass affluent offering, Digitise and diversify our SME business and Target our Corporate and Institutional offering.\n\nOur strategy is purpose driven and we continue to aspire towards a more sustainable and inclusive future through support for areas in which we can make a difference, such as our commitment to sustainable financing and the transition to net zero. 15 per cent of the LTIP outcome will therefore depend on the extent to which we deliver on our Sustainable Finance and Investment commitments and make progress towards our 2030 Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) sector targets and Scottish Widows' overall 2030 net zero ambition.\n\nFull details of our new LTIP can be found on page 124 .\n\nFor the last two years, our priority has been pay for our most junior colleagues and we did not award pay increases to our executive directors in 2023. For 2024, we will be increasing the fixed pay of our executive directors by four per cent consistent with the pay rise awarded to the majority of the wider colleague population as part of our unique two-year commitment on pay.\n\nWe will also be recommending a resolution to the AGM to ensure our governance remains aligned with the PRA's updated Policy Statement on the setting of variable to fixed pay ratios for large UK institutions; the variable pay opportunity of our executive directors is determined by our Directors' Remuneration Policy and will not be impacted.\n\nFinally, together with my Committee members, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support and our colleagues for delivering another robust set of results in 2023.\n\nOn behalf of the Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cathy Turner,\n\nChair, Remuneration Committee",

This is a decrease of 6 per cent compared to 2022 which was driven by a lower long-term incentive payment for 2023.

Therefore, while the measure outcome is 93.3 per cent, a downward adjustment to 50 per cent has been applied as shown below reducing the measure outcome to 2.5 per cent.\n\nThe Committee is satisfied the adjusted outcome of 80.3 per cent fairly reflects Group performance and appropriately rewards the executive directors for their performance within the context of overall shareholder experience.",

Our performance was bolstered by Hybrid/EV Clean Growth Finance Initiative transactions and Debt Capital Markets activity, along with an increase in sustainable financing, for example across solar financing, battery storage and EV charging.

Risk management has remained a key element in shaping our business model, with a focus on safely progressing strategic ambitions whilst supporting customers impacted by the rising cost of living.\n\nThe Group continues to make meaningful progress against our environmental commitments including reducing our operational carbon emissions by around 30 per cent from the 2018/19 baseline, delivering over \u00a340 billion 1 in sustainable financing and investment since 2022, becoming a founding member of the Net Zero Banking Alliance and publishing 10 sector-based 2030 emissions reduction targets for our most carbon-intensive sectors tracked through our system-led transition plans.\n\nThe Committee noted in the 2020 pre-grant test that there was still work to do towards achieving the Group's gender and diversity goals but felt comfortable that these were reflected in stretch targets in the 2021 balanced scorecard. In each performance year from 2021 to 2023 we have continued to improve our gender and ethnicity representation in senior roles. From year-end 2020 we have increased women in senior roles from 37 per cent to 40.1 per cent at year-end 2023 and from year-end 2020 we have increased Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic representation by 47 per cent from 7.7 per cent to 11.3 per cent at year-end 2023.\n\nThe Committee concluded that performance considered in the 'pre-grant test' has been sustainable and therefore no discretion has been applied. The 2021 LTSP awards will vest at 100 per cent, as the outcome represents a fair reflection of performance during the period.\n\n- 1 Includes: Corporate and Institutional, Business and Commercial Banking clients, EPC A/B mortgage lending (cumulative to September 2023), financing for EV and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and Scottish Widows discretionary investment in climate aware strategies.\n\nIn determining the final vesting outcome of the 2021 Long Term Share Plan, the Committee carefully considered alignment with shareholder experience and whether adjustments were required for windfall gains.\n\nAwards were granted in March 2021 at 39.3015 pence. The share price used to calculate indicative value is 43.564 pence ( page 112 ). While 10.8 per cent higher, the Committee considers\n\nit reasonably represents performance over the period. 2021 LTSP awards, including the award for the CFO, were reduced by up to 40 per cent upfront at the time of grant, showing restraint based on 2020 Group performance. The GCE did not receive a 2021 LTSP award as he was not in role at the time of grant. The Committee concluded there was no windfall gain over the period and as such no additional adjustment was required.",

Options vested on the 14 March 2023 and were exercised on 21 March 2023. Charlie Nunn retained all the shares apart from 586,558 shares which were sold at 48.16 pence to meet income tax and National Insurance contributions withholding obligations. The remaining 660,990 shares are subject to holding periods that mirror the shares replaced from HSBC of no hold, six months and 12 months holds.\n- 2 All GOS and LTSP awards have a three-year performance period ending 31 December. Awards were made in the form of conditional rights to free shares.\n- 3 LTSP awards (in the form of conditional share awards) in 2023 were made over shares with a value of 150 per cent of salary for Charlie Nunn (3,283,896 shares with a value of \u00a31,704,375) and a value of 150 per cent for William Chalmers (2,366,848 shares with a value of \u00a31,228,418). Vesting is subject to underpin thresholds applicable for the first three years from grant as detailed on page 121 of the 2022 Directors\u03e0 remuneration report. Each year the Remuneration Committee will monitor the Group\u03e0s progress in relation to the underpins. The share price used to calculate the value is the average price over the five days prior to grant (27 February 2023 to 3 March 2023), which was 51.901 pence.\n- 4 The second tranche of the 2021 GPS deferred award vested on 7 March 2023. The closing market price of the Group's ordinary shares on that date was 51.360 pence. The award was settled in shares net of tax, with the resulting shares subject to a one-year holding period.\n- 5 Half of the 2022 GPS is deferred into shares (in the form of conditional rights to free shares). The value of the shares awarded in respect of GPS granted in March 2023 was \u00a3668,911 (1,288,821 shares) for Charlie Nunn; and \u00a3344,367 (663,507 shares) for William Chalmers. As the awards represent deferral of awarded GPS they are not subject to further performance conditions. The share price used to calculate the value is the average price over the five days prior to grant (27 February 2023 to 3 March 2023), which was 51.901 pence.\n- 6 The first tranche of the 2022 GPS award vested on 7 March 2023.

The CFO has met the requirement of 250 per cent of salary and currently holds 467 per cent of salary at 31 December 2023.\n\nIn recognition of the increased variable opportunity offered by the implementation of the LTIP and to further strengthen alignment with shareholders, from 1 January 2024 the shareholding requirement applicable to the GCE will increase from 350 per cent to 400 per cent of salary and from 250 per cent to 300 per cent for the CFO.\n\nThe time frame over which this requirement must be met remains five years from the date of appointment.\n\nIn the event that exceptional individual circumstances exist resulting in an executive not being able to comply with the Policy, the Remuneration Committee will consider whether an exception should apply.\n\n## Post-employment shareholding requirement\n\nExecutive directors are contractually bound to a postemployment shareholding requirement of two years at a level equal to the lower of the shareholding requirements immediately prior to departure or the actual shareholding on departure. The post-employment requirement will be maintained through self-certification, with the Committee keeping this approach under review.\n\nNone of those who were directors at the end of the year had any other interest in the capital of Lloyds Banking Group plc or its subsidiaries.\n\n| Charlie Nunn       | Requirement  1 To be met by 15/08/26   | % of salary   |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Charlie Nunn       | \u00a33.98m                                 | 350%          |\n| Charlie Nunn       | Actual  2 31/12/23                     |               |\n| Charlie Nunn       | \u00a32.23m                                 | 196%          |\n| Charlie Nunn       | Actual  2,3 31/12/22                   |               |\n| Charlie Nunn       | \u00a31.21m                                 | 107%          |\n| William   Chalmers | Requirement  1 To be met by 02/06/24   | % of salary   |\n| William   Chalmers | Actual  2 31/12/23                     |               |\n| William   Chalmers | \u00a33.83m                                 | 467%          |\n| William   Chalmers | Actual  2,3 31/12/22 \u00a32.90m            | 355%          |\n\n- 1 As reported in the 2022 Annual Report, following approval at the 2023 AGM, from 1 January 2024 the shareholding requirement applicable to the GCE will increase to 400 per cent of salary and to 300 per cent for the other executive directors.\n- 2 Calculated using the average share price for the period 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 (45.864 pence).

Shares held by Person Closely Associated, as defined by the Companies Act, but broadly meaning spouse or partner and children, are also included.\n- 3 2022 shareholding has been recalculated using the average share price for the period 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 (45.864 pence). Salary as at 31 December 2022 has been used to calculate the percentage.",

We recognise that companies with proportionate gender diversity see increased performance, and make better decisions. We are working towards an ambition of 50 per cent of senior leadership roles being held by women by 2025. At the end of April 2023 we were at 39.8 per cent, an increase from when we first set our original gender goal in 2014 when we were at 28 per cent.\n\nContinued progress has been made in closing the Gender Pay Gap, with the gap reducing by 2.6 percentage points to 26.7 per cent, the largest improvement since we started reporting. This improvement demonstrates that our actions are moving us in the right direction, however, we remain committed to accelerating our progress.\n\nAs part of our commitment to Helping Britain Prosper, we believe it is essential for us to make an impact beyond our organisation. We therefore co-sponsor the FTSE Women Leaders review, which has set a target of a minimum of 40 per cent women on boards and in leadership teams. Our ongoing work to improve gender balance in our organisation has resulted in us being named in the 2023 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the fifth consecutive year, and in The Times 2023 Top 50 Employers for Gender Equality for the 12th consecutive year.\n\nFurther information is available in our pay gap report  .\n\n## Ethnicity pay\n\n## Mean pay gap\n\n%\n\n|   2023 | 5.7%   |\n|--------|--------|\n|   2022 | 4.6%   |\n\nWe know that diversity of our workforce is important, and that representation is a key driver to close the gaps that exist. For this reason, we made a public commitment to increase Black Heritage representation in senior roles to 3 per cent by 2025 and increase our overall senior Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic representation to 13 per cent by 2025. At the end of April 2023, 10.5 per cent of senior manager roles were held by Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic colleagues, and 1.6 per cent held by Black Heritage colleagues.\n\nWhen it comes to Ethnicity Pay Gap reporting, there is no legislative requirement on UK organisations to publish these figures. However, for the past three years we have published our Ethnicity Pay Gap on a voluntary basis. As a leading UK employer, we've chosen to publish this data because we recognise the importance of transparency in encouraging focus and inspiring purposeful, action-led change. It holds us accountable, helps us to learn, and we believe will lead to positive improvement.\n\nEncouragingly, our disclosure rate has increased from 85.1 per cent in April 2022 to 88.2 per cent in April 2023 (of those colleagues who have chosen to disclose their ethnicity with us). We're pleased to see that our overall representation of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic talent has increased. This is due to higher volumes of inclusive recruitment and a greater proportion of colleagues sharing their ethnicity data with us at the more junior levels of our business. This has, however resulted in an increase in our ethnicity pay gaps from 4.6 per cent to 5.7 per cent because our junior colleagues hold lower paid positions within our business. Whilst we have also seen improvements within the representation of our senior leadership teams this remains lower, affecting our efforts to close the gaps further and we recognise we have more to do to achieve this.\n\nFurther information is available in our pay gap report  .",

Payroll data from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023\n- \u00b7 Colleague total remuneration has been calculated in line with the single total figure of remuneration. The single total figure of remuneration has been calculated for 58,072 UK colleagues within the Group for a full year including full-time equivalent base pay, vesting Long Term Share Plan awards (for eligible colleagues), core benefits, pension, overtime and shift payments, travel/relocation payments (for eligible colleagues) and private medical benefit\n- \u00b7 The average share price between 1 October 2023 and 31 December 2023 of 43.564 pence has been used to indicate the value of vesting Long Term Share Plan awards\n- \u00b7 Due to operational constraints, the calculation of the colleague Pension Input Figure excludes inflationary adjustments for those on the defined benefit scheme. The omission of this factor does not materially affect the outcome of the ratio and/or distort the validity of the valuation\n- \u00b7 All other data has been calculated in line with the methodology for the single total figure of remuneration for the GCE\n\nOur ratios have been calculated using Methodology option A on the basis that it provided the most accurate means of identifying the median, lower and upper quartile colleagues. The ratio has been calculated taking into account the pay and benefits of 58,072 UK employees, other than the individual performing the role of GCE.\n\nThe change in total remuneration ratios since 2017 is largely driven by the more volatile nature of variable pay for the GCE.\n\nThe reduction in 2020 can be attributed to the decision not to make awards under the Group Performance Share plan, reduced performance in the vesting of the 2018 Group Ownership plan compared to the 2017 plan and the reduction in the former GCE\u03e0s pension allowance from 33 per cent to 15 per cent of salary.\n\nIn 2021 the median ratio was calculated for all three individuals undertaking the role of GCE and increased by 137 per cent year-onyear. This increase can be attributed to the one-off buy out awards granted to Charlie Nunn, an increase in the vesting of the LTIP and the payment of Group Performance Share (annual bonus), which were not awarded for 2020.\n\nThe reduction in 2022 was due to two factors. Firstly, Charlie Nunn's remuneration for 2022 did not include any value in respect of Long Term Incentive plans, as no 2020 EGOS award was granted to him given that he was not an executive director at the time of grant. Secondly, the 2021 ratio included the one-off buy-out awards granted to Charlie Nunn. In addition the 2021 ratio was calculated for all three individuals undertaking the role of GCE. Over the same time period, employee total compensation increased by 12 per cent at the lower quartile, 11 per cent at the median and 7 per cent at the upper quartile, also contributing to the decrease in pay ratios.\n\nThere has been a further reduction in 2023 which can be attributed to three key factors. Recognising the desire to focus on the remuneration of lower paid colleagues, no annual pay award was proposed for the GCE for 2023 while the pay budget for the wider workforce was 6.3 per cent. Given the approach focused on lower paid colleagues and colleagues lower in their pay range, this resulted in pay increases of between 8 per cent and 13 per cent for around 43,000 colleagues. In addition, from July 2023 we consolidated a significant portion of our Group Performance Share into base salary for around 32,000 colleagues, further increasing the fixed pay element. Finally, the GCE received a lower annual short-term variable award for 2023 compared to 2022.\n\nFor the majority of colleagues, year-on-year changes in remuneration are principally driven by pay increases and the impacts of Group performance and collective adjustment. The Group has a commitment to pay progression and a continued focus on ensuring higher pay awards for colleagues who are lower paid, or paid lower within their pay range. We are committed to reducing the pay gap between executives and wider colleagues and continue to remain focused on addressing the gap from the bottom up and not just from the top down.\n\nThe Committee is thoughtful of the volatility in pay ratios due to variable reward outcomes. Although the pay ratio is used as a useful reference point to inform policy-setting, the Committee takes into account a number of other factors to assess colleague pay progression.",

The approach focuses on lower paid colleagues.\n\nSalary increases for the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer are in line with the pay awards for the majority of the wider workforce at 4 per cent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fixed Share Award\n\nFixed Share Awards for the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer will increase as part of the 4 per cent fixed pay increase for 2024.\n\n## Awards will therefore be as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 GCE: \u00a31,092,000\n- \u00b7 CFO: \u00a3524,160\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Pension\n\nPension allowances for all executive directors are set at 15 per cent of base salary. Any new executive director appointments in 2024 will also attract a maximum allowance of 15 per cent of base salary.\n\nOver 56,000 colleagues participate in the Group\u03e0s Defined Contribution (DC) Pension scheme where the maximum opportunity for the workforce is 15 per cent of base salary. Executive directors\u03e0 employer pension contributions are therefore aligned with those available to the majority of the workforce.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Benefits\n\nBenefits remain unchanged from 2023. Executive directors receive a flexible benefit allowance of 4 per cent of base salary.\n\nThis can be used to select benefits including life assurance and critical illness cover.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group Performance Share (short term variable)\n\nThe performance measures for determining any individual 2024 GPS awards for executive directors are outlined in the 2024 balanced scorecard on page 125 .\n\nMaximum opportunities for executive directors for 2024 are 140 per cent of base salary.\n\nIndividual awards as a percentage of maximum will directly relate to the overall performance assessment outcome. For the 2024 performance year, any GPS opportunity will be awarded in March 2025 in a combination of cash (up to 50 per cent) and shares.\n\nThe Group will apply deferral in line with minimum regulatory requirements as set out in the Policy. This is consistent with the approach taken by our peers. At least 60 per cent of total variable remuneration awarded to our executive directors will remain deferred over a period of up to seven years, maintaining strong alignment to shareholders.\n\n## Salaries will therefore be as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 GCE: \u00a31,181,700\n- \u00b7 CFO: \u00a3851,703\n\nShares will be released in equal tranches over three years. (See page 129 for further details).\n\nIn addition to the DC arrangement, the Group currently has around 10,000 active members in defined benefit plans, with the effective cost of employer contributions into these arrangements being around 34 per cent of salary.\n\nOther benefits include transportation and private medical cover. The CFO also receives a car allowance.",

LTIP awards will be granted in relation to 2023 performance under the terms of the current Remuneration Policy. The Committee concluded that 2023 performance, including assessment of our 2023 Group scorecard and other factors, was at a level to make awards. This is known as the 'pre-grant test'.\n\nTo ensure strong alignment between variable reward outcomes and the creation of shareholder value through the delivery of our strategy and the deepening of our relationships with our customers, the Committee has determined that LTIP awards will be granted with a value of 300 per cent of salary to the GCE and CFO to reflect the Group\u03e0s performance in 2023.\n\nIn accordance with regulatory requirements LTIP awards will not accrue dividend equivalents over the vesting period; in line with the Directors' Remuneration Policy, the number of shares granted under the awards will be determined using a share price adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends or equivalents during the vesting period.\n\n## Performance measures and weightings\n\nThe 2023 DRP set out a framework to align LTIP performance measures to the financial performance of the Group, the delivery of its refreshed, growth-orientated strategy and the progress towards its environmental commitments. Three financial measures have been chosen, aligned to our disclosed intentions in the 2022 ARA, with a total weighting of 50 per cent. Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE) emphasises the efficient use of capital and ensures focus on long-term value creation, Capital Build recognises the importance of maintaining a strong financial foundation for the Group and prioritises capital\n\naccretive decision making for the long-term and rTSR compares the value delivered to a shareholder in the Group over the performance period with the value delivered to shareholders by our peers.\n\nA dedicated 35 per cent weighting will focus on the Group's delivery of its strategy and success of our strategic initiatives in driving revenue growth and diversification. The Committee will give consideration to an assessment of performance against quantifiable Board metrics aligned to each of our four strategic growth pillars: Deepen and innovate in Consumer, Create a new mass affluent offering, Digitise and diversify our SME business and Target our Corporate and Institutional offering.\n\nFinally, 15 per cent weight is attributed to environmental measures, reflecting that the transition to a low carbon economy is at the core of our strategy and aligns with our purpose to Help Britain Prosper. The Committee will assess performance of the Group\u03e0s sustainable financing and investment commitments over the performance period, 2026 progress towards its 2030 NZBA sector targets and delivery against Scottish Widows' net zero ambition (see page 33 ).\n\n## Target setting\n\nSetting targets is a critical focus area for the Committee and a rigorous exercise has been undertaken to ensure our targets are sufficiently stretching. We have taken into account our long-term strategic ambitions, commitments to our ESG agenda and comparable industry returns.\n\n## Operation\n\nThe awards made in 2024 will vest based on the Group's performance between January 2024 to December 2026.

For this reason, it has been removed from the 2024 scorecard and its 5 per cent weight allocated to the RoTE measure recognising its importance to shareholders. This brings the total financial weighting to 60 per cent.\n\nWhilst a RoTE measure is also included in the LTIP performance metrics, it is considered a fundamental indicator of Group performance and creation of shareholder value. The RoTE within the annual scorecard focuses on in-year performance while the LTIP assesses long-term performance.

This helps to avoid any potential unintended outcomes that might arise from the application of formulaic performance criteria.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration report continued\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, the Committee was comprised of five non-executive directors. From September 2023, the Committee has comprised of four non-executive directors, after Alan Dickinson stepped down from the Committee. Sir Robin Budenberg attends the Committee in his role as Group Chair. The non-executive directors are from a wide background to provide a balanced and independent view on remuneration matters. Two of the three designated independent non-executive directors of the Ring-Fenced Banks also attend meetings of the Committee as observers in order to provide insights on matters relevant to the Ring-Fenced Banks and as part of their role in the Group's overall governance structure. For further details of Committee membership and attendance at meetings, please see page 79 .\n\nDuring the year, Charlie Nunn, as the GCE provided regular briefings to the Committee. In addition, the Committee engaged with and received updates from the Chief People and Places Officer, Total Reward Director and the Chief Risk Officer.\n\nThe purpose of the Committee is to set the remuneration for all executive directors and the Chair, including pension rights and any compensation payments. It recommends and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for senior management and material risk takers. It also considers, agrees and recommends\n\nto the Board an overall remuneration policy and philosophy for the Group that is aligned with its long-term business strategy, its business objectives, its risk appetite, purpose and values and the long-term interests of the Group, and recognises the interests of relevant stakeholders, including the wider workforce. The Committee\u03e0s operation is designed to ensure that no conflicts of interest arise, and in particular, the Committee ensures that no individual is present when matters relating to their own remuneration are discussed.\n\n## Advisers\n\nPwC was appointed by the Committee in May 2022 following a competitive tender process and was retained for 2023. The Committee is of the view that PwC provides independent remuneration advice to the Committee and does not have any connections with the Group or any director that may impair its independence.\n\nMore broadly, PwC provides unrelated professional services to the Group in the ordinary course of business including tax, advisory, internal audit and non-audit assurance services. PwC attended Committee meetings upon invitation and fees payable for the provision of services in respect of directors' remuneration in 2023 amounted to \u00a3122,650 excluding VAT. Fees paid to PwC for advising the Committee are based partly on a fixed fee and partly on a time and materials basis.\n\n|

Information on how the Policy will be implemented in 2024 is included in the annual report on remuneration on pages 123 to 125 .\n\nThe Committee extensively consulted on the Policy proposals with the Group's institutional shareholders and key proxy rating agencies. The Committee regularly engages and consults with key shareholders to take into account their feedback on the Policy and its implementation.\n\nThe full policy is set out in the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts ( pages 125 to 133 ) which is available on our website  .\n\n## Directors' Remuneration Policy and alignment to our Group strategy\n\nThe performance measures selected for the GPS and LTIP will be set annually by the Committee taking account of the Group's strategic priorities and its most important financial measures. Performance measures are selected to ensure an appropriate balance between short and long-term strategic goals and to align executive director and shareholder interests. In determining the appropriate set of measures and targets for annual bonus and LTIP awards, the Committee has discretion to vary the performance measures, or to substitute the metrics, over the life of the Directors' Remuneration Policy taking into account the Group's strategic plan or emerging best practice.\n\nThe only significant difference between the Policy for executive directors and colleagues outside the Group Executive Committee is participation in the LTIP which is restricted to those most directly accountable for the successful delivery of the Group's strategy.\n\nThe table below summarises how the Policy applies across the Group.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration Policy and Group Remuneration Policy alignment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                          | Executive   directors   | Group Executive Committee   | Other   material risk takers   | Other   employees   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Fixed                                    |                         |                             |                                |                     |\n| Base salary                              |                         |                             |                                |                     |\n| Fixed Share Award / Role-based allowance |                         |                             |                                |                     |\n| Pension and benefits                     |                         |                             |                                |                     |\n| Variable                                 |                         |                             |                                |                     |\n| Short term incentive                     |                         |                             |                                |                     |\n| Long term incentive                      |                         |                             |                                |                     |\n\n## Remuneration policy table for executive directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Base Salary\n\n## Purpose and link to strategy\n\nTo support the recruitment and retention of executive directors of the calibre required to develop and deliver the Group's strategic priorities. Base salary reflects the role of the individual, taking account of market competitiveness, responsibilities and experience, and pay in the Group as a whole.\n\n## Operation\n\nBase salaries are typically reviewed annually with any increases normally taking effect from 1 April for executive directors. When determining and reviewing base salary levels, the Committee takes into account base salary increases for employees throughout the Group and ensures that decisions are made within the following two parameters:\n\n- \u00b7 An objective assessment of the individual's responsibilities and the size and scope of their role, using objective job-sizing methodologies.\n- \u00b7 Pay for comparable roles in comparable publicly listed financial services groups of a similar size.\n\nSalary may be paid in sterling or other currency and at an exchange rate determined by the Committee.\n\n## Maximum potential\n\nThe Committee will make no increase which it believes is inconsistent with the two parameters. Increases will normally be no more than the increase awarded to the overall employee population. However, a greater salary increase may be appropriate in certain circumstances, such as a new appointment made on a salary below a market competitive level, where phased increases are planned, or where there has been an increase in the responsibilities of an individual. Where increases are awarded in excess of the wider employee population, the Committee will provide an explanation in the relevant annual report on remuneration.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nN/A",

This may include benefits such as accommodation, relocation, and travel. The Committee retains the right to provide additional benefits depending on individual circumstances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## All-employee plans\n\n## Purpose and link to strategy\n\nExecutive directors are eligible to participate in HMRC-approved share plans which promote share ownership by giving employees an opportunity to invest in Group shares.\n\n## Operation\n\nExecutive directors may participate in these plans in line with HMRC guidelines currently prevailing (where relevant), on the same basis as other eligible employees.\n\n## Maximum potential\n\nThe maximum award is 100 per cent of base salary.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nN/A\n\n## Maximum potential\n\nThe maximum allowance for all executive directors is set at 15 per cent of base salary in line with the majority of the workforce.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nN/A\n\nWhen determining and reviewing the level of benefits provided, the Committee ensures that decisions are made within the following two parameters:\n\n- \u00b7 An objective assessment of the individual's responsibilities and the size and scope of their role, using objective job-sizing methodologies\n- \u00b7 Benefits for comparable roles in comparable publicly listed financial services groups of a similar size\n\n## Maximum potential\n\nThe Committee will only make increases in the benefits currently provided which it believes are consistent with the two parameters above. Executive directors receive a flexible benefits allowance which does not currently exceed 4 per cent of base salary.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nN/A\n\n## Maximum potential\n\nParticipation levels may be increased up to HMRC limits as amended from time to time. The monthly savings limits for Save As You Earn (SAYE) is currently \u00a3500.

The GPS may be delivered partly in cash, shares, notes or other debt instruments including contingent convertible bonds. Where all or part of any award is deferred, the Committee may adjust these deferred awards in the event of any variation of share capital, demerger, special dividend or distribution or amend the terms of the plan in accordance with the plan rules.\n\nWhere an award or a deferred award is in shares or other sharelinked instrument, the number of shares to be awarded may be calculated using a fair value or based on discount to market value, as appropriate to reflect the fact that the directors are not eligible for dividends on unvested deferred awards.\n\nThe Committee applies its judgement to determine the payout level commensurate with business and/or individual performance or other factors as determined by the Committee. The Committee may reduce the level of award (including to zero), apply additional conditions to the vesting, or delay the vesting of deferred awards to a specified date or until conditions set by the Committee are satisfied, where it considers it appropriate.

Awards will be granted in the form of conditional rights to shares in the Group.\n\nThe grant price of shares to be awarded may be discounted to reflect that the directors are not eligible for dividends on unvested awards.\n\nAwards shall vest in five equal annual instalments which will not start before the third anniversary of grant; each vesting will be subject to a further holding period as required by regulation.\n\nThe Committee retains full discretion to amend the vesting levels should the outcome not reflect business and/or individual performance including risk and conduct outcomes. The Committee may reduce (including to zero) the level of the award, apply additional conditions to the vesting, or delay the vesting of awards to a specified date or until conditions set by the Committee are satisfied, where it considers it appropriate. Awards may be subject to malus and clawback for a period of up to seven years after the date of award which may be extended to 10 years where there is an ongoing internal or regulatory investigation.\n\n## Maximum potential\n\nThe maximum GPS opportunity is 140 per cent of salary for the executive directors.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nMeasures and targets are set annually by the Committee in line with the Group's strategic business plan and further details are set out in the annual report on remuneration for the relevant year.\n\nMeasures consist of both financial and non-financial measures and the weighting of these measures will be determined annually by the Committee. All assessments of performance are ultimately subject to the Committee's judgement, but measures will not vest if a 25 per cent threshold performance is not met. The normal 'target' level of the GPS is 50 per cent of maximum opportunity.\n\nThe Committee is committed to providing transparency in its decision making in respect of GPS awards and will disclose historic measures and target information together with information relating to how the Group has performed against those targets in the annual report on remuneration for the relevant year except to the extent that this information is deemed to be commercially sensitive, in which case it will be disclosed once it is deemed not to be sensitive.\n\n## Maximum potential\n\nThe maximum Long Term Incentive Plan opportunity is 300 per cent of base salary for annual awards to all executive directors. The actual award level granted will be determined with reference to a pre-grant test based on an assessment of performance by the Committee.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nAwards will be subject to forward-looking performance measures based on financial and other strategic and environmental measures set out in the annual report on remuneration each year; performance will be measured over a period of not less than three years as determined by the Committee.\n\nThe Committee has the discretion to change the measures or their weightings subject to a minimum of 50 per cent of the award being dependent on financial measures.\n\nNo more than 25 per cent of the award will vest for threshold performance. 100 per cent of the award will vest for achieving the maximum performance. Where performance falls between threshold, target and maximum levels, an intermediate number of awards will vest.",

When considering collective adjustment, a report is submitted to the Remuneration Committee and Board Risk Committee regarding any adjustments required to balanced scorecards or the overall GPS and/or LTSP/LTIP outcome to reflect in-year or prior year risk matters.\n\nThe application of malus will generally be considered when:\n\n- \u00b7 There is reasonable evidence of employee misbehaviour or material error or that they participated in conduct which resulted in losses for the Group or failed to meet appropriate standards of fitness and propriety\n- \u00b7 There is material failure of risk management at a Group, business area, division and/or business unit level\n- \u00b7 The Committee determines that the financial results for a given year do not support the level of variable remuneration awarded\n- \u00b7 Any other circumstances where the Committee consider adjustments should be made\n\nJudgement on individual performance adjustment is informed by taking into account the severity of the issue, the individual's proximity to the issue and the individual's behaviour in relation to the issue. Individual adjustment may be applied through adjustments to balanced scorecard assessments and/or through reducing the variable remuneration outcome.\n\nAwards are subject to clawback for a period of up to seven years after the date of award which may be extended to 10 years where there is an ongoing internal or regulatory investigation.\n\nThe application of clawback will generally be considered when:\n\n- \u00b7 There is reasonable evidence of employee misbehaviour or material error\n- \u00b7 There is material failure of risk management at a Group, business area, division and/or business unit level\n\nFrom 2 October 2023 we comply with new US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules which require listed firms in the US (including foreign issuers such as Lloyds Banking Group) to be able to recover variable awards in the event of a restatement of the company\u03e0s financial statements.",

If approved by shareholders, the final dividend will be paid on 21 May 2024.\n\nA final dividend of 1.60 pence per share totalling \u00a31,059 million in respect of 2022 was paid on 23 May 2023, and an interim dividend of 0.92 pence per share totalling \u00a3592 million was paid on 12 September 2023. Further information on dividends is shown in note 46 on page 305 and is incorporated into this directors' report by reference.\n\nThe Board continues to give due consideration at each year end to the return of any surplus capital to shareholders and for 2023, the Board intends to return up to \u00a32.0 billion through a share buyback programme in respect of the Company's ordinary shares. This represents the return of capital over and above the Board's view of the current level of capital required to grow the business, meet regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties.\n\nThe share buyback programme is intended to commence as soon as is practicable and is expected to be completed, subject to continued authority from the PRA, by 31 December 2024. Based on the total ordinary dividend and the intended ordinary share buyback the total capital return in respect of 2023 will be up to \u00a33.8 billion.\n\nThe Company intends to use the authority for the repurchase of ordinary shares granted to it at the 2023 AGM to implement the proposed share buyback. Details of this existing authority are set out under 'Power of directors in relation to shares'. Shareholders will be asked to renew this authority at the 2024 AGM, in line with common practice.\n\n## Appointment and retirement of directors\n\nThe appointment and retirement of directors is governed by the Company's articles of association, the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Companies Act 2006. The Company's articles of association may only be amended by a special resolution of the shareholders in a general meeting.\n\nIn the interests of good governance and in accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all directors will retire at the 2024 AGM and those wishing to serve again will submit themselves for re-election. Biographies of the current directors are set out on pages 74 to 75 . Details of the directors seeking re-election at the AGM will be set out in the Notice of Meeting.\n\n## Board composition changes\n\nThere were no changes to the composition of the Board since 1 January 2023 up to the date of this report. Alan Dickinson and Lord Lupton have notified the Board that they do not intend to seek re-election at this year's annual general meeting. Nathan Bostock will be appointed as a non-executive director and, subject to regulatory approval, Chair of Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc, in each case with effect from 1 August 2024.\n\n## Directors' and Officers' liability insurance\n\nThroughout 2023 the Group had appropriate insurance cover in place to protect directors, including the directors who retired during the year, from liabilities that may arise against them personally in connection with the performance of their role.\n\nAs well as insurance cover, the Group agrees to indemnify the directors to the maximum extent permitted by law. Further information on the Group's indemnity arrangements is provided in the directors' indemnities section.\n\n## Directors' indemnities\n\nThe directors of the Company have entered into individual deeds of indemnity with the Company which constituted 'qualifying third party indemnity provisions' for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006. The deeds indemnify the directors to the maximum extent permitted by law and remain in force. The deeds were in force during the whole of the financial year. Deeds for existing directors are available for inspection at the Company\u03e0s registered office.\n\nThe Company has also granted deeds of indemnity by deed poll and by way of entering into individual deeds, which constitute 'qualifying third party indemnity provisions' to the directors of the Group's subsidiary companies, including to former directors who retired during the year and since the year-end, and to Group colleagues subject to the provisions of the Senior Managers and Certification Regime. Such deeds were in force during the financial year ended 31 December 2023 and remain in force as at the date of this report.\n\nQualifying pension scheme indemnities have also been granted to the Trustees of the Group's pension schemes, which were in force for the whole of the financial year and remain in force as at the date of this report.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nThe Board has a comprehensive procedure for reviewing and, as permitted by the Companies Act 2006 and the Company's articles of association, approving actual and potential conflicts of interest. Directors have a duty to notify the Chair and Company Secretary as soon as they become aware of actual or potential conflict situations. Any changes to the commitments of directors are reported to the Nomination and Governance Committee and the Board and a register of directors' interests is regularly reviewed and authorised by the Board to ensure the authorisation status remains appropriate.\n\nLord Lupton is a senior adviser to Greenhill Europe, an investment bank focused on providing financial advice on significant mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, financings and capital raising to corporations, partnerships, institutions and governments. The Board has authorised the potential conflicts and requires Lord Lupton to recuse himself from discussions, should the need arise.\n\n## Share capital\n\nDetail of the rights and obligations attaching to the Company's issued share capital may be found in note 40 to the financial statements.\n\n## Power of directors in relation to shares\n\nThe Board manages the business of the Company under the powers set out in the articles of association, which include the directors' ability to issue or buy back shares. The directors were granted authorities to issue and allot shares and to buy back shares at the 2023 AGM. Shareholders will be asked to renew these authorities at the 2024 AGM.\n\nThe authority in respect of purchase of the Company's ordinary shares, as granted at the 2022 AGM, was limited to 7,047,917,092 ordinary shares, equivalent to 10 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at the latest practicable date prior to publication of the 2022 AGM Notice of Meeting. Such authority was used during the year under review in connection with the share buyback programme described below and, as at 31 December 2023 and the date of this report, a total of 4,386,262,707 ordinary shares had been repurchased.",

Our total emissions, in tonnes of CO 2 equivalent, are reported in the table below. Deloitte LLP has provided limited level ISAE 3000 (Revised) assurance over selected non-financial indicators. Their full independent assurance statement is available online on the financial downloads page of our website.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe Group follows the principles of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard to calculate Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from our worldwide operations. Energy consumption is calculated according to guidance set out by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero. The reporting period is 1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023, which is different to that of our directors' report (January to December 2023). This is in line with the regulations in that most of the emissions reporting year falls within the period of the directors' report.",

Reported Scope 1 emissions are those generated from gas and oil used in buildings, emissions from fuels used in UK company owned vehicles used for business travel and fugitive emissions from the use of air conditioning and chiller/refrigerant plant. Reported Scope 2 emissions are generated from the use and purchase of electricity and imported heat through heat networks; which are calculated using both the location and market-based methodologies. Reported Scope 3 emissions relate to business travel (category 6) and commuting (category 7) undertaken by colleagues, emissions from colleagues working from home (category 7), operational waste (category 5) and the extraction and distribution of each of our energy sources electricity, imported heating, gas and oil (category 3). Scope 3 emissions do not include purchased good and services, capital goods and upstream transportation and distribution (category 1, 2 and 4) and investments (category 15), but these figures are disclosed in the sustainability report which can be found on the responsible business downloads page   of our website.\n\n## Intensity ratio\n\n| Legacy                                                             | Oct 2022-   Sep 2023   | Oct 2021- Sep 2022   | Oct 2018- Sep 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| GHG emissions (CO2e) per \u00a3m of  underlying income (Location  1     |                        |                      |                      |\n| Based)                                                             | 9.90                   | 10.10                | 16.58                |\n| GHG emissions (CO2e) per \u00a3m of  underlying income (Market Based) 1 | 6.89                   | 6.74                 | 10.33                |\n\nThis year our overall location-based carbon emissions 2 were 177,599 tonnes CO 2 e; a 0.7 per cent increasing year on year. While our overall market-based carbon emissions 3 were 123,499 tonnes CO 2 e; a 5.0 per cent increase since 2021/22 mainly driven by higher business travel and commuting related carbon emissions. Group energy consumption (electricity and gas) has reduced in line with extensive investment in energy efficiency across our buildings and adaptations to our established hybrid workstyle.\n\n- 2 Includes Scope 1, 2 emissions and Scope 3 categories 3, 5, 6 and 7. Scope 3 categories 1, 2, 4 and 15 are excluded.\n- 3 Since January 2019, our Scope 2 market-based emissions relating to electricity consumption are zero tCO 2 e, as we have procured renewable electricity mainly through our Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and Green Tariff, and renewable certificates equivalent to the remainder to make up the total electricity consumption in each of the markets in which we operate.\n\n## Carbon emissions (tonnes CO2e)\n\n|                                                | Oct 2022- Sep 2023   | Oct 2021- Sep 2022   | Oct 2018- Sep 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Total CO2e (market based) 1                    | 123,499  \u221a           | 117,657              | 176,993              |\n| Total CO2e (location based)  1                 | 177,599  \u221a           | 176,430              | 284,219              |\n| Total Scope 1 and 2 (location based)  1        | 76,574               | 86,243               | 150,263              |\n| - of which UK Scope 1 and 2 (location based) 1 | 75,813               | 85,377               | 147,881              |\n| Total Scope 1 and 2 (market based) 1           | 22,474               | 27,470               | 43,037               |\n| - of which UK Scope 1 and 2 (market based) 1   | 22,269               | 27,203               | 42,350               |\n| Total Scope 1 1                                | 22,464  \u221a            | 27,468               | 42,650               |\n| Total Scope 2 (market based) 3                 | 10  \u221a                | 2                    | 387                  |\n| Of which electricity                           | 0                    | 0                    | 387                  |\n| Total Scope 2 (location based) 1               | 54,110  \u221a            | 58,775               | 107,613              |\n| Total Scope 3 1                                | 101,025  \u221a           | 90,187               | 133,956              |\n\nAdditional data from baseline year 2018/19 to 2021/22 and further information on our Scope 3 emissions is available in our Sustainability Metrics Datasheet on the responsible business downloads page   of our website.\n\n## Global energy use (kWhs)\n\n|                                       | Oct 2022-  Sep 2023   | Oct 2021- Sep 2022   | Oct 2018- Sep 2019       |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|\n| Total global energy use 1             | 368,359,363  \u221a        | 420,788,169          | 594,436,189              |\n| of which UK energy use 1              | 364,501,857           | 416,304,279          | 588,218,331              |\n| Total building energy 1               | 353,947,908           |                      | 409,173,498  554,596,742 |\n| Total company owned vehicle  energy 1 | 9,850,017             | 7,599,309            | 30,264,339               |\n| Total grey fleet vehicle energy 2     | 4,561,437             | 4,015,361            | 9,575,109                |\n\n- 2 Grey fleet refers to colleague and hired road vehicles being used for a business purpose.\n- 3 One branch across our own portfolio has joined a District Heat Network in July of 2022, reportable as scope 2 emissions; we continue to procure 100 per cent renewable electricity across our own operations.\n- \u221a   Indicator is subject to Limited ISAE 3000 (revised) assurance by Deloitte LLP for the 2023 Annual Responsible Business Reporting.

This workstream includes onsite optimisation and strategic alterations of building management and control systems to match the run hours of plant to core operating hours and ensures temperature settings are aligned with Group comfort guidelines. In 2023, 30 deep dives, 47 onsite optimisations, 16 remote optimisations, 14 onsite engagements and 151 bank holiday programmes were completed. Together with the energy optimisation programme, we have also delivered a significant LED lighting and Building Management System upgrade throughout our estate, leading to an estimated annualised 6,406 MWh electricity saving. These were the principal measures taken in 2023 to increase the Group's energy efficiency.\n\n## Omissions\n\nEmissions associated with our supply chain, joint ventures and investments are not included in this disclosure as they fall outside the scope of our operational boundary. Further information on these sources can be found in the sustainability report available on the responsible business downloads page   of our website. The Group does not have any emissions associated with the purchase of steam or cooling for its own use and is not aware of any other material sources of omissions from our reporting.",

All data is disclosed as at 31 December 2023. The Group has 100 per cent completion of gender data and ethnic background data for the Board and Group Executive Committee (GEC). All diversity information for ethnicity is based on voluntary self-declaration by colleagues. Our systems do not record diversity data of colleagues who have not declared this information and is for UK payroll only. Gender data includes international, those on parental/maternity leave, absent without leave and long-term sick and excludes contractors, Group non-executive directors and temporary and agency staff. The GEC assists the Group Chief Executive in strategic, cross-business or Group-wide matters and inputs to the Board. GEC includes the Group Chief Executive. Diversity calculations are based on headcount, not full-time employee value. Ethnicity data excludes non-UK colleagues.\n\n## Independent auditor and audit information\n\nEach person who is a director at the date of approval of this report confirms that, so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditor is unaware and each director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a director to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditor is aware of that information.\n\nThis confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Statement of directors' responsibilities\n\nThe directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, including the directors\u03e0 remuneration report and the financial statements, in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the directors are required to prepare the Group and parent Company financial statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nUnder company law, the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company and Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to properly select and apply accounting policies; present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity\u03e0s financial position and financial performance; and make an assessment of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company\u03e0s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the directors\u03e0 remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nA copy of the financial statements is placed on our website on the financial downloads page . The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nEach of the current directors who are in office as at the date of this report, and whose names and functions are listed on pages 74 to 75 of this annual report, confirm that, to the best of his or her knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group and the Company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group and the Company\n- \u00b7 The management report contained in the strategic report and the directors' report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and the Company together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face\n- \u00b7 The annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company and the Group's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\nThe directors have also separately reviewed and approved the strategic report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Kate Cheetham,\n\nCompany Secretary\n\nOn behalf of the Board 21 February 2024 Lloyds Banking Group plc Registered in Scotland, No. SC095000",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\n## Risk management is at the heart of Helping Britain Prosper and creating a more sustainable and inclusive future for people and businesses.\n\nOur mission is to protect our customers, shareholders, colleagues and the Group, while enabling sustainable growth. This is achieved through informed risk decisions and robust risk management, supported by a consistent riskfocused culture.\n\nThe risk overview ( pages 39 to 45 ) provides a summary of risk management within the Group and the key focus areas for 2023, including maintaining support for customers. The risk overview also highlights the importance of the connectivity of principal, emerging and strategic risks and how they are embedded into the Group's strategic risk management framework.\n\nThis full risk management section provides a more in-depth picture of how risk is managed within the Group, detailing the Group's emerging risks, approach to stress testing, risk governance, committee structure, appetite for risk and a full analysis of the principal risk categories ( pages 145 to 196 ), the framework by which risks are identified, managed, mitigated and monitored.\n\n## The Group's approach to risk\n\nThe Group operates a prudent approach to risk with rigorous management controls to support sustainable business growth and minimise losses. Through a strong and independent risk function (Risk division), a robust control framework is maintained to identify and escalate current and emerging risks, support sustainable growth within the Group's risk appetite, and to drive and inform good risk reward decision making.\n\nTo comply with UK specific ring-fencing requirements, core banking services are ring-fenced from other activities within the overall Group. The Group's enterprise risk management framework (ERMF) and risk appetite apply across the Group. These are supplemented by sub-group specific risk management frameworks and risk appetites which operate within the Group parameters. The Group's Corporate Governance Framework applies across Lloyds Banking Group plc, Lloyds Bank plc, Bank of Scotland plc and HBOS plc. It is tailored where needed to meet the entity-specific needs of Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc, within the Ring-Fenced Bank sub-group and supplementary corporate governance frameworks are in place to address the specific requirements of the other sub-groups (Non-Ring-Fenced Bank, Insurance and Equity Investments).\n\nThe Group's ERMF is structured to align with the industry-accepted internal control framework standards.\n\nThe ERMF applies to every area of the business and covers all types of risk. It is reviewed, updated and approved by the Board to reflect any changes in the nature of the Group's business and external regulations, law, corporate governance and industry good practice. The Group is in the process of conducting a more detailed review of the ERMF which will result in a reclassification of our principal risks in 2024.\n\nThe ERMF provides the Group with an effective mechanism for developing and embedding risk policies and risk management strategies which are aligned with the risks faced by its businesses. It also seeks to facilitate effective communication on these matters across the Group.\n\n## Role of the Board and senior management\n\nKey responsibilities of the Board and senior management include:\n\n- \u00b7 Approval of the ERMF and Board risk appetite\n- \u00b7 Approval of Group-wide risk principles and policies\n- \u00b7 The cascade of delegated authority (for example to Board sub-committees and the Group Chief Executive)\n- \u00b7 Effective oversight of risk management consistent with risk appetite\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nThe Group's approach to setting, governing, embedding and monitoring risk appetite is detailed in the risk appetite framework, a key component of the ERMF.\n\nRisk appetite is defined within the Group as the amount and type of risk that the Group is prepared to seek, accept or tolerate in delivering its strategy.\n\nBusiness planning aims to optimise value within the Group's risk appetite parameters and deliver on its promise of Helping Britain Prosper.\n\nThe Group's risk appetite statement details the risk parameters within which the Group operates. The statement forms part of the Group's control framework and is embedded into its policies, authorities and limits, to guide decision making and risk management. Group risk appetite is regularly reviewed and refreshed to ensure appropriate coverage across our principal risks and any emerging risks, and to align with internal or external change.\n\nThe Board is responsible for approving the Group's Board risk appetite statement annually. Group Board level metrics are augmented by further executive-level metrics and cascaded into more detailed business appetite metrics and limits.\n\nThe following areas are currently included in the Group Board risk appetite:\n\n- \u00b7 Capital: the Group maintains capital levels commensurate with a prudent level of solvency to achieve financial resilience and market confidence\n- \u00b7 Change and execution: the Group has limited appetite for negative impacts on customers, colleagues, or the Group as a result of change activity\n- \u00b7 Climate: the Group takes action to support the Group and its customers' transition to net zero, and maintain its resilience against the risks relating to climate change\n- \u00b7 Conduct: the Group delivers good outcomes for its customers\n- \u00b7 Credit : the Group has a conservative and well-balanced credit portfolio through the economic cycle in line with the Group's target return on equity in aggregate. The Group's approach focuses on origination quality and levers at Board level while dynamically adapting to the risk environment, business growth strategy, industry practices and regulatory expectations\n- \u00b7 Data: the Group has zero appetite for data-related regulatory fines or enforcement actions\n- \u00b7 Funding and liquidity : the Group maintains a prudent liquidity profile and a balance sheet structure that limits its reliance on potentially volatile sources of funding\n- \u00b7 Insurance underwriting : the Group has an appetite to take on insurance underwriting risks where they fit with our strategic objectives\n- \u00b7 Market: the Group has effective controls in place to identify and manage the market risk inherent in our customer and client-focused activities\n- \u00b7 Model : material models perform in line with expectations\n- \u00b7 Operational: the Group has robust controls in place to manage operational losses, reputational events and regulatory breaches. It identifies and assesses emerging risks and acts to mitigate these\n- \u00b7 Operational resilience: the Group has limited appetite for disruption to services to customers and stakeholders from significant unexpected events\n- \u00b7 People: the Group leads responsibly and proficiently, manages people resource effectively, supports and develops colleague skills and talent, creates and nurtures the right culture and meets legal and regulatory obligations related to its people\n- \u00b7 Regulatory and legal: the Group interprets and complies with all relevant regulation and all applicable laws (including codes of conduct which could have legal implications) and/or legal obligations",

Senior executives are supported where required by a committeebased structure which is designed to ensure open challenge and support effective decision making.\n\nThe Group's risk appetite, principles, policies, procedures, controls and reporting are regularly reviewed and updated where needed to ensure they remain fully in line with regulation, law, corporate governance and industry good practice.\n\nThe interaction of the executive and non-executive governance structures relies upon a culture of transparency and openness that is encouraged by both the Board and senior management.\n\nBoard level engagement, coupled with the direct involvement of senior management in Group-wide risk issues at Group Executive Committee level, ensures that escalated issues are promptly addressed and remediation plans are initiated where required.\n\nLine managers are directly accountable for identifying and managing risks in their individual businesses, ensuring that business decisions strike an appropriate balance between risk and reward and are consistent with the Group's risk appetite.\n\nClear responsibilities and accountabilities for risk are defined across the Group through a three lines of defence model which ensures effective independent oversight and assurance in respect of key decisions.\n\nThe Risk Committee governance framework is outlined on page 141 .\n\n## Three lines of defence model\n\nThe ERMF is implemented through a 'three lines of defence' model which defines clear responsibilities and accountabilities and ensures effective independent oversight and assurance activities take place covering key decisions.\n\nBusiness lines (first line) have primary responsibility for risk decisions, identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling risks within their areas of accountability. They are required to establish effective governance and control frameworks for their business to be compliant with Group policy requirements, to maintain appropriate risk management skills, mechanisms and toolkits, and to act within Group risk appetite parameters set and approved by the Board.\n\nRisk division (second line) is centralised, headed by the Chief Risk Officer, providing oversight and constructive challenge to the effectiveness of risk decisions taken by business management, providing proactive advice and guidance, reviewing, challenging and reporting on the risk profile of the Group and ensuring that mitigating actions are appropriate.\n\nIt also has a key role in promoting the implementation of a strategic approach to risk management reflecting the risk appetite and ERMF agreed by the Board that encompasses:\n\n- \u00b7 Overseeing embedding of effective risk management processes\n- \u00b7 Transparent, focused risk monitoring and reporting\n- \u00b7 Provision of expert and high-quality advice and guidance to the Board, executives and management on strategic issues and horizon scanning, including pending regulatory changes\n- \u00b7 A constructive dialogue with the first line through provision of advice, development of common methodologies, understanding, education, training, and development of new risk management tools\n\nThe primary role of Group Internal Audit (third line) is to help the Board and executive management protect the assets, reputation and sustainability of the Group. Group Internal Audit is led by the Group Chief Internal Auditor. Group Internal Audit provides independent assurance to the Audit Committee and the Board through performing reviews and engaging with committees and executive management, providing opinion, challenge and informal advice on risk and the state of the control environment. Group Internal Audit is a single independent internal audit function, reporting to the Group Audit Committee, and the Board or Board Audit Committees of the sub-groups, subsidiaries and legal entities where applicable.\n\n## Risk and control cycle from identification to reporting\n\nTo allow senior management to make informed risk decisions, the business follows a continuous risk management approach. This risk and control cycle, from identification to reporting, ensures that there is consistency in the approach to managing and mitigating risks impacting the Group.\n\nThe risk and control self-assessment (RCSA) process is used to identify, measure and manage operational risk across the Group. Risks, including emerging risks, are identified and measured on an inherent basis, using a consistent quantification methodology.\n\nAll key controls are recorded against material inherent risks, and assessed on a regular basis, in response to triggers or as a minimum annually. Where a control is not effective, the root cause is established and action plans implemented to improve control design or performance. The assessment of control effectiveness combined with a view of the inherent risk assessment is used to determine the residual risk that the Group is exposed to.\n\nRisks are reviewed and independently challenged by the Risk division and then reported on a regular basis to management and the Board through the risk governance structure. Risk exposure is compared to overall risk appetite as well as specific limits or triggers. When thresholds are breached, committee minutes are clear on the actions and time frames required to address the risk and bring the exposure back within tolerance.\n\nRisk identification is also conducted through the use of scenario analysis which considers the most material risks the Group faces and identifies and assesses extreme, but plausible instances which may occur.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nThe Group operates a prudent business model and a balanced approach to risk management. This provides a solid foundation to deliver good customer outcomes and drive forward the Group's strategic transformation to ensure we continue Helping Britain Prosper. Guided by the Board, the senior management articulates and role models the core risk values to which the Group aspires. Senior management establishes a strong focus on building and sustaining long-term relationships with customers, through the economic cycle. The Group's Code of Ethics and Responsibility, reinforce colleagues' accountability for the risks they take, and supports better decision making to meet their customers' needs.",

A library of risk management learning resources is available, which all colleagues who have specific risk management roles can access to build their skills and capabilities.\n\nThere is ongoing investment in risk systems and models alongside the Group's investment in customer and product systems and processes. This drives improvements in risk data quality, aggregation and reporting leading to effective and efficient risk decisions.\n\n## Risk decision making and reporting\n\nRisk analysis and reporting enables better understanding of risks and returns, supporting the identification of opportunities as well as better management of risks.\n\nAn aggregate view of the Group's overall risk profile, key risks and management actions, and performance against risk appetite, including the Key Risk Insights Report and Consolidated Risk Report (CRR), is reported to and discussed monthly at the Group Risk Committee with regular reporting to the Board Risk Committee and the Board.\n\n## Financial reporting risk management systems and internal controls\n\nThe Group maintains risk management systems and internal controls relating to the financial reporting process which are designed to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure that accounting policies are appropriately and consistently applied, transactions are recorded accurately, and undertaken in accordance with delegated authorities, that assets are safeguarded and liabilities are properly stated\n- \u00b7 Enable the calculation, preparation and reporting of financial, prudential regulatory and tax outcomes in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards, statutory and regulatory requirements\n- \u00b7 Enable certifications by the Senior Accounting Officer relating to maintenance of appropriate tax accounting and in accordance with the 2009 Finance Act\n- \u00b7 Ensure that disclosures are made on a timely basis in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements (for example, UK Finance Code for Financial Reporting Disclosure and the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act)\n- \u00b7 Ensure ongoing monitoring to assess the impact of emerging regulation and legislation on financial, prudential regulatory and tax reporting\n- \u00b7 Ensure an accurate view of the Group's performance to allow the Board and senior management to appropriately manage the affairs and strategy of the business as a whole and each of its sub-groups\n\nThe Group has a Disclosure Committee which assists the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer in fulfilling their disclosure responsibilities under relevant listing and other regulatory and legal requirements. In addition, the Audit Committee reviews the quality and acceptability of the Group's financial disclosures. For further information on the Audit Committee's responsibilities relating to financial reporting see\n\n## pages 97 to 100\n\n.\n\n## Exposure to risk arising from the business activities of the Group\n\nThe table below provides a high level guide to how the Group's business activities are reflected through its risk-weighted assets (RWAs), which are calculated in accordance with prudential capital requirements. There are a number of risks that are not captured in RWAs such as pension obligation risk and interest rate risk in the banking book, which instead fall within the scope of the Group's Pillar 2A capital requirements. Furthermore the risk relating to Insurance activities is not included in this table as Insurance is subject to a different set of prudential rules (Solvency 2 regime).

To meet ring-fencing requirements the Boards and Board Committees of the Group and the Ring-Fenced Banks as well as relevant Committees of the Group and the RingFenced Banks will sit concurrently and we refer to this as the Aligned Board Model. Please see page 87 for further information on the Aligned Board Model and the Group's approach to ring-fencing. The Risk division is appropriately represented on key committees to ensure that risk management is discussed in these meetings. This structure outlines the flow and escalation of risk information and reporting from business areas and the Risk division to the Group Executive Committee and Board. Conversely, strategic direction and guidance is cascaded down from the Board and Group Executive Committee.\n\nThe Company Secretariat supports senior and Board level committees, and supports the Chairs in agenda planning.

It is fully embedded in the planning process of the Group and its key legal entities as a key activity in medium-term planning, and senior management is actively involved in stress testing activities via the governance process.\n\nScenario stress testing is used to support:\n\n## Risk identification:\n\n- \u00b7 Understanding key vulnerabilities of the Group and its key legal entities under adverse economic conditions\n\nRisk appetite:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessing the results of the stress test against the risk appetite of all parts of the Group to ensure the Group and its legal entities are managed within their risk parameters\n- \u00b7 Setting of risk appetite by assessing the underlying risks under stress conditions\n\nStrategic and capital planning:\n\n- \u00b7 Senior management and the Boards of the Group and its applicable legal entities to adjust strategies if the plan does not meet risk appetite in a stressed scenario\n- \u00b7 The ICAAP, by demonstrating capital adequacy and meet the requirements of regulatory stress tests that are used to inform the setting of the PRA and management buffers (see capital risk on pages 146 to 153 ) of the Group and its separately regulated legal entities\n- \u00b7 The capital allocation process which feeds into business unit performance management\n\nRisk mitigation:\n\n- \u00b7 The development of potential actions and contingency plans to mitigate the impact of adverse scenarios. Stress testing also links directly to the recovery and resolution planning process of the Group and its legal entities\n\n## Regulatory stress tests\n\nFollowing two years of COVID-19 pandemic crisis related stress testing, in 2022 the PRA returned to the annual cyclical scenario (ACS) stress test framework. The 2022 ACS included submissions for both the Group and RFB. The 2022 stress test objective was to assess the resilience of the UK banking system to deep simultaneous recessions in the UK and global economy, large falls in asset prices and higher global interest rates. The results were published in the third quarter of 2023; the Group passed the stress test and given the strong performance, the Group was not required to take any capital actions.\n\n## Internal stress tests\n\nOn at least an annual basis, the Group conducts macroeconomic stress tests to highlight and understand the key vulnerabilities of the Group's and its legal entities' business plans to adverse changes in the economic environment, and to ensure that there are adequate financial resources in the event of a downturn.\n\n## Reverse stress testing\n\nReverse stress testing is used to explore the vulnerabilities of the Group's and its key legal entities' strategies and plans for extreme adverse events that would cause the businesses to fail. Where this identifies plausible scenarios with an unacceptably high risk, the Group or its entities will adopt measures to prevent or mitigate that and reflect these in strategic plans.\n\n## Other stress testing activity\n\nThe Group's stress testing programme also involves undertaking assessments of liquidity scenarios, market risk sensitivities and scenarios, and business-specific scenarios (see the principal risk categories on pages 146 to 196 for further information on riskspecific stress testing). If required, ad hoc stress testing exercises are also undertaken to assess emerging risks, as well as in response to regulatory requests. This wide-ranging programme provides a comprehensive view of the potential impacts arising from the risks to which the Group is exposed and reflects the nature, scale and complexity of the Group. The Group is currently participating in the Bank of England's System-wide exploratory scenario (SWES), which aims to improve understanding of the behaviours of banks and non-bank financial institutions during stressed financial market conditions. Results of this exercise will be published in late 2024.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe stress tests process must comply with all regulatory requirements, which is achieved through comprehensive macroeconomic scenarios and a rigorous divisional, functional, risk and executive review and challenge process, supported by analysis and insight into impacts on customers and business drivers.\n\nAll relevant business, Risk and Finance teams are involved in the delivery of analysis, and ensure the sensitivity of the business plan to each risk is well understood. The methodologies and modelling approach used for stress testing embed direct links between the macroeconomic scenarios and the drivers for each business area to give appropriate stress sensitivities. All material assumptions used in modelling are documented and justified, with a clearly communicated review and sign-off process. Modelling is supported by expert judgement and is subject to the Group model governance policy.\n\n## Governance\n\nClear accountabilities and responsibilities for stress testing are assigned to senior management and the Risk and Finance functions throughout the Group and its key legal entities. This is formalised through the Group business planning and stress testing policy and procedure, which are reviewed at least annually.\n\nThe GFRC, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and attended by the Chief Financial Officer and other senior Risk and Finance colleagues, has primary responsibility for overseeing the development and execution of the Group's and Ring-Fenced Bank's stress tests. The Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc (LBCM) Risk Committee performs a similar function within the scope of LBCM.\n\nThe review and challenge of the Group's and Ring-Fenced Bank's detailed stress forecasts, the key assumptions behind these, and the methodology used to translate the economic assumptions into stressed outputs conclude with the appropriate Finance and Risk sign-off. The outputs are then presented to the GFRC and the Board Risk Committee for review and challenge. With all regulatory exercises being approved by the Board. There is a similar process within the LBCM for the governance of the LBCM-specific results.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n## Emerging risks\n\n## Background and framework\n\nUnderstanding emerging risks is an essential component of the Group's risk management approach. It enables the Group to identify the most pertinent risks and opportunities, and to proactively respond through strategic planning and appropriate risk mitigation.\n\nWhilst emerging risk is not a principal risk, if left undetected emerging risks have the potential to adversely impact the Group or result in missed opportunities.\n\nImpacts from emerging risks on the Group's principal risks can materialise in two ways:\n\n- \u00b7 Emerging risks can impact the Group's principal risks directly in the absence of an appropriate strategic response\n- \u00b7 Emerging risks can be a source of new risks, dependent on our chosen response and the underlying assumptions on how given emerging risks may manifest\n\nWhere an emerging risk is considered material enough in its own right, the Group may choose to recognise the risk as a principal risk, with a recent example being climate risk. Such elevations are considered and approved through the Board Risk Committee as part of the annual refresh of the enterprise risk management framework.\n\n## Risk identification\n\nThe basis for risk identification is underpinned by our horizon scanning approach, supported by collaboration between functions across the Group. The Group works closely with regulatory authorities and industry bodies to ensure that the Group can monitor external developments and identify and respond to the evolving landscape, particularly in relation to regulatory and legal risk. In addition, the Group engages with external experts to gain external insight and context. This activity complements and builds upon the annual strategic planning cycle and is used to identify key external trends, risks and opportunities for the Group.\n\nThe Group continues to evolve its approach for the identification and prioritisation of emerging risks. During 2023, the Group continued to evolve its emerging risk methodology, refining and enhancing the process, placing greater focus on existing controls, to reflect the Group's position in its strategic transformation journey and the level of planned investment outlined in the Group's business plans.\n\nThe emerging risk methodology is centred around several key factors:\n\n- \u00b7 The threat presented by a risk\n- \u00b7 The Group's specific vulnerability to the risk\n- \u00b7 The preparation and protection the Group has in place to manage or mitigate impacts\n- \u00b7 The existing control environment and planned investment (new for 2023)\n\nOur evolved approach has further streamlined the list of emerging risk themes from 10 to eight, enabling greater management concentration on developing the appropriate responses.\n\nThe emerging risk themes detailed in the risk overview section on page 44 , align to the current primary risks the Group is managing and many of which (for example, operational elasticity and political and macroeconomic environment) are continuous areas of focus. The nature of emerging risks is expected to evolve and may require different ways to mitigate from the measures used today. The risks also correlate, for example customer propositions and societal expectations will be influenced by the UK political and macroeconomic environment.\n\n## Risk mitigation and monitoring\n\nEmerging risks are currently managed through the Group's strategic risk framework, detailed on page 196 .\n\nEmerging risk themes have been discussed at executive-level committees throughout 2023, with key actions assigned to closely monitor their manifestation and potential opportunities, and in some cases, also forming part of the business planning process. Deep dives on selected emerging risk themes are also planned for 2024.\n\nAs part of the 2023 analysis, it has been identified that there is significant overlap with the previous strategic risk themes (climate change, customer proposition, organisational purpose, talent attraction and retention, and technology advances) and the emerging risk themes. This further supports our recommendation to merge these into a combined category of horizon and emerging risks from 2024 onwards. The graphic below indicates the mapping of the strategic risk themes to the emerging risk themes.\n\n## Strategic/Emerging Risks\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n## Capital risk\n\n## Definition\n\nCapital risk is defined as the risk that an insufficient quantity or quality of capital is held to meet regulatory requirements or to support business strategy, an inefficient level of capital is held or that capital is inefficiently deployed across the Group.\n\n## Exposures\n\nA capital risk event arises when the Group has insufficient capital resources to support its strategic objectives and plans, and to meet both regulatory and external stakeholder requirements and expectations. This could arise due to a depletion of the Group's capital resources as a result of the crystallisation of any of the risks to which it is exposed, or through a significant increase in risk-weighted assets as a result of rule changes or economic deterioration. Alternatively a shortage of capital could arise from an increase in the minimum requirements for capital, leverage or MREL either at Group, Ring-Fenced Bank (RFB) sub-group or regulated entity level. The Group's capital management approach is focused on maintaining sufficient and appropriate capital resources across all regulated levels of its structure in order to prevent such exposures while optimising value for shareholders.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group maintains capital levels across all regulated entities commensurate with a prudent level of solvency to achieve financial resilience and market confidence. To support this, capital risk appetite is calibrated by taking into consideration both an internal view of the amount of capital to hold as well as external regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Group assesses both its regulatory capital requirements and the quantity and quality of capital resources it holds to meet those requirements in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD V) and Capital Requirements Regulation (UK CRR). This is supplemented through additional regulation set out under the PRA Rulebook and through associated statements of policy, supervisory statements and other regulatory guidance.\n\nFurther details of the regulatory capital and leverage frameworks to which the Group is subject, including the means by which its capital and leverage requirements and capital resources are calculated, are provided in the Group's Pillar 3 disclosures.\n\nThe minimum amount of total capital, under Pillar 1 of the regulatory capital framework, is set at 8 per cent of total riskweighted assets. At least 4.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets are required to be met with common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital and at least 6 per cent of risk-weighted assets are required to be met with tier 1 capital. Minimum Pillar 1 requirements are supplemented by both additional minimum requirements under Pillar 2A of the regulatory capital framework, the aggregate of which is referred to as the Group's Total Capital Requirement (TCR), and by a number of regulatory capital buffers as described below.\n\nAdditional minimum capital requirements under Pillar 2A are set by the PRA as a firm-specific Individual Capital Requirement (ICR) reflecting a point in time estimate, which may change over time, of the minimum amount of capital to cover risks that are not fully covered by Pillar 1, such as credit concentration and operational risk, and those risks not covered at all by Pillar 1, such as pension obligation risk and interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB). This is set as a variable amount for Pillar 2A (being a set percentage of risk-weighted assets), with fixed add-ons for certain risk types. The Group's Pillar 2A capital requirement is currently the equivalent of around 2.6 per cent of risk-weighted assets, of which the minimum amount to be met by CET1 capital is the equivalent of around 1.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets.\n\nThe Group is also required to hold a number of regulatory capital buffers which must be met with CET1 capital.\n\nSystemic buffers are designed to hold systemically important banks to higher capital standards, so that they can withstand a greater level of stress before requiring resolution.\n\n- \u00b7 The Group is not currently classified as a global systemically important institution (G-SII) but has been classified as an 'other' systemically important institution (O-SII) by the PRA\n- \u00b7 The O-SII buffer applies to the Group's RFB sub-group and is currently set at 2.0 per cent of the RFB sub-group's riskweighted assets. The FPC amended the O-SII buffer framework in 2022, changing the metric for determining the buffer rate from total assets to the UK leverage exposure measure. The first review point under the revised framework occurred during December 2023 (based upon the RFB sub-group's UK leverage exposure measure as at 31 December 2022) which resulted in no change to the current buffer. This currently equates to 1.7 per cent of risk-weighted assets at Group level, with the difference reflecting the risk-weighted assets of the Group that are not in the RFB sub-group and for which the O-SII buffer does not therefore apply. It is the PRA's policy to include this in the Group's PRA Buffer.\n\nThe capital conservation buffer (CCB) is a standard buffer of 2.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets designed to provide for losses in the event of stress.\n\nThe countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) is time-varying and is designed to require banks to hold additional capital to remove or reduce the build-up of systemic risk in times of credit boom, providing additional loss-absorbing capacity and acting as an incentive for banks to constrain further credit growth. The amount of the buffer is determined by reference to buffer rates published by the FPC for the individual countries where the Group has relevant credit exposures. The FPC also sets the UK CCyB rate which is currently set at 2 per cent, following a 1 per cent increase in July 2023. The FPC judges that the neutral rate for the UK CCyB is around 2 per cent.\n\nGiven the Group's UK-focused business model, the Group's CCyB at 31 December 2023 was 1.8 per cent of risk-weighted assets.\n\nAs part of the Group's capital planning process, forecast capital positions are subjected to stress testing to determine the adequacy of the Group's capital resources against minimum requirements, including the Pillar 2A requirement. The PRA considers outputs from both the Group's internal stress tests and Bank of England (BoE) stress tests, in conjunction with other information, as part of the process for informing the setting of a bank-specific capital buffer for the Group, known as the PRA Buffer. The PRA requires this buffer to remain confidential.\n\nUnder recent Bank of England stress tests, the BoE has taken action to avoid an unwarranted de facto increase in capital requirements that could result from the interaction of IFRS 9. The stress hurdle rates for banks participating in the 2022/23 annual cyclical scenario (ACS) stress test exercise were adjusted to recognise the additional resilience provided by the earlier provisions taken under IFRS 9. The BoE is continuing to work towards a more enduring treatment of IFRS 9 for the purposes of future stress tests.\n\nAll buffers are required to be met with CET1 capital. Usage of the PRA Buffer would trigger a dialogue between the Group and the PRA to agree what action is required whereas a breach of the combined buffer (all other regulatory buffers, as referenced above) would give rise to mandatory restrictions upon any discretionary capital distributions. The PRA has previously communicated its expectation that banks' capital and liquidity buffers can be drawn down as necessary to support the real economy through a shock and that sufficient time would be made available to restore buffers in a gradual manner.\n\nIn addition to the risk-based capital framework outlined above, the Group is also subject to minimum capital requirements under the UK Leverage Ratio Framework. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing tier 1 capital resources by the leverage exposure which is a defined measure of on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items.",

        "page_content": "The minimum tier 1 leverage ratio requirement under the UK Leverage Ratio Framework is 3.25 per cent. This is supplemented by a time-varying countercyclical leverage buffer (CCLB) requirement which is determined by multiplying the Group's CCyB rate by 35 per cent. As at 31 December 2023 the CCLB for the Group was 0.6 per cent. An additional leverage ratio buffer (ALRB) requirement of 0.7 per cent applies to the RFB sub-group and is determined by multiplying the RFB sub-group O-SII buffer by 35 per cent. At Group level an equivalent buffer of 0.6 per cent applies.\n\nAt least 75 per cent of the 3.25 per cent minimum leverage ratio requirement as well as 100 per cent of regulatory leverage buffers must be met by CET1 capital.\n\nThe leverage ratio framework does not currently give rise to higher regulatory capital requirements for the Group than the risk-based capital framework.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group has a capital management framework that includes the setting of capital risk appetite and capital planning and stress testing activities. Close monitoring of capital, leverage and MREL ratios is undertaken to ensure the Group meets regulatory requirements and risk appetite levels and deploys its capital resources efficiently.\n\nThe Group regularly refreshes and monitors its suite of early warning indicators and maintains a Capital Contingency Framework as part of a Recovery Plan, which is designed to identify and escalate emerging capital concerns at an early stage, so that mitigating actions can be taken, if needed. For example, the Group is able to accumulate additional capital through the retention of profits over time, which can be enhanced through reducing or cancelling proposed dividend payments and share buybacks, by raising new equity via, for example, a rights issue or debt exchange and by raising additional tier 1 or tier 2 capital securities. The cost and availability of additional capital are dependent upon market conditions and perceptions at the time.\n\nThe Group is also able to manage the demand for capital through management actions including adjusting its lending strategy, business disposals and through the efficient use of securitisations and other optimisation activity.\n\nCapital policies and procedures are well established and subject to independent oversight.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe Group's capital is actively managed and monitoring capital ratios is a key factor in the Group's planning processes, which separately cover the RFB sub-group and key individual banking entities. Multi-year base case forecasts of the Group's capital position, based upon the Group's operating plan, are produced at least annually to inform the Group's capital plan whilst shorterterm forecasts are more frequently undertaken to understand and respond to variations of the Group's actual performance against the plan. The Group's capital plan is tested for capital adequacy using relevant stress scenarios and sensitivities covering adverse economic conditions as well as other adverse factors that could impact the Group.\n\nRegular monitoring of the capital position is undertaken by a range of committees, including Group Capital Risk Committee (GCRC), Group Financial Risk Committee (GFRC), Group and RingFenced Banks Asset and Liability Committees (GALCO), Group and Ring-Fenced Banks Risk Committees (GRC), Board Risk Committee (BRC) and the Board. This includes reporting of actual ratios against forecasts and risk appetite, base case and stress scenario projected ratios, and review of early warning indicators and assessment against the Capital Contingency Framework.\n\nThe regulatory capital framework within which the Group operates continues to evolve and further detail on this is provided in the Group's Pillar 3 disclosures. The Group continues to monitor prudential developments very closely, analysing the potential capital impacts to ensure that, through organic capital generation and management actions, the Group continues to maintain a strong capital position that exceeds both minimum regulatory requirements and the Group's risk appetite and is consistent with market expectations.\n\n## Target capital ratios\n\nThe Board's revised view of the ongoing level of CET1 capital required by the Group to grow the business, meet current and future regulatory requirements and cover economic and business uncertainties is 13.0 per cent which includes a management buffer of around 1 per cent. This takes into account, amongst other considerations:\n\n- \u00b7 The minimum Pillar 1 CET1 capital requirement of 4.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets\n- \u00b7 The Group's Pillar 2A capital requirement, set by the PRA, of which the minimum amount to be met with CET1 capital is the equivalent of around 1.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets\n- \u00b7 The Group's current CCyB requirement which is 1.8 per cent of risk-weighted assets\n- \u00b7 The CCB requirement of 2.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets\n- \u00b7 The RFB sub-group's O-SII buffer of 2.0 per cent of risk-weighted assets, which equates to 1.7 per cent of risk-weighted assets at Group level\n- \u00b7 The Group's PRA Buffer\n- \u00b7 The likely performance of the Group in various potential stress scenarios and ensuring capital remains resilient in these\n- \u00b7 The economic outlook for the UK and business outlook for the Group\n- \u00b7 The desire to maintain a progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy in the context of year-on-year earnings movements\n\n## Capital returns\n\nThe Group has in place a progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy which allows for flexibility to return surplus capital to shareholders through share buybacks or special dividends.\n\nSurplus capital represents capital over and above the amount management wish to retain to grow the business, meet current and future regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties. The amount of required capital may vary from time to time depending on circumstances and by its nature there can be no guarantee that any return of surplus capital will be made.\n\nGiven the Group's robust financial performance and strong capital position at the year end, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 1.84 pence per share. This is in addition to the interim ordinary dividend of 0.92 pence per share that was announced as part of the 2023 half year results and paid in September 2023. The total ordinary dividend for the year is therefore 2.76 pence per share. The Group also intends to implement a share buyback programme of up to \u00a32.0 billion which will commence as soon as is practicable and is expected to be completed by 31 December 2024.\n\nThe Board remains committed to future capital returns. Going forward, the Board intends to maintain its progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy alongside further returns of surplus capital at the end of the year as appropriate. The Board will continue to give due consideration at year end to the size of the final dividend payment and to the return of any surplus capital based upon the circumstances at the time.\n\nThe ability of the Group to pay a dividend is also subject to constraints including the availability of distributable reserves, legal and regulatory restrictions and the Group's financial and operating performance.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\nDistributable reserves are determined as required by the Companies Act 2006 by reference to a company's individual financial statements. At 31 December 2023 Lloyds Banking Group plc ('the Company') had accumulated distributable reserves of approximately \u00a312 billion. Substantially all of the Company's merger reserve is available for distribution under UK company law as a result of transactions undertaken to recapitalise the Company in 2009.\n\nLloyds Banking Group plc acts as a holding company which also issues capital and other securities to capitalise and fund the activities of the Group. The profitability of the holding company, and its ability to sustain dividend payments, is therefore dependent upon the continued receipt of dividends and interest from its main operating subsidiaries, including Lloyds Bank plc (the Ring-Fenced Bank), Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc, LBG Equity Investments Limited and Scottish Widows Group Limited (the Insurance business). The principal operating subsidiary is Lloyds Bank plc which, at 31 December 2023, had a consolidated CET1 capital ratio that exceeded minimum regulatory requirements and internal risk appetite levels. A number of Group subsidiaries, principally those with banking and insurance activities, are subject to regulatory capital requirements which require minimum amounts of capital to be maintained relative to their size and risk. The Group actively manages the capital of its subsidiaries, which includes monitoring the regulatory capital ratios for its banking and insurance subsidiaries and, on a consolidated basis, the RFB sub-group against approved risk appetite levels. The Group operates a formal capital management policy which requires all subsidiary entities, subject to agreement by their governing bodies, to remit surplus capital to their parent companies.\n\n## Minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL)\n\nGlobal systemically important banks (G-SIBs) are subject to an international standard on total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC). The standard is designed to enhance the resilience of the global financial system by ensuring that failing G-SIBs have sufficient capital to absorb losses and recapitalise under resolution, whilst continuing to provide critical banking services.\n\nIn the UK, the Bank of England has implemented the requirements of the international TLAC standard through the establishment of a framework which sets out MREL. The purpose of MREL is to require firms to maintain sufficient own funds and eligible liabilities that are capable of credibly bearing losses or recapitalising a bank whilst in resolution. MREL can be satisfied by a combination of regulatory capital and certain unsecured liabilities (which must be subordinate to a firm's operating liabilities).\n\nAlthough the Group is not classified as a G-SIB it is subject to the Bank of England's MREL framework, including the statement of policy on MREL (the 'MREL SoP') which requires the Group to maintain a minimum level of MREL resources.\n\nUnder the requirements of the framework, the Group operates a single point of entry (SPE) resolution strategy, with Lloyds Banking Group plc as the designated resolution entity.\n\nApplying the MREL SoP to minimum capital requirements at 31 December 2023, the Group's MREL, excluding regulatory capital and leverage buffers, is the higher of 2 times Pillar 1 plus 2 times Pillar 2A, equivalent to 21.3 per cent of risk-weighted assets, or 6.5 per cent of the UK leverage ratio exposure measure.\n\nIn addition, CET1 capital cannot be used to meet both MREL and capital or leverage buffers.\n\nInternal minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (Internal MREL) also apply to the Group's material subgroups and entities, including the RFB sub-group, Lloyds Bank plc, Bank of Scotland plc and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc.\n\n## Analysis of CET1 capital position\n\nThe Group's pro forma CET1 capital ratio at 31 December 2023 was 13.7 per cent (31 December 2022: 14.1 per cent pro forma). Capital generation before regulatory headwinds during the year was 223 basis points, reflecting strong banking build, the \u00a3250 million dividend received from the Insurance business and other movements. These impacts were partially offset by risk-weighted asset increases (before CRD IV model updates within Retail secured and net of optimisation) and the full year payment (\u00a3800 million) of fixed pension deficit contributions made to the Group's three main defined benefit pension schemes. Regulatory headwinds of 50 basis points largely reflect a \u00a35 billion riskweighted assets adjustment for part of the impact of Retail secured CRD IV model updates. They also reflect the end of IFRS 9 static transitional relief and the reduction in the transitional factor applied to IFRS 9 dynamic relief. Capital generation after the impact of these regulatory headwinds was 173 basis points. This benefited by just under 30 basis points from an impairment credit driven by a significant write-back in the fourth quarter which was materially offset by around 15 basis points in relation to the \u00a3450 million charge arising from the potential impact of the FCA review of historical motor finance commission arrangements.\n\nThe impact of the interim ordinary dividend paid in September 2023 and the accrual for the recommended final ordinary dividend equated to 86 basis points, with a further 98 basis points utilised to cover the accrual for the announced ordinary share buyback programme and 9 basis points for variable pension contributions reflecting the payment to address the \u00a3250 million residual aggregate deficit in the fourth quarter. The acquisition of Tusker utilised 21 basis points of capital.\n\nExcluding the Insurance dividend received in February 2024 and the full impact of the announced ordinary share buyback programme, the Group's CET1 capital ratio at 31 December 2023 was 14.6 per cent (31 December 2022: 15.1 per cent).\n\nThe full impact of the share buyback will be accrued for through the Group's actual capital position during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nOn 1 January 2024, the transitional factor applied to IFRS 9 dynamic relief reduced by a further 25 per cent, resulting in a reduction of 4 basis points. The Group's pro forma CET1 capital ratio at 31 December 2023 does not include the impact of the reduced relief.\n\n## Total capital requirement\n\nThe Group's total capital requirement (TCR) as at 31 December 2023, being the aggregate of the Group's Pillar 1 and current Pillar 2A capital requirements, was \u00a323,322 million (31 December 2022: \u00a322,550 million).\n\n## Capital and MREL resources\n\nAn analysis of the Group's capital position and MREL resources as at 31 December 2023 is presented in the following section. This reflects the application of the transitional arrangements for IFRS 9.",

The Group's pro forma CET1 ratio of 13.7 per cent at 31 December 2023 reflects the full capital impact of the ordinary share buyback programme announced as part of the Group's 2023 year end results and the Insurance dividend received in February 2024.\n\nThe IFRS 9 transitional arrangements for static relief ended on 1 January 2023 and therefore no static relief exists at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: \u00a3232 million). Dynamic relief amounted to \u00a3196 million (31 December 2022: \u00a3358 million) through CET1 capital.\n\n## Movements in total capital and MREL\n\nThe Group's total capital ratio increased to 19.8 per cent at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 19.7 per cent) primarily reflecting AT1 and Tier 2 issuance. This was largely offset by the increase in risk-weighted assets and other movements in Tier 2 capital instruments, which included the impact of a call and regulatory amortisation.\n\nThe MREL ratio increased to 31.9 per cent at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 31.7 per cent) reflecting the increase in both total capital resources and other eligible liabilities, largely offset by the increase in risk-weighted assets. The increase in other eligible liabilities was primarily driven by new issuances, partially offset by a call and the exclusion of instruments maturing in 2024.",

Significant investments primarily arise from investment in the Group's Insurance business.\n\nRisk-weighted assets have increased by \u00a38 billion during the year to \u00a3219 billion at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: \u00a3211 billion). This includes the impact of Retail secured CRD IV model updates of \u00a35 billion. Excluding this, lending, operational and market risk increases, a modest uplift from credit and model calibrations and other movements were partly offset by optimisation, including capital efficient securitisation activity within the balance sheet.\n\nIn relation to the Retail secured CRD IV models, it is estimated that a further \u00a35 billion increase will be required over 2024 to 2026, noting that this will be subject to final model outcomes.",

This was partially offset by the increase in the leverage exposure measure following increases in financial and other assets (excluding central bank claims), net of reductions in off-balance sheet items and the measure for securities financing transactions .",

One of the most important uses of stress testing is to assess the resilience of the operational and strategic plans of the Group and its legal entities to adverse economic conditions and other key vulnerabilities.\n\nAs part of this programme the Group participated in the delayed 2022 Annual Cyclical Scenario stress test run by the Bank of England, which was submitted to the regulator in January 2023. This assesses the Group's resilience to a severe economic shock where the House Price Index (HPI) falls by 31 per cent, Commercial Real Estate (CRE) falls by 45 per cent, unemployment peaks at 8.5 per cent and the Base Rate peaks at 6 per cent. The results of this exercise were published by the Bank of England on 12 July 2023. The Bank of England calculated the Group's transitional CET1 ratio, after the application of management actions, as 11.6 per cent and its Tier 1 leverage ratio as 4.5 per cent, significantly exceeding the hurdle rates of 6.6 per cent and 3.5 per cent, respectively. The Group also continues to internally assess vulnerabilities to adverse economic conditions.\n\n## G-SIB indicators\n\nAlthough the Group is not currently classified as a Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB), by virtue of the Group's leverage exposure measure exceeding \u20ac200 billion the Group is required to report G-SIB indicator metrics to the PRA. The Group's indicator metrics used within the 2023 Basel G-SIBs annual exercise will be disclosed at the end of April 2024 and the results are expected to be made available by the Basel Committee later this year.\n\n## Insurance business\n\nThe business transacted by the insurance companies within the Group comprises both life insurance business and general insurance business. Life insurance comprises unit-linked, nonprofit and With-Profits business.\n\nScottish Widows Limited (SW Ltd) holds the only With-Profits funds managed by the Group. The UK insurance companies within the Group are regulated by the PRA. SW Ltd's European insurance subsidiary is regulated by the CAA.\n\nThe Solvency II regime for insurers and insurance groups came into force from 1 January 2016 and was most recently updated in December 2023 as part of the Solvency UK framework. Insurance is required to calculate solvency capital requirements and available capital on a risk-based approach. Insurance calculates regulatory capital on the basis of an internal model, which has been approved by the PRA.\n\nThe minimum required capital must be maintained at all times throughout the year. These capital requirements and the capital available to meet them are regularly estimated in order to ensure that capital maintenance requirements are being met.\n\nAll minimum regulatory requirements of the insurance companies have been met during the year.\n\n## Change and execution risk Definition\n\nChange and execution risk is defined as the risk that, in delivering its change agenda, the Group fails to ensure compliance with laws and regulation, maintain available and effective customer and colleague services, and/or operate within the Group's risk appetite.\n\n## Exposures\n\nChange and execution risks arise when the Group undertakes activities which require products, processes, people, systems or controls to change. These changes can be as a result of external drivers (for example, a new piece of regulation that requires the Group to put in place a new process or reporting) and/or internal drivers including business process changes, technology upgrades and strategic business or technology transformation.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group currently measures change and execution risk against defined risk appetite metrics which are a combination of leading, quality and delivery indicators across the investment portfolio. These indicators are reported through internal governance structures and monthly execution risk metrics; which form part of the Board risk appetite metrics, and are under ongoing evolution and enhancement to ensure they support the Group's change and transformation agenda.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group takes a range of mitigating actions with respect to change and execution risk. These include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The Board establishes a Group-wide risk appetite and metric for change and execution risk\n- \u00b7 Ensuring compliance with the change policy and associated policies and procedures, which set out the principles and key controls that apply across the business and are aligned to the Group risk appetite\n- \u00b7 Businesses assess the potential impacts of undertaking any change activity on their ability to execute effectively, on customers and colleagues and on the potential consequences for existing business risk profiles\n- \u00b7 The implementation of effective governance and control frameworks to ensure adequate controls are in place to manage change activity and act to mitigate the change and execution risks identified. These controls are monitored in line with the change policy and enterprise risk management framework\n- \u00b7 Events and incidents related to change activities are escalated and managed appropriately in line with risk framework guidance\n- \u00b7 Ensuring there are sufficient, appropriately skilled resources to support the safe delivery of the Group's current and future change portfolio\n\n## Monitoring\n\nChange and execution risks are monitored and reported through to the Board and Group Governance Committees in accordance with the Group's enterprise risk management framework. Risk exposures are assessed monthly through established governance in the Group's functions and business unit risk committees with escalation to executive committees where required. Material change and execution related risk events or incidents are escalated in accordance with the Group operational risk policy and change policy. In addition there is oversight, challenge and reporting within Risk function to support overall management of risks and ongoing effectiveness of controls.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n## Climate risk\n\n## Definition\n\nThe Group defines climate risk as the risk that the Group experiences losses and/or reputational damage, either from the impacts of climate change and the transition to net zero (inbound) or as a result of the Group's response to tackling climate change (outbound).\n\n## Embedding\n\nClimate risk is considered as a principal risk within the Group's ERMF, reflecting the importance of the topic and the focus required to manage these risks. This ensures a consistent approach to embedding the consideration of climate risk in activities across the Group, while also enhancing Board level insight.\n\nThe Group's climate risk policy provides an overarching framework for managing climate risks. This policy continues to be refined, to ensure awareness of key climate-related risks across different areas of the Group and appropriate processes and controls are in place to mitigate these risks. This includes requirements in relation to governance, scenario analysis and management for climate risks, as well as governance requirements for different aspects of the Group's net zero strategy. Activity across the Group to meet these requirements is actively monitored, including through the development of the Group's climate risk profile.\n\nThe Group continues to consider climate risk through an evolving view of 'Double Materiality'. This reflects the concept that climate risks can materialise through inbound risk, outbound risk or potentially both.\n\n- \u00b7 Inbound risk: impacts of a risk on the Group's balance sheet, which can lead to a financial loss. Managing inbound risks is critical to mitigate this potential impact, including supporting customers to be aware of potential risks. Examples include property devaluation from physical and transition risks and extreme weather events increasing insurance losses\n- \u00b7 Outbound risk: impacts of the Group's balance sheet or activity on the environment driven by our strategy or purpose. Examples include insufficient consideration of climate risk in external disclosure or external perception of the Group's actions, claims and disclosures\n\nThe Group is continuing to develop its understanding of Double Materiality, as well as reflecting how it applies across broader ESG risks. This approach allows an assessment of the impact of risks to the Group in addition to identification of the impact of the Group's balance sheet on society and the planet.\n\nWithin the Group's risk and control self-assessment (RCSA) system for risk management, key climate-related risks have been prioritised into five broad themes in line with this view of inbound and outbound risks:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe impacts from climate risk largely manifest through other principal risks. Therefore, in order to ensure these impacts are appropriately managed, the Group is embedding consideration of climate risk into its approach for managing other principal risks.\n\nNew and existing controls have also been mapped to key climaterelated regulatory obligations to support identification, measurement, management and reporting of the impacts of climate change.\n\n## Exposures\n\nClimate risks can arise through two channels, physical or transition risks:\n\n- \u00b7 Physical risks from changes in climate or weather patterns. These can either be acute (event driven such as floods or storms) or chronic (longer-term shifts such as rising sea levels or droughts)\n- \u00b7 Transition risks due to changes associated with moving towards a low carbon economy, including changes to policy, legislation and regulation, technology and market, or legal risks from failing to manage the transition\n\nAs part of the Group's ERMF, risks are proactively identified considering various internal and external sources, including environmental factors such as climate change. The Group has identified the sectors at increased risk from the impacts of climate change and continues to monitor its loans and advances to customers in these sectors, see page 110 in the Group's sustainability report 2023.\n\nThis has informed identification of the key climate-related risks at a Group level, with input from other entities to capture any material risks not reflected. The table on page 155 provides a highlevel overview of the Group's key climate risks, across the five main inbound and outbound themes highlighted in the climate risk diagram. This has also included consideration of the crosscutting impacts across other principal risks in the Group's ERMF. A similar exercise has been carried out for Scottish Widows, as outlined on page 171 in the Group's sustainability report 2023.\n\nThe materiality of the Group's key climate risks reflects their potential impact on the Group, considering key impacts across a range of factors including: customer; reputation; financial losses; colleagues; and business objectives. These impacts are considered on an ongoing basis through the Group's continuous risk management approach, with formal assessment at least annually. This assessment is supported by horizon scanning of climate-related developments across the Group and additional quantitative and qualitative analysis, including scenario analysis results.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThere are a number of different ways to measure the relative size of the key climate risks facing the Group. However, in order to quantify the impact, scenario analysis is required to understand their effects, particularly given the different potential outcomes and time horizons over which the risks may manifest.\n\nFrom an outbound perspective, the Group measures its emissions relating to activities across bank finance, Scottish Widows' investments, supply chain and own operations. This helps to provide a view on the impact of the Group's activities, as well as identifying the areas where the Group can most effectively reduce emissions to support the transition to net zero. These calculations follow the relevant industry standards and guidelines, noting that such methodologies will continue to evolve. Further detail on the approach for each of these areas is provided on page 113 in the Group's sustainability report 2023.\n\nFor inbound risks, the levels of climate risk impacting different areas of the Group are assessed through a variety of metrics and approaches:\n\n- \u00b7 For Commercial lending, the Group's ESG tool helps to identify and assess the impact of climate risk for individual Commercial customers as part of the credit decisioning process",

Climate change could potentially impact the schemes' financial position due to changes in asset prices, financial market conditions and members' longevity.\n- \u00b7 For Retail lending, levels of flood risk and energy efficiency, via energy performance certificates (EPC), are measured for the Homes portfolio to inform the physical and transition risk we face. For the motor portfolio, the transition from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric vehicles (EVs) is a key consideration in measuring residual value risk\n- \u00b7 For Home insurance business, there is a dedicated weather modelling team, comprised of specialists in hydrology, meteorology and probabilistic modelling. The team develops a baseline view of physical risk for the UK and conducts forwardlooking climate stress testing on this. This team has been in place since 2016 and has monitored and applied climate change science onto the view of risk used for capital, pricing, reinsurance, and planning\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\nGiven the range of outcomes over which climate risks and opportunities may materialise, scenario analysis is a key tool for understanding the potential impacts on the Group. The Group continues to develop its climate scenario analysis capabilities to inform analysis of climate risks, as well as to help shape the Group's strategy to reflect climate opportunities and assess its resilience, building on lessons learned from the Bank of England's 2021 Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES). The subsequent analysis has focused on understanding the areas of the Group most impacted by climate change, as well as assessing the impact from key climate-related risks.\n\nSeparate assessments have been undertaken for the Group's Commercial lending and Scottish Widows investments portfolios to identify the sectors most exposed to climate risks.\n\n- \u00b7 For Commercial lending clients, this has been based on estimated financial impacts from physical and transition risk. The relative difference between this climate estimate and a baseline provides an indicative foresight view of discounted cash flow and hence net present value (NPV) of the entity from present day to 2050\n- \u00b7 For Scottish Widows' investments, the analysis focused on the impact of climate risk on broadly defined sectors, considering the quantitative impact of transition risk alone in the high transition scenarios. The chart below is based on projected equity values at 2050, with currency movements hedged and compared to counterfactual projections\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Impact of transition risk on equities   |\n|-----------------------------------------|\n|                                         |\n|                                         |\n|                                         |\n|                                         |\n|                                         |\n|                                         |\n|                                         |",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\nBoth assessments have been modelled across two climate scenarios consistent with the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), Net Zero 2050 (Orderly) and Divergent Net Zero (Divergent). The Net Zero 2050 scenario was chosen as it describes the ideal outcome that the Group's net zero targets are aiming for. The Divergent Net Zero scenario provides a useful comparison, given it reaches the same end goal although at higher overall cost.\n\nThe results across both assessments are broadly in line with each other, highlighting that high emitting sectors, such as coal mining and oil and gas, are expected to face a substantial adverse impact, with considerable effects in other sectors, such as automotive and transport. However, these impacts will vary significantly by company and will be most notably observed in the power sector. Further details of the analysis supporting these assessments is outlined in the Group's sustainability report 2023.\n\nThe Group has a relatively low commercial lending exposure to the sectors which experience the most significant negative impacts, based on this assessment. Note 52 on page 312 provides further detail of the Group's lending by sector.\n\nThe above assessment also supports the view of the sectors with the greatest potential climate-related impact for the Group. Alongside lending exposure, this analysis validates the focus for the Group's environmental sustainability strategy, including the banking sectors for which NZBA targets have been set. Further detail on the Group's strategy and targets is outlined in the transition plan in the Group's sustainability report 2023.\n\nClimate risks also transmit via trading book assets and the Group has undertaken climate scenario analysis across three bespoke climate scenarios to understand the impact of very short-term market risk factor shocks stemming from both physical and transition risks. Resulting stressed valuations fell within existing stress test framework outcomes demonstrating the resilience of existing risk management approaches.\n\n## Impact assessment\n\nThis scenario analysis is intended to inform the Group's view of the financial impacts from the risks relating to change, which would principally arise through asset impairments or credit losses. Building on this assessment of the sectors at increased risk from climate change, the Group has incorporated consideration of some climate risks into its calculation of ECL. For Commercial Banking clients in these sectors most materially impacted, a topdown sector level approach has been used to estimate impacts in a disorderly scenario, resulting an estimated impact on ECL of less than \u00a315 million. This uses a combination of sector level NPV impact estimates, NGFS Gross Domestic Product (GDP) pathways, historic impairment data and other inputs to assess the impact of physical and transition risks.\n\nFurthermore, the UK Mortgages portfolio has been assessed for physical and transition risk. This assessment considered the impact of the UK introducing minimum EPC requirements and the estimated retrofitting costs to meet these. These additional costs then translated into Probability of Default (PD) uplifts, resulting in an estimated increase in ECL of less than \u00a35 million for the Group's buy-to-let portfolio. A similar exercise was undertaken for flood risk, also with an estimated impact of less than \u00a35 million. Measurement of the physical and transition risk impacts continues to progress, with ongoing development of a Residential Real Estate Climate Impact model to estimate potential impacts. Further detail on this is provided on page 153 of the Group's sustainability report 2023.\n\nThese estimated impacts are below the Group's materiality thresholds, therefore, no adjustments have been made to the expected credit losses measured as at 31 December 2023. Note 24 on page 278 provides further information on the assessment of climate risks in the Group's measurement of expected credit losses.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group manages climate-related risk in different ways across the five key inbound and outbound themes identified. The following sections provide an overview of the Group's mitigation approach, including the relevant cross-cutting impacts, across each of these themes. Scottish Widows provide further detail on its approach in its own risk management section on page 171 of the Group's sustainability report 2023.\n\n## Net Zero\n\nThe Group considers how its different areas are supporting the transition to net zero. The Group has set ambitions to reduce emissions across four key areas of activity. This is supported through development of appropriate plans and strategies, as well as sector specific targets for bank financed emissions. We aim to monitor progress against these targets through the Group Net Zero Committee on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe 2023 Group climate transition plan sets out the steps it will take to reduce emissions to net zero for its own operations and supply chain, as well as specific activities happening in relation to the Group's lending and investments. For further details, please see the Group's sustainability report 2023.\n\n## Disclosures\n\nThe Group's external disclosures are subject to a robust governance process, including appropriate legal review. This includes an assessment of the relevant regulatory requirements, particularly to ensure alignment with CFD requirements and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. External disclosures will continue to progress in line with the changing regulatory landscape, and the Group will look to ensure suitable controls remain in place as these develop.\n\n## Greenwashing\n\nThe Group's understanding of greenwashing continues to evolve, with adoption of various methods across the Group to continue to build this understanding, including development of training materials to avoid greenwashing for all colleagues. Current priorities relate to any sustainability related claims in external disclosures and development of consideration of ESG criteria (including climate-related factors) for relevant products across the Group.\n\nThe Group will look to ensure that its disclosures outline a clear and accurate message of what it is doing to support the transition to net zero. An external legal review provides assurance on the suitability of content in disclosures within the sustainability report and annual report and accounts. The Group expects its controls and processes will continue to evolve, reflecting increasing understanding of greenwashing, as well as the changing regulatory landscape, such as the FCA's Sustainability Disclosure Requirements anti-greenwashing rule. In 2023, for example, Scottish Widows launched a Green Claims Framework, under which first line risk teams assess green claims prior to publication of communications to ensure any claims are accurate, clear, not misleading and can be substantiated.\n\nIn 2023, the Group product policy was redesigned to ensure compliance with Consumer Duty and focus on customer outcomes. As part of this, initial guidance in relation to climate considerations was strengthened to introduce more comprehensive ESG considerations for all products in line with the Group's updated values. Dedicated ESG guidance has been introduced to support product governance processes, ensuring climate-related factors and wider ESG risks are appropriately considered and managed throughout the product life cycle. In 2024, further support will be provided to upskill colleagues and ensure the guidance is enhanced in line with the ESG risks landscape.",

        "page_content": "## Inbound physical and transition risks\n\nThe impacts from physical and transition risks cut across other principal risks in different ways for different areas of the Group, as outlined below.\n\n## Commercial and Retail lending\n\nThe Group continues to integrate climate risk and broader ESG considerations in its credit process, with continued progress in 2023. This is through a credit risk integration strategy, which includes development of an ESG credit risk framework and policies, as well as portfolio and case management. Further detail on management of climate-related and ESG credit risks is provided on page 150 of the Group's sustainability report 2023.\n\n## Operations and supply chain\n\nClimate risk is embedded in the Group approach for managing operational resilience, as one of the key drivers within the Group strategy, considering the impact on and from climate as part of ensuring its operations remain resilient. Climate-related impacts could affect operational resilience through properties, IT systems, people and third party suppliers. The Group approach primarily focuses on the potential impact from physical risks, although transition risk impacts may require further consideration as the approach evolves.\n\nThe Group has processes in place to consider the resilience of its property in relation to physical risks, particularly focused on its offices, data centres and branch network, to minimise the risk of service disruption. Insurers periodically highlight the Group's buildings that are subject to high flood risk. These sites are then surveyed in detail to quantify that risk and determine appropriate flood defence mitigation. The Group proactively monitors the temperature and humidity in its data centres, with root cause analysis undertaken for any incidents to identify any local climate issues and remediate. Additionally, resilient tech rooms have been created where power, temperature and humidity are robustly controlled.\n\nThe Group expects its third party suppliers to review their business continuity plans and recovery strategies, ensuring these are appropriately updated to mitigate potential risks posed by climate change, to ensure continued provision of service. The Group's Code of Supplier Responsibility also outlines expectations for the third parties in relation to environmental sustainability. This includes expectations for the Group's suppliers to proactively identify, manage and reduce their environmental impact, as well as adopting the principles of the Emerald Standard which the Group launched in 2022, as detailed on page 101 of the Group's sustainability report 2023.\n\n## Regulatory compliance\n\nThe Group's monitoring of regulatory expectations includes understanding the current relevant requirements, and its activity and progress towards these, as well as horizon scanning for new developments. Monitoring progress against current expectations, for example Dear CEO and CFO letters, supports regular engagement with regulators on respective plans and priorities. In addition, the Group maintains a view of how its disclosures support the relevant regulatory requirements, as outlined above.\n\nThe Group also maintains an awareness of regulatory developments and seeks to include and map regulatory obligations within its risk and control profile in support of compliance traceability.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe Group ensures visibility and awareness of climate risks wherever they present themselves across its risk profile, with regular reporting and tracking of any identified risks.\n\nManagement Information (MI) across a range of themes is regularly assessed to provide insight into and oversight of management of climate risk, together with tracking of associated action plans and identification of triggers for reassessment. This is reported through appropriate Risk governance, across the relevant business units.\n\nClimate risk is also considered through Risk governance on a monthly basis through the Consolidated Risk Report, supported by assessment of identified climate risks across the Group and appropriate analysis of Group Board risk appetite metrics. This provides insight into any changes to the risk profile together with their rationale for awareness and scrutiny by senior leaders. In addition, climate risk MI is reported through this process, with standalone deep dive discussions on climate risk at Board Risk Committee on a half-yearly basis.\n\n## Conduct risk\n\n## Definition\n\nConduct risk is defined as the risk of customer detriment across the customer lifecycle including: failures in product management, distribution and servicing activities; from other risks materialising, or other activities which could undermine the integrity of the market or distort competition, leading to unfair customer outcomes, regulatory censure, reputational damage or financial loss.\n\nHarm or detriment is defined as loss, distress or inconvenience to customers due to breaches of regulatory or internal requirements or our wider duty to act fairly and reasonably.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group faces significant conduct risks, which affect all aspects of the Group's operations and all types of customers. The introduction of Consumer Duty has increased regulatory expectations in relation to customer outcomes, including how the Group demonstrates and measures them.\n\nConduct risks can impact directly or indirectly on the Group's customers and could materialise from a number of areas across the Group, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Business and strategic planning that does not sufficiently consider customer needs\n- \u00b7 Ineffective development, management and monitoring of products, their distribution (including the sales process, fair value assessment and responsible lending criteria) and postsales service (including the management of customers in financial difficulties)\n- \u00b7 Unclear, unfair, misleading or untimely customer communications\n- \u00b7 A culture that is not sufficiently customer-centric\n- \u00b7 Poor governance of colleagues' incentives and rewards and approval of schemes which lead to behaviours that drive unfair customer outcomes\n- \u00b7 Ineffective identification, management and oversight of legacy conduct issues\n- \u00b7 Ineffective management and resolution of customers' complaints or claims\n- \u00b7 Outsourcing of customer service and product delivery to third parties that do not have the same level of control, oversight and culture as the Group\n\nThe Group is also exposed to the risk of engaging in activities or failing to manage conduct which could constitute market abuse, undermine the integrity of a market in which it is active, distort competition or create conflicts of interest.\n\nThere is a high level of scrutiny from regulatory bodies, the media, politicians, and consumer groups regarding financial institutions' treatment of customers, especially those with characteristics of vulnerability. The Group continues to apply significant focus to its treatment of all customers, in particular those in financial difficulties and those with characteristics of vulnerability, to ensure good outcomes.\n\nThe Group is continuing to liaise closely with the FCA and Financial Ombudsman Service on the historical motor commission arrangements.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\nThe Group continuously adapts to market developments that could pose heightened conduct risk, and actively monitors for early signs of financial difficulties driven by pressures from a rising cost of living and rising interest rates.\n\nOther key areas of focus include transparency and fairness of pricing communications; ensuring victims of Authorised Push Payment Fraud receive good outcomes; and a mindset shift regarding customer outcomes in line with the FCA's Consumer Duty Regulation.\n\n## Measurement\n\nTo articulate its conduct risk appetite, the Group has Conduct Risk Appetite Metrics (CRAMs) and tolerances that aim to indicate where it may be operating outside its conduct risk appetite.\n\nCRAMs have been designed for services and products offered by the Group and are measured by a set of common metrics. These contain a range of product design, sales and process metrics (including outcome testing results) to provide a more holistic view of conduct risks; some products also have a suite of additional bespoke metrics.\n\nEach of the tolerances for the metrics are agreed for the individual product or service and are regularly tracked. At a consolidated level these metrics are part of the Board risk appetite. The Group has, and continues to, evolve its approach to conduct risk measurements, to include emerging conduct themes.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group takes a range of mitigating actions with respect to conduct risk and remains focused on delivering a leading customer experience.\n\nThe Group's ongoing commitment to good customer outcomes sets the tone from the top and supports the development our values-led culture with customers at the heart, strengthening links between actions to support conduct, culture and customer and enabling more effective control management. Actions to encourage good conduct include:\n\n- \u00b7 Conduct risk appetite established at Group and divisional level, with metrics included in the Group risk appetite to ensure ongoing focus\n- \u00b7 Simplified and enhanced conduct policies and procedures in place to ensure appropriate controls and processes that deliver good customer outcomes, and support market integrity and competition requirements\n- \u00b7 Customer needs considered through divisional customer plans, with integral conduct lens\n- \u00b7 Achieving a values-led culture that delivers great customer outcomes, by focusing on aligning our systems, symbols, behaviours and storytelling\n- \u00b7 Development and continued oversight of the implementation of the vulnerability strategy continues through the Group Customer Inclusion Forum to monitor vulnerable outcomes, provide strategic direction and ensure consistency across the Group\n- \u00b7 Robust product governance framework to ensure products continue to offer customers fair value, and consistently meet their needs throughout their product lifecycle\n- \u00b7 Complaints management through responding to, and learning from, root causes of complaint volumes and Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) change rates\n- \u00b7 Review and oversight of thematic conduct agenda items at senior committees, ensuring holistic consideration of key Group-wide conduct risks\n- \u00b7 Robust recruitment and training, with a continued focus on how the Group manages colleagues' performance with clear customer accountabilities\n- \u00b7 Ongoing engagement with third parties involved in serving the Group's customers to ensure consistent delivery\n- \u00b7 Monitoring and testing of customer outcomes to ensure the Group delivers good outcomes for customers throughout the product and service lifecycle, and make continuous improvements to products, services and processes\n\n- \u00b7 Continued focus on market conduct; member of the Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities Markets Standard Board; and committed to conducting its market activities consistent with the principles of the UK Money Markets Code, the Global Precious Metals Code and the FX Global Code\n- \u00b7 Adoption of robust change delivery methodology to enable prioritisation and delivery of initiatives to address conduct challenges\n- \u00b7 Continued focus on proactive identification and mitigation of conduct risk in the Group's strategy\n- \u00b7 Active engagement with regulatory bodies and other stakeholders to develop understanding of concerns related to customer treatment, effective competition and market integrity, to ensure that the Group's strategic conduct focus continues to meet evolving stakeholder expectations\n- \u00b7 Creation of tools and additional support for customers impacted by the rising cost of living, including Cost-of-Living Hub and interest-free overdraft buffer\n- \u00b7 A programme of work in place to deliver the enhanced expectations of Consumer Duty\n\n## Monitoring\n\nConduct risk is governed through divisional risk committees and significant issues are escalated to the Group Risk Committee, in accordance with the Group's ERMF, as well as through the monthly Risk Reporting. The risk exposures are reported, discussed and challenged at divisional risk committees. Remedial action is recommended, if required. All material conduct risk events are escalated in accordance with the Group operational risk policy.\n\nA number of activities support the close monitoring of conduct risk including:\n\n- \u00b7 The use of CRAMs across the Group, with an escalation route to Board\n- \u00b7 Oversight and assurance activities across the three lines of defence\n- \u00b7 Horizon scanning",

        "page_content": "## Credit risk\n\n## Definition\n\nCredit risk is defined as the risk that parties with whom the Group has contracted fail to meet their financial obligations (both on and off-balance sheet).\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe principal sources of credit risk within the Group arise from loans and advances, contingent liabilities, commitments and debt securities to customers, financial institutions and sovereigns. The credit risk exposures of the Group are set out in note 52 on page 313 .\n\nIn terms of loans and advances (for example, mortgages, term loans and overdrafts) and contingent liabilities (for example, credit instruments such as guarantees and documentary letters of credit), credit risk arises both from amounts advanced and commitments to extend credit to a customer or bank. With respect to commitments to extend credit, the Group is also potentially exposed to an additional loss up to an amount equal to the total unutilised commitments. However, the likely amount of loss may be less than the total unutilised commitments, as most retail and certain commercial lending commitments may be cancelled based on regular assessment of the prevailing creditworthiness of customers. Commercial term commitments are also contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards.\n\nCredit risk also arises from debt securities and derivatives. The total notional principal amount of interest rate, exchange rate, credit derivative and other contracts outstanding at 31 December 2023 is shown on page 173 . The notional principal amount does not, however, represent the Group's credit risk exposure, which is limited to the current cost of replacing contracts with a positive value to the Group. Such amounts are reflected in note 52 on page 313 .\n\nAdditionally, credit risk arises from leasing arrangements where the Group is the lessor. Note 2(J) on page 224 provides details on the Group's approach to the treatment of leases.\n\nCredit risk exposures in the Insurance, Pensions and Investments division relate mostly to bond and loan assets which, together with some related swaps, are used to fund annuity commitments within shareholder funds; plus balances held in liquidity funds to manage Insurance division's liquidity requirements, and exposure to reinsurers.\n\nThe investments held in the Group's defined benefit pension schemes also expose the Group to credit risk. Note 16 on page 244 provides further information on the defined benefit pension schemes' assets and liabilities.\n\nLoans and advances, contingent liabilities, commitments, debt securities and derivatives also expose the Group to refinance risk. Refinance risk is the possibility that an outstanding exposure cannot be repaid at its contractual maturity date. If the Group does not wish to refinance the exposure then there is refinance risk if the obligor is unable to repay by securing alternative finance. This may occur for a number of reasons which may include: the borrower is in financial difficulty, because the terms required to refinance are outside acceptable appetite at the time or the customer is unable to refinance externally due to a lack of market liquidity. Refinance risk exposures are managed in accordance with the Group's existing credit risk policies, processes and controls, and are not considered to be material given the Group's prudent credit risk appetite. Where heightened refinance risk exists exposures are minimised through intensive account management and, where appropriate, are classed as impaired and/or forborne.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe process for credit risk identification, measurement and control is integrated into the Board-approved framework for credit risk appetite and governance.\n\nCredit risk is measured from different perspectives using a range of appropriate modelling and scoring techniques at a number of levels of granularity, including total balance sheet, individual portfolio, pertinent concentrations and individual customer - for both new business and existing exposure. Key metrics, which may include but are not limited to, total exposure, ECL, risk-weighted assets, new business quality, concentration risk and portfolio performance, are reported monthly to risk committees and forums.\n\nMeasures such as ECL, risk-weighted assets, observed credit performance, predicted credit quality (usually from predictive credit scoring models), collateral cover and quality, and other credit drivers (such as cash flow, affordability, leverage and indebtedness) have been incorporated into the Group's credit risk management practices to enable effective risk measurement across the Group.\n\nThe Group has also continued to strengthen its capabilities and abilities for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities, recognising that climate change is likely to result in changes in the risk profile and outlook for the Group's customers, the sectors the Group operates in and collateral/asset valuations. For further information, please refer to the sustainability report 2023.\n\nIn addition, stress testing and scenario analysis, including preparation of credit playbooks to analyse and forward plan for specific events and/or emerging issues, are used to estimate mpairment losses and capital demand forecasts for both regulatory and internal purposes and to assist in the formulation and calibration of credit risk appetite, where appropriate. i\n\nAs part of the 'three lines of defence' model, the Risk division is the second line of defence providing oversight and independent challenge to key risk decisions taken by business management. The Risk division also tests the effectiveness of credit risk management and internal credit risk controls. This includes ensuring that the control and monitoring of higher risk and vulnerable portfolios and sectors is appropriate and confirming that appropriate loss allowances for impairment are in place. Output from these reviews helps to inform credit risk appetite, credit policy and portfolio mandates.\n\nAs the third line of defence, Group Internal Audit undertakes regular risk-based reviews to assess the effectiveness of credit risk management and controls.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group uses a range of approaches to mitigate credit risk.\n\n## Prudent credit principles, risk policies and appetite statements:\n\nthe independent Risk division sets out the credit principles, credit risk policies and credit risk appetite statements. These are subject to regular review and governance, with any changes subject to an approval process. Risk teams monitor credit performance trends and the outlook. Risk teams also test the adequacy of and adherence to credit risk policies and processes throughout the Group. This includes tracking portfolio performance against an agreed set of credit risk appetite tolerances.\n\nRobust models and controls: see model risk on page 191 .\n\nLimitations on concentration risk: there are portfolio controls on certain industries, sectors and products to reflect risk appetite as well as individual, customer and bank limit risk tolerances. Credit policies, appetite statements and mandates are aligned to the Group's risk appetite and restrict exposure to higher risk countries and potentially vulnerable sectors and asset classes. Note 52 on\n\npage 314 provides an analysis of loans and advances to customers by industry (for commercial customers) and product (for retail customers). Exposures are monitored to prevent both an excessive concentration of risk and single name concentrations. These concentration risk controls are not necessarily in the form of a maximum limit on exposure, but may instead require new business in concentrated sectors to fulfil additional minimum policy and/or guideline requirements. The Group's largest credit limits are regularly monitored by the Board Risk Committee and reported in accordance with regulatory requirements.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\nDefined country risk management framework: the Group sets a broad maximum country risk appetite. Risk-based appetite for all countries is set within the independent Risk division, taking into account economic, financial, political and social factors as well as the approved business and strategic plans of the Group.\n\nSpecialist expertise: credit quality is managed and controlled by a number of specialist units within the business and Risk division, which provide for example: intensive management and control; security perfection; maintenance of customer and facility records; expertise in documentation for lending and associated products; sector-specific expertise; and legal services applicable to the particular market segments and product ranges offered by the Group.\n\nStress testing: the Group's credit portfolios are subject to regular stress testing. In addition to the Group-led, PRA and other regulatory stress tests, exercises focused on individual divisions and portfolios are also performed. For further information on the Group wide stress testing process, methodology and governance see page 143 .\n\nFrequent and robust credit risk assurance: assurance of credit risk is undertaken by an independent function operating within the Risk division which is part of the Group's second line of defence. Its primary objective is to provide reasonable and independent assurance and confidence that credit risk is being effectively managed and to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and being adhered to. Group Internal Audit also provides assurance to the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of credit risk management controls across the Group's activities.\n\n## Collateral\n\nThe principal types of acceptable collateral include:\n\n- \u00b7 Residential and commercial properties\n- \u00b7 Charges over business assets such as inventory and accounts receivable\n- \u00b7 Financial instruments such as debt securities\n- \u00b7 Vehicles\n- \u00b7 Cash\n- \u00b7 Guarantees received from third parties\n\nThe Group maintains appetite parameters on the acceptability of specific classes of collateral.\n\nFor non-mortgage retail lending to small businesses, collateral may include second charges over residential property and the assignment of life cover.\n\nCollateral held as security for financial assets other than loans and advances is determined by the nature of the underlying exposure. Debt securities, including treasury and other bills, are generally unsecured, with the exception of asset-backed securities and similar instruments such as covered bonds, which are secured by portfolios of financial assets. Collateral is generally not held against loans and advances to financial institutions. However, securities are held as part of reverse repurchase or securities borrowing transactions or where a collateral agreement has been entered into under a master netting agreement. Derivative transactions with financial counterparties are typically collateralised under a Credit Support Annex (CSA) in conjunction with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement. Derivative transactions with non-financial customers are not usually supported by a CSA.\n\nThe requirement for collateral and the type to be taken at origination will be based upon the nature of the transaction and the credit quality, size and structure of the borrower. For non-retail exposures, if required, the Group will often seek that any collateral includes a first charge over land and buildings owned and occupied by the business, a debenture over the assets of a company or limited liability partnership, personal guarantees, limited in amount, from the directors of a company or limited liability partnership and key man insurance. The Group maintains policies setting out which types of collateral valuation are acceptable, maximum loan to value (LTV) ratios and other criteria that are to be considered when reviewing an application. The fundamental business proposition must evidence the ability of the business to generate funds from normal business sources to repay a customer or counterparty's financial commitment, rather than reliance on the disposal of any security provided.\n\nAlthough lending decisions are primarily based on expected cash flows, any collateral provided may impact the pricing and other terms of a loan or facility granted. This will have a financial impact on the amount of net interest income recognised and on internal loss given default estimates that contribute to the determination of asset quality and returns.\n\nThe Group requires collateral to be realistically valued by an appropriately qualified source, independent of both the credit decision process and the customer, at the time of borrowing. In certain circumstances, for Retail residential mortgages this may include the use of automated valuation models based on market data, subject to accuracy criteria and LTV limits. Where third parties are used for collateral valuations, they are subject to regular monitoring and review. Collateral values are subject to review, which will vary according to the type of lending, collateral involved and account performance. Such reviews are undertaken to confirm that the value recorded remains appropriate and whether revaluation is required, considering, for example, account performance, market conditions and any information available that may indicate that the value of the collateral has materially declined. In such instances, the Group may seek additional collateral and/or other amendments to the terms of the facility. The Group adjusts estimated market values to take account of the costs of realisation and any discount associated with the realisation of the collateral when estimating credit losses.\n\nThe Group considers risk concentrations by collateral providers and collateral type with a view to ensuring that any potential undue concentrations of risk are identified and suitably managed by changes to strategy, policy and/or business plans.\n\nThe Group seeks to avoid correlation or wrong-way risk where possible. Under the Group's repurchase (repo) policy, the issuer of the collateral and the repo counterparty should be neither the same nor connected. The same rule applies for derivatives. The Risk division has the necessary discretion to extend this rule to other cases where there is significant correlation. Countries with a rating equivalent to AA- or better may be considered to have no adverse correlation between the counterparty domiciled in that country and the country of risk (issuer of securities).\n\nRefer to note 52 on page 313 for further information on collateral.",

        "page_content": "## Additional mitigation for Retail customers\n\nThe Group uses a variety of lending criteria when assessing applications for mortgages and unsecured lending. The general approval process uses credit acceptance scorecards and involves a review of an applicant's previous credit history using internal data and information held by Credit Reference Agencies (CRA).\n\nThe Group also assesses the affordability and sustainability of lending for each borrower. For secured lending this includes use of an appropriate stressed interest rate scenario. Affordability assessments for all lending are compliant with relevant regulatory and conduct guidelines. The Group takes reasonable steps to validate information used in the assessment of a customer's income and expenditure.\n\nIn addition, the Group has in place quantitative limits such as maximum limits for individual customer products, the level of borrowing to income and the ratio of borrowing to collateral. Some of these limits relate to internal approval levels and others are policy limits above which the Group will typically reject borrowing applications. The Group also applies certain criteria that are applicable to specific products, for example applications for buy-to-let mortgages.\n\nFor UK mortgages, the Group's policy permits owner occupier applications with a maximum LTV of 95 per cent. This can increase to 100 per cent for specific products where additional security is provided by a supporter of the applicant and held on deposit by the Group. Applications with an LTV above 90 per cent are subject to enhanced underwriting criteria, including higher scorecard cutoffs and loan size restrictions.\n\nBuy-to-let mortgages within Retail are limited to a maximum loan size of \u00a32,000,000 and 75 per cent LTV for a single property. Buy-tolet applications must pass a minimum rental cover ratio of 125 per cent under stressed interest rates, after applicable tax liabilities. Portfolio landlords (customers with four or more mortgaged buyto-let properties) are subject to additional controls including evaluation of overall portfolio resilience.\n\nThe Group's policy is to reject any application for a lending product where a customer is registered as bankrupt or insolvent, or has a recent County Court Judgment or financial default registered at a CRA used by the Group above de minimis thresholds. In addition, the Group typically rejects applicants where total unsecured debt, debt-to-income ratios, or other indicators of financial difficulty exceed policy limits.\n\nWhere credit acceptance scorecards are used, new models, model changes and monitoring of model effectiveness are independently reviewed and approved in accordance with the governance framework set by the Group Model Governance Committee.\n\n## Additional mitigation for Commercial customers\n\nIndividual credit assessment and independent sanction of customer and bank limits: with the exception of small exposures to small to medium-sized enterprises (SME) customers where certain relationship managers have limited delegated credit approval authority, credit risk in commercial customer portfolios is subject to approval by the independent Risk division, which considers the strengths and weaknesses of individual transactions, the balance of risk and reward, and how credit risk aligns to the Group and divisional risk appetite. Exposure to individual counterparties, groups of counterparties or customer risk segments is controlled through a tiered hierarchy of credit authority delegations and risk-based credit limit guidances per client group for larger exposures. Approval requirements for each decision are based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the transaction amount, the customer's aggregate facilities, any risk mitigation in place, credit policy, risk appetite, credit risk ratings and the nature and term of the risk. The Group's credit risk appetite criteria for counterparty and customer loan underwriting is generally the same as that for loans intended to be held to maturity. All hard loan/bond underwriting must be approved by the Risk division. A pre-approved credit matrix may be used for 'best efforts' underwriting.\n\nCounterparty credit limits: limits are set against all types of exposure in a counterparty name, in accordance with an agreed methodology for each exposure type. This includes credit risk exposure on individual derivatives and securities financing transactions, which incorporates potential future exposures from market movements against agreed confidence intervals. Aggregate facility levels by counterparty are set and limit breaches are subject to escalation procedures.\n\nDaily settlement limits: settlement risk arises in any situation where a payment in cash, securities or equities is made in the expectation of a corresponding receipt in cash, securities or equities. Daily settlement limits are established for each relevant counterparty to cover the aggregate of all settlement risk arising from the Group's market transactions on any single day. Where possible, the Group uses Continuous Linked Settlement in order to reduce foreign exchange (FX) settlement risk.\n\n## Master netting agreements\n\nIt is credit policy that a Group-approved master netting agreement must be used for all derivative and traded product transactions and must be in place prior to trading, with separate documentation required for each Group entity providing facilities. This requirement extends to trades with clients and the counterparties used for the Group's own hedging activities, which may also include clearing trades with Central Counterparties (CCPs).\n\nAny exceptions must be approved by the appropriate credit approver. Master netting agreements do not generally result in an offset of balance sheet assets and liabilities for accounting purposes, as transactions are usually settled on a gross basis. However, within relevant jurisdictions and for appropriate counterparty types, master netting agreements do reduce the credit risk to the extent that, if an event of default occurs, all trades with the counterparty may be terminated and settled on a net basis. The Group's overall exposure to credit risk on derivative instruments subject to master netting agreements can change substantially within a short period, since this is the net position of all trades under the master netting agreement.\n\n## Other credit risk transfers\n\nThe Group also undertakes asset sales, credit derivative based transactions, securitisations (including significant risk transfer transactions), purchases of credit default swaps and purchase of credit insurance as a means of mitigating or reducing credit risk and/or risk concentration, taking into account the nature of assets and the prevailing market conditions.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nIn conjunction with the Risk division, businesses identify and define portfolios of credit and related risk exposures and the key behaviours and characteristics by which those portfolios are managed and monitored. This entails the production and analysis of regular portfolio monitoring reports for review by senior management. The Risk division in turn produces an aggregated view of credit risk across the Group, including reports on material credit exposures, concentrations, concerns and other management information, which is presented to senior officers, divisional credit risk forums, business unit committees and forums, Group Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Models\n\nThe performance of all models used in credit risk is monitored in line with the Group's model governance framework - see model risk on page 191 .\n\n## Intensive care of customers in financial difficulty\n\nThe Group operates a number of solutions to assist borrowers who are experiencing financial stress. The material elements of these solutions through which the Group has granted a concession, whether temporarily or permanently, are set out below.\n\n## Forbearance\n\nThe Group's aim in offering forbearance and other assistance to customers in financial distress is to benefit both the customer and the Group by supporting its customers and acting in their best interests by, where possible, bringing customer facilities back into a sustainable position.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\nThe Group offers a range of tools and assistance to support customers who are encountering financial difficulties. Cases are managed on an individual basis, with the circumstances of each customer considered separately and the action taken judged as being appropriate and sustainable for both the customer and the Group.\n\nForbearance measures consist of concessions towards a debtor that is experiencing or about to experience difficulties in meeting its financial commitments. This can include modification of the previous terms and conditions of a contract or a total or partial refinancing of a troubled debt contract, either of which would not have been required had the debtor not been experiencing financial difficulties.\n\nThe provision and review of such assistance is controlled through the application of an appropriate policy framework and associated controls. Regular review of the assistance offered to customers is undertaken to confirm that it remains appropriate, alongside monitoring of customers' performance and the level of payments received.\n\nThe Group classifies accounts as forborne at the time a customer in financial difficulty is granted a concession.\n\nBalances in default or classified as Stage 3 are always considered to be non-performing. Balances may be non-performing but not in default or Stage 3, where for example they are within their nonperforming forbearance cure period.\n\nNon-performing exposures can be reclassified as performing forborne after a minimum 12-month cure period, providing there are no past due amounts or concerns regarding the full repayment of the exposure. A minimum of a further 24 months must pass from the date the forborne exposure was reclassified as performing forborne before the account can exit forbearance. If conditions to exit forbearance are not met at the end of this probation period, the exposure shall continue to be identified as forborne until all the conditions are met.\n\nThe Group's treatment of loan renegotiations is included in the impairment policy in note 2(H) on page 223 .\n\n## Customers receiving support from UK Government sponsored programmes\n\nTo assist customers in financial distress, the Group participates in UK Government sponsored programmes for households, including the Income Support for Mortgage Interest programme, under which the government pays the Group all or part of the interest on the mortgage on behalf of the customer. This is provided as a government loan which the customer must repay.\n\n## The Group credit risk portfolio in 2023 Overview\n\nThe Group's portfolios are well-positioned for the current macroeconomic environment. The Group retains a prudent approach to credit risk appetite and risk management, with strong credit origination criteria and robust LTVs in the secured portfolios.\n\nObserved credit performance remains resilient, despite the continued economic uncertainty with only modest evidence of deterioration to date. In UK mortgages, new to arrears were relatively stable throughout 2023, having increased slightly at the start of the year, largely driven by legacy vintages (mortgages originated in the period 2006 to 2008). Flows to default increased during the year for the same reason with trends stabilising in the second half. Unsecured portfolios continue to exhibit stable new to arrears and flow to default trends, broadly at or below prepandemic levels. The Group continues to monitor the impacts of the economic environment carefully through a suite of early warning indicators and governance arrangements that ensure risk mitigating action plans are in place to support customers and protect the Group's positions.\n\nThe underlying impairment charge in 2023 was \u00a3308 million, down from a charge of \u00a31,510 million in 2022. This is as a result of a significant write-back following the full repayment of debt from a single name client in the fourth quarter and improvements in the Group's macroeconomic outlook, the latter resulting in a release of \u00a3257 million (2022: a charge of \u00a3595 million).\n\nThe Group's underlying ECL allowance on loans and advances to customers decreased in the year to \u00a34,292 million (31 December 2022: \u00a35,222 million).\n\nGroup Stage 2 loans and advances to customers reduced to \u00a356,545 million (31 December 2022: \u00a365,728 million) and as a percentage of total lending to 12.5 per cent (31 December 2022: 14.3 per cent). This is due to improvements in the macroeconomic outlook transferring assets to Stage 1, along with impacts from securitisations of legacy Retail mortgages in the first quarter and Retail unsecured loans in the fourth quarter. Of the total Group Stage 2 loans and advances to customers, 91.3 per cent are up to date (31 December 2022: 92.7 per cent). Stage 2 coverage reduced slightly to 3.0 per cent (31 December 2022: 3.2 per cent).\n\nStage 3 loans and advances to customers reduced to \u00a310,110 million (31 December 2022: \u00a310,753 million), and as a percentage of total lending decreased slightly to 2.2 per cent (31 December 2022: 2.3 per cent). This reduction is largely following the full repayment of debt from a single name client in Commercial Banking and securitisation activity, partially offset by flow to default increases in the UK mortgages portfolio. Stage 3 coverage decreased by 6.8 percentage points to 15.8 per cent (31 December 2022: 22.6 per cent).\n\n## Prudent risk appetite and risk management\n\n- \u00b7 The Group continues to take a prudent and proactive approach to credit risk management and credit risk appetite whilst, in line with the Group's strategy, supporting clients to grow, as well as working closely with customers to help them through cost of living pressures and the impacts of higher interest rates and any deterioration in broader economic conditions\n- \u00b7 Sector, asset and product concentrations within the portfolios are closely monitored and controlled, with mitigating actions taken where appropriate. Sector and product risk appetite parameters help manage exposure to certain higher risk and cyclical sectors, segments and asset classes\n- \u00b7 The Group's effective risk management seeks to ensure early identification and management of customers and\n\ncounterparties who may be showing signs of distress\n\n- \u00b7 The Group will continue to work closely with its customers to ensure that they receive the appropriate level of support, embracing the standards outlined in the Mortgage Charter and including where customers are leveraging Pay As You Grow options under the UK Government Coronavirus scheme",

Loans and advances to customers are categorised into the following stages:\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 1 assets comprise of newly originated assets (unless purchased or originated credit-impaired), as well as those which have not experienced a significant increase in credit risk. These assets carry an expected credit loss allowance equivalent to the expected credit losses that result from those default events that are possible within 12 months of the reporting date (12 month expected credit losses)\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 assets are those which have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since origination. These assets carry an expected credit loss allowance equivalent to the expected credit losses arising over the lifetime of the asset (lifetime expected credit losses)\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 assets have either defaulted or are otherwise considered to be credit-impaired. These assets carry a lifetime expected credit loss\n- \u00b7 Purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI) are those that have been originated or acquired in a creditimpaired state. This includes within the definition of creditimpaired the purchase of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects impaired credit losses\n\n## Total expected credit loss allowance\n\n|                                      | Statutory basis   | Statutory basis   | Underlying basis A   | Underlying basis A   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                      | At 31 Dec 2023 \u00a3m | At 31 Dec 2022 \u00a3m | At 31 Dec 2023 \u00a3m    | At 31 Dec 2022 \u00a3m    |\n| Customer related balances            |                   |                   |                      |                      |\n| Drawn                                | 3,717             | 4,518             | 3,970                | 4,899                |\n| Undrawn                              | 322               | 323               | 322                  | 323                  |\n|                                      | 4,039             | 4,841             | 4,292                | 5,222                |\n| Loans and advances to banks          | 8                 | 15                | 8                    | 15                   |\n| Debt securities                      | 11                | 9                 | 11                   | 9                    |\n| Other assets                         | 26                | 38                | 26                   | 38                   |\n| Total expected credit loss allowance | 4,084             | 4,903             | 4,337                | 5,284                |\n\n## Reconciliation between statutory and underlying bases of gross loans and advances to customers and expected credit loss allowance on drawn balances\n\n|                                   | Gross loans and advances to customers   | Gross loans and advances to customers   | Gross loans and advances to customers   | Gross loans and advances to customers   | Gross loans and advances to customers   | Expected credit loss allowance on drawn balances   | Expected credit loss allowance on drawn balances   | Expected credit loss allowance on drawn balances   | Expected credit loss allowance on drawn balances   | Expected credit loss allowance on drawn balances   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n|                                   | Stage 1 \u00a3m                              | Stage 2 \u00a3m                              | Stage 3 \u00a3m                              | POCI \u00a3m                                 | Total \u00a3m                                | Stage 1 \u00a3m                                         | Stage 2 \u00a3m                                         | Stage 3 \u00a3m                                         | POCI \u00a3m                                            | Total \u00a3m                                           |\n| At 31 December 2023               |                                         |                                         |                                         |                                         |                                         |                                                    |                                                    |                                                    |                                                    |                                                    |\n| Underlying basis A                | 387,060                                 | 56,545                                  | 10,110                                  | -

A reconciliation between the two bases has been provided.\n\nIn the following statutory basis tables, purchased or originated credit- impaired (POCI) assets include a fixed pool of mortgages that were purchased as part of the HBOS acquisition at a deep discount to face value reflecting credit losses incurred from the point of origination to the date of acquisition. The residual expected credit loss (ECL) allowance and resulting low coverage ratio on POCI assets reflects further deterioration in the creditworthiness from the date of acquisition. Over time, these POCI assets will run off as the loans redeem, pay down or as loans are written off.\n\nThe Group uses the underlying basis to monitor the creditworthiness of the lending portfolio and related ECL allowances because it provides a better indication of the credit performance of the POCI assets purchased as part of the HBOS acquisition. The underlying basis assumes that the lending assets acquired as part of a business combination were originated by the Group and are classified as either Stage 1, 2 or 3 according to the change in credit risk over the period since origination. Underlying ECL allowances have been calculated accordingly.",

A more sophisticated assessment is required for up to date customers, which varies across divisions and product type. This assessment incorporates specific triggers such as a significant proportionate increase in probability of default relative to that at origination, recent arrears, forbearance activity, internal watch lists and external bureau flags. Up to date exposures in Stage 2 are likely to show lower levels of expected credit loss (ECL) allowance relative to those that have already moved into arrears given that an arrears status typically reflects a stronger indication of future default and greater likelihood of credit losses.",

The Group achieves this by generating four economic scenarios to reflect the range of outcomes; the central scenario reflects the Group's base case assumptions used for medium-term planning purposes, an upside and a downside scenario are also selected together with a severe downside scenario. If the base case moves adversely, it generates a new, more adverse downside and severe downside which are then incorporated into the ECL. Consistent with prior years, the base case, upside and downside scenarios carry a 30 per cent weighting; the severe downside is weighted at 10 per cent.\n\nThe table below shows the Group's ECL for the probability-weighted, upside, base case, downside and severe downside scenarios, with the severe downside scenario incorporating adjustments made to CPI inflation and UK Bank Rate paths. The stage allocation for an asset is based on the overall scenario probability-weighted probability of default and hence the staging of assets is constant across all the scenarios. In each economic scenario the ECL for individual assessments is held constant reflecting the basis on which they are evaluated. Judgemental adjustments applied through changes to model inputs or parameters, or more qualitative post model adjustments, are apportioned across the scenarios in proportion to modelled ECL where this better reflects the sensitivity of these adjustments to each scenario. The probability-weighted view shows the extent to which a higher ECL allowance has been recognised to take account of multiple economic scenarios relative to the base case; the uplift being  \u00a3678 million compared to \u00a3692 million at 31 December 2022.\n\n|                     | Probability- weighted \u00a3m   | Upside \u00a3m   | Base case \u00a3m   | Downside \u00a3m   | Severe downside \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------|----------------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|----------------------|\n| Statutory basis     |                            |             |                |               |                      |\n| UK mortgages        | 1,115                      | 395         | 670            | 1,155         | 4,485                |\n| Credit cards        | 810                        | 600         | 771            | 918           | 1,235                |\n| Other Retail        | 945                        | 850         | 920            | 981           | 1,200                |\n| Commercial Banking  | 1,182                      | 793         | 1,013          | 1,383         | 2,250                |\n| Other               | 32                         | 32          | 32             | 32            | 32                   |\n| At 31 December 2023 | 4,084                      | 2,670       | 3,406          | 4,469         | 9,202                |\n| UK mortgages        | 1,209                      | 514         | 790            | 1,434         | 3,874                |\n| Credit cards        | 763                        | 596         | 727            | 828           | 1,180                |\n| Other Retail        | 1,016                      | 907         | 992            | 1,056         | 1,290                |\n| Commercial Banking  | 1,869                      | 1,459       | 1,656          | 2,027         | 3,261                |\n| Other               | 46                         | 46          | 46             | 47            | 47                   |\n| At 31 December 2022 | 4,903                      | 3,522       | 4,211          | 5,392         | 9,652                |\n\n|                     | Probability- weighted \u00a3m   | Upside \u00a3m   | Base case \u00a3m   | Downside \u00a3m   | Severe downside \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------|----------------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|----------------------|\n| Underlying basis A  |                            |             |                |               |                      |\n| UK mortgages        | 1,368                      | 650         | 930            | 1,400         | 4,738                |\n| Credit cards        | 810                        | 600         | 771            | 918           | 1,235                |\n| Other Retail        | 945                        | 850         | 920            | 981           | 1,200                |\n| Commercial Banking  | 1,182                      | 793         | 1,013          | 1,383         | 2,250                |\n| Other               | 32                         | 32          | 32             | 32            | 32                   |\n| At 31 December 2023 | 4,337                      | 2,925       | 3,666          | 4,714         | 9,455                |\n| UK mortgages        | 1,590                      | 895         | 1,172          | 1,815         | 4,254                |\n| Credit cards        | 763                        | 596         | 727            | 828           | 1,180                |\n| Other Retail        | 1,016                      | 907         | 992            | 1,056         | 1,290                |\n| Commercial Banking  | 1,869                      | 1,459       | 1,656          | 2,027         | 3,261                |\n| Other               | 46                         | 46          | 46             | 47            | 47                   |\n| At 31 December 2022 | 5,284                      | 3,903       | 4,593          | 5,773         | 10,032               |",

The notional principal amount does not, however, represent the Group's credit risk exposure, which is limited to the current cost of replacing contracts with a positive value to the Group. Such amounts are reflected in note 52 on page 313 .\n\n## Retail\n\n- \u00b7 The Retail portfolio has remained resilient and well-positioned, despite pressure on consumer finances and affordability from a higher cost of living, inflationary pressures and rising interest rates. Robust risk management remains in place, with strong affordability and indebtedness controls for both new and existing lending and a prudent risk appetite approach\n- \u00b7 The Retail lending book is concentrated in lower risk segments which are better able to withstand the cost of living challenge and higher interest rates\n- \u00b7 In UK mortgages, new to arrears were relatively stable throughout 2023, having increased slightly at the start of the year, largely driven by legacy vintages (mortgages originated in the period 2006 to 2008). Flows to default increased during the year for the same reason with trends stabilising in the second half\n- \u00b7 Unsecured portfolios continue to exhibit stable new to arrears and flow to default trends, broadly at, or below pre-pandemic levels\n- \u00b7 The Group is closely monitoring the impacts of a higher cost of living on consumers to ensure it remains vigilant for any signs of deterioration. Lending strategies are under continuous review and have been proactively managed and calibrated to the latest macroeconomic outlook, with actions taken to enhance both living and housing cost assumptions in affordability assessments\n- \u00b7 The Retail impairment charge in 2023 was \u00a3831 million and is materially lower than the charge of \u00a31,373 million for 2022, largely due to favourable updates to the Group's macroeconomic outlook, driving a \u00a3233 million release compared to a charge of \u00a3600 million last year. This is partially offset by an increase in charges in relation to underlying performance to \u00a31,064 million, compared to \u00a3773 million from 2022, predominately as a result of flow to default increases in UK mortgages and the impact of higher discount rates reducing the value of future recoveries\n- \u00b7 All existing IFRS 9 staging rules and triggers have been maintained across Retail from the 2022 year end. Retail customer related ECL allowance as a percentage of drawn loans and advances (coverage) is stable at 0.9 per cent (31 December 2022: 0.9 per cent)\n- \u00b7 Favourable updates to the Group's macroeconomic outlook have reduced Stage 2 loans and advances to 13.3 per cent of the Retail portfolio (31 December 2022: 14.8 per cent), of which 91.0 per cent are up to date loans (31 December 2022: 92.3 per cent). Stage 2 ECL coverage also reduces slightly to 2.6 per cent (31 December 2022: 3.0 per cent)\n- \u00b7 Increased flows to default within UK mortgages result in an increase in Stage 3 loans and advances to 2.2 per cent of total loans and advances (31 December 2022: 2 per cent). Retail Stage 3 ECL coverage decreases to 13.9 per cent (31 December 2022: 16.4 per cent) due to portfolio mix changes; notably because UK mortgages hold comparatively lower coverage in comparison to other Retail products due to security. Underlying Stage 3 loans and advances, and Stage 3 coverage for all other Retail products excluding UK mortgages remain broadly stable\n\n## UK mortgages\n\n- \u00b7 The UK mortgages portfolio is well positioned with low arrears and a strong loan to value (LTV) profile. The Group has actively improved the quality of the portfolio over the years using robust affordability and credit controls, while the balances of higher risk legacy vintages have continued to reduce\n- \u00b7 New to arrears in the UK mortgages portfolio were relatively stable throughout 2023, having increased slightly at the start of the year, largely driven by legacy vintages, where there is a high concentration of variable rate customers. The Group is proactively monitoring existing mortgage customers as they reach the end of fixed rate deals with customers' immediate behaviour remaining stable\n- \u00b7 Total loans and advances decreased to \u00a3307.6 billion (31 December 2022: \u00a3312.7 billion), with an increase in average LTV to 43.6 per cent (31 December 2022: 41.6 per cent). The proportion of balances with a LTV greater than 90 per cent increased to 2.9 per cent (31 December 2022: 1.4 per cent). The average LTV of new business remained stable at 61.7 per cent (31 December 2022: 61.7 per cent)\n- \u00b7 Updated macroeconomic assumptions within the ECL model, most notably to account for more resilient house price performance than previously anticipated, resulted in a net impairment release of \u00a351 million for 2023 compared to a charge of \u00a3295 million for 2022.

Total ECL coverage remains stable at 5.1 per cent (31 December 2022: 5.1 per cent)\n- \u00b7 Favourable updates to the macroeconomic outlook result in a reduction in Stage 2 loans and advances to 18.4 per cent of the portfolio (31 December 2022: 21.9 per cent), with Stage 2 ECL coverage broadly stable at 15.3 per cent (31 December 2022: 14.5 per cent)\n- \u00b7 Resilient underlying arrears and default performance has also resulted in stable Stage 3 loans and advances at 1.8 per cent of the portfolio (31 December 2022: 1.9 per cent) and Stage 3 ECL coverage is broadly stable at 49.4 per cent (31 December 2022: 50.9 per cent)\n\n## Loans and overdrafts\n\n- \u00b7 Loans and advances for personal current account and the personal loans portfolios reduced to \u00a38.5 billion (31 December 2022: \u00a310.3 billion) driven by a \u00a32.7 billion securitisation in the loans portfolio\n- \u00b7 Impairment charge of \u00a3251 million for 2023 is lower than the charge of \u00a3499 million for 2022 again due to favourable macroeconomic updates and a more resilient underlying performance than previously anticipated\n\n## UK Motor Finance\n\n- \u00b7 The UK Motor Finance portfolio increased to \u00a315.7 billion (31 December 2022: \u00a314.6 billion), with lower new car supply versus pre-COVID being offset by used vehicle sales\n- \u00b7 Updates to Residual Value (RV) and Voluntary Termination (VT) risk held against Personal Contract Purchase (PCP) and Hire Purchase (HP) lending are included within the impairment charge.

At 31 December 2023, owner occupier interest-only balances as a proportion of total owner occupier balances had reduced to 14.4 per cent (31 December 2022: 16.4 per cent). The average indexed loan to value remained low at 36.9 per cent (31 December 2022: 35.5 per cent).\n\nFor existing interest-only mortgages, a contact strategy is in place during the term of the mortgage to ensure that customers are aware of their obligations to repay the principal upon maturity of the loan.\n\nTreatment strategies are in place to help customers anticipate and plan for repayment of capital at maturity and support those who may have difficulty in repaying the principal amount. A dedicated specialist team supports customers who have passed their contractual maturity date and are unable to fully repay the principal. A range of treatments are offered to customers based on their individual circumstances to create fair and sustainable outcomes.\n\n## Analysis of owner occupier interest-only mortgages (statutory basis)\n\n|                                             | At 31 Dec 2023   | At 31 Dec 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Interest-only balances (\u00a3m)                 | 37,278           | 42,697           |\n| Stage 1 (%)                                 | 54.7             | 58.5             |\n| Stage 2 (%)                                 | 27.6             | 25.3             |\n| Stage 3 (%)                                 | 5.6              | 3.7              |\n| Purchased or originated credit-impaired (%) | 12.1             | 12.6             |\n| Average loan to value (%)                   | 36.9             | 35.5             |\n| Maturity profile (\u00a3m)                       |                  |                  |\n| Due                                         | 1,982            | 1,931            |\n| Within 1 year                               | 1,129            | 1,453            |\n| 2 to 5 years                                | 8,803            | 8,832            |\n| 6 to 10 years                               | 13,918           | 16,726           |\n| Greater than 10 years                       | 11,446           | 13,755           |\n| Past term interest-only balances 1  (\u00a3m)    | 1,925            | 1,906            |\n| Stage 1 (%)                                 | 0.2              | 0.2              |\n| Stage 2 (%)                                 | 9.3              | 11.9             |\n| Stage 3 (%)                                 | 52.2             | 45.6             |\n| Purchased or originated credit-impaired (%) | 38.4             | 42.3             |\n| Average loan to value (%)                   | 35.2             | 33.2             |\n| Negative equity (%)                         | 2.6              | 2.0              |",

On an underlying basis, total forbearance for the major retail portfolios has reduced by \u00a30.5 billion to \u00a34.0 billion. This reduction is primarily driven by decreases in customers with a historical capitalisation treatment (where arrears were reset) and the impact of removing mortgage balances following the securitisation of legacy Retail mortgage accounts. On a statutory basis the equivalent total forbearance position improved by \u00a30.4 billion to \u00a33.9 billion.\n\nThe main customer treatments included are: repair, where arrears are added to the loan balance and the arrears position cancelled; instances where there are suspensions of interest and/or capital repayments; and refinance personal loans.\n\nAs a percentage of loans and advances, forbearance loans remain broadly static at 1.2 per cent at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 1.2 per cent).\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, 97.0 per cent of forbearance loans are captured in Stage 2 or Stage 3 for IFRS 9 and hold provision on a lifetime basis (31 December 2022: 96.5 per cent).\n\nTotal expected credit losses (ECL) as a proportion of loans and advances which are forborne has decreased  to 11.2 per cent (31 December 2022: 12.1 per cent).\n\n## Retail forborne loans and advances (statutory basis) (audited)\n\n|                      | Total \u00a3m   | Of which Stage 2 \u00a3m   | Of which Stage 3 \u00a3m   | Of which POCI \u00a3m   | Expected  credit losses  as a % of total  loans and  advances  which are  1 forborne %   |\n|----------------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| At 31 December 2023  |            |                       |                       |                    |                                                                                          |\n| UK mortgages         | 3,269      | 695                   | 1,008                 | 1,552              | 4.1                                                                                      |\n| Credit cards         | 268        | 89                    | 141                   | -

While some of the Group's metrics indicate limited deterioration, especially in consumerled sectors, these are not considered to be material\n- \u00b7 The Group is cognisant of a number of risks and headwinds associated with a heightened inflationary and interest rate environment especially in, but not limited to, sectors reliant upon consumer discretionary spend. Risks include, but are not limited to, reduced asset valuation and refinancing risk, a reduction in market liquidity impacting credit supply and pressure on both household discretionary spending and business margins\n- \u00b7 The Group has reduced overall exposure to cyclical sectors since 2019 and continues to closely monitor credit quality, sector and single name concentrations. Sector and credit risk appetite continue to be proactively managed to ensure clients continue to be supported in the right way and the Group is protected\n- \u00b7 The Group continues to provide early support to its more vulnerable customers through focused risk management via its Watchlist and Business Support framework, within which volumes have increased marginally in 2023. The Group continues to balance prudent risk appetite with ensuring support for financially viable clients\n\n## Impairments\n\n- \u00b7 There was a net impairment release of \u00a3511 million in 2023, compared to a net impairment charge of \u00a3517 million in 2022. This largely reflects the full repayment of debt from a single name client in the fourth quarter offset by additional charges on existing Stage 3 clients\n- \u00b7 ECL allowances decreased in the year to \u00a31,165 million at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: \u00a31,849 million). The ECL provision at 31 December 2023 includes the capture of the impact of inflationary pressures and heightened interest rates and assumes additional losses will emerge as a result of these and other emerging risks, through the multiple economic scenarios\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 loans and advances decreased to \u00a37,987 million (31 December 2022: \u00a311,493 million), largely as a result of improvements in the Group's forward-looking modelled macroeconomic assumptions, with 92.8 per cent of Stage 2 balances up to date (31 December 2022: 94.8 per cent). Stage 2 as a proportion of total loans and advances to customers decreased to 8.9 per cent (31 December 2022: 12.1 per cent). Stage 2 ECL coverage was higher at 5.6 per cent (31 December 2022: 4.4 per cent) with the increase in coverage largely a result of the change in the forward-looking multiple economic scenarios\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 loans and advances reduced to \u00a32,068 million (31 December 2022: \u00a33,371 million) and as a proportion of total loans and advances to customers, reduced to 2.3 per cent (31 December 2022: 3.5 per cent). Stage 3 ECL coverage reduced to 24.1 per cent (31 December 2022: 38.9 per cent). These reductions are largely driven by the full repayment of debt from a single name client\n\n## Commercial Banking UK Real Estate\n\n- \u00b7 Commercial Banking UK Real Estate committed drawn lending stood at c.\u00a310 billion at 31 December 2023 (net of \u00a33.6 billion exposures subject to protection through Significant Risk Transfer (SRT) securitisations). In addition there are undrawn lending facilities of \u00a33.6 billion to predominantly investment grade rated corporate customers\n- \u00b7 The Group classifies Direct Real Estate as exposure which is directly supported by cash flows from property activities (as opposed to trading activities, such as hotels, care homes and housebuilders). Exposures of \u00a37.0 billion to social housing providers are also excluded\n- \u00b7 Despite some headwinds, including the inflationary environment and the impact of heightened interest rates, the portfolio continues to remain well-positioned and proactively managed with conservative LTVs, good levels of interest cover and appropriate risk mitigants in place\n- \u00b7 Overall performance of the portfolio has remained resilient. The Group has seen an increase in cases in its more closely monitored Watchlist category, however this has only translated into a modest flow into Business Support. Rent collection has largely stabilised, although challenges remain in some sectors\n- \u00b7 Lending continues to be heavily weighted towards investment real estate (c.91 per cent) rather than development. Of these investment exposures, c.90 per cent have an LTV of less than 70 per cent, with an average LTV of 46 per cent. The average interest cover ratio was 3.3 times, with 78 per cent having interest cover of above 2 times. In SME, LTV at origination has been typically limited to c.55 per cent, given prudent repayment cover criteria (including notional base rate stress)\n- \u00b7 The portfolio is well diversified with no speculative commercial development lending (defined as property not pre-sold or prelet at a level to fully repay the debt or generate sufficient income to meet the minimum interest cover requirements). Approximately 49 per cent of exposures relate to commercial real estate, including c.14 per cent secured by office assets, c.10 per cent by retail assets and c.12 per cent by industrial assets. Approximately 49 per cent of the portfolio relates to residential\n- \u00b7 Recognising this is a cyclical sector, total (gross and net) and asset type quantum caps are in place to control origination and exposure, including several asset type categories. Focus remains on the UK market and new business has been written in line with a prudent risk appetite criteria including conservative LTVs, strong quality of income and proven management teams. Development lending criteria also includes maximum loan to gross development value and maximum loan to cost, with funding typically only released against completed work, as confirmed by the Group's monitoring quantity surveyor\n- \u00b7 Use of SRT securitisations also acts as a risk mitigant in this portfolio, with run-off of these carefully managed and sequenced",

        "page_content": "## Data risk\n\n## Definition\n\nData risk is defined as the risk of the Group failing to effectively govern, manage and protect its data throughout its lifecycle, including data processed by third parties, or failure to drive value from data; leading to unethical decision making, poor customer outcomes, loss of value to the Group and mistrust.\n\n## Exposures\n\nData risk is present in all aspects of the business where data is processed, both within the Group and by third parties including colleague and contractor, and prospective and existing customers. Data risk manifests:\n\n- \u00b7 When data policies, standards and governance are not adhered to\n- \u00b7 When data is processed and fails to meet compliance requirements, for example the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and other data regulatory obligations\n- \u00b7 When data-related issues such as quality are not identified, assessed and managed appropriately\n- \u00b7 When data is not created, retained, protected, destroyed or retrieved appropriately\n\n## Measurement\n\nData risk covers data governance, data management and data privacy and ethics and is measured through a series of quantitative and qualitative metrics.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group continues to invest to reduce data risk exposure to within appetite. Examples include:\n\n- \u00b7 Delivering a data strategy\n- \u00b7 Enhancing data quality and capability\n- \u00b7 Embedding data by design and ethics\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe Group continues to monitor and respond to data-related regulatory initiatives, such as the new Digital Protection and Digital Information Bill expected in 2024, and other legal regimes, for example, the European Commission's Artificial Intelligence Act.\n\nData risk is governed through Group and sub-group committees. Significant issues are escalated to Group Risk Committee, in accordance with the Group's enterprise risk management framework, and RCSA frameworks.\n\nA number of activities support the close monitoring of data risk including:\n\n- \u00b7 Design and monitoring of data risk appetite metrics, including key risk and performance indicators\n- \u00b7 Monitoring of significant data-related issues, complaints, events and breaches in accordance with Group Operational Risk and Data policies\n- \u00b7 Identification and mitigation of data risk when planning and implementing transformation or business change\n\n## Funding and liquidity risk\n\n## Definition\n\nFunding risk is defined as the risk that the Group does not have sufficiently stable and diverse sources of funding or the funding structure is inefficient. Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group has insufficient financial resources to meet its commitments as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost.\n\n## Exposure\n\nLiquidity exposure represents the potential stressed outflows in any future period less expected inflows. The Group considers liquidity exposure from both an internal and a regulatory perspective.\n\n## Measurement\n\nLiquidity risk is managed through a series of measures, tests and reports that are primarily based on contractual maturities with behavioural overlays as appropriate. Note 52 on page 323 sets out an analysis of assets and liabilities by relevant maturity grouping. The Group undertakes quantitative and qualitative analysis of the behavioural aspects of its assets and liabilities in order to reflect their expected behaviour.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group manages and monitors liquidity risks and ensures that liquidity risk management systems and arrangements are adequate with regard to the internal risk appetite, Group strategy and regulatory requirements. Liquidity policies and procedures are subject to independent internal oversight by Risk. Overseas branches and subsidiaries of the Group may also be required to meet the liquidity requirements of the entity's domestic country. Management of liquidity requirements is performed by the overseas branch or subsidiary in line with Group policy. Liquidity risk of the Insurance business is actively managed and monitored within the Insurance business. The Group plans funding requirements over its planning period, combining business as usual and stressed conditions. The Group manages its liquidity position paying regard to its internal risk appetite, Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) as required by the PRA, the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) and the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) liquidity requirements.\n\nThe Group's funding and liquidity position is underpinned by its significant customer deposit base and is supported by strong relationships across customer segments. The Group has consistently observed that, in aggregate, the retail deposit base provides a stable source of funding. Funding concentration by counterparty, currency and tenor is monitored on an ongoing basis and, where concentrations do exist, these are managed as part of the planning process and limited by the internal funding and liquidity risk monitoring framework, with analysis regularly provided to senior management.\n\nTo assist in managing the balance sheet, the Group operates a Liquidity Transfer Pricing (LTP) process which: allocates relevant interest expenses from the centre to the Group's banking businesses within the internal management accounts; helps drive the correct inputs to customer pricing; and is consistent with regulatory requirements. LTP makes extensive use of behavioural maturity profiles, taking account of expected customer loan prepayments and stability of customer deposits, modelled on historic data.\n\nThe Group can monetise liquid assets quickly, either through the repurchase agreements (repo) market or through outright sale. In addition, the Group has pre-positioned a substantial amount of assets at the Bank of England's Discount Window Facility which can be used to access additional liquidity in a time of stress. The Group considers diversification across geography, currency, markets and tenor when assessing appropriate holdings of liquid assets. The Group's liquid asset buffer is available for deployment at immediate notice, subject to complying with regulatory requirements.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\nLiquidity risk within the Insurance business may result from: the inability to sell financial assets quickly at fair value; an insurance liability falling due for payment earlier than expected; the inability to generate cash inflows as anticipated; an unexpected large operational event; or from a general insurance catastrophe, for example, a significant weather event. Liquidity risk is actively managed and monitored within the Insurance business to ensure that it remains within approved risk appetite, so that even under stress conditions, there is sufficient liquidity to meet obligations.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nDaily monitoring and control processes are in place to address internal and regulatory liquidity requirements. The Group monitors a range of market and internal early warning indicators on a daily basis for early signs of liquidity risk in the market or specific to the Group. This captures regulatory metrics as well as metrics the Group considers relevant for its liquidity profile. These are a mixture of quantitative and qualitative measures, including: daily variation of customer balances; changes in maturity profiles; funding concentrations; changes in LCR outflows; credit default swap (CDS) spreads; and basis risks.\n\nThe Group carries out internal stress testing of its liquidity and potential cash flow mismatch position over both short (up to one month) and longer-term horizons against a range of scenarios forming an important part of the internal risk appetite. The scenarios and assumptions are reviewed at least annually to ensure that they continue to be relevant to the nature of the business, including reflecting emerging horizon risks to the Group. For further information on the Group's 2023 liquidity stress testing results refer to page 183 .\n\nThe Group maintains a Liquidity Contingency Framework as part of the wider Recovery Plan which is designed to identify emerging liquidity concerns at an early stage, so that mitigating actions can be taken to avoid a more serious crisis developing. The Liquidity Contingency Framework has a foundation of robust and regular monitoring and reporting of key performance indicators, early warning indicators and risk appetite by both Group Corporate Treasury (GCT) and Risk up to and including Board level. Where movements in any of these metrics and indicator suites point to a potential issue, SME teams and their directors will escalate this information as appropriate.\n\n## Funding and liquidity management in 2023\n\nThe Group has maintained its strong funding and liquidity position with a loan to deposit ratio of 95 per cent as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 96 per cent). Total wholesale funding decreased to \u00a398.7 billion as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: \u00a3100.3 billion) driven by a small reduction in Money Market funding. The Group maintains its access to diverse sources and tenors of funding.\n\nThe Group's liquid assets continue to exceed the regulatory minimum and internal risk appetite, with a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of 142 per cent (based on a monthly rolling average over the previous 12 months) as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 144 per cent) calculated on a Group consolidated basis based on the PRA rulebook. The decrease in LCR is explained primarily by a reduction in customer deposits. All assets within the liquid asset portfolio are hedged for interest rate risk. Following the implementation of structural reform, liquidity risk is managed at a legal entity level with the Group consolidated LCR representing the composite of the Ring-Fenced Bank and Non-Ring-Fenced Bank entities.\n\nLCR eligible assets have reduced to \u00a3136.0 billion, from \u00a3144.7 billion as at 31 December 2022, driven by a reduction in customer deposits. In addition to the Group's reported LCR eligible assets, the Group maintains borrowing capacity at central banks which averaged \u00a374 billion in the 12 months to 31 December 2023. The net stable funding ratio remains strong at 130 per cent as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 130 per cent).\n\nDuring 2023, the Group accessed wholesale funding across a range of currencies and markets with term issuance volumes totalling \u00a316.1 billion, compared to full year guidance of around \u00a315 billion of wholesale issuance needs. In 2024, the Group expects to have term wholesale issuance requirements of around \u00a315 billion. The total outstanding amount of drawings from the TFSME has remained stable at \u00a330.0 billion at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: \u00a330.0 billion), with maturities in 2025, 2027 and beyond.\n\nThe Group's credit ratings continue to reflect the strength of its business model and balance sheet. The rating agencies continue to monitor the impact of economic conditions and elevated rates for the UK banking sector. The strength of the Group's management and franchise, along with its robust financial performance, capital and funding position, are reflected in the Group's strong ratings.",

The decrease in ratio is explained primarily by an increase in modelled stress outflows.\n\nThis scenario includes a two notch downgrade of the Group's current long-term debt rating and accompanying one notch short-term downgrade implemented instantaneously by all major rating agencies.",

At 31 December 2023, the Group had \u00a338.0 billion (31 December 2022: \u00a335.5 billion) of externally encumbered on-balance sheet assets with counterparties other than central banks. The increase in encumbered assets was primarily driven by securitisation and covered bond issuances. The Group also had \u00a3704.5 billion (31 December 2022: \u00a3705.9 billion) of unencumbered on-balance sheet assets, and \u00a3139.0 billion (31 December 2022: \u00a3132.0 billion) of pre-positioned and encumbered assets held with central banks; the increase in the latter was primarily driven by additional assets pre-positioned at the Bank of England. Primarily, the Group encumbers mortgages, unsecured lending, credit card receivables and car loans through the issuance programmes and tradable securities through securities financing activity.

Longevity risk arises from the annuity portfolios where policyholders' future cash flows are guaranteed at retirement and increases in life expectancy beyond current assumptions will increase the cost of annuities. Longevity risk exposures are expected to increase with the insurance business growth in the annuity market. Customer behaviour may result in increased cancellations or cessation of contributions, giving rise to the persistency exposure.\n\nThe Group's defined benefit pension schemes also expose the Group to longevity risk. For further information please refer to the defined benefit pension schemes component of the market risk section and note 16 to the financial statements.\n\nProperty insurance risk is a key risk within the General Insurance business, arising from home insurance. Exposures can arise, for example, from extreme weather conditions such as flooding, when property damage claims are higher than expected.\n\nExpenses are incurred in writing insurance business, with the risk of costs being higher than expected managed through regular cost initiatives and operating model reviews.\n\n## Measurement\n\nInsurance underwriting risks are measured using a variety of techniques including stress, reverse stress and scenario testing, as well as stochastic modelling. Current and potential future insurance underwriting risk exposures are assessed and aggregated across a range of stresses with risk measures based on 1-in-200 year stresses for the Insurance business' regulatory capital assessments and other supporting measures where appropriate, including those set out in note 36 to the financial statements.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nInsurance underwriting risk is mitigated in a number of ways:\n\n- \u00b7 Risks are identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported using the RCSA process\n- \u00b7 Embedded insurance processes for underwriting, claims and expense management, pricing, product design and use of reinsurance\n- \u00b7 Annual review and setting of demographic and expense best estimate assumptions\n- \u00b7 Exposure limits by risk type are assessed through the business planning process and used as a control mechanism to ensure risks are taken within risk appetite\n- \u00b7 Longevity risk transfer and hedging solutions are considered on a regular basis\n- \u00b7 Life Insurance exposure to demographic risks are mitigated through the use of reinsurance, where there is a clear benefit that outweighs the value of retaining the risks, or where there are risks which are less well understood\n- \u00b7 General Insurance exposure to accumulations of risk and possible catastrophes is mitigated by reinsurance arrangements spread over a range of reinsurers. Detailed modelling, including that of the potential losses under various catastrophe scenarios, supports the choice of reinsurance arrangements\n\n## Monitoring\n\nInsurance underwriting risks are monitored by Insurance senior executive committees and ultimately the Insurance Board. Significant risks from the Insurance business and the defined benefit pension schemes are reviewed by the Group Executive and Group Risk Committees and Board.\n\nInsurance underwriting risk exposures are monitored against risk appetite with persistency, expenses and GI claims also analysed monthly. The Insurance business monitors experiences against expectations, for example business volumes and mix, claims, expenses and persistency experience. The effectiveness of controls put in place to manage insurance underwriting risk is evaluated and significant divergences from experience or movements in risk exposures are investigated and remedial action taken.",

Further information on these balances can be found under funding and liquidity risk on page 179 .\n\nThe majority of debt issuance originates from the Group's capital and funding activities and the interest rate risk of the debt issued is hedged by swapping them into a floating rate.\n\nThe non-trading book primarily consists of customer on-balance sheet activities and the Group's capital and funding activities, which expose it to the risk of adverse movements in market rates or prices, predominantly interest rates, credit spreads, exchange rates and equity prices, as described in further detail within the Banking activities section on page 187 .",

        "page_content": "## Measurement\n\nGroup risk appetite is calibrated primarily to a number of multirisk Group economic scenarios, and is supplemented with sensitivity-based measures. The scenarios assess the impact of unlikely, but plausible, adverse stresses on income with the worst case for banking activities, defined benefit pensions, insurance and trading portfolios reported against independently, and across the Group as a whole.\n\nThe Group risk appetite is cascaded first to the Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO), chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, where risk appetite is approved and monitored by risk type, and then to the Group Market Risk Committee (GMRC) where risk appetite is sub-allocated by business unit. These metrics are reviewed regularly by senior management to inform effective decision making.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nGALCO is responsible for approving and monitoring market risk management techniques, market risk measures, behavioural assumptions, and the market risk policy. Various mitigation activities are assessed and undertaken across the Group to manage portfolios and seek to ensure they remain within approved limits. The mitigation actions will vary dependent on exposure but will, in general, look to reduce risk in a cost effective manner by offsetting balance sheet exposures and externalising to the financial markets dependent on market liquidity. The market risk policy is owned by Group Corporate Treasury (GCT) and refreshed annually. The policy is underpinned by supplementary market risk procedures, which define specific market risk management and oversight requirements.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nGALCO and GMRC regularly review high level market risk exposures as part of the wider risk management framework. They also make recommendations to the Board concerning overall market risk appetite and market risk policy. Exposures at lower levels of delegation are monitored at various intervals according to their volatility, from daily in the case of trading portfolios to monthly or quarterly in the case of less volatile portfolios. Levels of exposures compared to approved limits and triggers are monitored by Risk and appropriate escalation procedures are in place.\n\nHow market risks arise and are managed across the Group's activities is considered in more detail below.\n\n## Banking activities\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group's banking activities expose it to the risk of adverse movements in market rates or prices, predominantly interest rates, credit spreads, exchange rates and equity prices. The volatility of market rates or prices can be affected by both the transparency of prices and the amount of liquidity in the market for the relevant asset, liability or instrument.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nYield curve risk in the Group's divisional portfolios, and in the Group's capital and funding activities, arises from the different repricing characteristics of the Group's non-trading assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions.\n\nBasis risk arises from the potential changes in spreads between indices, for example where the bank lends with reference to a central bank rate but funds with reference to a market rate, for example, SONIA, and the spread between these two rates widens or tightens.\n\nOptionality risk arises predominantly from embedded optionality within assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet items where either the Group or the customer can affect the size or timing of cash flows. One example of this is mortgage prepayment risk where the customer owns an option allowing them to prepay when it is economical to do so. This can result in customer balances amortising more quickly or slowly than anticipated due to customers' response to changes in economic conditions.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nEconomic foreign exchange exposure arises from the Group's investment in its overseas operations (net investment exposures are disclosed in note 52 on page 312 ). In addition, the Group incurs foreign exchange risk through non-functional currency flows from services provided by customer-facing divisions, the Group's debt and capital management programmes and is exposed to volatility in its CET1 ratio, due to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the retranslation of non-Sterling-denominated risk-weighted assets.\n\n## Equity risk\n\nEquity risk arises primarily from three different sources:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group's private equity exposure from investments held by Lloyds Development Capital and its stake in BGF, both within the Equities sub-group\n- \u00b7 A small number of legacy strategic equity holdings, for example Visa Inc Preference Shares, and recently acquired minority fintech stakes, all held in the Equities sub-group\n- \u00b7 A small exposure to Lloyds Banking Group share price through deferred shares and deferred options granted to employees as part of their benefits package\n\n## Credit spread risk\n\nCredit spread risk arises largely from: (i) the liquid asset portfolio held in the management of Group liquidity, comprising government, supranational and other eligible assets; (ii) the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) and Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) sensitivity to credit spreads; (iii) a number of the Group's structured medium-term notes where the Group has elected to fair value the notes through the profit and loss account; and (iv) banking book assets in Commercial Banking held at fair value under IFRS 9.\n\n## Measurement\n\nInterest rate risk exposure is monitored monthly using, primarily:\n\nMarket value sensitivity: this methodology considers all repricing mismatches (behaviourally adjusted where appropriate) in the current balance sheet and calculates the change in market value that would result from an instantaneous 25, 100 and 200 basis points parallel rise or fall in the yield curve. Sterling interest rates are modelled with a floor below zero per cent, with negative rate floors also modelled for non-Sterling currencies where appropriate (product-specific floors apply). The market value sensitivities are calculated on a static balance sheet using principal cash flows excluding interest, commercial margins and other spread components and are therefore discounted at the risk-free rate.\n\nInterest income sensitivity: this measures the impact on future net interest income arising from various economic scenarios. These include instantaneous 25, 100 and 200 basis point parallel shifts in all yield curves and the Group economic scenarios. Sterling interest rates are modelled with a floor below zero per cent, with negative rate floors also modelled for non-Sterling currencies where appropriate (product-specific floors apply). These scenarios are reviewed every year and are designed to replicate severe but plausible economic events, capturing risks that would not be evident through the use of parallel shocks alone such as basis risk and steepening or flattening of the yield curve.\n\nUnlike the market value sensitivities, the interest income sensitivities incorporate additional behavioural assumptions as to how and when individual products would reprice in response to changing rates.\n\nReported sensitivities are not necessarily predictive of future performance as they do not capture additional management actions that would likely be taken in response to an immediate, large, movement in interest rates. These actions could reduce the net interest income sensitivity, help mitigate any adverse impacts or they may result in changes to total income that are not captured in the net interest income.\n\nStructural hedge: the structural hedging programme managing interest rate risk in the banking book relies on assumptions made around customer behaviour. A number of metrics are in place to monitor the risks within the portfolio.",

        "page_content": "Year 1 net interest income sensitivity, to both up and down shocks, has decreased slightly year-on-year mostly as a result of changing customer deposit behaviour and structural hedge activity.\n\nThe three year net interest income sensitivity to an up 25 basis points and 50 basis points shock is largely due to reinvestment of structural hedge maturities in years two and three.\n\nThe sensitivities are illustrative and do not reflect new business margin implications and/or pricing actions, other than as outlined.\n\nThe following assumptions have been applied:\n\n- \u00b7 Instantaneous parallel shift in interest rate curve, including bank base rate\n- \u00b7 Balance sheet remains constant\n- \u00b7 Illustrative 50 per cent pass-through on deposits and 100 per cent pass-through on assets, which could be different in practice.\n\nBasis risk, foreign exchange, equity and credit spread risks are measured primarily through scenario analysis by assessing the impact on profit before tax over a 12-month horizon arising from a change in market rates, and reported within the Board risk appetite on a monthly basis. Supplementary measures such as sensitivity and exposure limits are applied where they provide greater insight into risk positions. Frequency of reporting supplementary measures varies from daily to quarterly appropriate to each risk type.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group's policy is to optimise reward while managing its market risk exposures within the risk appetite defined by the Board. The Group market risk policy and procedures outlines the hedging process, and the centralisation of risk from divisions into Group Corporate Treasury (GCT), for example via the transfer pricing framework. GCT is responsible for managing the centralised risk and does this through natural offsets of matching assets and liabilities, and appropriate hedging activity of the residual exposures, subject to the authorisation and mandate of GALCO within the Board risk appetite. The hedges are externalised to the market by derivative desks within GCT and the Commercial Bank. The Group mitigates income statement volatility through hedge accounting. This reduces the accounting volatility arising from the Group's economic hedging activities and any hedge accounting ineffectiveness is continuously monitored.\n\nThe largest residual risk exposure arises from balances that are deemed to be insensitive to changes in market rates (including current accounts, a portion of variable rate deposits and investable equity), and is managed through the Group's structural hedge. Consistent with the Group's strategy to deliver stable returns, GALCO seeks to minimise large reinvestment risk, and to smooth earnings over a range of investment tenors. The structural hedge consists of longer-term fixed rate assets or interest rate swaps and the amount and duration of the hedging activity is reviewed regularly by GALCO.\n\nWhile the Group faces uncertainty in customer behaviour due to a higher rate environment, its exposure to increased pipeline and prepayment risks are managed through hedging in line with expected customer behaviour. These are appropriately monitored and controlled through divisional Asset and Liability Committees (ALCOs).\n\nNet investment foreign exchange exposures are managed centrally by GCT, by hedging non-Sterling asset values with currency borrowing. Economic foreign exchange exposures arising from non-functional currency flows are identified by divisions and transferred and managed centrally. The Group also has a policy of forward hedging its forecasted currency profit and loss to year end.\n\nThe Group makes use of both accounting and economic foreign exchange exposures, as an offset against the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the value of non-Sterlingdenominated risk-weighted assets. This involves the holding of a structurally open currency position; sensitivity is minimised where, for a given currency, the ratio of the structural open position to risk-weighted assets equals the CET1 ratio. Continually evaluating this structural open currency position against evolving nonSterling-denominated risk-weighted assets mitigates volatility in the Group's CET1 ratio.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe appropriate limits and triggers are monitored by senior executive committees within the Banking divisions. Banking assets, liabilities and associated hedging are actively monitored and if necessary rebalanced to be within agreed tolerances.\n\n## Defined benefit pension schemes\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group's defined benefit pension schemes are exposed to significant risks from their assets and liabilities. The liability discount rate exposes the Group to interest rate risk and credit spread risk, which are partially offset by fixed interest assets (such as gilts and corporate bonds) and swaps. Equity and alternative asset risk arises from direct asset holdings. Scheme membership exposes the Group to longevity risk. Increases to pensions in deferment and in payment expose the Group to inflation risk.\n\nFor further information on defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities please refer to note 16 on page 244 .\n\n## Measurement\n\nManagement of the schemes' assets is the responsibility of the Trustees of the schemes who are responsible for setting the investment strategy and for agreeing funding requirements with the Group. The Group will be liable for meeting any funding deficit that may arise. As part of the triennial valuation process, the Group will agree with the Trustees a funding strategy to eliminate the deficit over an appropriate period.\n\nLongevity risk is measured using both 1-in-20 year stresses (risk appetite) and 1-in-200 year stresses (regulatory capital).\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group takes an active involvement in agreeing mitigation strategies with the schemes' Trustees. An interest rate and inflation hedging programme is in place to reduce liability risk. The schemes have also reduced equity allocation and invested the proceeds in credit assets. The Trustees have put in place longevity swaps to mitigate longevity risk. The merits of longevity risk transfer and hedging solutions are reviewed regularly.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nIn addition to the wider risk management framework, governance of the schemes includes a specialist pension committee.\n\nThe surplus, or deficit, in the schemes is tracked monthly along with various single factor and scenario stresses which consider the assets and liabilities holistically. Key metrics are monitored monthly including the Group's capital resources of the scheme, the performance against risk appetite triggers, and the performance of the hedged asset and liability matching positions.\n\n## Insurance business\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe main elements of market risk to which the Group is exposed through the Insurance business are equity, credit default spread, interest rate and inflation.\n\n- \u00b7 Equity risk arises indirectly through the value of future management charges on policyholder funds\n- \u00b7 Credit default spread risk mainly arises from annuities where policyholders' future cash flows are guaranteed at retirement. Exposure arises if the market value of the assets moves differently to the liabilities they back. This exposure arises from credit downgrades and defaults\n- \u00b7 Interest rate risk arises through credit and interest assets which are mainly held to cover the annuity and general insurance liabilities\n- \u00b7 Inflation exposure arises from inflation-linked policyholder benefits and future expenses",

Asset liability matching, hedging and unit matching are all used to reduce the sensitivity of equity movements.\n\nInterest rate risk in the annuity book is monitored and mitigated by investing in assets whose cash flows closely match those on the projected future liabilities. It is not possible to eliminate the risk completely as the timing of insured events is uncertain and bonds are not available for all required maturities.\n\nOther market risks (e.g. interest rate exposure outside the annuity book and inflation) are also closely monitored and where considered appropriate, hedges are put in place to reduce exposure.\n\nThe costs and benefits of market risk mitigation are considered in strategy and business planning decisions, with consideration given to the impacts to various metrics.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nMarket risks in the Insurance business are monitored by Insurance senior executive committees and ultimately the Insurance Board. Monitoring includes the progression of market risk capital against risk appetite limits, as well as the sensitivity of profit before tax to combined market risk stress scenarios and in-year market movements. Asset and liability matching positions and hedges in place are actively monitored and if necessary rebalanced to be within agreed tolerances. In addition, market risk is controlled via approved investment policies and mandates.\n\n## Trading portfolios\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group's trading activity is small relative to its peers. The Group's trading activity is undertaken primarily to meet the financial requirements of commercial and retail customers for foreign exchange, credit, interest rate and inflation products. These activities support customer flow and market making activities.\n\nAll trading activities are performed within the Commercial Banking division. While the trading positions taken are generally small, any extreme moves in the main risk factors and other related risk factors could cause significant losses in the trading book depending on the positions at the time. The average 95 per cent 1-day trading VaR (Value at Risk; diversified across risk factors) was \u00a32.3 million for 31 December 2023 compared to \u00a31.5 million for 31 December 2022.\n\nTrading market risk measures are applied to all of the Group's regulatory trading books and they include daily VaR (see trading portfolios: VaR table), sensitivity-based measures, and stress testing calculations.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group internally uses VaR as the primary risk measure for all trading book positions.\n\nThe trading portfolios: VaR table shows some relevant statistics for the Group's 1-day 95 per cent confidence level VaR that are based on 300 historical consecutive business days to year-end 2022 and year-end 2021.\n\nThe risk of loss measured by the VaR model is the loss in earnings which is not expected to be exceeded with 95 per cent confidence. The total and average trading VaR numbers reported below have been obtained after the application of the diversification benefits across the five risk types, but do not reflect any diversification between Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc and any other entities. The maximum and minimum VaR reported for each risk category did not necessarily occur on the same day as the maximum and minimum VaR reported at Group level.\n\n## Trading portfolios: VaR (1-day 95 per cent confidence level) (audited)\n\n|                                         | At 31 December 2023   | At 31 December 2023   | At 31 December 2023   | At 31 December 2023   | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                         | Close \u00a3m              | Average \u00a3m            | Maximum \u00a3m            | Minimum \u00a3m            | Close \u00a3m              | Average \u00a3m            | Maximum \u00a3m            | Minimum \u00a3m            |\n| Interest rate risk                      | 1.7                   | 2.0                   | 3.8                   | 1.0                   | 1.3                   | 1.4                   | 4.0                   | 0.5                   |\n| Foreign exchange risk                   | 0.1                   | 0.3                   | 0.9                   | 0.1                   | 0.2                   | 0.1                   | 0.4                   | -                     |\n| Equity risk                             | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     |\n| Credit spread risk                      | 0.2                   | 0.3                   | 0.5                   | 0.1                   | 0.1                   | 0.1                   | 0.3                   | -                     |\n| Inflation risk                          | 0.5                   | 0.5                   | 1.0                   | 0.2                   | 0.6                   | 0.4                   | 1.1                   | 0.2                   |\n| All risk factors before diversification | 2.5                   | 3.1                   | 5.1                   | 1.9                   | 2.2                   | 2.0                   | 5.1                   | 0.9                   |\n| Portfolio diversification               | (0.9)                 | (0.8)                 |                       |                       | (0.5)                 | (0.5)                 |                       |                       |\n| Total VaR                               | 1.6                   | 2.3                   | 4.1                   | 1.2                   | 1.7                   | 1.5                   | 4.0                   | 0.6                   |\n\nThe market risk for the trading book continues to be low relative to the size of the Group and in comparison to peers. This reflects the fact that the Group's trading operations are customer-centric and focused on hedging and recycling client risks.\n\nAlthough it is an important market standard measure of risk, VaR has limitations. One of them is the use of a limited historical data sample which influences the output by the implicit assumption that future market behaviour will not differ greatly from the historically observed period. Another known limitation is the use of defined holding periods which assumes that the risk can be liquidated or hedged within that holding period. Also calculating the VaR at the chosen confidence interval does not give enough information about potential losses which may occur if this level is exceeded. The Group fully recognises these limitations and supplements the use of VaR with a variety of other measurements which reflect the nature of the business activity. These include detailed sensitivity analysis, position reporting and a stress testing programme.\n\nTrading book VaR (1-day 99 per cent) is compared daily against both hypothetical and actual profit and loss. The 1-day 99 per cent VaR chart can be found in the Group's Pillar 3 disclosures.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe level of exposure is controlled by establishing and communicating the approved risk limits and controls through policies and procedures that define the responsibility and authority for risk taking. Market risk limits are clearly and consistently communicated to the business. Any new or emerging risks are brought within risk reporting and defined limits.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nTrading risk is monitored daily against 1-day 95 per cent VaR and stress testing limits. These limits are complemented with position level action triggers and profit and loss referrals. Risk and position limits are set and managed at both desk and overall trading book levels. They are reviewed at least annually and can be changed as required within the overall Group risk appetite framework.",

        "page_content": "## Model risk\n\n## Definition\n\nModel risk is defined as the risk of financial loss, regulatory censure, reputational damage or customer detriment, as a result of deficiencies in the development, application and ongoing operation of models and rating systems.\n\nModels are defined as quantitative methods that process input data into quantitative outputs, or qualitative outputs (including ordinal letter output) which have a quantitative measure associated with them. Model governance policy is restricted to specific categories of application of models, principally financial risk, treasury and valuation, with certain exclusions, such as prescribed calculations and project appraisal calculations.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group makes extensive use of models. They perform a variety of functions including:\n\n- \u00b7 Capital calculation\n- \u00b7 Credit decisioning, including fraud\n- \u00b7 Pricing models\n- \u00b7 Impairment calculation\n- \u00b7 Stress testing and forecasting\n- \u00b7 Market risk measurement\n\nAs a result of the wide scope and breadth of coverage, there is exposure to model risk across a number of the Group's principal risk categories.\n\nModel risk remained elevated in 2023, following the pandemic related government-led support schemes weakening the relationships between model inputs and outputs in 2022. The economy has steadied somewhat compared to 2022, now being more typical of the environment used to build the models, reducing need for judgemental overlays to account for this, but many of the effects of the pandemic and other stresses to the economy are still working their way through.\n\nThe control environment for model risk continues to be strengthened to meet revised internal and regulatory requirements. In addition, in common with the rest of the industry, changes required to capital models following new regulations have created a temporary increase in the risk relating to these models during the period of transition. Further information on capital impacts are detailed in the capital risk section on pages\n\n## 146 to 153 .\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Board risk appetite metric is the key component for measuring the Group's most material models; performance is reported monthly to the Group and Board Risk Committees.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe model risk management framework, established by and with continued oversight from an independent team in the Risk division, provides the foundation for managing and mitigating model risk within the Group. Accountability is cascaded from the Board and senior management via the Group enterprise risk management framework.\n\nThis provides the basis for the Group's model governance policy, which defines the mandatory requirements for models across the Group, including:\n\n- \u00b7 The scope of models covered by the policy\n- \u00b7 Model materiality\n- \u00b7 Roles and responsibilities, including ownership, independent oversight and approval\n- \u00b7 Key principles and controls regarding data integrity, development, validation, implementation, ongoing maintenance and revalidation, monitoring, and the process for non-compliance\n\nThe model owner takes responsibility for ensuring the fitness for purpose of the models and rating systems, supported and challenged by the independent specialist Group function.\n\nThe above ensures all models in scope of policy, including those involved in regulatory capital calculation, are developed consistently and are of sufficient quality to support business decisions and meet regulatory requirements.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe Group Model Governance Committee is the primary body for overseeing model risk. Policy requires that key performance indicators are monitored for every model to ensure they remain fit for purpose and all issues are escalated appropriately. Material model issues are reported to the Group and Board Risk Committees monthly, with more detailed papers as necessary to focus on key issues.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n## Operational risk\n\n## Definition\n\nOperational risk is defined as the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe principal operational risks to the Group which could result in customer detriment, unfair customer outcomes, financial loss, disruption and/or reputational damage include:\n\n- \u00b7 IT systems: including cyber-attacks, or the failure of IT systems due to volume of change and/or aged infrastructure\n- \u00b7 Fraud: including intentional acts of deception or omission by external or internal parties\n- \u00b7 Financial crime: including failures relating to anti-money laundering, anti-bribery, counter-terrorist financing and financial sanctions and prohibitions laws and regulations\n- \u00b7 Security: including the confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of the Group's assets (such as physical, data and information) being compromised\n- \u00b7 Business process: including failed transaction processing or process management\n\nA number of these risks could increase where there is a reliance on third party suppliers to provide services to the Group or its customers.\n\n## Measurement\n\nOperational risk is managed across the Group through an operational risk framework and policies. This framework includes a risk and control self-assessment process, risk impact likelihood matrix, risk and control indicators, risk appetite setting, a robust operational loss event management and escalation process, and a scenario analysis and operational loss forecasting process. This is supplemented by Group level and local management information and reporting across a suite of governed metrics.\n\nThe operational risk events by risk category table below shows high level loss and event trends for the Group using Basel II categories. Based on data captured on the Group's RCSA, in 2023 the highest frequency of events occurred in external fraud with 90.93 per cent of the total volume. Clients, products and business practices accounted for 52.19 per cent of losses by value.\n\nOperational risk losses and scenario analysis is used to inform the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). The Group calculates its minimum (Pillar I) operational risk capital requirements using The Standardised Approach (TSA). Pillar II is calculated using internal and external loss data and extreme but plausible scenarios that may occur in the next 12 months.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group continues to focus on risk management requirements and developing the processes, systems and people skills and capabilities needed to mitigate risks. Risks, including IT systems and security-related risks, are reported and discussed at local governance forums and escalated to executive management and the Board as appropriate to ensure the correct level of visibility and engagement. The Group employs a range of risk management strategies, including: avoidance, mitigation, transfer (including insurance) and acceptance within appetite or tolerance. Where there is a reliance on third party suppliers to provide services, including the areas of IT systems and information security, the Group's sourcing policy ensures that outsourcing initiatives follow a defined process including due diligence, risk evaluation and ongoing assurance.\n\nThe Board has overall oversight responsibility for the Group's IT systems and information security risk management and delegates this oversight to the Group Risk Committee (GRC). GRC is responsible for ensuring that management has processes in place designed to identify and evaluate IT systems and information security risks that the Group is exposed to and implementing processes and programmes to manage these risks and mitigate related incidents within appetite. GRC also reports material IT systems and information security risks to the Board via the Board Risk Committee. Management is responsible for identifying, considering and assessing material IT systems and information security risks on an ongoing basis, establishing processes to ensure that such potential risk exposures are monitored, putting in place appropriate mitigation measures and maintaining control improvement programmes.\n\nThe Group classifies the potential IT systems and information security risk of its suppliers based on the nature and criticality of the information accessed or processed. These assessments are completed at initial service onboarding and periodically throughout the supplier lifecycle. These assessments drive the level of ongoing supplier governance, assurance and monitoring. The Group provides training and other resources to its suppliers to support IT systems and information security resiliency in its supply chain. The Group also requires its suppliers to comply with its standard information security terms and conditions as a condition of doing business with it. Suppliers are required to provide management information to review and assess any potential information security related risks depending on the nature of the services being provided.\n\n## Operational risk events by risk category (losses greater than or equal to \u00a310,000) 1\n\n|                                            |   % of total volume |   % of total volume |   % of total losses |   % of total losses |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                            |             2023    |             2022    |             2023    |             2022    |\n| Business disruption and system failures    |                0.31 |                0.37 |                0.6  |                0.41 |\n| Clients, products and business practices   |                1.23 |                4.95 |               52.19 |               73.43 |\n| Damage to physical assets                  |                0.07 |                0.15 |                0.09 |                0.03 |\n| Employee practices and workplace safety    |                0.31 |                0.48 |                0.43 |                0.09 |\n| Execution, delivery and process management |                6.91 |                9.19 |               21.43 |               15.17 |\n| External fraud                             |               90.93 |               84.6  |               25.23 |               10.82 |\n| Internal fraud                             |                0.24 |                0.26 |                0.03 |                0.05 |\n| Total                                      |              100    |              100    |              100    |              100    |",

        "page_content": "Mitigating actions to the principal operational risks include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group has set out key controls, aligned to the Group's risk appetite, via its policies, procedures and enterprise risk management framework, ensuring businesses assess the potential impacts of activity on customers, markets, colleagues and business risk profiles\n- \u00b7 The Group adopts a risk-based approach to mitigate the internal and external fraud risks it faces, reflecting the current and emerging fraud risks within the market. Fraud risk appetite metrics holistically cover the impacts of fraud in terms of losses to the Group, costs of fraud systems and operations, and customer experience of actual and attempted fraud. Oversight of the appropriateness and performance of these metrics is undertaken regularly through business area and Group-level committees. This approach drives a continual programme of prioritised enhancements to the Group's technology and process and people-related controls; with an emphasis on preventative controls supported by real time detective controls wherever feasible. Group-wide policies and operational control frameworks are maintained and designed to provide customer confidence, protect the Group's commercial interests and reputation, comply with legal requirements and meet regulatory requirements. The Group's fraud awareness programme remains a key component of its fraud control environment, and awareness of fraud risk is supported by mandatory training for all colleagues. This is further strengthened by material annual investment into both technology and the personal development needs of colleagues. The Group also plays an active role with other financial institutions, industry bodies and law enforcement agencies in identifying and combatting fraud\n- \u00b7 The Group adopts a risk-based approach to mitigate cyber threats it faces. The effective operation of the Group's estate is supported by an IT and Cyber Security Governance framework, guided by a threat-based strategy which underpins investment decisions. The ongoing protection of the estate and confidentiality of material information is ensured through adherence to the Group Security Policy which has been aligned to industry good practice including the NIST Cyber Security Framework; and material laws and regulations. The Group's IT systems and information security risk management processes, which includes assessment, documentation and treatment have been integrated into its overall enterprise risk management framework. The Group engages a specialist third party consultancy on a periodic basis, to assess the maturity of its cyber security programme, in assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. During the handling of an incident, the Cyber Security team will continuously monitor and assess the impact to the Group. Thresholds have been set that, once triggered, will bring the information security risk owning business representatives, legal and compliance teams together as a subcommittee. The subcommittee will own the invocation of crisis management, Board notification and the drafting of any regulatory notifications. In the event of a major information security incident, including those with a material impact on the Group, the Chief Security Officer (CSO) maintains engagement with the executive, supported by the Group incident management teams\n- \u00b7 The Group has adopted policies and procedures designed to detect and prevent the use of its banking network for money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery, tax evasion, human trafficking, modern-day slavery and wildlife trafficking, and activities prohibited by legal and regulatory sanctions. Against a background of complex and detailed laws and regulations, and of continued criminal and terrorist activity, the Group regularly reviews and assesses its policies, procedures and organisational arrangements to keep them current, effective and consistent across markets and jurisdictions\n- \u00b7 The Group requires mandatory training on these topics for all employees. Specifically, the anti-money laundering procedures include 'know-your-customer' requirements, transaction monitoring technologies, reporting of suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing to the applicable regulatory authorities, and interaction between the Group's Integrated Intelligence and Investigations team and external agencies and other financial institutions. The Group economic crime prevention policy prohibits the payment, offer, acceptance or request of a bribe, including 'facilitation payments' by any employee or agent and provides a confidential reporting service for anonymous reporting of suspected or actual bribery activity. The Group economic crime prevention policy also sets out a framework of controls for compliance with legal and regulatory sanctions\n- \u00b7 In addition to its efforts internally, the Group also contributes to economic crime prevention by supporting and championing industry-level activity, including:\n- - Representing large retail banks at the National Economic Crime Centre (NECC) led Public Private Operating Board (PPOB); co-chairing the Public Private Threat Group leading the UK's response to money laundering; chairing the Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (JMLIT) senior management team and providing expert resource to the NECC's operational threat cells\n- - Collaborating with peer bank to take forward the second phase of data fusion (large-scale information sharing and analysis) with the National Crime Agency (NCA)\n- - Holding bilateral discussions with the Home Office on using suspected criminal funds to fund economic crime initiatives, in advance of the provisions being included in the Criminal Justice Bill\n- - In conjunction with UK Finance and peer banks, developing a pilot to use the newly acquired information sharing provisions contained within the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act\n- - Being an active member of UK Finance where the Group has representation on every economic crime committee and panel. This includes attending the Sanctions and Fraud Committees, which are the industries' primary forums for considering and responding to issues of mutual interest\n- - Helping fund the Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit to investigate fraud cases, target and where appropriate arrest and gain prosecution of offenders\n- - Being a member of Cifas, the largest cross-sector fraud sharing organisation, where the Group shares and receives internal and first party fraud data to detect, deter and prevent criminals exploiting our banking facilities\n- - Engagement with Europol and International Law Enforcement to share fraud and financial crime intelligence\n- - In partnership with the City of London Police, a pilot scheme was launched to use the proceeds of crime to fund fraudfighting and victim support programmes: Cyber Detectives: a primary school education programme on fraud and cyber protection and Crooks on Campus: a fraud education programme on money mules which brings to life the reality of organised financial crime for university students\n- - The Group is an active supporter of Stop Scams UK. Working in partnership with other banks, telecoms and technology companies, the telephone hotline number - 159 - has been rolled out across the UK with excellent results\n\nOperational resilience risk, on page 194 , provides further information on the mitigating actions for cyber and IT resilience.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n## Monitoring\n\nMonitoring and reporting of operational risk is undertaken at Board, Group, legal entity and business unit and functional committees. Each committee monitors key risks, control effectiveness, indicators, events, operational losses, risk appetite metrics and the results of independent testing conducted by Risk division and/or Group Internal Audit. Additionally, the Group's IT and information security processes are validated and audited by internal experts within the Risk function and Group Internal Audit.\n\nThe Group maintains a formal approach to operational risk event escalation, whereby events are identified, captured and escalated, where appropriate based on materiality. Root causes of events are determined, and action plans put in place to ensure an optimum level of control to keep customers and the business safe, reduce costs, and improve efficiency.\n\nThe insurance policies are monitored and reviewed regularly, with recommendations being made to the Group's senior management annually prior to each renewal. Insurers are monitored on an ongoing basis, to ensure counterparty risk is minimised. A process is in place to manage any insurer rating changes or insolvencies.\n\n## Operational resilience risk Definition\n\nOperational resilience risk is defined as the risk that the Group fails to design resilience into business operations including those that are outsourced, underlying infrastructure and controls (people, property, process, technology) so that it is able to withstand external or internal events which could impact the continuation of operations, and fails to respond in a way which meets customer and stakeholder expectations and needs when the continuity of operations is compromised.\n\n## Exposures\n\nIneffective operational resilience risk management could lead to important services not being available to customers, and in extreme circumstances, bank failure could result. The Group has in place a transparent and effective operating model to identify, monitor and test important business services and critical business processes from a customer, Group and systemic perspective. The failure to adequately build resilience into an important business service or critical business process may occur in a variety of ways, including:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group being overly reliant on one location to deliver a critical business process\n- \u00b7 The Group not having an adequate succession plan in place for designated subject matter experts\n- \u00b7 The Group being overly reliant on a supplier which fails to provide a service\n- \u00b7 A shortcoming in the Group's ability to respond and/or recover in a timely manner following a cyber incident\n- \u00b7 The Group failing to upgrade its IT systems and leaving them vulnerable to failure\n\nEffective operational resilience ensures the Group designs resilience into its systems, is able to withstand and/or recover from a significant unexpected event occurring and can continue to provide services to its customers. A significant outage could result in customers being unable to access accounts or conduct transactions, which as well as presenting significant reputational risk for the Group would negatively impact the Group's purpose. Operational resilience is also an area of continued regulatory and industry focus, similar in importance to financial resilience.\n\nFailure to manage operational resilience effectively could impact the following other risk categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Regulatory compliance: non-compliance with new/existing operational resilience regulations, for example, through failure to identify emerging regulation or not embedding regulatory requirements within the Group's policies, processes and procedures or identify further future emerging regulation\n- \u00b7 Operational risk: being unable to safely provide customers with business services\n- \u00b7 Conduct risk: an operational resilience failure may render the Group liable to fines from the FCA for poor conduct\n- \u00b7 Market risk: the Group being unable to provide key services could have ramifications for the wider market and could impact share price\n\n## Measurement\n\nOperational resilience risk is managed across the Group through the Group's enterprise risk management framework and operational risk policy and associated standards. Board risk appetite metrics for operational resilience are in place and are well understood. These specific measures are subject to ongoing monitoring and reporting, including a mandatory review of metrics and thresholds on at least an annual basis. To strengthen the management of operational resilience risk, the Group mobilised an operational resilience enhancement programme which is designed to focus on end-to-end resilience and the management of key risks to important processes.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group has increased its focus on operational resilience and has updated its operational resilience strategy to reflect changing priorities of both customers and regulators. Furthermore, the Group is in the process of responding to the publication of regulatory policy statements. Focus has been given to ensure compliance, and existing frameworks have been adapted to consider important business services and impact tolerances. At the core of its approach to operational resilience are the Group's important business services and critical business processes which drive activity, including scenario testing to identify and drive remediation of vulnerabilities that could impact delivery of an important business service. The Group continues to maintain and develop playbooks that guide its response to a range of interruptions from internal and external threats and tests these through scenario-based testing and exercising.\n\nThe Group's strategy considers the evolving risk management requirements, adapting the change delivery model to be more agile and develop the people skills and capabilities needed. The Group continues to review and invest in its control environment to ensure it addresses the risks it faces. Risks are reported and discussed at local governance forums and escalated to executive management and the Board as appropriate. The Group employs a range of risk management strategies, including: avoidance, mitigation, transfer (including insurance) and acceptance. Where there is a reliance on third party suppliers to provide services, the Group's sourcing policy ensures that outsourcing initiatives follow a defined process including due diligence, risk evaluation and ongoing assurance.\n\nMitigating actions to the principal operational resilience risk are:\n\nCyber: Whilst the Group did not identify any cyber threats that materially affected its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition in 2023, the Group remains exposed to the risk of cyber threats and future interruptions that could potentially disrupt business operations and materially adversely affect the Group's performance. The Board continues to invest heavily to protect the Group from cyber-attacks. Investment continues to focus on improving the Group's approach to identity and access management, data loss prevention, improving capability to detect, respond and recover from cyber-attacks and improved ability to manage vulnerabilities across the estate.",

        "page_content": "To deal with cybersecurity threats, the Group has a dedicated Cyber Security function led by a certified CSO with over 12 years of experience in this field. The CSO actively participates in Audit Committee and Board meetings and is responsible for offering updates on information security risks and mitigation strategies to the Board and its subcommittees. GRC is responsible for the oversight of all risk policies, including the IT system and information security policy and commissions regular reviews and compliance updates to this policy. Additionally, the CSO chairs a subcommittee comprised of stakeholders including, but not limited to security representatives, risk management, compliance and Group Internal Audit. This subcommittee is focused on information security, to review major policy changes, strategies and key risk mitigations to enhance the governance of the information security strategies and policies.\n\nIT resilience: the Group continues to optimise its approach to IT and operational resilience by investing in technology improvements and enhancing the resilience of systems that support the Group's critical business processes and important business services, primarily through a portfolio of Technology Resilience and Security Change programmes. The Board optimises the role that resilient technology plays in maintaining banking services across the wider industry. As such, the Board dedicates considerable time and focus to this subject at both the Board and the Board Risk Committee, and continues to sponsor key investment programmes that enhance resilience.\n\nPeople: the Group acknowledges the risks associated to the failure to maintain appropriately skilled and available colleagues. The Group continues to optimise its approach to ensure that, for example, the right number of colleagues are capable of supporting critical technology components. Key controls and processes are regularly reported to committee(s) and alignment with the Group's strategy is closely monitored.\n\nProperty: the Group's property portfolio remains a key focus in ensuring targeted resilience requirements are appropriately maintained, including energy resilience. Processes are in place to identify key buildings where an important business service or critical business process is performed. Depending on criticality, a number of mitigating controls are in place to manage the risk of severe critical business process disruption. The Group remains committed to investment in the upkeep of the property portfolio, primarily through the Group property upkeep investment programme.\n\nSourcing: the threat landscape associated with third party suppliers and the critical services they provide continues to receive a significant amount of regulatory attention. The Group acknowledges the importance of demonstrating control and responsibility for those important business services and critical business processes which could cause significant harm to the Group's customers. The Group segments its suppliers by criticality and has processes in place to support ongoing supplier management.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nMonitoring and reporting of operational resilience risk is undertaken at Board, Group, entity and divisional committees. Each committee monitors key risks, control effectiveness, key risk and control indicators, events, operational losses, risk appetite metrics and the results of independent testing conducted by Risk division and/or Group Internal Audit.\n\nThe Group maintains a formal approach to operational resilience risk event escalation, whereby material events are identified, captured and escalated. Root causes are determined, and action plans put in place to ensure an optimum level of control to keep customers and the business safe, reduce costs, and improve efficiency.\n\n## People risk\n\n## Definition\n\nPeople risk is defined as the risk that the Group fails to provide an appropriate colleague and customer-centric culture, supported by robust reward and wellbeing policies and processes; effective leadership to manage colleague resources; effective talent and succession management; and robust control to ensure all colleague-related requirements are met.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group's management of material people risks is critical to its capacity to deliver against its strategic objectives, particularly in the context of organisational, political and external market change and increasing digitisation. The Group is exposed to the following key people risks:\n\n- \u00b7 Failure to recruit, develop and retain a diverse workforce, with the appropriate mix and required level of skills and capabilities to meet the current and future needs of the Group\n- \u00b7 Non-inclusive culture, ineffective leadership, poor communication, weak performance, inappropriate remuneration policies and poor colleague conduct\n- \u00b7 Ineffective management of succession planning or failure to identify appropriate talent pipeline\n- \u00b7 Failure to manage capacity, colleagues having excessive demands placed on them resulting in wellbeing issues and business objectives not being met\n- \u00b7 Failure to meet all colleague-related legal and regulatory requirements\n- \u00b7 Inadequately designed people processes that are not resilient to withstand unexpected events\n- \u00b7 The increasing digitisation of the business is changing the capability mix required and may impact the Group's ability to attract and retain talent\n- \u00b7 Colleague engagement and sentiment may be challenged by a number of factors including changes to ways of working, dissatisfaction with the colleague proposition, cost of living pressures, and purpose of the business including changes to culture and ethical considerations\n\n## Measurement\n\nPeople risk is measured through a series of quantitative and qualitative indicators, aligned to key sources of people risk for the Group such as succession, diversity, retention, colleague engagement and wellbeing. In addition to risk appetite measures and limits, people risks and controls are monitored on a monthly basis via the Group's risk governance framework and reporting structures.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group takes many mitigating actions with respect to people risk. Key areas of focus include:\n\n- \u00b7 Focusing on leadership and colleague engagement, through delivery of strategies to attract, retain and develop high calibre people together with a focus on creating a strong and resilient talent pipeline\n- \u00b7 Continued focus on the Group's culture and inclusivity strategy by developing and delivering initiatives that reinforce the appropriate behaviours which generate the best possible long-term outcomes for customers and colleagues\n- \u00b7 Managing organisational capability and capacity through divisional people strategies to ensure there are the right skills and resources to meet customers' needs and deliver the Group's strategic plan\n- \u00b7 Maintaining an attractive colleague proposition to promote an appropriate culture and colleague behaviours that meet customer needs and regulatory expectations\n- \u00b7 Ensuring colleague wellbeing strategies and support are in place to meet colleague needs, alongside skills and capability growth required to maximise the potential of our people\n- \u00b7 Ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, embedding compliant and appropriate colleague behaviours in line with Group policies, values and its people risk priorities\n- \u00b7 Ongoing consultation with the Group's recognised unions on changes which impact their members\n- \u00b7 Reviewing and enhancing people processes to ensure they are fit for purpose and operationally resilient",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n## Monitoring\n\nPeople risk appetite metrics and business risk indicators are reported at the People and Places Group and Business Risk Committee, Group and Ring-fenced Bank Risk Committee and Board Risk Committee, on a regular basis.\n\nAll material people risk events are escalated in accordance with the Group's operational risk policy.\n\n## Regulatory and legal risk Definition\n\nRegulatory and legal risk is defined as the risk of financial penalties, regulatory censure, criminal or civil enforcement action or customer detriment as a result of failure to identify, assess, correctly interpret, comply with, or manage regulatory and/or legal requirements.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group has a zero risk appetite for material legal or regulatory breaches. The Group remains exposed to the evolving legal and regulatory landscape, such as changes to the regulatory framework, changing regulatory and other standards as well as uncertainty arising from the current and future litigation landscape.\n\n## Measurement\n\nRegulatory and legal risks are measured against a defined risk appetite metric, which is an assessment of material regulatory breaches and material legal incidents.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group undertakes a range of key mitigating actions to manage regulatory and legal risk. These include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The Board has established a Group-wide risk appetite and metric for regulatory and legal risk\n- \u00b7 Group policies and procedures set out the principles that should apply across the business which are aligned to the Group risk appetite. Mandated policies and processes require appropriate control frameworks, management information, standards and colleague training to be implemented to identify and manage regulatory and legal risk\n- \u00b7 Business units identify, assess and implement policy and regulatory requirements and establish local controls, processes, procedures and resources to ensure appropriate governance and compliance\n- \u00b7 Business units regularly produce management information to assist in the identification of issues and test management controls are working effectively\n- \u00b7 The Legal function provides legal advice and together, the Risk and Legal functions provide oversight, proactive support and constructive challenge to the business in identifying and managing regulatory and legal issues\n- \u00b7 Risk division conducts thematic reviews to provide oversight of regulatory compliance\n- \u00b7 Horizon scanning is conducted to identify and address changes in regulatory and legal requirements\n- \u00b7 The Group engages with regulatory authorities and industry bodies on forthcoming regulatory changes, market reviews and investigations, ensuring programmes are established to deliver new regulation and legislation\n- \u00b7 The Group has adapted quickly to evolving regulatory expectations due to cost of living pressures and continues to engage with regulatory authorities\n\n## Monitoring\n\nMaterial risks are managed through the relevant business committees, with review and escalation through Group-level committees where appropriate, including the escalation of any material regulatory breaches or material legal incidents.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\n## Definition\n\nStrategic risk is defined as the risk which results from:\n\n- \u00b7 Incorrect assumptions about internal or external operating environments\n- \u00b7 Failure to understand the potential impact of strategic responses and business plans on existing risk types\n- \u00b7 Failure to respond or the inappropriate strategic response to material changes in the external or internal operating environments\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group faces significant risks due to the evolving external environment, changing regulatory and competitive environments in the financial services sector, with increased pace, scale and complexity of change. Customer, shareholder and employee expectations continue to evolve, together with societal trends and cost of living pressures.\n\nSimilar to emerging risks, strategic risks can manifest themselves in existing principal risks or as new exposures which could adversely impact the Group and its businesses. In considering strategic risks, a key focus is the interconnectivity of individual risks and the cumulative effect of different risks on the Group's overall risk profile.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group assesses and monitors strategic risk implications as part of business planning and in its day-to-day activities, ensuring it responds appropriately to internal and external factors including changes to regulatory, macroeconomic and competitive environments. An assessment is made of the key strategic risks that are considered to impact the Group, leveraging internal and external information and the key mitigants or actions that could be taken in response.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe range of mitigating actions includes the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Horizon scanning is conducted across the Group to identify potential threats, risks, emerging issues and opportunities and to explore future trends\n- \u00b7 The Group's business planning processes include an assessment of the strategic risk implications of new business, product entries and other strategic initiatives\n- \u00b7 The Group's governance framework mandates individuals' and committees' responsibilities and decision making rights, to ensure that strategic risks are appropriately reported and escalated\n\n## Monitoring\n\nA review of the Group's strategic risks is undertaken on at least an annual basis and the findings are reported to the Group and Board Risk Committees. During 2023, the process and analysis for strategic risks and emerging risks has highlighted the alignment and overlap between these risks. As a result, from 2024 onwards, we will iterate our reporting further and combine both into horizon and emerging risks. Further information on emerging risks can be found on pages 44 and 144 .",

Opinion\n\nIn our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 the financial statements of Lloyds Banking Group plc (the \u03dfParent company\u03e0) and its subsidiaries (the \u03dfGroup\u03e0 or \u03dfLBG\u03e0) give a true and fair view of the state of the Group\u03e0s and of the Parent company\u03e0s affairs as at 31 December 2023 and of the Group\u03e0s profit for the year then ended;\n- \u00b7 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB);\n- \u00b7 the Parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and\n- \u00b7 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nWe have audited the financial statements which comprise the:\n\n## Group\n\n## Parent company\n\n- \u00b7 Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2023;\n- \u00b7 Consolidated income statement for the year then ended;\n- \u00b7 Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;\n- \u00b7 Consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;\n- \u00b7 Consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended;\n- \u00b7 Notes 1 to 55 to the financial statements, which include the accounting principles and policies;\n- \u00b7 Directors\u03e0 remuneration report identified as \u03dfaudited\u03e0; and;\n- \u00b7 Risk management section identified as \u03dfaudited\u03e0.\n\nThe financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards, and as regards the Parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## 2. Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditors\u03e0 responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of the Group and the Parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council\u03e0s (the \u03dfFRC\u03e0s\u03e0) Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The non-audit services provided to the Group and Parent company for the year are disclosed in note 17 to the financial statements. We confirm that we have not provided any non-audit services prohibited by the FRC\u03e0s Ethical Standard to the Group or the Parent company.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## 3.

        "page_content": "## Our audit approach\n\nWe structured our approach to the audit to reflect how the Group is organised as well as ensuring it was both effective and risk focused. It can be summarised into the following key activities through which we obtained sufficient audit evidence required to form our opinion on the Group and Parent company financial statements:\n\n## \u00b7 Audit planning and risk assessment\n\nOur audit team has been structured in line with the Group's three main operating divisions; Retail, Commercial Banking and Insurance, Pensions and Investments. Our audit planning procedures considered the impact of internal and external factors affecting the Group's profitability and operations, key audit matters most relevant to the users of the financial statements, the appropriate scope of audit work performed as well as the expectations and requirements of the Group's investors and regulators.\n\nIn performing our audit risk assessments, we considered the impact of macroeconomic factors on the Group's key accounting judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty. The key factors considered in our risk assessments were:\n\n- \u00b7 the impact of high interest rates, high inflation and cost of living pressures on the Group\u03e0s ECL and valuation of certain illiquid and complex financial instruments;\n- \u00b7 the impact of the first time adoption of IFRS 17 on the Group\u03e0s Insurance business; and\n- \u00b7 changes to the regulatory and litigation environment affecting the Group\u03e0s financial reporting.\n\nWe obtained the knowledge and information required to inform our audit planning and risk assessment decision making through regular meetings with Group and Divisional Finance and the extensive use of data and technology;\n\n## \u00b7 Execution of audit work\n\nOur audit is comprised of two distinct component audit teams covering the Group's three operating segments, which are:\n\n- - The UK Banking component auditing the Group's Retail and Commercial Banking operating segments; and\n- - The Insurance component auditing the Group's Insurance, Pensions and Investments operations.\n\nThe group audit team met regularly and was in active dialogue with each component audit team throughout the audit to ensure appropriate oversight over audit activities performed within each audit component. Oversight activities included determining whether the planned work was performed in accordance with the overall Group audit strategy and in line with the Group audit instructions provided to the components. We were able to satisfy ourselves that our oversight and supervision was appropriate through in-person meetings, videoconferencing, direct reviews of work as well as through attending planning and clearance meetings with divisional management;\n\n## \u00b7 Audit procedures undertaken at both Group and Parent company level\n\nWe performed audit procedures over the Group and Parent company financial statements including the consolidation of the Group\u03e0s results, the preparation of the financial statements, certain disclosures within the directors\u03e0 remuneration report, litigation provisions and exposures, as well as the Group\u03e0s entity level and oversight controls relevant to financial reporting. Entities not covered by our audit scope are subject to analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement in the aggregated financial information;\n\n## \u00b7 Internal controls testing approach\n\nOur internal controls testing approach was informed by our scoping and risk assessment activities. We have assessed the Group's end-to-end financial reporting processes supporting all in-scope financial statement balances and identified relevant controls to test for these balances. This included the testing of general IT controls, process level controls and entity level controls at the Group level; and\n\n## \u00b7 The impact of climate change on our audit\n\nIn planning our audit, we have considered the impact of climate change on the Group's operations and any subsequent impact on its financial statements. The Group sets out its assessment of the potential impact on page 154 of the Risk Management section of the Annual Report.\n\nIn conjunction with our climate risk specialists, we have held discussions with the Group to understand their:\n\n- \u00b7 process for identifying affected operations including the governance and controls over this process, and the subsequent effect on the financial reporting for the Group; and\n- \u00b7 long-term strategy to respond to climate change risks and how this is factored into the Group's forecasts, considering publicly announced climate change commitments and any costs associated with the Group's net zero targets.\n\n## Our audit work has involved:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating climate as a factor in risk assessments for potentially affected balances;\n- \u00b7 challenging the completeness of the physical and transition risks identified and considered in the Group\u03e0s climate risk assessment and the conclusion that there continues to be no material impact of climate change risk on financial reporting;\n- \u00b7 reviewing the Group's qualitative loan portfolio analysis, and challenging the key assumptions used by the Group with reference to our own understanding of the portfolios and publicly available documentation; and\n- \u00b7 assessing disclosures in the Annual Report and challenging the consistency between the financial statements and the remainder of the Annual Report.\n\nWe have not identified any material inconsistencies or issues as a result of these procedures.\n\nThe Group\u03e0s progress on their Environmental, Social and Governance (\u03dfESG\u03e0) targets in not included within the scope of this audit.",

Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit, and directing the efforts of the engagement team.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Expected credit losses (Group)\n\nKey audit matter description\n\n## How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter\n\n## Refer to notes 2, 18, 23, 24 and 52 in the financial statements\n\nThe Group has recognised \u00a34.1 billion of expected credit losses (\u03e2ECL\u03e3) as at 31 December 2023. The determination of ECL consists of a number of assumptions that are inherently uncertain and require a high degree of complex and subjective auditor judgement, specialised skills and knowledge, and complex impairment modelling and a high degree of estimation uncertainty. Specifically, the impact of high interest rates and inflation, as well as the economic impact of the rising cost of living on the ECL have been particularly judgemental in the current economic environment.\n\nThe key areas we identified as having the most significant level of management judgement were in respect of:\n\n- \u00b7 Multiple economic scenarios (\u03dfMES\u03e0);\n- \u00b7 Collectively assessed ECL;\n- \u00b7 Individually assessed ECL; and\n- \u00b7 ECL model adjustments.\n\n## Multiple economic scenarios\n\nThe measurement of expected credit losses is required to reflect an unbiased probability-weighted range of possible future outcomes.\n\nThe Group's economics team develops the future economic scenarios. Firstly, a base case forecast is produced based on a set of conditioning assumptions, which are designed to reflect the Group's best view of future events. A full distribution of economic scenarios around this base case is produced using a Monte Carlo simulation and scenarios within that distribution are ranked using estimated relationships with industrywide historical loss data.\n\nIn addition to the base case, three scenarios are derived from the distribution as averages of constituent modelled scenarios around the 15th, 75th and 95th percentiles of the distribution corresponding to an upside, a downside and a severe downside, respectively. The severe downside is then adjusted to incorporate non-modelled paths for inflation and interest rate assumptions. The upside, the base case and the downside scenarios are weighted at 30 per cent and the severe downside at 10 per cent.\n\nThese four scenarios are then used as key assumptions in the determination of the ECL allowance.\n\nThe development of these multiple economic scenarios is inherently uncertain, highly complex, and requires significant judgement.\n\nThe principal consideration for our determination that the multiple economic scenarios is a key audit matter was the high degree of management judgement which required specialised auditor knowledge and a high degree of audit effort in areas such as evaluating the forward-looking information used by management, and the weighting applied.\n\nThis key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee's report on page 98 .\n\nWe performed the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Tested the controls over the generation of the multiple economic scenarios including those over the Group's governance processes to determine the base case, different scenarios and the weightings applied to each scenario;\n- \u00b7 Working with our internal economic specialists:\n- - Challenged and evaluated economic forecasts in the base scenario such as the unemployment rate, House Price Index, inflation and forecasted interest rates, and Gross Domestic Product through comparison to independent economic outlooks, other external analyses and market data;\n- - Challenged and evaluated the appropriateness of management's change in both assumptions and the model;\n- - Challenged and evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology applied to generate alternative macroeconomic scenarios, including associated weightings and assumptions within; and\n- - Independently replicated the multiple economic scenario model and compared the outputs of our independent model to the Group's output to test scenario generation;\n- \u00b7 Tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used by the model;\n- \u00b7 Performed a stand back assessment of the appropriateness of the weightings applied to each of the scenarios based on publicly available data; and\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the appropriateness of disclosures in respect of significant judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty including macroeconomic scenarios.",

These models use a number of significant judgements to calculate a probability weighted estimate by applying a probability of default, exposure at default and a loss given default, taking account of collateral held or other loss mitigants, discounted using the effective interest rate.\n\nThe key judgements and estimates in determining the ECL include:\n\n- \u00b7 modelling approach, modelling simplifications and judgements, and selection of modelling data;\n- \u00b7 behavioural lives for the Retail division;\n- \u00b7 credit risk ratings for the Commercial Banking division, which are performed on a counterparty basis for larger exposures by a credit officer; and\n- \u00b7 the appropriate allocation of assets into the correct staging taking into account any significant deterioration in credit risk since inception of the loan.\n\nThis key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee's report on page 98 .\n\n## Individually assessed ECL\n\nFor individual provision assessments of larger exposures in stage 3 in the Commercial Banking division, complex and subjective auditor judgement including specialised knowledge is required in evaluating the methodology, models and inputs that are inherently uncertain. The significant judgements in determining provisions are the:\n\n- \u00b7 completeness and appropriateness of the potential workout scenarios identified;\n- \u00b7 probability of default assigned to each identified potential workout scenarios; and\n- \u00b7 valuation assumptions used in determining the expected recovery strategies.\n\nThis key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee's report on page 98 .\n\nWe tested controls across the process to determine the ECL provisions including:\n\n- \u00b7 Model governance including model validation and monitoring;\n- \u00b7 Model assumptions;\n- \u00b7 The allocation of assets into stages, including those to determine the Credit Risk Rating in the Commercial Banking division; and\n- \u00b7 Data accuracy and completeness.\n\nWorking with our internal modelling specialists, our audit procedures over the key areas of estimation covered the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Model estimations, where we:\n- -Evaluated the appropriateness of the modelling approach and assumptions used;\n- - Independently replicated the models for all material portfolios and compared the outputs of our independent models to the Group's outputs;\n- - Assessed model performance by evaluating variations between observed data and model predictions;\n- - Developed an understanding and assessed model limitations and remedial actions; and\n- - Tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used in model execution and calibration.\n- \u00b7 Allocation of assets into stages, where we:\n- -Evaluated the appropriateness of quantitative and qualitative criteria used for allocation into IFRS 9 stages, including independently assessing the credit rating of loans in the commercial banking division;\n- - Tested the appropriateness of the stage allocation for a sample of exposures; and\n- - Tested the data used by models in assigning IFRS 9 stages and evaluated the appropriateness of the model logic used.\n- \u00b7 For expected credit losses assessed individually we have:\n- - Selected senior team members with extensive IFRS 9 knowledge and expertise to design and lead the execution of ECL recognised in respect of these exposures;\n- - Tested the controls over the determination of individually assessed exposures including assumptions and inputs into workout and recovery scenarios, as well as valuation assumptions used; and\n- -Evaluated the appropriateness of workout and recovery scenarios including associated cash flows and consideration of climate risk.",

The current economic environment, characterised by elevated cost of living pressures on borrowers and high inflation, has increased the uncertainty of credit losses. As a result, the amount and timing of adjustments recognised in the model to account for the impacts of the current economic environment are highly judgemental and inherently uncertain. These adjustments require specialist auditor judgement when evaluating the:\n\n- \u00b7 completeness of adjustments; and\n- \u00b7 methodology, models and inputs used in determining the relevant adjustments.\n\nWhere impairment models do not incorporate all factors relevant to estimating the ECL, adjustments are made to address known model limitations and data limitations, emerging or nonmodelled risks and the impact of economic uncertainty on different industry sectors. The measurement of judgements around model adjustments to evaluate the completeness of adjustments, methodology and model inputs for these adjustments is highly judgemental and inherently uncertain.\n\nThis key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee's report on page 98 .\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\nWe are satisfied that the ECL provisions are reasonable and recognised in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. Appropriate methodologies using reasonable modelled assumptions were used in the calculations of the multiple economic scenarios, collectively assessed and in-model adjustments and post-model adjustments where they address model shortcomings.

The Group is currently exposed to a number of regulatory and litigation matters. The Group's provision for these matters is \u00a31.1 billion as at 31 December 2023. In the current year, the Group recognised a provision of \u00a3450 million relating to motor finance commission arrangements.\n\nSignificant judgement is required by the Group in determining whether, under IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets':\n\n- \u00b7 the amount recorded is representative of the Group's best estimate to settle the obligation based on the information available to the Group, including in respect of motor finance commission arrangements where there is significant uncertainty around the final outcome of the on-going review by the FCA; and\n- \u00b7 any contingent liabilities and underlying significant estimation uncertainties are adequately disclosed.\n\nThis key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee's report on page 99 .\n\n## How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter\n\nWe performed the following audit procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Tested the Group's controls over the completeness of provisions, the review of the assessment of the provision against the requirements of IAS 37, the review of the appropriateness of judgements used to determine a 'best estimate' and the completeness and accuracy of data used in the process;\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the assessment of the provisions, associated probabilities, and potential outcomes in accordance with IAS 37;\n- \u00b7 In respect of motor finance commission arrangements, we inspected information available for the historical complaints, both supportive and contradictory, and the limited number of decisions made by the Financial Ombudsman Service. We tested the methodology and assumptions applied to determine the provision;\n- \u00b7 Verified and evaluated whether the methodology, data and significant judgements and assumptions used in the valuation of the provisions are appropriate in the context of the applicable financial reporting framework;Inspected correspondence and, where appropriate, made direct inquiry with the Group's regulators and internal and external legal counsel;\n- \u00b7 Where no provision was made, we critically evaluated the conclusion in the context of the requirements of IAS 37; and\n\n\u00b7\n\nEvaluated whether the disclosures made in the financial\n\nstatements appropriately reflect the facts and key sources of\n\nestimation uncertainty, including in respect of motor finance\n\ncommission arrangements.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\nWhile there is significant judgement required in estimating the timing and value of future settlements, we are satisfied that the approach to the recognition, estimation and disclosures of these provisions and contingent liabilities is consistent with the requirements of IFRS.\n\n- \u00b7 In respect of the adjustment to models, we performed the following procedures in conjunction with our specialists:\n- - Tested the controls over the valuation of in-model and post-model adjustments;\n- -Evaluated the methodology, approach and assumptions in developing the adjustments, and evaluated the Group's selection of approach;\n- - Tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used in formulating the judgements;\n- - Performed a recalculation of adjustments;\n- -Evaluated the completeness of adjustments based on our understanding of both model and data limitations, including those related to cost of living and high inflation pressures; and\n- - Assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures and whether the disclosures appropriately address the uncertainty which exists in determining the ECL.",

The new standard establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts which are significantly different to those required under IFRS 4.\n\nAs a result, comparative financial information has been restated from 1 January 2022, with the first time adoption of IFRS 17 resulting in a decrease in reserves by \u00a31.9 billion upon transition.\n\nUnder IFRS 17, insurance contracts are categorised into groups with similar measurement characteristics and valued at a risk-adjusted present value of estimated future cash flows plus or minus an amount representing unearned profits. Unearned profits are recognised over the period of the insurance contract unless a group of contracts are loss-making, in which case losses would have to be recognised immediately.\n\nIn accordance with the transition arrangements allowed under IFRS 17, from 1 January 2022 LBG adopted a fair value approach to certain groups of contracts, as it was determined to be impracticable to apply the standard on a fully retrospective basis. All other contracts were remeasured and recognised on a fully retrospective basis.\n\nThis required a significant level of judgement in the interpretation and determination of accounting policies and methodologies to be applied to the IFRS 17 calculation models, primarily related to the estimate of the fulfilment cash flows and contractual service margin ('CSM'); under both the full retrospective and fair value approaches. Determining the first time adoption of these judgements is inherently judgemental and complex, requiring significant auditor effort.\n\nImplementation of IFRS 17 has also required incremental data to be used within the new models and new disclosure requirements both on transition and on an ongoing basis.\n\nThis key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee's report on page 100 .\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\nWe are satisfied that the Group\u03e0s insurance contracts are appropriately recognised under IFRS 17.\n\n## How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter\n\nWe performed the following audit procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Tested the controls over the accounting methodologies applied in the new IFRS 17 calculation models, CSM and the estimated fulfilment of cash flows;\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the appropriateness of key technical accounting decisions, judgements, assumptions and elections made in determining the impacts to assess compliance with the requirements of the standard;\n- \u00b7 Involved our internal actuarial specialists in performing procedures to assess the Group's implementation of the defined methodology and IFRS 17 calculation models, including those related to the estimate of the fulfilment cash flows and CSM; under both the full retrospective and fair value approaches, as applicable;\n- \u00b7 Tested the completeness and accuracy of the incremental data and other information required for IFRS 17 calculations, including the attribution of cash flows and modelled results to the appropriate CSM calculation groups; and\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the new ongoing disclosures and the disclosures related to the transition impact and reconciled the disclosures to underlying accounting records and supporting data.",

The nature, volume and size of uncorrected misstatements arising in the previous audit; and |\n\n## 6.3 Error reporting threshold\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of \u00a317 million (2022: \u00a316 million), as well as any differences below this threshold, which in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\n## 7. Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the Annual Report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to\n\nreport in this regard.",

Responsibilities of directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the directors\u03e0 responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group\u03e0s and the Parent company\u03e0s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## 9. Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC\u03e0s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities  . This description forms part of our auditors' report.\n\n## 10. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\n## Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities\n\nIn identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the Group's remuneration policies, key drivers for directors' remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;\n- \u00b7 the Group's own assessment of the risks that irregularities may occur either as a result of fraud or error that was discussed by the Audit Committee on 20 February 2024;\n- \u00b7 enquiring of management, in-house legal counsel, internal audit and the Audit Committee, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the Group's policies and procedures relating to:\n- -  identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;\n- -  detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; and -  the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or noncompliance with laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 discussing among the engagement team including significant component audit teams and involving relevant internal specialists, including tax, valuations, pensions, credit modelling, actuarial, IT and industry specialists regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud; and\n- \u00b7 obtaining an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the Group operates in, focusing on those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the financial statements, such as provisions of the UK Companies Act, pensions legislation and tax legislation or that had a fundamental effect on the operations of the Group, including regulation and supervisory requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority, Financial Reporting Council and Financial Conduct Authority.\n\n## Audit response to risks identified\n\nAs a result of performing the above, we identified the Group\u03e0s determination of \u03dfExpected credit losses\u03e0 as key audit matters related to the potential risk of fraud. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matter in more detail and also describes the specific procedures in response to those key audit matters. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.\n\nIn addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;\n- \u00b7 enquiring of management, the Audit Committee and in-house and external legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;\n- \u00b7 performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud;\n- \u00b7 reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and correspondence with regulators; and\n- \u00b7 in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.\n\nWe also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including specialists, and component audit teams, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.",

Other matters which we are required to address Auditor tenure\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by shareholders at its annual general meeting on 18 May 2023 to audit the financial statements of Lloyds Banking Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2023 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement of the firm is accordingly three years.\n\n## Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the Audit Committee\n\nOur audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee we are required to provide in accordance with I SAs (UK).\n\n## 15.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Parent company and the Parent company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\nAs required by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule (DTR) 4.1.15R - DTR 4.1.18R, these financial statements will form part of the Electronic Format Annual Financial Report filed on the National Storage Mechanism of the FCA in accordance with DTR 4.1.15R - DTR 4.1.18R.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 1: Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Lloyds Banking Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings (the Group) have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nThe financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment properties, insurance and reinsurance contract assets and liabilities measured at their fulfilment values in accordance with IFRS 17, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, trading securities and certain other financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and all derivative contracts. The directors consider that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. In reaching this assessment, the directors have considered the impact of climate change upon the Group's performance and projected funding and capital position. The directors have also taken into account the results from stress testing scenarios.\n\nExcept for accounting policies and methods of computation affected by IFRS 17 and the IAS 12 exception relating to the recognition and disclosure of the implication of certain potential deferred tax consequences, the Group's accounting policies are consistent with those applied by the Group in its financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 and there have been no changes in the Group's methods of computation. Following amendments to IAS 12 by the IASB ( International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules , issued in May 2023) entities are not permitted to disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the Organisation for Economic, Co-operation and Development's Pillar Two Model Rules, including any qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes. No changes arise to the Group's deferred tax assets or liabilities as a result of the Group having applied the relevant exception.\n\n## Presentational changes\n\nChanges have been made to the presentation of the Group's income statement and the Group's balance sheet arising from the adoption of IFRS 17. In addition to the impact of IFRS 17, the following changes have been made to the presentation of the Group's income statement and balance sheet to provide a more relevant analysis of the Group's financial performance and financial position:\n\n- \u00b7 Movement in third party interests in consolidated funds are presented separately on the face of the income statement rather than within interest expense. There is no change to the balance sheet presentation of the third party interests\n- \u00b7 Items in the course of collection from banks are reported within other assets rather than separately on the face of the balance sheet\n- \u00b7 Investments in joint ventures and associates are reported within other assets rather than separately on the face of the balance sheet\n- \u00b7 Goodwill and other intangible assets are aggregated on the face of the balance sheet\n- \u00b7 Items in the course of transmission to banks are reported within other liabilities rather than separately on the face of the balance sheet\n\nExcept for the impact of IFRS 17, there has been no change in the basis of accounting for any of the underlying transactions. Comparatives for 2022 have been restated for the impact of IFRS 17. Comparatives for 2022 and 2021 have been restated for all other changes.\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nOn 1 January 2023, the Group adopted IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts , which replaced IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts . A summary of the impact is set out below.\n\nIFRS 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts, including reinsurance contracts issued, participating investment contracts and reinsurance contracts held.\n\nThe Group's change in accounting policies arising from the adoption of IFRS 17 has been made in accordance with the transitional provisions of the standard. IFRS 17 requires a full retrospective approach unless it is impracticable to do so. Under the full retrospective approach, transition impacts are calculated as if IFRS 17 had always applied and it prohibits the use of hindsight. This requires having full and granular data on assumptions and cash flows so that, at the point of contract recognition, the IFRS 17 contract value and contractual service margin (CSM) can be calculated and revalued up to the point of transition. If it is impracticable to apply IFRS 17 retrospectively, a choice is permitted between a modified retrospective approach, provided qualifying conditions are met, or a fair value approach. The different approaches can be applied to different groups of insurance contracts.\n\nOn transition, the Group used the full retrospective approach for business written since 1 January 2016 using Solvency II modelling tools developed when Solvency II was implemented, which are only available to support the calculation of IFRS 17 results from that date. The full retrospective approach was deemed impracticable for contracts initially recognised prior to 1 January 2016 as the models required to calculate the risk adjustment were not in use within the business prior to this date. The Group opted to use the fair value approach for business initially recognised prior to 2016, and valuations supporting Solvency II at the transition date were used to support the fair value calculation for transition for that business.\n\nChanges have also been made to the Group's cash flow statement arising from the adoption of IFRS 17. As noted below, IFRS 17 has required several measurement changes to the balance sheet including the derecognition of the value of in-force (VIF) asset, the measurement of contract liabilities on a probability-weighted basis and the creation of a CSM liability. These changes, together with the presentation of the change in insurance contract liabilities within the change in operating liabilities, have resulted in a restatement of the adjustment for changes in both operating assets and liabilities as well as non-cash and other items.  Cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2022 were not impacted by the adoption of IFRS 17.\n\nOn transition to IFRS 17, the Group's total equity at 1 January 2022 was reduced by \u00a31,935 million from \u00a353,152 million under IFRS 4 to \u00a351,217 million under IFRS 17. The reduction in equity is primarily driven by the derecognition of the VIF asset (\u00a35,317 million), the move to a probability-weighted estimate (expected value) of contract liabilities (\u00a35,915 million), the creation of the new CSM liability (\u00a31,927 million, net of reinsurance) and the establishment of the risk adjustment (\u00a31,492 million, net of reinsurance).",

The table below summarises the approach the Group has applied to groups of insurance contracts at the transition date and the resulting CSM.\n\n|                                                        |                             | CSM at transition date   | CSM at transition date   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Year contracts initially recognised                    | Transition approach         | \u00a3m                       | %                        |\n| Contracts initially recognised prior to 1 January 2016 | Fair value approach 1       | 1,419                    | 7 4                      |\n| Contracts initially recognised after 1 January 2016    | Full retrospective approach | 508                      | 2 6                      |\n|                                                        |                             | 1,927                    | 1  00                    |\n\nIn addition to the impact of \u00a31,935 million at 1 January 2022, at 31 December 2022, total equity is also impacted by the restatement of the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2022, resulting in a further reduction of \u00a31,632 million in retained profits. This arose from the impact of revised income recognition requirements, changes in interest rates during 2022 and the effect of contract modifications. There is a further reduction in total equity of \u00a343 million in respect of the foreign currency translation reserve and the reclassification of treasury shares on transition to IFRS 17. Total equity at 31 December 2022 reduced by \u00a33,610 million, from \u00a347,521 million under IFRS 4 to \u00a343,911 million under IFRS 17.\n\nWhilst IFRS 17 does not change the total profit recognised over the life of an insurance contract or participating investment contract, it does change both the phasing of profit recognition and the amounts recognised within individual income statement line items, including other income and operating expenses. Under IFRS 17, the Group is required to defer substantially all of the expected profit through the recognition of a CSM on the balance sheet; the CSM is subsequently released to the income statement over the coverage period of the product. The expected profit includes estimated future premiums and claims together with expected administration costs such as claims handling costs, costs incurred to provide contractual policyholder benefits and policy administration and maintenance costs.\n\nThe impact of IFRS 17 on the Group's results for the year ended 31 December 2022 was to reduce profit before tax by \u00a32,146 million and reduce profit after tax by \u00a31,632 million compared to results reported under IFRS 4.\n\n## Future accounting developments\n\nThe IASB has issued a number of minor amendments to IFRSs effective 1 January 2024, including IFRS 16 Lease Liability in a Sale and Leasebac k, IAS 1 Non-current Liabilities with Covenants , and IAS 1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current . These amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group and have been endorsed for use in the UK.\n\n## Note 2: Accounting policies\n\nThe Group's accounting policies are set out below. These accounting policies have been applied consistently.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (A)  Consolidation\n\nThe assets, liabilities and results of Group undertakings (including structured entities) are included in the financial statements on the basis of accounts made up to the reporting date. Group undertakings include subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. Details of the Group's subsidiaries and related undertakings are given on pages 344 to 356 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (1) Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it has power over the entity, is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and has the ability to affect those returns through the exercise of its power. This generally accompanies a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights although in certain circumstances a holding of less than one half of the voting rights may still result in the ability of the Group to exercise control. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there have been changes to any of the above elements. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group; they are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.\n\nThe Group consolidates collective investment vehicles if its beneficial ownership interests give it substantive rights to remove the external fund manager of the investment activities of the fund. Where a subsidiary of the Group is the fund manager of a collective investment vehicle, the Group considers a number of factors in determining whether it acts as principal, and therefore controls the collective investment vehicle, including: an assessment of the scope of the Group's decision making authority over the investment vehicle; the rights held by other parties including substantive removal rights without cause over the Group acting as fund manager; the remuneration to which the Group is entitled in its capacity as decision-maker; and the Group's exposure to variable returns from the beneficial interest that it holds in the investment vehicle. Consolidation may be appropriate in circumstances where the Group has less than a majority beneficial interest. Where a collective investment vehicle is consolidated the interests of parties other than the Group are reported in other liabilities and the movement in those interests in movement in third party interests in consolidated funds .\n\nStructured entities are entities that are designed so that their activities are not governed by way of voting rights. In assessing whether the Group has power over such entities in which it has an interest, the Group considers factors such as the purpose and design of the entity; its practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity; the nature of the relationship with the entity; and the size of its exposure to the variability of returns of the entity.",

Changes in the parent's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions; any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent entity. Where the Group loses control of the subsidiary, at the date when control is lost the amount of any non-controlling interest in that former subsidiary is derecognised and any investment retained in the former subsidiary is remeasured to its fair value; the gain or loss that is recognised in profit or loss on the partial disposal of the subsidiary includes the gain or loss on the remeasurement of the retained interest.\n\nIntercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group. The consideration for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred except those relating to the issuance of debt instruments (see (E)(4) below) or share capital (see ( Q) below). Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date.\n\n## (2)  Joint ventures and associates\n\nJoint ventures are joint arrangements over which the Group has joint control with other parties and has rights to the net assets of the arrangements. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement and only exists when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity, but is not control or joint control of those policies, and is generally achieved through holding between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting share capital of the entity.\n\nThe Group utilises the venture capital exemption for investments where significant influence or joint control is present and the business unit operates as a venture capital business. These investments are designated on initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Otherwise, the Group's investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.\n\n## (B)  Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises on business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Where the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity is greater than the cost of acquisition, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nGoodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and is tested at least annually for impairment. For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit (CGU) or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination. The Group's CGUs are largely product based for its Retail and Insurance businesses and client based for its Commercial Banking business. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of a CGU is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If an impairment is identified the carrying value of the goodwill is written down immediately through the income statement and this is not subsequently reversed. At the date of disposal of a subsidiary, the carrying value of attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.\n\n## (C)  Other intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets which have been determined to have a finite useful life are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life as follows: up to seven years for capitalised software; 10 to 15 years for brands and other intangible assets.\n\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date to assess whether there is any indication that they are impaired. If any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is determined and in the event that the asset's carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount, it is written down immediately. Certain brands have been determined to have an indefinite useful life and are not amortised. Such intangible assets are assessed annually to determine whether the asset is impaired and to reconfirm that an indefinite useful life remains appropriate. In the event that an indefinite life is inappropriate, a finite life is determined and a further impairment review is performed on the asset.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (D)  Revenue recognition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (1) Net interest income\n\nInterest income and expense are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method for all interest-bearing financial instruments, except for those classified at fair value through profit or loss. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the expected life of the financial instrument. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset (before adjusting for expected credit losses) or to the amortised cost of the financial liability, including early redemption fees, other fees, and premiums and discounts that are an integral part of the overall return. In the case of financial assets that are purchased or originated credit-impaired, the effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows to the amortised cost of the instrument. Direct incremental transaction costs related to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial instrument are also taken into account. Interest income from non-credit-impaired financial assets is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the asset; for credit-impaired financial assets, the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount after deducting the allowance for expected credit losses. Impairment policies are set out in (H) below.\n\n## (2)  Fee and commission income and expense\n\nFees and commissions receivable which are not an integral part of the effective interest rate are recognised as income as the Group fulfils its performance obligations. The Group's principal performance obligations arising from contracts with customers are in respect of value added current accounts, credit cards and debit cards. These fees are received, and the Group provides the service, monthly; the fees are recognised in income on this basis. The Group also receives certain fees in respect of its asset finance business where the performance obligations are typically fulfilled towards the end of the customer contract; these fees are recognised in income on this basis. Where it is unlikely that the loan commitments will be drawn, loan commitment fees are recognised in fee and commission income over the life of the facility, rather than as an adjustment to the effective interest rate for the lending expected to be drawn. Incremental costs incurred to generate fee and commission income are charged to fee and commission expense as they are incurred.",

The Group assesses its business models at a portfolio level based on its objectives for the relevant portfolio, how the performance of the portfolio is managed and reported, and the frequency of asset sales. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when considering their cash flow characteristics. The Group reclassifies financial assets only when its business model for managing those assets changes. A reclassification will only take place when the change is significant to the Group's operations and will occur at a portfolio level and not for individual instruments; reclassifications are expected to be rare. Equity investments are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless the Group elects at initial recognition to account for the instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income. For these instruments, principally strategic investments, dividends are recognised in profit or loss but fair value gains and losses are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss following derecognition of the investment.\n\nThe Group initially recognises loans and advances, deposits, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of securities and other financial assets and trading liabilities are recognised on trade date, being the date that the Group is committed to purchase or sell an asset.\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to receive cash flows from those assets has expired or when the Group has transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows from the assets and either: substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred; or the Group has neither retained nor transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards, but has transferred control.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.\n\n## (1) Financial instruments measured at amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets that are held to collect contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. A basic lending arrangement results in contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Where the contractual cash flows introduce exposure to risks or volatility unrelated to a basic lending arrangement such as changes in equity prices or commodity prices, the payments do not comprise solely principal and interest. Financial assets measured at amortised cost are predominantly loans and advances to customers and banks, reverse repurchase agreements and certain debt securities used by the Group to manage its liquidity. Loans and advances and reverse repurchase agreements are initially recognised when cash is advanced to the borrower at fair value inclusive of transaction costs. Interest income is accounted for using the effective interest method (see (D) above).\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for trading liabilities and other financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition which are held at fair value.\n\nWhere changes are made to the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability that are economically equivalent and arise as a direct consequence of interest rate benchmark reform, the Group updates the effective interest rate and does not recognise an immediate gain or loss.\n\n## (2)  Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets that are held to collect contractual cash flows and for subsequent sale, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value, inclusive of transaction costs. Interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on assets denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement. All other gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, until the financial asset is either sold or matures, at which time, other than in respect of equity shares, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement. The cumulative revaluation amount in respect of equity shares is transferred directly to retained profits. The Group recognises a charge for expected credit losses in the income statement (see (H) below). As the asset is measured at fair value, the charge does not adjust the carrying value of the asset, and this is reflected in other comprehensive income.\n\n## (3)  Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss where they do not meet the criteria to be measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income or where they are designated at fair value through profit or loss to reduce an accounting mismatch. All derivatives are carried at fair value through profit or loss, other than those in effective cash flow and net investment hedging relationships. Derivatives are carried on the balance sheet as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Refer to note 21(2) (Financial instruments: Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value) for details of valuation techniques and significant inputs to valuation models.\n\nDerivatives embedded in a financial asset are not considered separately; the financial asset is considered in its entirety when determining whether its cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. Derivatives embedded in financial liabilities and insurance contracts (unless the embedded derivative is itself an insurance contract) are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value through profit or loss. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe assets backing the insurance and investment contracts issued by the Group do not meet the criteria to be measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income as they are managed on a fair value basis and accordingly are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Similarly, trading securities, which are debt securities and equity shares acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or which are part of a portfolio which is managed for short-term gains, do not meet these criteria and are also measured at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value. Fair value gains and losses together with interest coupons and dividend income are recognised in the income statement within net trading income.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss where they are trading liabilities or where they are designated at fair value through profit or loss in order to reduce an accounting mismatch; where the liabilities are part of a group of liabilities (or assets and liabilities) which is managed, and its performance evaluated, on a fair value basis; or where the liabilities contain one or more embedded derivatives that significantly modify the cash flows arising under the contract and would otherwise need to be separately accounted for. Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value. Fair value gains and losses are recognised in the income statement within net trading income in the period in which they occur, except in the case of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss where gains and losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe fair values of assets and liabilities traded in active markets are based on current bid and offer prices, respectively, which include the expected effects of potential changes to laws and regulations, risks associated with climate change and other factors. If the market is not active the Group establishes a fair value by using valuation techniques. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are adjusted where appropriate to reflect credit risk (via credit valuation adjustments (CVAs), debit valuation adjustments (DVAs) and funding valuation adjustments (FVAs)), market liquidity and other risks.\n\n## (4)  Borrowings\n\nBorrowings (which include deposits from banks, customer deposits, repurchase agreements, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities) are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred. These instruments are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nPreference shares and other instruments which carry a mandatory coupon or are redeemable on a specific date are classified as financial liabilities. The coupon on these instruments is recognised in the income statement as interest expense. Securities which carry a discretionary coupon and have no fixed maturity or redemption date are classified as other equity instruments. Interest payments on these securities are recognised as distributions from equity in the period in which they are paid. An exchange of financial liabilities on substantially different terms is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability is recognised in profit or loss together with any related costs or fees incurred.\n\nWhen a financial liability is exchanged for an equity instrument, the new equity instrument is recognised at fair value and any difference between the carrying value of the liability and the fair value of the new equity instrument is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## (5)  Sale and repurchase agreements (including securities lending and borrowing)\n\nSecurities sold subject to repurchase agreements (repos) continue to be recognised on the balance sheet where substantially all of the risks and rewards are retained. Funds received for repos carried at fair value are included within trading liabilities. Conversely, securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repos), where the Group does not acquire substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership, are measured at amortised cost or at fair value. Those measured at fair value are recognised within trading securities. The difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued over the life of the agreements using the effective interest method.\n\nSecurities borrowing and lending transactions are typically secured; collateral takes the form of securities or cash advanced or received. Securities lent to counterparties are retained on the balance sheet. Securities borrowed are not recognised on the balance sheet, unless these are sold to third parties, in which case the obligation to return them is recorded at fair value as a trading liability. Cash collateral given or received is treated as a loan and advance measured at amortised cost or customer deposit.\n\n## (F)  Hedge accounting\n\nAs permitted by IFRS 9, the Group continues to apply the requirements of IAS 39 to its hedging relationships.\n\nChanges in the fair value of all derivative instruments, other than those in effective cash flow and net investment hedging relationships, are recognised immediately in the income statement. As noted in (2) and (3) below, the change in fair value of a derivative in an effective cash flow or net investment hedging relationship is allocated between the income statement and other comprehensive income.\n\nHedge accounting allows one financial instrument, generally a derivative such as a swap, to be designated as a hedge of another financial instrument such as a loan or deposit or a portfolio of such instruments. At the inception of the hedge relationship, formal documentation is drawn up specifying the hedging strategy, the hedged item, the hedging instrument and the methodology that will be used to measure the effectiveness of the hedge relationship in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of the hedged risk. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is tested both at inception and throughout its life and if at any point it is concluded that it is no longer highly effective in achieving its documented objective, hedge accounting is discontinued. Note 22 provides details of the types of derivatives held by the Group and presents separately those designated in hedge relationships.\n\nWhere there is uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform, the Group assumes that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows and/or the hedged risk are based, or the interest rate benchmark on which the cash flows of the hedging instrument are based, are not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform. The Group does not discontinue a hedging relationship during the period of uncertainty arising from the interest rate benchmark reform solely because the actual results of the hedge are not highly effective.\n\nWhere the contractual terms of a financial asset, financial liability or derivative are amended, on an economically equivalent basis, as a direct consequence of interest rate benchmark reform, the uncertainty arising from the reform is no longer present. In these circumstances, the Group amends the hedge documentation to reflect the changes required by the reform; these changes to the documentation do not in and of themselves result in the discontinuation of hedge accounting or require the designation of a new hedge relationship.\n\n## (1) Fair value hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk; this also applies if the hedged asset is classified as a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are no longer recognised in the income statement. The cumulative adjustment that has been made to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method over the period to maturity.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\n## (2)  Cash flow hedges\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.\n\n## (3)  Net investment hedges\n\nHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income, and the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of. The hedging instruments used in net investment hedges may include non-derivative liabilities as well as derivative financial instruments.\n\n## (G)  Offset\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Cash collateral on exchange traded derivative transactions is presented gross unless the collateral cash flows are always settled net with the derivative cash flows. In certain situations, even though master netting agreements exist, the lack of management intention to settle on a net basis results in the financial assets and liabilities being reported gross on the balance sheet.\n\n## (H)  Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe impairment charge in the income statement reflects the change in expected credit losses, including those arising from fraud. Expected credit losses are recognised for loans and advances to customers and banks, other financial assets held at amortised cost, financial assets (other than equity investments) measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. Expected credit losses are calculated as an unbiased and probability-weighted estimate using an appropriate probability of default, adjusted to take into account a range of possible future economic scenarios, and applying this to the estimated exposure of the Group at the point of default after taking into account the value of any collateral held, repayments, or other mitigants of loss and including the impact of discounting using the effective interest rate.\n\nAt initial recognition, allowance (or provision in the case of some loan commitments and financial guarantees) is made for expected credit losses resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (12-month expected credit losses). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk since origination, allowance (or provision) is made for expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime expected credit losses). Financial assets where 12month expected credit losses are recognised are considered to be Stage 1; financial assets which are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are in Stage 2; and financial assets which have defaulted or are otherwise considered to be credit-impaired are allocated to Stage 3. Some Stage 3 assets, mainly in Commercial Banking, are subject to individual rather than collective assessment. Such cases are subject to a risk-based impairment sanctioning process, and these are reviewed and updated at least quarterly, or more frequently if there is a significant change in the credit profile. The collective assessment of impairment aggregates financial instruments with similar risk characteristics, such as whether the facility is revolving in nature or secured and the type of security held against financial assets.\n\nAn assessment of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition considers the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument. In determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk, the Group uses quantitative tests based on relative and absolute probability of default (PD) movements linked to internal credit ratings together with qualitative indicators such as watchlists and other indicators of historical delinquency, credit weakness or financial difficulty. The use of internal credit ratings and qualitative indicators ensures alignment between the assessment of staging and the Group's management of credit risk which utilises these internal metrics within distinct retail and commercial portfolio risk management practices. However, unless identified at an earlier stage, the credit risk of financial assets is deemed to have increased significantly when more than 30 days past due. The use of a payment holiday in and of itself has not been judged to indicate a significant increase in credit risk, with the underlying long-term credit risk deemed to be driven by economic conditions and captured through the use of forward-looking models. These portfolio-level models are capturing the anticipated volume of increased defaults and therefore an appropriate assessment of staging and expected credit loss. Where the credit risk subsequently improves such that it no longer represents a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the asset is transferred back to Stage 1.\n\nAssets are transferred to Stage 3 when they have defaulted or are otherwise considered to be credit-impaired. Default is considered to have occurred when there is evidence that the customer is experiencing financial difficulty which is likely to affect significantly the ability to repay the amount due. IFRS 9 contains a rebuttable presumption that default occurs no later than when a payment is 90 days past due which the Group now uses for all its products following changes to the definition of default for UK mortgages on 1 January 2022. In addition, other indicators of mortgage default are added including end-of-term payments on past due interest-only accounts and loans considered non-performing due to recent arrears or forbearance. The use of payment holidays is not considered to be an automatic trigger of regulatory default and therefore does not automatically trigger Stage 3. Days past due will also not accumulate on any accounts that have taken a payment holiday including those already past due.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the Group will renegotiate the original terms of a customer's loan, either as part of an ongoing customer relationship or in response to adverse changes in the circumstances of the borrower. In the latter circumstances, the loan will remain classified as either Stage 2 or Stage 3 until the credit risk has improved such that it no longer represents a significant increase since origination (for a return to Stage 1), or the loan is no longer credit-impaired (for a return to Stage 2). On renegotiation the gross carrying amount of the loan is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows, which are discounted at the original effective interest rate. Renegotiation may also lead to the loan and associated allowance being derecognised and a new loan being recognised initially at fair value.\n\nPurchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets (POCI) include financial assets that are purchased or originated at a deep discount that reflects incurred credit losses. At initial recognition, POCI assets do not carry an impairment allowance; instead, lifetime expected credit losses are incorporated into the calculation of the effective interest rate. All changes in lifetime expected credit losses subsequent to the assets' initial recognition are recognised as an impairment charge.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\nA loan or advance is normally written off, either partially or in full, against the related allowance when the proceeds from realising any available security have been received or there is no realistic prospect of recovery and the amount of the loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off decrease the amount of impairment losses recorded in the income statement. For both secured and unsecured retail balances, the write-off takes place only once an extensive set of collections processes has been completed, or the status of the account reaches a point where policy dictates that continuing attempts to recover are no longer appropriate. For commercial lending, a write-off occurs if the loan facility with the customer is restructured, the asset is under administration and the only monies that can be received are the amounts estimated by the administrator, the underlying assets are disposed and a decision is made that no further settlement monies will be received, or external evidence (for example, third party valuations) is available that there has been an irreversible decline in expected cash flows.\n\n## (I) Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment (other than investment property) is included at cost less accumulated depreciation. The value of land (included in premises) is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the difference between the cost and the residual value over their estimated useful lives, as follows: the shorter of 50 years and the remaining period of the lease for freehold/long and short leasehold premises; the shorter of 10 years and, if lease renewal is not likely, the remaining period of the lease for leasehold improvements; 10 to 20 years for fixtures and furnishings; and 2 to 8 years for other equipment and motor vehicles.\n\nThe assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed and, if appropriate, revised at each balance sheet date.\n\nAssets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverable amount of assets the Group considers the effects of potential or actual changes in legislation, customer behaviour, climate-related risks and other factors on the asset's CGU. In the event that an asset's CGU carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount the asset is written down immediately.\n\nInvestment property comprises freehold and long leasehold land and buildings that are held either to earn rental income or for capital accretion or both, primarily within the life insurance funds. In accordance with the guidance published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, investment property is carried at fair value based on current prices for similar properties, adjusted for the specific characteristics of the property (such as location or condition). If this information is not available, the Group uses alternative valuation methods such as discounted cash flow projections or recent prices in less active markets. These valuations are reviewed at least annually by independent professionally qualified valuers. Investment property being redeveloped for continuing use as investment property, or for which the market has become less active, continues to be valued at fair value.\n\n## (J)  Leases\n\nUnder IFRS 16, a lessor is required to determine whether a lease is a finance or operating lease. A lessee is not required to make this determination.\n\n## (1) As lessor\n\nAssets leased to customers are classified as finance leases if the lease agreements transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee but not necessarily legal title. All other leases are classified as operating leases. When assets are subject to finance leases, the present value of the lease payments, together with any unguaranteed residual value, is recognised as a receivable, net of allowances for expected credit losses and residual value impairment, within loans and advances to banks and customers. The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance lease income. Finance lease income is recognised in interest income over the term of the lease using the net investment method (before tax) so as to give a constant rate of return on the net investment in the lease. Unguaranteed residual values are reviewed regularly to identify any impairment.\n\nOperating lease assets are included within other assets at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. The depreciation charge is based on the asset's residual value and the life of the lease. Operating lease rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.\n\nThe Group evaluates non-lease arrangements such as outsourcing and similar contracts to determine if they contain a lease which is then accounted for separately.\n\n## (2)  As lessee\n\nLeases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, or the Group's incremental borrowing rate appropriate for the right-of-use asset arising from the lease, and the liability recognised within other liabilities.\n\nLease payments are allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.\n\n## (K)  Employee benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefits, such as salaries, paid absences, performance-based cash awards and social security costs, are recognised over the period in which the employees provide the related services.\n\n## (1) Pension schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of post-retirement benefit schemes for its employees including both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. A defined benefit scheme is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of pensionable service and pensionable salary. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan into which the Group pays fixed contributions; there is no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\n## (i) Defined benefit schemes\n\nScheme assets are included at their fair value and scheme liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method. The defined benefit scheme liabilities are discounted using rates equivalent to the market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. The Group's income statement charge includes the current service cost of providing pension benefits, past service costs, net interest expense (income), and plan administration costs that are not deducted from the return on plan assets. Past service costs, which represents the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment, are recognised when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs. Net interest expense (income) is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset.\n\nRemeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest expense (income) and net of the cost of managing the plan assets), and the effect of changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) are reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income are reflected immediately in retained profits and will not subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nThe Group's balance sheet includes the net surplus or deficit, being the difference between the fair value of scheme assets and the discounted value of scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date. Surpluses are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the schemes. In assessing whether a surplus is recoverable, the Group considers (i) its current right to obtain a refund or a reduction in future contributions and (ii) the rights of other parties existing at the balance sheet date. In determining the rights of third parties existing at the balance sheet date, the Group does not anticipate any future acts by other parties.\n\n## (ii) Defined contribution schemes\n\nThe costs of the Group's defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.\n\n## (2)  Share-based compensation\n\nThe Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans in respect of services received from certain of its employees. The value of the employee services received in exchange for equity instruments granted under these plans is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the instruments, with a corresponding increase in equity. This expense is determined by reference to the fair value of the number of equity instruments that are expected to vest. The fair value of equity instruments granted is based on market prices, if available, at the date of grant. In the absence of market prices, the fair value of the instruments at the date of grant is estimated using an appropriate valuation technique, such as a Black-Scholes option pricing model or a Monte Carlo simulation. The determination of fair values excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions, which are included in the assumptions used to estimate the number of options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, this estimate is reassessed and if necessary revised. Any revision of the original estimate is recognised in the income statement, together with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Cancellations by employees of contributions to the Group's Save As You Earn plans are treated as non-vesting conditions and the Group recognises, in the year of cancellation, the amount of the expense that would have otherwise been recognised over the remainder of the vesting period. Modifications are assessed at the date of modification and any incremental charges are charged to the income statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (L)  Taxation\n\nTax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are charged or credited in the income statement except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event which is recognised, in the same or a different period, outside the income statement (either in other comprehensive income, directly in equity, or through a business combination), in which case the tax appears in the same statement as the transaction that gave rise to it. The tax consequences of the Group's dividend payments (including distributions on other equity instruments), if any, are charged or credited to the statement in which the profit distributed originally arose.\n\nCurrent tax is the amount of corporate income taxes expected to be payable or recoverable based on the profit for the period as adjusted for items that are not taxable or not deductible, and is calculated using tax rates and laws that were enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nCurrent tax includes amounts provided in respect of uncertain tax positions when management expects that, upon examination of the uncertainty by His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) or other relevant tax authority, it is more likely than not that an economic outflow will occur. Provisions reflect management's best estimate of the ultimate liability based on their interpretation of tax law, precedent and guidance, informed by external tax advice as necessary. Changes in facts and circumstances underlying these provisions are reassessed at each balance sheet date, and the provisions are remeasured as required to reflect current information.\n\nFor the Group's long-term insurance businesses, the tax expense is analysed between tax that is payable in respect of policyholders' returns and tax that is payable on the shareholders' returns. This allocation is based on an assessment of the rates of tax which will be applied to the returns under the current UK tax rules.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the balance sheet. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and which are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences but not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries where the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised on temporary differences that arise from goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised, and are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised in respect of temporary differences that arise on initial recognition of assets and liabilities acquired other than in a business combination. Deferred tax is not discounted.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\n## (M) Insurance - IFRS 17\n\nThe Group undertakes both life insurance and general insurance business. Insurance and participating investment contracts, and reinsurance contracts issued and held, are accounted for under IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts .\n\nProducts sold by the life insurance business are classified into three categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance contracts are contracts that transfer significant insurance risk and may also transfer financial risk. The Group defines significant insurance risk as the possibility of having to pay benefits on the occurrence of an insured event which are significantly higher than the benefits payable if the insured event were not to occur. Once a contract has been classified as an insurance contract, it remains an insurance contract until all obligations are extinguished unless that contract is derecognised due to a contract modification. These contracts are classified as either direct participating contracts or contracts without direct participation features. Contracts without direct participation features are accounted for using the general measurement model (GMM) for life contracts or the premium allocation approach (PAA) for general insurance contracts. Direct participating contracts are contracts for which, at inception, the contractual terms specify the policyholders participate in a clearly identified pool of underlying items. Under the terms of these contracts the policyholders are entitled to a substantial share of the returns and change in fair value of the underlying items. These contracts are accounted for under the variable fee approach (VFA)\n- \u00b7 Participating investment contracts are investment contracts that contain a discretionary participation feature (DPF). They do not transfer significant insurance risk, but contain a contractual right to receive, as a supplement to an amount not subject to the discretion of the Group, additional amounts that are expected to be a significant portion of the total contractual benefits. The timing or amount of these additional amounts are at the discretion of the Group and are contractually based on the returns on a specified pool of contracts or type of contract, returns on a specified pool of assets held by the Group or profit or loss of a fund\n- \u00b7 For certain insurance and investment contracts, the contract can be partly invested in units which contain a DPF and partly in units without. In these circumstances, where the contract also contains features that transfer significant insurance risk, they are classified as insurance contracts. Where this is not the case, and the discretionary cash flows are expected to be a significant portion of the total contractual benefits, they are classified as participating investment contracts. Where the discretionary cash flows are not expected to be a significant portion of the total contractual benefits, they are classified as financial instruments. An investment component is defined as the amount that an insurance contract requires the entity to repay to a policyholder in all circumstances, regardless of whether an insured event occurs. The investment component of the insurance and participating investment contract is non-distinct and is not separated. The Group applies judgement to determine the investment component for each contract considering the extent to which insurance and investment components are highly interrelated or not applying factors such as: whether the policyholder is able to benefit from one component unless the other component is present; and whether the value of the investment component is dependent on the timing of the insured event. The value of the non-distinct investment component is determined on the following bases: for immediate annuities, full claim amount when within the guaranteed period; for unit-linked and With-Profits contracts, policyholder's account value\n\nThe general insurance business issues only insurance contracts.\n\n## (1) Life insurance business\n\n## (i) Accounting for insurance and participating investment contracts\n\n## Recognition\n\nThe Group aggregates insurance and participating investment contracts into portfolios of contracts subject to similar risks and managed together. Each portfolio of insurance contracts is divided into annual cohorts (by year of issue). Annual cohorts are divided into groups of insurance and participating investment contracts based on profitability expectations at initial recognition. The directly attributable costs of selling, underwriting and starting a group of insurance and participating investment contracts are allocated to the group of insurance and participating investment contracts using a systematic and rational method.\n\nOn initial recognition, a group of insurance and participating investment contracts is measured as the total of the fulfilment cash flows and the contractual service margin (CSM). The measurement includes all future cash flows that are within the contract boundary of each contract in the group. The fulfilment cash flows comprise unbiased and probability-weighted estimates of future cash flows, discounted to present value to reflect the time value of money and financial risks, plus an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk. The discount rate applied reflects the time value of money, the characteristics of the cash flows, the liquidity characteristics of the insurance and participating investment contracts and, where appropriate, is consistent with observable current market prices. The risk adjustment for non-financial risk for a group of insurance and participating investment contracts is the compensation required for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from non-financial risk. Diversification benefit is calculated based on Group level diversification of risks. To determine the risk adjustments for non-financial risk for reinsurance contracts, the Group applies these techniques both gross and net of excess of loss reinsurance and derives the amount of risk being transferred to the reinsurer as the difference between the two results. The CSM of a group of insurance and participating investment contracts represents the unearned profit that the Group expects to recognise as it provides insurance contract services under those contracts in the future.\n\n## Contract boundaries\n\nThe measurement of a group of contracts includes all future cash flows within the boundary of each contract in the group.\n\nCash flows are within the contract boundary:\n\n- \u00b7 For an insurance contract, if they arise from substantive rights and obligations that exist during the reporting period in which the Group can compel the policyholder to pay premiums or has a substantive obligation to provide insurance contract services\n- \u00b7 For a participating investment contract, if they result from a substantive obligation of the Group to deliver cash at a present or future date\n\nA substantive obligation to provide insurance contract services ends when the Group has the practical ability to reassess the risks of the particular policyholder, and can set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects those reassessed risks; or the Group has the practical ability to reassess the risks of the portfolio that contains the contract and can set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects the risks of that portfolio, and the pricing of the premiums up to the reassessment date does not take into account risks that relate to periods after the reassessment date.\n\nFor certain unitised With-Profits and unit-linked policies, a guaranteed minimum pension is payable at a vesting date. For certain conventional With-Profits pensions, policyholders have the option to convert to an annuity on guaranteed terms. There is no contract boundary at the vesting date of these policies; the pre and post vesting date phases are treated as a single insurance contract.\n\nThe contract boundary of each group is reassessed at the end of each reporting period.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe carrying amount of a group of insurance and participating investment contracts at each reporting date is the sum of the liability for remaining coverage (LRC) and the liability for incurred claims (LIC). The LRC comprises the fulfilment cash flows that relate to services that will be provided under the contracts in future periods and any remaining CSM at that date. The LIC includes the fulfilment cash flows for incurred claims and expenses that have not yet been paid, including claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The fulfilment cash flows of groups of insurance and participating investment contracts are measured at the reporting date using current estimates of future cash flows, current discount rates and current estimates of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk. Changes in fulfilment cash flows are recognised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Changes related to future service are adjusted against the CSM unless the group is onerous in which case such changes are recognised in the insurance service result in profit or loss\n- \u00b7 Changes related to past or current service are recognised in the insurance service result in profit or loss\n- \u00b7 The effects of the time value of money and financial risk are recognised as net finance income or expense from insurance, participating investment and reinsurance contracts in profit or loss\n\nThe carrying amount of the CSM is remeasured at the end of each reporting period. For contracts measured under the GMM, interest is accreted on the carrying amount of the CSM using the discount rate curve determined at the date of initial recognition of the group of contracts. The CSM is also adjusted for the changes in fulfilment cash flows relating to future service at the locked-in discount rates determined at initial recognition, unless the increases in fulfilment cash flows cause a group of contracts to become onerous or decreases in fulfilment cash flows are allocated to the loss component of the liability for remaining coverage.\n\nThe majority of the Group's With-Profits and unit-linked insurance and participating investment contracts are direct participating contracts under which the Group's obligation to the policyholder is the payment of an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items, less a variable fee. On subsequent remeasurement of a group of direct participating contracts (measured under VFA), changes to the fulfilment cash flows, discounted at current rates, reflecting changes in the obligation to pay the policyholder an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items are recognised in the income statement, within net finance income or expense from insurance, participating investment and reinsurance contracts. The CSM is adjusted for changes in the amount of the Group's share of the fair value of the underlying items, which relate to future services, except where such changes result in recognition or reversal of the loss component for onerous groups, or where the Group applies the risk mitigation option. For certain contracts with direct participation features, the Group mitigates financial risks using equity and currency hedges. The Group does not adjust the CSM for changes in the fulfilment cash flows and/or entity's share of the underlying items that reflect some of the changes in the effect of time value of money and financial risk. These amounts are instead reflected in profit or loss. The CSM is also adjusted for those fulfilment cashflows that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items that relate to future service (including the effect of time value of money and financial risks not arising from underlying items, such as the impact of minimum return guarantees), except where such changes result in recognition or reversal of the loss component for onerous groups. Changes in fulfilment cash flows relating to future service adjust the CSM using current discount rates.\n\nFor contracts measured under the GMM or VFA at the end of each reporting period the appropriate proportion of the CSM is recognised in the income statement to reflect the amount of profit related to the insurance contract services provided in the period. This is calculated using coverage units, a measure used to determine the allocation of the CSM over the remaining coverage periods. The number of coverage units in a group is the quantity of insurance contract services provided by the contracts in the group, determined by considering for each contract the quantity of the benefits provided and its expected coverage period.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nThe Group derecognises an insurance and participating investment contract when it is extinguished (that is, when the obligation specified in the contract expires or is discharged or cancelled) or if its terms are modified in a way that would have changed the accounting for the contract significantly had the new terms always existed.\n\nIf a contract is derecognised, then the fulfilment cash flows of the group are adjusted to eliminate the present value of the future cash flows and risk adjustment of the contract derecognised from the group, and the CSM of the group is adjusted for the change in fulfilment cash flows, except where such changes are allocated to the loss component.\n\nIf a contract is derecognised because its terms are modified, then the CSM of the existing group is also adjusted for the premium that would have been charged had the Group entered into a contract with the new contract's terms at the date of modification, less any additional premium charged for the modification. A new modified contract is recognised assuming the Group received the premium that would have been charged had the Group entered into a contract with the new contract's terms at the date of the modification.\n\nWhere the adjustments to CSM result in the CSM being reduced to nil, any further adjustments are recognised in the income statement in insurance service expense.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (2)  General insurance contracts\n\nGeneral insurance contracts issued by the Group are presented on the balance sheet within liabilities arising from insurance and participating investment contracts. The Group applies the PAA to the measurement of general insurance contracts, which either have a coverage period of each contract in the group of one year or less or have an annual re-pricing option.\n\nFor a group of general insurance contracts that is not onerous at initial recognition, the Group measures the LRC as any premium received at initial recognition, less any insurance acquisition cash flows at that date, plus any other asset or liability previously recognised for cash flows related to the group of contracts that the Group pays or receives before the group of insurance contracts is recognised.\n\nThe Group estimates the LIC using the methodology described in the Measurement section for life insurance contracts above.\n\nWhere, during the coverage period, facts and circumstances indicate that a group of insurance contracts is onerous, the Group recognises a loss in the income statement for the net outflow, resulting in the carrying amount of the liability for the group being equal to the fulfilment cash flows. A loss component is established by the Group within the LRC for such onerous group.\n\nOn subsequent measurement, the Group measures the carrying amount of the LRC at the end of each reporting period as the LRC at the beginning of the period plus premiums received in the period, less insurance acquisition cash flows, plus any amounts relating to the amortisation of the insurance acquisition cash flows recognised as an expense in the reporting period for the group, less the amount recognised as insurance revenue for the services provided in the period. For onerous groups, the LRC is also adjusted for the remeasurement of the loss component.",

These contracts are presented within other assets or liabilities arising from insurance and participating investment contracts.\n\n## (ii) Reinsurance contracts held\n\nThe classification of contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for amounts payable on one or more other contracts issued by the Group is dependent on whether the contract with the reinsurer transfers significant insurance risk to the reinsurer. Where the reinsurance contract transfers significant insurance risk (reinsurance contracts held), it is accounted for under the GMM, as modified for reinsurance contracts held. The Group adjusts the CSM of the group to which a reinsurance contract held belongs and as a result recognises income, when it recognises a loss on initial recognition of onerous underlying contracts.\n\nContracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk to the reinsurer are recognised within financial assets at fair value through profit or loss as they are within a portfolio of financial assets that is managed, and whose performance is evaluated, on a fair value basis. These contracts, while legally reinsurance contracts, do not meet the definition of a reinsurance contract under IFRS. Investment returns (including movements in fair value and investment income) allocated to these contracts are recognised on the face of the income statement within net trading income.\n\n## (4)  Non-participating investment contracts\n\nThe Group's non-participating investment contracts are primarily unit-linked. These contracts are accounted for under IFRS 9 as financial liabilities whose value is contractually linked to the fair values of financial assets within the Group's unitised investment funds. The value of the unit-linked financial liabilities is determined using current unit prices multiplied by the number of units attributed to the contract holders at the balance sheet date. Their value is never less than the amount payable on surrender, discounted for the required notice period where applicable. Investment returns (including movements in fair value and investment income) allocated to those contracts are recognised in the income statement through change in non-participating investment contracts.\n\nDeposits and withdrawals are not accounted for through the income statement but are accounted for directly in the balance sheet as adjustments to the non-participating investment contract liability.\n\nThe Group receives investment management fees in the form of an initial adjustment or charge to the amount invested. These fees are in respect of services rendered in conjunction with the issue and management of investment contracts where the Group actively manages the consideration received from its customers to fund a return that is based on the investment profile that the customer selected on origination of the contract. These services comprise an indeterminate number of acts over the lives of the individual contracts and, therefore, the Group defers these fees and recognises them over the estimated lives of the contracts, in line with the provision of investment management services.\n\nCosts which are directly attributable and incremental to securing new non-participating investment contracts are deferred. This asset is subsequently amortised over the period of the provision of investment management services and its recoverability is reviewed in circumstances where its carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the asset is greater than its recoverable amount it is written down immediately through fee and commission expense in the income statement. All other costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.\n\n## (N)  Insurance - IFRS 4\n\nAs permitted by IFRS 17, the Group's income statement for the year ended 31 December 2021 has been prepared under IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts . The balance sheets as at 31 December 2023, 31 December 2022 and the opening balance sheet for IFRS 17 transition as at 1 January 2022 are presented under IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts .\n\nProducts sold by the life insurance business are classified into three categories: insurance contracts, participating investment contracts and non-participating investment contracts.\n\nFor certain investment contracts, the contract can be partly invested in units which contain a discretionary participation feature (DPF) and partly in units without. Where switching levels for similar contracts are deemed to be significant, new investment contracts which contain an option to switch into investment contracts with DPF have been classified as participating investment contracts. Where the switching levels are not deemed to be significant, a new contract is split, with units containing a DPF being allocated as a participating investment contract and the units without a DPF as a non-participating investment contract.\n\nThe general insurance business issues only insurance contracts.\n\n## (1) Life insurance business\n\n## (i) Accounting for insurance and participating investment contracts\n\n## Premiums and claims\n\nPremiums received in respect of insurance and participating investment contracts are recognised as revenue when due except for unit-linked contracts on which premiums are recognised as revenue when received. Claims are recorded as an expense on the earlier of the maturity date or the date on which the claim is notified.\n\n## Liabilities\n\nChanges in the value of liabilities are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims and changes in insurance and investment contract liabilities.\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance and participating investment contracts in the Group's with-profit funds: liabilities of the Group's with-profit funds, including guarantees and options embedded within products written by these funds, are stated at their realistic values in accordance with the Prudential Regulation Authority's realistic capital regime, except that projected transfers out of the funds into other Group funds are recorded in the unallocated surplus (see below)\n- \u00b7 Insurance contracts which are not unit-linked or in the Group's with-profit funds: a liability for contractual benefits that are expected to be incurred in the future is recorded when the premiums are recognised. The liability is calculated by estimating the future cash flows over the duration of in-force policies and discounting them back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence. The liability will vary with movements in interest rates and with the cost of life insurance and annuity benefits where future mortality is uncertain",

        "page_content": "## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\nAssumptions are made in respect of all material factors affecting future cash flows, including future interest rates, mortality and costs.\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance and participating investment contracts which are unit-linked; Liabilities for unit-linked insurance and participating investment contracts are stated at the bid value of units plus an additional allowance where appropriate (such as for any excess of future expenses over charges). The liability is increased or reduced by the change in the unit prices and is reduced by policy administration fees, mortality and surrender charges and any withdrawals. Benefit claims in excess of the account balances incurred in the period are also charged through insurance claims and changes in insurance and investment contract liabilities. Revenue consists of fees deducted for mortality, policy administration and surrender charges\n\n## Unallocated surplus\n\nAny amounts in the with-profit funds not yet determined as being due to policyholders or shareholders are recognised as an unallocated surplus which is shown separately from liabilities arising from insurance and participating investment contracts.\n\n## (ii) Accounting for non-participating investment contracts\n\nThe accounting policy is consistent with M(4) above, except that investment returns (including movements in fair value and investment income) allocated to those contracts are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims and changes in insurance and investment contract liabilities.\n\n## (2)  General insurance business\n\nThe Group both underwrites and acts as intermediary in the sale of general insurance products. Underwriting premiums are included in insurance premium income, net of refunds, in the period in which insurance cover is provided to the customer; premiums received relating to future periods are deferred in the balance sheet within liabilities arising from insurance and participating investment contracts on a basis that reflects the length of time for which contracts have been in-force and the projected incidence of risk over the term of the contract and only credited to the income statement when earned. Broking commission is recognised when the underwriter accepts the risk of providing insurance cover to the customer. Where appropriate, provision is made for the effect of future policy terminations based upon past experience.\n\nThe underwriting business makes provision for the estimated cost of claims notified but not settled and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. The provision for the cost of claims notified but not settled is based upon a best estimate of the cost of settling the outstanding claims after taking into account all known facts. In those cases where there is insufficient information to determine the required provision, statistical techniques are used which take into account the cost of claims that have recently been settled and make assumptions about the future development of the outstanding cases. Similar statistical techniques are used to determine the provision for claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. Claims liabilities are not discounted.\n\n## (3)  Liability adequacy test\n\nAt each balance sheet date liability adequacy tests are performed to ensure the adequacy of insurance and participating investment contract liabilities net of related deferred cost assets and value of in-force business. In performing these tests, current best estimates of discounted future contractual cash flows and claims handling and policy administration expenses, as well as investment income from the assets backing such liabilities, are used. Any deficiency is immediately charged to the income statement, initially by writing off the relevant assets and subsequently by establishing a provision for losses arising from liability adequacy tests.\n\n## (4)  Reinsurance\n\nThe presentation of contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for amounts payable on one or more other contracts issued by the Group is dependent on whether the contract with the reinsurer transfers significant insurance risk to the reinsurer. Where the reinsurance contract transfers significant insurance risk, it is classified as an insurance contract and the asset is recognised separately on the balance sheet. Where the reinsurance contract does not transfer significant insurance risk to the reinsurer, the assets arising from contracts held with reinsurers are presented within financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## (i) Contracts with reinsurers that transfer significant insurance risk\n\nAmounts recoverable from or due to reinsurers are measured consistently with the amounts associated with the reinsured contracts and in accordance with the terms of each reinsurance contract and are regularly reviewed for impairment. Premiums payable for reinsurance contracts are recognised as an expense when due within insurance premium income. Changes in the reinsurance recoverable assets are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims and changes in insurance and investment contract liabilities.\n\n## (ii) Contracts with reinsurers that do not transfer significant insurance risk\n\nContracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk to the reinsurer are recognised within financial assets at fair value through profit or loss as they are within a portfolio of financial assets that is managed, and whose performance is evaluated, on a fair value basis. These contracts, while legally reinsurance contracts, do not meet the definition of a reinsurance contract under IFRS. Investment returns (including movements in fair value and investment income) allocated to these contracts are recognised in insurance claims and changes in insurance and investment contract liabilities.\n\n## (O)  Foreign currency translation\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). Foreign currency transactions are translated into the appropriate functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when recognised in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow or net investment hedges. Non-monetary assets that are measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Translation differences on equities and similar non-monetary items held at fair value through profit and loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on nonmonetary financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, such as equity shares, are included in the fair value reserve in equity unless the asset is a hedged item in a fair value hedge.",

On disposal or liquidation of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of exchange differences relating to that foreign operation is reclassified from equity and included in determining the profit or loss arising on disposal or liquidation.\n\n## (P)  Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nProvisions are recognised in respect of present obligations arising from past events where it is probable that outflows of resources will be required to settle the obligations and they can be reliably estimated.\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence depends on the outcome of uncertain future events or those present obligations where the outflows of resources are uncertain or cannot be measured reliably. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless they are remote.\n\nProvision is made for expected credit losses in respect of irrevocable undrawn loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts (see (H) above).\n\n## (Q)  Share capital\n\nIncremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the acquisition of a business are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Dividends paid on the Group's ordinary shares are recognised as a reduction in equity in the period in which they are paid.\n\nWhere the Company or any member of the Group purchases the Company's share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from shareholders' equity as treasury shares until they are cancelled; if these shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders' equity.\n\n## (R)  Cash and cash equivalents\n\nFor the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and non-mandatory deposits held with central banks, mandatory deposits held with central banks in demand accounts and amounts due from banks with an original maturity of less than three months that are available to finance the Group's day-to-day operations.\n\n## Note 3: Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the Group's financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in applying the accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts which differ from those estimates. Estimates, judgements and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In preparing the financial statements, the Group has considered the impact of climate-related risks on its financial position and performance. While the effects of climate change represent a source of uncertainty, the Group does not consider there to be a material impact on its judgements and estimates from the physical, transition and other climate-related risks in the short term.\n\nThe significant judgements, apart from those involving estimation, made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies in these financial statements (critical judgements) and the key sources of estimation uncertainty that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year (key sources of estimation uncertainty), which together are considered critical to the Group's results and financial position, are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Retirement benefit obligations (note 16)\n- \u00b7 Uncertain tax positions (note 19)\n- \u00b7 Fair value of financial instruments (note 21)\n- \u00b7 Allowance for expected credit losses (note 24)\n- \u00b7 Valuation of liabilities arising from insurance business (notes 30 and 36)\n- \u00b7 Regulatory and legal provisions (note 38)\n\n## Consideration of climate change\n\nFinancial statement preparation includes the consideration of the impact of climate change on the Group's financial statements. There has been no material impact identified on the financial reporting judgements and estimates. In particular, the directors considered the impact of climate change in respect of the:\n\n- \u00b7 Going concern of the Group for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements\n- \u00b7 Assessment of impairment of non-financial assets including goodwill\n- \u00b7 Carrying value and useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment\n- \u00b7 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities. These are generally based on market indicators which include the market's assessment of climate risk\n- \u00b7 Initial assessments on expected credit loss, focussing on specific climate-related macroeconomic, physical and transition risk impacts on credit quality at a sector and segment level\n- \u00b7 Forecasting of the Group's future UK taxable profits, which impacts deferred tax recognition\n\nWhilst there is currently no material short-term impact of climate change expected, the Group acknowledges the long-term nature of climate risk and continues to monitor and assess climate risks highlighted in the risk management section on pages 154 to 157 .",

        "page_content": "## Note 4: Segmental analysis\n\nLloyds Banking Group provides a wide range of banking and financial services in the UK and in certain locations overseas.\n\nThe Group Executive Committee (GEC) has been determined to be the chief operating decision-maker, as defined by IFRS 8 Operating Segments , for the Group. The Group's operating segments reflect its organisational and management structures. The GEC reviews the Group's internal reporting based around these segments in order to assess performance and allocate resources. It considers interest income and expense on a net basis and consequently the total interest income and expense for all reportable segments is presented net. The segments are differentiated by the type of products provided and by whether the customers are individuals or corporate entities.\n\nThe segmental results and comparatives are presented on an underlying basis (pre-tax), the basis reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker. The underlying basis is derived from the recognition and measurement principles of IFRS with the effects of the following excluded in arriving at underlying profit:\n\n- \u00b7 Restructuring costs relating to merger, acquisition and integration activities\n- \u00b7 Volatility and other items, which includes the effects of certain asset sales, the volatility relating to the Group's hedging arrangements and that arising in the insurance businesses, the unwind of acquisition-related fair value adjustments and the amortisation of purchased intangible assets\n- \u00b7 Losses from insurance and participating investment contract modifications relating to the enhancement to the Group's longstanding and workplace pension business through the addition of a drawdown feature\n\nFor the purposes of the underlying income statement, operating lease depreciation (net of gains on disposal of operating lease assets) is shown as an adjustment to total income.\n\nThe Group has three operating and reportable segments: Retail; Commercial Banking; and Insurance, Pensions and Investments:\n\n- \u00b7 Retail offers a broad range of financial services products to personal customers, including current accounts, savings, mortgages, credit cards, unsecured loans, motor finance and leasing solutions\n- \u00b7\n- Commercial Banking serves small and medium businesses and corporate and institutional clients, providing lending, transactional banking, working capital management, debt financing and risk management services\n- \u00b7 Insurance, Pensions and Investments offers insurance, investment and pension management products and services\n\nOther comprises income and expenditure not attributed to the Group's operating segments. These amounts include those arising from the Group's equities business, residual net interest income after transfer pricing (which includes the central recovery of the Group's distributions on other equity instruments), in period gains from gilt sales and the unwind of associated hedging costs.\n\nInter-segment services are generally recharged at cost, although some attract a margin. In particular, a profit margin is charged on the internal commission arrangements between the branch network and other distribution channels and the insurance product manufacturing businesses within the Group. Inter-segment lending and deposits are generally entered into at market rates, except that non-interest bearing balances are priced at a rate that reflects the external yield that could be earned on such funds.\n\nFor the majority of those derivative contracts entered into by business units for risk management purposes, the business unit recognises the net interest income or expense on an accrual accounting basis and transfers the remainder of the movement in the fair value of the derivative to the central function where the resulting accounting volatility is managed where possible through the establishment of hedge accounting relationships. Any change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk is also recorded within the central function. This allocation of the fair value of the derivative and change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk avoids accounting asymmetry in segmental results and leads to accounting volatility, which is managed centrally and reported within Other.",

Fees and commissions relating to instruments that are held at fair value through profit or loss are included within net trading income shown in note 7.\n\nIn determining the disaggregation of fees and commissions the Group has considered how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors, including those that are impacted by climate-related factors. It has determined that the above disaggregation by product type provides useful information that does not aggregate items that have substantially different characteristics and is not too detailed.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group held on its balance sheet \u00a3163 million (31 December 2022: \u00a3173 million) in respect of services provided to customers and \u00a369 million (31 December 2022: \u00a374 million) in respect of amounts received from customers for services to be provided after the balance sheet date. Current unsatisfied performance obligations amount to \u00a3172 million (31 December 2022: \u00a3149 million); the Group expects to receive substantially all of this revenue by 2025.\n\nIncome recognised during the year included \u00a332 million (2022: \u00a38 million) in respect of amounts included in the contract liability balance at the start of the year and \u00a32 million (2022: \u00a31 million) in respect of amounts from performance obligations satisfied in previous years.\n\nThe most significant performance obligations undertaken by the Group are in respect of current accounts, the provision of other banking services for commercial customers and credit and debit card services.\n\nIn respect of current accounts, the Group receives fees for the provision of bank account and transaction services such as ATM services, fund transfers, overdraft facilities and other value-added offerings.\n\nFor commercial customers, alongside its provision of current accounts, the Group provides other corporate banking services including factoring and commitments to provide loan financing. Loan commitment fees are included in fees and commissions where the loan is not expected to be drawn down by the customer.\n\nThe Group receives interchange and merchant fees, together with fees for overseas use and cash advances, for provision of card services to cardholders and merchants.\n\n## Note 7: Net trading income (losses)\n\n|                                                                                                         | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net gains (losses) on financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss:            |           |           |           |\n| Net gains (losses) on financial instruments held for trading 1                                          | 406       | (1,049)   | 141       |\n| Net gains (losses) on other financial instruments mandatorily held at fair value through profit or loss | 16,653    | (17,210)  | 15,943    |\n| Net losses on financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss 2                   | (341)     | (154)     | (65)      |\n|                                                                                                         | 16,718    | (18,413)  | 16,019    |\n| Foreign exchange                                                                                        | 1,418     | (1,063)   | 606       |\n| Investment property (losses) gains (note 27)                                                            | (87)      | (511)     | 575       |\n| Net trading income (losses)                                                                             | 18,049    | (19,987)  | 17,200    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2 Excludes gains and losses arising from non-participating investment contracts, which are presented separately on the face of the income statement.",

Awards are made within limits set by the rules of the plan, with the limits determining the maximum number of shares that can be awarded equating to three times annual salary. In exceptional circumstances this may increase to four times annual salary.\n\nAt the end of the performance period for the 2021 grant, the targets had not been fully met and therefore these awards vested in 2023 at a rate of 43.70 per cent.\n\nThe Executive Group Ownership awards were replaced by Long Term Share Plan awards in 2021.\n\n|                            | 2023 Number of shares   | 2022 Number of shares   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Outstanding at 1 January   | 202,394,509             | 350,873,627             |\n| Vested                     | (66,555,435)            | (50,703,778)            |\n| Forfeited                  | (96,034,781)            | (98,741,356)            |\n| Dividend award             | -                       | 966,016                 |\n| Outstanding at 31 December | 39,804,293              | 202,394,509             |",

The expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of the closing daily share price over the most recent period that is commensurate with the expected life of the option. The historical volatility is compared to the implied volatility generated from market traded options in the Group's shares to assess the reasonableness of the historical volatility and adjustments made where appropriate.\n\n## Share Incentive Plans Matching shares\n\nThe Group undertakes to match shares purchased by employees up to the value of \u00a345 per month; these matching shares are held in trust for a mandatory period of three years on the employee's behalf, during which period the employee is entitled to any dividends paid on such shares. The award is subject to a non-market based condition: if an employee leaves within this three-year period for other than a 'good' reason, all of the matching shares are forfeited. Similarly, if the employees sell their purchased shares within three years, their matching shares are forfeited.\n\nThe number of shares awarded relating to matching shares in 2023 was 43,945,238 (2022: 43,378,504), with an average fair value of \u00a30.46 (2022: \u00a30.45), based on market prices at the date of award.\n\n## Fixed share awards\n\nFixed share awards were introduced in 2014 in order to ensure that total fixed remuneration is commensurate with role and to provide a competitive reward package for certain Lloyds Banking Group employees, with an appropriate balance of fixed and variable remuneration, in line with regulatory requirements. The fixed share awards are delivered in Lloyds Banking Group plc shares, and were initially released over five years with 20 per cent being released each year following the year of award. From June 2020, the fixed share awards are released over three years with one third being released each year following the year of award. The number of shares purchased in relation to fixed share awards in 2023 was 1,790,243 (2022: 7,261,080) with an average fair value of \u00a30.46 (2022: \u00a30.47) based on market prices at the date of the award.\n\nThe fixed share award is not subject to any performance conditions, performance adjustment or clawback. On an employee leaving the Group, there is no change to the timeline for which shares will become unrestricted.\n\nSince the beginning of 2023 the number of recipients of these awards has been reduced to the executive directors only.\n\n## Free shares\n\nAn award of shares may be made annually to employees up to a maximum of \u00a33,600. The shares awarded are held in trust for a mandatory period of three years on the employee's behalf, during which period the employee is entitled to any dividends paid on such shares. The award is subject to a non-market based condition. If an employee leaves the Group within this three-year period for other than a 'good' reason, all of the shares awarded will be forfeited.\n\nThere have not been any awards made since 2021.",

All significant schemes are based in the UK, with the three most significant being the main sections of the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1, the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 2 and the HBOS Final Salary Pension Scheme. At 31 December 2023, these schemes represented 94  per cent of the Group's total gross defined benefit pension assets (2022: 94 per cent). These schemes provide retirement benefits calculated as a proportion of final pensionable salary depending upon the length of pensionable service; the minimum retirement age under the rules of the schemes at 31 December 2023 is generally 55, although certain categories of member are deemed to have a protected right to retire at 50 .\n\nThe Group operates both funded and unfunded pension arrangements; the majority, including the three most significant schemes, are funded schemes in the UK. All of these UK funded schemes are operated as separate legal entities under trust law, are in compliance with the Pensions Act 2004 and are managed by a Trustee Board (the Trustee) whose role is to ensure that their scheme is administered in accordance with the scheme rules and relevant legislation, and to safeguard the assets in the best interests of all members and beneficiaries. The Trustee is solely responsible for setting investment policy and for agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the funding valuation process. The Board of Trustees must be composed of representatives of the scheme membership along with a combination of independent and employer appointed trustees to comply with legislation and scheme rules.\n\nA valuation to determine the funding status of each scheme is carried out at least every three years, whereby scheme assets are measured at market value and liabilities (technical provisions) are measured using prudent assumptions. If a deficit is identified a recovery plan is agreed between the employer and the scheme Trustee and sent to the Pensions Regulator for review.  The Group does not provide for these deficit contributions as the future economic benefits arising from these contributions are expected to be available to the Group. The Group's overseas defined benefit pension schemes are subject to local regulatory arrangements.\n\nThe Group has completed the triennial valuation of its main defined benefit pension schemes as at 31 December 2022. Following a fixed contribution of \u00a3800 million in the first half of 2023, a residual aggregate deficit of \u00a3250 million was agreed with the Trustee which the Group paid in December 2023. There will be no further deficit contributions, fixed or variable, for this triennial period (to 31 December 2025).\n\nThe deficit contributions are in addition to the regular contributions to meet benefits accruing over the year, and to cover the expenses of running the schemes. The Group expects to pay contributions of at least \u00a30.1 billion to its defined benefit schemes in 2024.",

        "page_content": "## Note 16: Retirement benefit obligations continued\n\nDuring 2009, the Group made one-off contributions to the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1 and Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 2 in the form of interests in limited liability partnerships for each of the two schemes which hold assets to provide security for the Group's obligations to the two schemes. At 31 December 2023, the limited liability partnerships held assets of \u00a36.2 billion. The limited liability partnerships are consolidated fully in the Group's balance sheet.\n\nThe Group has also established three private limited companies which hold assets to provide security for the Group's obligations to the HBOS Final Salary Pension Scheme, a section of the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1 and the Lloyds Bank Offshore Pension Scheme. At 31 December 2023 these held assets of \u00a34.1 billion in aggregate. The private limited companies are consolidated fully in the Group's balance sheet. The terms of these arrangements require the Group to maintain assets in these vehicles to agreed minimum values in order to secure obligations owed to the relevant Group pension schemes. The Group has satisfied this requirement during 2023.\n\nThe last funding valuations of other Group schemes were carried out on a number of different dates. In order to report the position under IAS 19 as at 31 December 2023, the most recent valuation results for all schemes have been updated by qualified independent actuaries. The funding valuations use a more prudent approach to setting the discount rate and more conservative longevity and inflation assumptions than the IAS 19 valuations.\n\nIn a judgment in 2018, the High Court confirmed the requirement to equalise the Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) benefits of men and women accruing between 1990 and 1997 from contracting out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme. The Group recognised a past service cost of \u00a3108 million in respect of equalisation in 2018 and, following agreement of the detailed implementation approach with the Trustee, a further \u00a333 million was recognised in 2019. A further hearing was held during 2020 which confirmed the extent of the Trustee's obligation to revisit past transfers out of the schemes. The amount of any additional liability as a result of this judgment is not considered likely to be material.\n\nThe Group is aware of the High Court ruling in the case of Virgin Media Ltd v NTL Pension Trustees II Ltd & Ors and is waiting for the outcome of the appeal, scheduled for 25 June 2024, and any additional hearings, as well as confirmation from the Government as to whether it will issue new regulations in response to this issue.\n\n## (ii) Amounts in the financial statements\n\n|                                                        | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Amount included in the balance sheet                   |           |           |\n| Present value of funded obligations                    | (30,201)  | (28,965)  |\n| Fair value of scheme assets                            | 33,733    | 32,697    |\n| Net amount recognised in the balance sheet             | 3,532     | 3,732     |\n|                                                        | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n| Net amount recognised in the balance sheet             |           |           |\n| At 1 January                                           | 3,732     | 4,404     |\n| Net defined benefit pension credit (charge)            | 80        | (123)     |\n| Actuarial (losses) gains on defined benefit obligation | (1,304)   | 17,222    |\n| Return on plan assets                                  | (318)     | (20,302)  |\n| Employer contributions                                 | 1,342     | 2,530     |\n| Exchange and other adjustments                         | -         | 1         |\n| At 31 December                                         | 3,532     | 3,732     |\n|                                                        | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n| Movements in the defined benefit obligation            |           |           |\n| At 1 January                                           | (28,965)  | (47,130)  |\n| Current service cost                                   | (88)      | (180)     |\n| Interest expense                                       | (1,394)   | (902)     |\n| Remeasurements:                                        |           |           |\n| Actuarial gains - demographic assumptions              | 153       | 288       |\n| Actuarial losses - experience                          | (1,067)   | (1,186)   |\n| Actuarial (losses) gains - financial assumptions       | (390)     | 18,120    |\n| Benefits paid                                          | 1,544     | 2,048     |\n| Past service cost                                      | (5)       | (4)       |\n| Settlements                                            | -         | 13        |\n| Exchange and other adjustments                         | 11        | (32)      |\n| At 31 December                                         | (30,201)  | (28,965)  |",

It is now expected that from 2030 RPI will be aligned with CPIH (the Consumer Price Index including owner occupiers' housing costs). To determine the RPI assumption a term-dependent inflation curve has been used adjusting for an assumed inflation risk premium. A gap of 130 basis points has been assumed between RPI and CPI in 2024 reducing to 120 basis points in 2025, 110 basis points in 2026 and 100 basis points from 2027 to 2030; thereafter a 10 basis point gap has been assumed.\n\n|                                                                       | Men        | Men        | Women      | Women      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                                       | 2023 Years | 2022 Years | 2023 Years | 2022 Years |\n| Life expectancy for member aged 60, on the valuation date             | 26.7       | 26.7       | 28.7       | 28.8       |\n| Life expectancy for member aged 60, 15 years after the valuation date | 27.8       | 27.8       | 29.8       | 30.0       |\n\nThe mortality assumptions used in the UK scheme valuations are based on standard tables published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries which were adjusted in line with the actual experience of the relevant schemes. The table shows that a member retiring at age 60 at 31 December 2023 is assumed to live for, on average, 26.7 years for a male and 28.7 years for a female. In practice there will be much variation between individual members but these assumptions are expected to be appropriate across all members. It is assumed that younger members will live longer in retirement than those retiring now. This reflects the expectation that mortality rates will continue to fall over time as medical science and standards of living improve. To illustrate the degree of improvement assumed, the table also shows the life expectancy for members aged 45 now, when they retire in 15 years time at age 60. The Group uses the CMI mortality projections model and in line with actuarial industry recommendations has placed no weight on 2020 and 2021 mortality experience and 25 per cent weight on 2022 mortality experience.\n\n## (v)  Amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows\n\n## Risk exposure of the defined benefit schemes\n\nWhile the Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity-specific or scheme-specific risks in its defined benefit pension schemes, it is exposed to a number of significant risks, detailed below:\n\nInflation rate risk: The majority of the plans' benefit obligations are linked to inflation both in deferment and once in payment. Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although this will be materially offset by holdings of inflation-linked gilts and, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.\n\nInterest rate risk: The defined benefit obligation is determined using a discount rate derived from yields on AA-rated corporate bonds. A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities although this will be materially offset by an increase in the value of bond holdings and through the use of derivatives.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 16: Retirement benefit obligations continued\n\nLongevity risk: The majority of the schemes' obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities.\n\nInvestment risk: Scheme assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of debt securities, equities and other return-seeking assets. If the assets underperform the discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation, it will reduce the surplus or increase the deficit. Volatility in asset values and the discount rate will lead to volatility in the net pension asset on the Group's balance sheet and in other comprehensive income. To a lesser extent this will also lead to volatility in the pension expense in the Group's income statement.\n\nIn addition, the schemes themselves are exposed to liquidity risk with the need to ensure that liquid assets held are sufficient to meet benefit payments as they fall due and there is sufficient collateral available to support their hedging activity.\n\nThe ultimate cost of the defined benefit obligations to the Group will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions made. The assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost may be higher or lower than expected.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe effect of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions on the value of scheme liabilities and the resulting pension charge in the Group's income statement and on the net defined benefit pension scheme asset, for the Group's three most significant schemes, is set out below. The sensitivities provided assume that all other assumptions and the value of the schemes' assets remain unchanged, and are not intended to represent changes that are at the extremes of possibility. The calculations are approximate in nature and full detailed calculations could lead to a different result. It is unlikely that isolated changes to individual assumptions will be experienced in practice. Due to the correlation of assumptions, aggregating the effects of these isolated changes may not be a reasonable estimate of the actual effect of simultaneous changes in multiple assumptions.\n\n|                                             | Effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions   | Effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions   | Effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions                 | Effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions                 |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                             | Increase (decrease) in the                              | Increase (decrease) in the                              | (Increase) decrease in the net defined benefit pension scheme surplus | (Increase) decrease in the net defined benefit pension scheme surplus |\n|                                             | 2023 \u00a3m                                                 | 2022 \u00a3m                                                 | 2023 \u00a3m                                                               | 2022 \u00a3m                                                               |\n| Inflation (including pension increases) 1 : |                                                         |                                                         |                                                                       |                                                                       |\n| Increase of 0.1 per cent                    | 11                                                      | 13                                                      | 224                                                                   | 251                                                                   |\n| Decrease of 0.1 per cent                    | (12)                                                    | (13)                                                    | (235)                                                                 | (245)                                                                 |\n| Discount rate 2 :                           |                                                         |                                                         |                                                                       |                                                                       |\n| Increase of 0.1 per cent                    | (22)                                                    | (25)                                                    | (355)                                                                 | (379)                                                                 |\n| Decrease of 0.1 per cent                    | 21                                                      | 24                                                      | 363                                                                   | 388                                                                   |\n| Expected life expectancy of members:        |                                                         |                                                         |                                                                       |                                                                       |\n| Increase of one year                        | 45                                                      | 38                                                      | 927                                                                   | 745                                                                   |\n| Decrease of one year                        | (46)                                                    | (39)                                                    | (946)                                                                 | (762)                                                                 |\n\n## Sensitivity analysis method and assumptions\n\nThe sensitivity analysis above reflects the impact on the liabilities of the Group's three most significant schemes which account for over 90 per cent of the Group's defined benefit obligations. While differences in the underlying liability profiles for the remainder of the Group's pension arrangements mean that they may exhibit slightly different sensitivities to variations in these assumptions, the sensitivities provided above are indicative of the impact across the Group as a whole.\n\nThe inflation assumption sensitivity applies to the assumed rate of increase in both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Retail Price Index (RPI), and includes the impact on the rate of increases to pensions, both before and after retirement. These pension increases are linked to inflation (either CPI or RPI) subject to certain minimum and maximum limits.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis (including the inflation sensitivity) does not include the impact of any change in the rate of salary increases as pensionable salaries have been frozen since 2 April 2014.\n\nThe life expectancy assumption has been applied by allowing for an increase/decrease in life expectation from age 60 of one year, based upon the approximate weighted average age for each scheme. While this is an approximate approach and will not give the same result as a one year increase in life expectancy at every age, it provides an appropriate indication of the potential impact on the schemes from changes in life expectancy.\n\nThere was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from the prior year.",

Whilst c.50 per cent are held to generate the long-term returns required to support the funding position of the schemes, the remainder is invested in liability-driven investment (LDI) strategies which hedge the material risk exposures of the schemes. The investment strategy is not static and will evolve to reflect the structure of liabilities within the schemes. Specific strategies for each pension plan are independently determined by the responsible governance body for each scheme and in consultation with the employer.\n\nA significant goal of the strategies adopted by the schemes is to reduce volatility caused by changes in market expectations of interest rates and inflation. In the main schemes, this is achieved by investing scheme assets in bonds, primarily fixed interest gilts and index linked gilts, and by entering into interest rate and inflation swap arrangements. The assets in these LDI strategies represented  50 per cent of scheme assets at 31 December 2023.\n\nThese investments are structured to take into account the profile of scheme liabilities and actively managed to reflect both changing market conditions and changes to the liability profile. At 31 December 2023 the asset-liability matching strategy mitigated c .117 per cent of the liability sensitivity to interest rate movements and c.125 per cent of the liability sensitivity to inflation movements. In addition, a small amount of interest rate sensitivity arises through holdings of corporate and other debt securities. The higher level of hedging provides greater protection to the funding position of the schemes.\n\nOn 28 January 2020, the main schemes entered into a \u00a310 billion longevity insurance arrangement to hedge part of the schemes' exposure to unexpected increases in life expectancy. This arrangement forms part of the schemes' investment portfolio and will provide income to the schemes in the event that pensions are paid out for longer than expected. The transaction was structured as a pass-through with Scottish Widows as the insurer, and onwards reinsurance to Pacific Life Re Limited.\n\nOn 28 January 2022, the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1 entered into an additional \u00a35.5 billion longevity insurance arrangement. The transaction is structured as a pass-through with Scottish Widows as the insurer, and onwards reinsurance to SCOR SE - UK Branch.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 the value of scheme assets included \u00a3(160) million representing the value of the longevity swaps (after allowing for the impact on the IAS 19 liabilities of the revisions to the base mortality assumptions).\n\nIn total the schemes have now hedged c.30 per cent of their longevity risk exposure.\n\n## Maturity profile of defined benefit obligation\n\nThe following table provides information on the weighted average duration of the defined benefit pension obligation and the distribution and timing of benefit payments:\n\n|                                                    | 2023 Years   | 2022 Years   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Duration of the defined benefit obligation         | 13           | 15           |\n| Maturity analysis of benefits expected to be paid: |              |              |\n|                                                    | 2023 \u00a3m      | 2022 \u00a3m      |\n| Within 12 months                                   | 1,697        | 1,409        |\n| Between 1 and 2 years                              | 1,513        | 1,464        |\n| Between 2 and 5 years                              | 4,886        | 4,678        |\n| Between 5 and 10 years                             | 9,159        | 8,930        |\n| Between 10 and 15 years                            | 9,176        | 9,296        |\n| Between 15 and 25 years                            | 16,882       | 17,479       |\n| Between 25 and 35 years                            | 12,343       | 12,720       |\n| Between 35 and 45 years                            | 6,121        | 6,138        |\n| In more than 45 years                              | 1,595        | 1,685        |\n\n## Maturity analysis method and assumptions\n\nThe projected benefit payments are based on the assumptions underlying the assessment of the obligations, including allowance for expected future inflation. They are shown in their undiscounted form and therefore appear large relative to the discounted assessment of the defined benefit obligations recognised in the Group's balance sheet. They are in respect of benefits that have been accrued prior to the respective year end date only and make no allowance for any benefits that may have been accrued subsequently.\n\n## Defined contribution schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and overseas, principally Your Tomorrow and the defined contribution sections of the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1.\n\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2023 the charge to the income statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was \u00a3434 million (2022: \u00a3330 million; 2021: \u00a3302 million), representing the contributions payable by the employer in accordance with each scheme's rules.",

The principal scheme relates to former Lloyds Bank staff and under this scheme the Group has undertaken to meet the cost of post-retirement healthcare for all eligible former employees (and their dependants) who retired prior to 1 January 1996. The Group has entered into an insurance contract to provide these benefits and a provision has been made for the estimated cost of future insurance premiums payable.\n\nFor the principal post-retirement healthcare scheme, the latest actuarial valuation of the liability was carried out at 31 December 2023 by qualified independent actuaries.

Other services supplied pursuant to legislation relate primarily to costs incurred in connection with client asset assurance and with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements associated with the audit of the Group's financial statements filed on its Form 20-F.\n\nOther audit-related fees: This category includes fees in respect of services for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the financial statements, for example acting as reporting accountants in respect of debt prospectuses required by the Listing Rules.\n\nAll other fees: This category includes other assurance services not related to the performance of the audit or review of the financial statements, for example, the review of controls operated by the Group on behalf of a third party. The auditors are not engaged to provide tax services.\n\nIt is the Group's policy to use the auditors only on assignments in cases where their knowledge of the Group means that it is neither efficient nor cost effective to employ another firm of accountants.\n\nThe Group has procedures that are designed to ensure auditor independence, including prohibiting certain non-audit services. All audit and non-audit assignments must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee on an individual engagement basis; for certain types of non-audit engagements where the fee is 'de minimis' the Audit Committee has pre-approved all assignments subject to confirmation by management. On a quarterly basis, the Audit Committee receives and reviews a report detailing all pre-approved services and amounts paid to the auditors for such pre-approved services.\n\nDuring the year, the auditors also earned fees payable by entities outside the consolidated Lloyds Banking Group in respect of the following:\n\n|                                                                                   | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |   2021 \u00a3m |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Audits of Group pension schemes                                                   | 0.5       | 0.4       |       0.4 |\n| Audits of the unconsolidated Open-Ended Investment Companies managed by the Group | 0.2       | 0.2       |       0.3 |\n| Reviews of the financial position of corporate and other borrowers                | -         | -         |       0.3 |",

The increase in applicable tax rate from 2022 relates to the change in statutory tax rate effective from 1 April 2023.  An explanation of the relationship between tax expense and accounting profit is set out below.\n\n|                                                          | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 1 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|\n| Profit before tax                                        | 7,503     | 4,782       | 6,902     |\n| UK corporation tax thereon                               | (1,763)   | (909)       | (1,311)   |\n| Impact of surcharge on banking profits                   | (305)     | (339)       | (439)     |\n| Non-deductible costs: conduct charges                    | (29)      | (5)         | (185)     |\n| Non-deductible costs: bank levy                          | (35)      | (28)        | (22)      |\n| Other non-deductible costs                               | (106)     | (70)        | (83)      |\n| Non-taxable income                                       | 80        | 138         | 40        |\n| Tax relief on coupons on other equity instruments        | 124       | 83          | 81        |\n| Tax-exempt gains on disposals                            | 35        | 67          | 140       |\n| Tax losses where no deferred tax recognised              | (2)       | 11          | (1)       |\n| Remeasurement of deferred tax due to rate changes        | (14)      | 60          | 954       |\n| Differences in overseas tax rates                        | 6         | (63)        | (19)      |\n| Policyholder tax                                         | (61)      | (65)        | (63)      |\n| Deferred tax asset in respect of life assurance expenses | 84        | 21          | (69)      |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years                    | -         | 243         | (40)      |\n| Tax effect of share of results of joint ventures         | 1         | (3)         | -         |\n| Tax expense                                              | (1,985)   | (859)       | (1,017)   |\n\nThe tax impact of the IFRS 17 adjustments is recognised at the rate of tax at which it is expected to be realised. For 2022, this includes the impact of the transitional tax provisions to allow spreading of life companies' profit or loss arising on transition to IFRS 17 over 10 years.\n\nOn 17 November 2022 the UK Government confirmed its intention to implement the G20-OECD Inclusive Framework Pillar 2 rules in the UK, including a Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax rule. This legislation, which was enacted in 2023, will seek to ensure that UKheadquartered multinational enterprises pay a minimum tax rate of 15 per cent on UK and overseas profits arising after 31 December 2023. As the UK rate of corporation tax in 2024 will be 25 per cent, and the Group's business is primarily in the UK, the impact of these rules on the Group is not expected to be material.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 19: Tax continued\n\nAt 31 December 2023 the Group carried net deferred tax assets on its balance sheet of \u00a35,185 million (2022: \u00a36,422 million) principally relating to tax losses carried forward.\n\nEstimation of income taxes includes the assessment of recoverability of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are considered more likely than not to be recoverable based on existing tax laws and forecasts of future taxable profits against which the underlying tax deductions can be utilised. The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of \u00a34,783 million (2022: \u00a35,066 million) in respect of trading losses carried forward. Substantially all of these losses have arisen in Bank of Scotland plc and Lloyds Bank plc, and they will be utilised as taxable profits arise in those legal entities in future periods.\n\nThe Group's expectations of future UK taxable profits require management judgement, and take into account the Group's long-term financial and strategic plans and anticipated future tax-adjusting items. In making this assessment, account is taken of business plans, the Board-approved operating plan and the expected future economic outlook as set out in the strategic report, as well as the risks associated with future regulatory, climate-related and other change, in order to produce a base case forecast of future UK taxable profits. Under current law there is no expiry date for UK trading losses not yet utilised, and given the forecast of future profitability and the Group's commitment to the UK market, in management's judgement it is more likely than not that the value of the losses will be recovered by the Group while still operating as a going concern. Banking tax losses that arose before 1 April 2015 can only be used against 25 per cent of taxable profits arising after 1 April 2016, and they cannot be used to reduce the surcharge on banking profits. These restrictions in utilisation mean that the value of the deferred tax asset in respect of tax losses is only expected to be fully recovered by 2036 (2022: 2036) in the base case forecast. The rate of recovery of the Group's tax loss asset is not a straight line, being affected by the relative profitability of the different legal entities in future periods, and the relative size of their tax losses carried forward. It is expected in the base case that 90 per cent of the value will be recovered by 2034, when Bank of Scotland plc will have utilised all of its available tax losses. It is possible that future tax law changes could materially affect the timing of recovery and the value of these losses ultimately realised by the Group.\n\nA deferred tax asset of \u00a3118 million (2022: \u00a38 million) has been recognised in respect of the future tax benefit of certain expenses of the life assurance business. The increase is driven by higher forecast investment returns in the long term projections for the life insurance business due to interest rate rises which increases the amount of expenses expected to be utilised . The deferred tax asset not recognised in respect of the remaining expenses is \u00a388 million (2022: \u00a3339 million), and these expenses can be carried forward indefinitely. The unrecognised deferred tax asset has decreased in 2023 due to utilisation of expenses in the year and the higher expected investment returns in the long term projections for the life insurance business reducing the net amount of unutilised expenses in the long term.\n\n## Deferred tax not recognised\n\nDeferred tax assets of \u00a3160 million (2022: \u00a3156 million) have not been recognised in respect of \u00a3635 million of UK tax losses and other temporary differences which can only be used to offset future capital gains. UK capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nNo deferred tax has been recognised in respect of foreign trade losses where it is not more likely than not that we will be able to utilise them in future periods. Of the asset not recognised, \u00a351 million (2022: \u00a353 million) relates to losses that will expire if not used within 20 years, and \u00a39 million (2022: \u00a39 million) relates to losses with no expiry date.\n\nAs a result of parent company exemptions on dividends from subsidiaries and on capital gains on disposal there are no significant taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint arrangements.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nCritical judgement: The Group believes that its interpretation of the tax rules on group relief are correct\n\nThe Group has an open matter in relation to a claim for group relief of losses incurred in its former Irish banking subsidiary, which ceased trading on 31 December 2010. In 2013, HMRC informed the Group that its interpretation of the UK rules means that the group relief is not available. In 2020, HMRC concluded its enquiry into the matter and issued a closure notice. The  Group's interpretation of the UK rules has not changed and hence it appealed to the First Tier Tax Tribunal, with a hearing having taken place in May 2023. If the final determination of the matter by the judicial process is that HMRC's position is correct, management believes that this would result in an increase in current tax liabilities of approximately \u00a3920 million (including interest) and a reduction in  the Group's deferred tax asset of approximately \u00a3285 million. The Group, following conclusion of the hearing and having taken appropriate advice, does not consider that this is a case where additional tax will ultimately fall due.\n\nThere are a number of other open matters on which the Group is in discussions with HMRC (including the tax treatment of certain costs arising from the divestment of TSB Banking Group plc), none of which is expected to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Note 21: Fair values of financial assets and liabilities\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the carrying value of the Group's financial instrument assets held at fair value was \u00a3253,266 million (2022: \u00a3228,676 million), and its financial instrument liabilities held at fair value was \u00a390,041 million (2022: \u00a381,273 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (1) Fair value measurement\n\nFair value is the price that would be received on sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It is a measure as at a specific date and may be significantly different from the amount which will actually be paid or received on maturity or settlement date.\n\nWherever possible, fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments to those held by the Group. Where quoted market prices are not available, or are unreliable because of poor liquidity, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use nonmarket observable inputs. Valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models and, where appropriate, comparison to instruments with characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group. The Group measures valuation adjustments for its derivative exposures on the same basis as the derivatives are managed.\n\nThe carrying amount of the following financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of fair value: cash and balances at central banks, items in the course of collection from banks, items in course of transmission to banks and notes in circulation. Liabilities arising from non-participating investment contracts are carried at fair value.\n\nBecause a variety of estimation techniques are employed and significant estimates made, comparisons of fair values between financial institutions may not be meaningful. Readers of these financial statements are thus advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Group's financial position.\n\nFair value information is not provided for items that are not financial instruments or for other assets and liabilities which are not carried at fair value in the Group's consolidated balance sheet. These items include intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and shareholders' equity. These items are material and accordingly the Group believes that any fair value information presented would not represent the underlying value of the Group.\n\n## Valuation control framework\n\nThe key elements of the control framework for the valuation of financial instruments include model validation, product implementation review and independent price verification. These functions are carried out by appropriately skilled risk and finance teams, independent of the business area responsible for the products.\n\nModel validation covers both qualitative and quantitative elements relating to new models. In respect of new products, a product implementation review is conducted pre and post-trading. Pre-trade testing ensures that the new model is integrated into the Group's systems and that the profit and loss and risk reporting are consistent throughout the trade lifecycle. Post-trade testing examines the explanatory power of the implemented model, actively monitoring model parameters and comparing in-house pricing to external sources. Independent price verification procedures cover financial instruments carried at fair value. The frequency of the review is matched to the availability of independent data, monthly being the minimum. Valuation differences in breach of established thresholds are escalated to senior management. The results from independent pricing and valuation reserves are reviewed monthly by senior management.\n\nFormal committees, consisting of senior risk, finance and business management, meet at least quarterly to discuss and approve valuations in more judgemental areas, in particular for unquoted equities, structured credit, derivatives and the credit valuation adjustment (CVA), funding valuation adjustment (FVA) and other valuation adjustments.\n\n## Valuation of financial assets and liabilities\n\nAssets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified into three levels according to the quality and reliability of information used to determine the fair values.\n\n## Level 1\n\nLevel 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Products classified as level 1 predominantly comprise listed equity shares, treasury bills and other government securities.\n\n## Level 2\n\nLevel 2 valuations are those where quoted market prices are not available, for example where the instrument is traded in a market that is not considered to be active or valuation techniques are used to determine fair value and where these techniques use inputs that are based significantly on observable market data. Examples of such financial instruments include most over-the-counter derivatives, financial institution issued securities, certificates of deposit and certain asset-backed securities.\n\n## Level 3\n\nLevel 3 portfolios are those where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instrument's valuation is not based on observable market data. Such instruments would include the Group's venture capital and unlisted equity investments which are valued using various valuation techniques that require significant management judgement in determining appropriate assumptions, including earnings multiples and estimated future cash flows. Certain of the Group's asset-backed securities, loans and advances recognised at fair value and derivatives are also classified as level 3.\n\nTransfers out of the level 3 portfolio arise when inputs that could have a significant impact on the instrument's valuation become market observable after previously having been non-market observable. In the case of asset-backed securities this can arise if more than one consistent independent source of data becomes available. Conversely, transfers into the portfolio arise when consistent sources of data cease to be available.",

The discount rates are derived from market observable interest rates, a risk margin that reflects loan credit ratings and an incremental illiquidity premium based on historical spreads at origination on similar loans.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nDebt securities measured at fair value and classified as level 2 are valued by discounting expected cash flows using an observable credit spread applicable to the particular instrument.\n\nWhere there is limited trading activity in debt securities, the Group uses valuation models, consensus pricing information from third party pricing services and broker or lead manager quotes to determine an appropriate valuation. Debt securities are classified as level 3 if there is a significant valuation input that cannot be corroborated through market sources or where there are materially inconsistent values for an input. Asset classes classified as level 3 mainly comprise venture capital investments.\n\n## Equity investments\n\nUnlisted equity and fund investments are valued using different techniques in accordance with the Group's valuation policy and International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines.\n\nDepending on the business sector and the circumstances of the investment, unlisted equity valuations are based on earnings multiples, net asset values or discounted cash flows.\n\n- \u00b7 A number of earnings multiples are used in valuing the portfolio including price earnings, earnings before interest and tax and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. The particular multiple selected is appropriate for the size and type of business being valued and is derived by reference to the current market-based multiple. Consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing of comparable businesses when selecting the appropriate multiple\n- \u00b7 Discounted cash flow valuations use estimated future cash flows, usually based on management forecasts, with the application of appropriate exit yields or terminal multiples and discounted using rates appropriate to the specific investment, business sector or recent economic rates of return. Recent transactions involving the sale of similar businesses may sometimes be used as a frame of reference in deriving an appropriate multiple\n- \u00b7 For fund investments the most recent capital account value calculated by the fund manager is used as the basis for the valuation and adjusted, if necessary, to align valuation techniques with the Group's valuation policy\n\nUnlisted equity investments and investments in property partnerships held in the life assurance funds are valued using third party valuations. Management take account of any pertinent information, such as recent transactions and information received on particular investments, to adjust the third party valuations where necessary",

At 31 December 2023 there was a cumulative \u00a390 million decrease in the fair value of these liabilities attributable to changes in credit spread risk; this is determined by reference to the quoted credit spreads of Lloyds Bank plc, the issuing entity within the Group. Of the cumulative amount, an increase of \u00a3234 million arose in 2023 and a decrease of \u00a3519 million arose in 2022.\n\nFor the fair value of collateral pledged in respect of repurchase agreements see note 52.\n\nIn addition to the liabilities above, the Group's non-participating investment contracts are held at fair value through profit or loss and were all categorised as level 2.\n\n## Movements in level 3 portfolio\n\nThe table below analyses movements in the level 3 financial liabilities (excluding derivatives) at fair value portfolio.\n\n|                                                                                                                                               | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                                                                                                                                  | 45        | 37        |\n| Gains recognised in the income statement within other income                                                                                  | (1)       | (4)       |\n| Additions                                                                                                                                     | -         | 33        |\n| Redemptions                                                                                                                                   | (1)       | (3)       |\n| Transfers out of the level 3 portfolio                                                                                                        | (1)       | (18)      |\n| At 31 December                                                                                                                                | 42        | 45        |\n| Gains recognised in the income statement, within other income, relating to the change in fair value of those liabilities  held at 31 December | (1)       | (4)       |",

The carrying amount of the securities is adjusted to reflect the effect of changes in own credit spreads and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nIn the year ended 31 December 2023, the own credit adjustment arising from the fair valuation of \u00a35,265 million  (2022: \u00a35,159 million) of the Group's debt securities in issue designated at fair value through profit or loss resulted in a loss of \u00a3234 million (2022: gain of \u00a3519 million), before tax, recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Trading liabilities in respect of securities sold under repurchase agreements\n\nThe fair value of these liabilities is determined using discounted cash flow techniques. The discount rates are derived from observable repurchase agreement rate curves specific to the type of security sold under the repurchase agreement.\n\n## (C)  Derivatives\n\n## Valuation hierarchy\n\nAll of the Group's derivative assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. At 31 December 2023, such assets totalled \u00a322,356 million (2022: \u00a324,753 million) and liabilities totalled \u00a320,149 million (2022: \u00a324,042 million).

The types of derivatives classified as level 2 and the valuation techniques used include:\n\n- \u00b7 Interest rate swaps which are valued using discounted cash flow models; the most significant inputs into those models are interest rate yield curves which are developed from publicly quoted rates\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange derivatives that do not contain options which are priced using rates available from publicly quoted sources\n- \u00b7 Credit derivatives are valued using standard models with observable inputs, including publicly available yield and credit default swap (CDS) curves\n- \u00b7 Less complex interest rate and foreign exchange option products which are valued using volatility surfaces developed from publicly available interest rate cap, interest rate swaption and other option volatilities; option volatility skew information is derived from a market standard consensus pricing service.\n\nComplex interest rate products where inputs to the valuation are significant and unobservable are classified as level 3.\n\nCertain inputs used to calculate CVA, FVA, and own credit adjustments, are not significant in determining the classification of the derivative and debt instruments. Consequently, these inputs do not form part of the level 3 sensitivities presented.",

These exposures largely relate to the provision of risk management solutions for corporate customers within the Commercial Banking division.\n\nA CVA is taken where the Group has a positive future uncollateralised exposure (asset). A DVA is taken where the Group has a negative future uncollateralised exposure (liability). These adjustments reflect interest rates and expectations of counterparty creditworthiness and the Group's own credit spread respectively.\n\nThe CVA is sensitive to:\n\n- \u00b7 The current size of the mark-to-market position on the uncollateralised asset\n- \u00b7 Expectations of future market volatility of the underlying asset\n- \u00b7 Expectations of counterparty creditworthiness\n\nMarket Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads are used to develop the probability of default for quoted counterparties. For unquoted counterparties, internal credit ratings and market sector CDS curves and recovery rates are used. The loss given default (LGD) is based on market recovery rates and internal credit assessments.\n\nThe combination of a one-notch deterioration in the credit rating of derivative counterparties and a 10  per cent increase in LGD increases the CVA by \u00a350 million. Current market value is used to estimate the projected exposure for products not supported by the model, which are principally complex interest rate options that are traded in very low volumes. For these, the CVA is calculated on an add-on basis (although no such adjustment was required at 31 December 2023).\n\nThe DVA is sensitive to:\n\n- \u00b7 The current size of the mark-to-market position on the uncollateralised liability\n- \u00b7 Expectations of future market volatility of the underlying liability\n- \u00b7 The Group's own CDS spread\n\nA 1 per cent rise in the CDS spread would lead to an increase in the DVA of \u00a375 million.\n\nThe risk exposures that are used for the CVA and DVA calculations are strongly influenced by interest rates. Due to the nature of the Group's business the CVA/DVA exposures tend to be on average the same way around such that the valuation adjustments fall when interest rates rise. A 1 per cent rise in interest rates would lead to a \u00a339 million fall in the overall valuation adjustment to \u00a3118 million. The CVA model used by the Group does not assume any correlation between the level of interest rates and default rates.\n\nThe Group has also recognised a Funding Valuation Adjustment to adjust for the net cost of funding uncollateralised derivative positions. This adjustment is calculated on the expected future exposure discounted at a suitable cost of funds. A 10 basis points increase in the cost of funds will increase the funding valuation adjustment by \u00a312 million.\n\n## (ii) Market liquidity\n\nThe Group includes mid to bid-offer valuation adjustments against the expected cost of closing out the net market risk in the Group's trading positions within a time frame that is consistent with historical trading activity and spreads that the trading desks have accessed historically during the ordinary course of business in normal market conditions.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group's derivative trading business held mid to bid-offer valuation adjustments of \u00a352 million (2022: \u00a361 million).",

The valuation techniques for level 3 financial instruments involve management judgement and estimates, the extent of which depends on the complexity of the instrument and the availability of market observable information. In addition, in line with market practice, the Group applies credit, debit and funding valuation adjustments in determining the fair value of its uncollateralised derivative positions. A description of these adjustments is set out in section (C)(i) above. A quantitative analysis of the sensitivities to market risk arising from the Group's trading portfolios is set out in the tables marked audited on page 190 .\n\n|

The earnings multiples used are derived from those of listed entities operating in the same sector with adjustments made for factors such as the size of the company and the quality of its earnings. The majority of the Group's venture capital investments are valued using an estimate of the company's maintainable earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines. A higher earnings multiple will result in a higher fair value\n\n## Reasonably possible alternative assumptions\n\nValuation techniques applied to many of the Group's level 3 instruments often involve the use of two or more inputs whose relationship is interdependent. The calculation of the effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions included in the table above reflects such relationships.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nReasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of the Group's structured credit investments by flexing credit spreads.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nReasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of swaptions in the Group's derivative portfolios which are priced using industry standard option pricing models. Such models require interest rate volatilities which may be unobservable at longer maturities. To derive reasonably possible alternative valuations these volatility parameters have been flexed within a range of 13 per cent to 200 per cent (2022: 17 per cent to 105 per cent).\n\n## Unlisted equity, venture capital investments and investments in property partnerships\n\nThe valuation techniques used for unlisted equity and venture capital investments vary depending on the nature of the investment. Reasonably possible alternative valuations for these investments have been calculated by reference to the approach taken, as appropriate to the business sector and investment circumstances and as such the following inputs have been considered:\n\n- \u00b7 For valuations derived from earnings multiples, consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing of comparable businesses when selecting an appropriate multiple\n- \u00b7 The discount rates used in discounted cash flow valuations\n- \u00b7 In line with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines, the values of underlying investments in fund investment portfolios\n\n## (3)  Financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost\n\n## (A)  Financial assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Valuation hierarchy\n\nThe table below analyses the fair values of those financial assets of the  Group which are carried at amortised cost by valuation methodology (level 1, 2 or 3, as described on page 257 ).

The fair value of other loans and advances to banks is estimated by discounting the anticipated cash flows at a market discount rate adjusted for the credit spread of the obligor or, where not observable, the credit spread of borrowers of similar credit quality.\n\n## Loans and advances to customers\n\nThe Group provides loans and advances to commercial, corporate and personal customers at both fixed and variable rates.\n\nTo determine the fair value of loans and advances to customers, loans are segregated into portfolios of similar characteristics. A number of techniques are used to estimate the fair value of fixed rate lending; these take account of expected credit losses based on historic trends, prevailing market interest rates and expected future cash flows. For retail exposures, fair value is usually estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows (including interest at contractual rates) at market rates for similar loans offered by the Group and other financial institutions. Certain loans secured on residential properties are made at a fixed rate for a limited period, typically two  to five years, after which the loans revert to the relevant variable rate. The fair value of such loans is estimated by reference to market rates for similar loans of maturity equal to the remaining fixed interest rate period. The fair value of commercial loans is estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows at a rate which reflects the effects of interest rate changes, adjusted for changes in credit risk.\n\n## Reverse repurchase agreements\n\nThe carrying amount is deemed a reasonable approximation of fair value given the short-term nature of these instruments.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nThe fair values of debt securities are determined predominantly from lead manager quotes and, where these are not available, by alternative techniques including reference to credit spreads on similar assets with the same obligor, market standard consensus pricing services, broker quotes and other research data.\n\n## (B)  Financial liabilities\n\n## Valuation hierarchy\n\nThe table below analyses the fair values of those financial liabilities of the  Group which are carried at amortised cost by valuation methodology (level 1, 2 or 3, as described on page 257 ).\n\n|                                            |                   |               | Valuation hierarchy   | Valuation hierarchy   | Valuation hierarchy   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                            | Carrying value \u00a3m | Fair value \u00a3m | Level 1 \u00a3m            | Level 2 \u00a3m            | Level 3 \u00a3m            |\n| At 31 December 2023                        |                   |               |                       |                       |                       |\n| Deposits from banks                        | 6,153             | 6,153         | -                     | 6,153                 | -                     |\n| Customer deposits                          | 471,396           | 471,857       | -                     | 471,857               | -                     |\n| Repurchase agreements at amortised cost    | 37,703            | 37,703        | -                     | 37,703                | -                     |\n| Debt securities in issue at amortised cost | 75,592            | 75,021        | -                     | 75,021                | -                     |\n| Subordinated liabilities                   | 10,253            | 10,345        | -                     | 10,345                | -                     |\n| At 31 December 2022                        |                   |               |                       |                       |                       |\n| Deposits from banks                        | 7,266             | 7,268         | -                     | 7,268                 | -                     |\n| Customer deposits                          | 475,331           | 475,147       | -                     | 475,147               | -                     |\n| Repurchase agreements at amortised cost    | 48,596            | 48,596        | -                     | 48,596                | -                     |\n| Debt securities in issue at amortised cost | 73,819            | 71,975        | -                     | 71,975                | -                     |\n| Subordinated liabilities                   | 10,730            | 10,065        | -                     | 10,065                | -                     |\n\n## Valuation methodology\n\n## Deposits from banks and customer deposits\n\nThe fair value of bank and customer deposits repayable on demand is assumed to be equal to their carrying value.\n\nThe fair value for all other deposits is estimated using discounted cash flows applying either market rates, where applicable, or current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities.\n\n## Repurchase agreements at amortised cost\n\nThe carrying amount is deemed a reasonable approximation of fair value given the short-term nature of these instruments.\n\n## Debt securities in issue at amortised cost\n\nThe fair value of short-term debt securities in issue is approximately equal to their carrying value.

To reduce credit risk the Group uses a variety of credit enhancement techniques such as netting and collateralisation, where security is provided against the exposure; a large proportion of the Group's derivatives are held through exchanges such as London Clearing House and are collateralised through those exchanges. Further details are provided in note 52 Credit risk.\n\nThe Group holds derivatives as part of the following strategies:\n\n- \u00b7 Customer driven, where derivatives are held as part of the provision of risk management products to Group customers\n- \u00b7 To manage and hedge the Group's interest rate and foreign exchange risk arising from normal banking business. The hedge accounting strategy adopted by the Group is to utilise a combination of fair value and cash flow hedge approaches as described in note 52\n- \u00b7 Derivatives held in policyholder funds as permitted by the investment strategies of those funds\n\nThe principal derivatives used by the Group are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Interest rate related contracts include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options. An interest rate swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange fixed and floating interest payments, based upon interest rates defined in the contract, without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Forward rate agreements are contracts for the payment of the difference between a specified rate of interest and a reference rate, applied to a notional principal amount at a specific date in the future. An interest rate option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to fix the rate of interest on a future loan or deposit, for a specified period and commencing on a specified future date\n- \u00b7 Exchange rate related contracts include forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and options. A forward foreign exchange contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified future date at an agreed rate. Currency swaps generally involve the exchange of interest payment obligations denominated in different currencies; the exchange of principal can be notional or actual. A currency option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to sell specified amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange on or before a specified future date\n- \u00b7 Credit derivatives, principally credit default swaps, are used by the Group as part of its trading activity and to manage its own exposure to credit risk. A credit default swap is a swap in which one counterparty receives a premium at pre-set intervals in consideration for guaranteeing to make a specific payment should a negative credit event take place\n- \u00b7 Equity derivatives are also used by the Group as part of its equity-based retail product activity to eliminate the Group's exposure to fluctuations in various international stock exchange indices. Index-linked equity options are purchased which give the Group the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specified amount of equities, or basket of equities, in the form of published indices on or before a specified future date",

        "page_content": "## Note 24: Allowance for expected credit losses continued\n\nThe calculation of the Group's expected credit loss allowances and provisions against loan commitments and guarantees, which are set out above, under IFRS 9 requires the Group to make a number of judgements, assumptions and estimates. The most significant are set out below:\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\n| Critical judgements:   | Determining an appropriate definition of default against which a probability of default, exposure at  default and loss given default parameter can be evaluated                                                |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                        | Establishing the criteria for a significant increase in credit risk (SICR)                                                                                                                                     |\n|                        | The individual assessment of material cases and the use of judgemental adjustments made to  impairment modelling processes that adjust inputs, parameters and outputs to reflect risks not  captured by models |\n|                        | Key source of estimation uncertainty: Base case and multiple economic scenarios (MES) assumptions, including the rate of unemployment                                                                          |\n\n## Definition of default\n\nThe probability of default (PD) of an exposure, both over a 12-month period and over its lifetime, is a key input to the measurement of the ECL allowance. Default has occurred when there is evidence that the customer is experiencing significant financial difficulty which is likely to affect the ability to repay amounts due. The definition of default adopted by the Group is described in note 2(H) Impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 contains a rebuttable presumption that default occurs no later than when a payment is 90 days past due which the Group now uses for all its products following changes to the definition of default for UK mortgages on 1 January 2022. In addition, other indicators of mortgage default include end-of-term payments on past due interest-only accounts and loans considered in probation due to recent arrears or forbearance, aligning the definition of Stage 3 credit-impaired for IFRS 9 to the CRD IV prudential regulatory definition of default.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk\n\nAn ECL allowance equivalent to 12 months' expected losses is established against assets in Stage 1; assets classified as Stage 2 carry an ECL allowance equivalent to lifetime expected losses. Assets are transferred from Stage 1 to Stage 2 when there has been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition. Credit-impaired assets are transferred to Stage 3 with a lifetime expected losses allowance. The Group uses both quantitative and qualitative indicators to determine whether there has been a SICR for an asset. For Retail, the following tables set out the retail master scale (RMS) grade triggers which result in a SICR for financial assets and the PD boundaries for each RMS grade.\n\n## SICR triggers for key Retail portfolios\n\n| Origination grade                             |                                               |                                               |                                               |                                               |                                               |                                               | 1    | 2             |   3 |   4 |   5 |     6 |   7 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------|---------------|-----|-----|-----|-------|-----|\n| Mortgages SICR grade                          | Mortgages SICR grade                          | Mortgages SICR grade                          | Mortgages SICR grade                          | Mortgages SICR grade                          | Mortgages SICR grade                          | Mortgages SICR grade                          | 5    | 5             |   6 |   7 |   8 |  9    |  10 |\n| Credit cards, loans and overdrafts SICR grade | Credit cards, loans and overdrafts SICR grade | Credit cards, loans and overdrafts SICR grade | Credit cards, loans and overdrafts SICR grade | Credit cards, loans and overdrafts SICR grade | Credit cards, loans and overdrafts SICR grade | Credit cards, loans and overdrafts SICR grade | 4    | 5             |   6 |   7 |   8 |  9    |  10 |\n| RMS grade                                     | 1                                             | 2                                             | 3                                             | 4                                             | 5                                             | 6                                             | 7 8  | 9             |  10 |  11 |  12 | 13    |  14 |\n| PD boundary 1  (%)                            | 0.10                                          | 0.40                                          | 0.80                                          | 1.20                                          | 2.50                                          | 4.50                                          | 7.50 | 10.00   14.00 |  20 |  30 |  45 | 99.99 | 100 |\n\n- 1 Probability-weighted annualised lifetime probability of default.\n\nFor Commercial a doubling of PD with a minimum increase in PD of 1 per cent and a resulting change in the underlying grade is treated as a SICR.\n\nThe Group uses the internal credit risk classification and watchlist as qualitative indicators to identify a SICR. The Group does not use the low credit risk exemption in its staging assessments. The use of a payment holiday in and of itself has not been judged to indicate a significant increase in credit risk, nor forbearance, with the underlying long-term credit risk deemed to be driven by economic conditions and captured through the use of forward-looking models. These portfolio level models are capturing the anticipated volume of increased defaults and therefore an appropriate assessment of staging and expected credit loss.\n\nAll financial assets are assumed to have suffered a SICR if they are more than 30 days past due; credit cards, loans and overdrafts financial assets are also assumed to have suffered a SICR if they are in arrears on three or more separate occasions in a rolling 12month period. Financial assets are classified as credit-impaired if they are 90 days past due.\n\nA Stage 3 asset that is no longer credit-impaired is transferred back to Stage 2 as no general probation period is applied to assets in Stage 3. UK mortgages is an exception to this rule where a probation period is enforced for non-performing, forborne and defaulted exposures in accordance with prudential regulation. If an exposure that is classified as Stage 2 no longer meets the SICR criteria, which in some cases capture customer behaviour in previous periods, it is moved back to Stage 1.\n\nThe setting of precise trigger points combined with risk indicators requires judgement. The use of different trigger points may have a material impact upon the size of the ECL allowance. The Group monitors the effectiveness of SICR criteria on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Lifetime of an exposure\n\nA range of approaches, segmented by product type, has been adopted by the Group to estimate a product's expected life. These include using the full contractual life and taking into account behavioural factors such as early repayments, extensions and refinancing. For non-revolving retail assets, the Group has assumed the expected life for each product to be the time taken for all significant losses to be observed. For revolving retail products, the Group has considered the losses beyond the contractual term over which the Group is exposed to credit risk. For commercial overdraft facilities, the average behavioural life has been used. Changes to the assumed expected lives of the Group's assets could impact the ECL allowance recognised by the Group. The assessment of SICR and corresponding lifetime loss, and the PD, of a financial asset designated as Stage 2, or Stage 3, is dependent on its expected life.",

While these assessments are based on the Group's latest economic view, the use of Group-wide multiple economic scenarios and weightings is not considered appropriate for these cases due to their individual characteristics. In place of this, a range of case-specific outcomes are considered with any alternative better or worse outcomes that carry a 25 per cent likelihood taken into account in establishing a probability-weighted ECL. At 31 December 2023, individually assessed provisions for Commercial Banking were \u00a3340 million (2022: \u00a31,008 million) which reflected a range of \u00a3291 million to \u00a3413 million (2022: \u00a3908 million to \u00a31,140 million), based on the range of alternative outcomes considered.\n\n## Application of judgement in adjustments to modelled ECL\n\nImpairment models fall within the Group's model risk framework with model monitoring, periodic validation and back testing performed on model components, such as probability of default. Limitations in the Group's impairment models or data inputs may be identified through the ongoing assessment and validation of the output of the models. In these circumstances, management applies appropriate judgemental adjustments to the ECL to ensure that the overall provision adequately reflects all material risks. These adjustments are determined by considering the particular attributes of exposures which have not been adequately captured by the impairment models and range from changes to model inputs and parameters, at account level, through to more qualitative postmodel adjustments. Post-model adjustments are not typically calculated under each distinct economic scenario used to generate ECL, but on final modelled ECL. All adjustments are reviewed quarterly and are subject to internal review and challenge, including by the Audit Committee, to ensure that amounts are appropriately calculated and specific release criteria is identified.\n\nDuring 2022 the intensifying inflationary pressures, alongside rising interest rates within the Group's outlook created further risks not deemed to be fully captured by ECL models. These pressures played out in 2023 with households experiencing increased interest rates and living costs. These risks, whilst still present, are beginning to subside with inflation now reducing and interest rates now believed to have peaked. As a result, the judgements held in respect of inflationary and interest rate risks  are at a slightly reduced level of \u00a3186 million (2022: \u00a3195 million). Other judgements continue to be applied for broader data and model limitations, both increasing and decreasing ECL. These include incremental risks associated with a material devaluation in commercial real estate prices present since 2022. Given ECL models only capture future price movements, and not the suppressed level, there is a risk that further losses are yet to emerge as well as greater risk on specific sector valuations. At 31 December 2023 judgemental adjustments resulted in net additional ECL allowances totalling \u00a328 million (2022: \u00a3330 million).\n\n## Judgements due to inflationary and interest rate risk UK mortgages: \u00a361 million (2022: \u00a349 million)\n\nThere has been only modest evidence of credit deterioration in the UK mortgages portfolio through 2023 despite the high levels of inflation and the rising interest rate environment. Increases in new to arrears and defaults that have emerged are mainly driven by variable rate customers, who have experienced material increases in their monthly payment. Mortgage ECL models use UK Bank Rate as a driver of predicted defaults largely capturing the stretch on customers due to increased payments, and that has contributed materially to the elevated levels of ECL at 31 December 2023. The impact is also partly mitigated by stressed affordability assessments applied at loan origination which means most customers have demonstrated the ability to absorb payment shocks.\n\nHowever, there remains a potential risk to affordability from continued inflationary pressures combined with higher interest rates, and that this may not be fully captured by the Group's ECL models. The risk remains for customers maturing from low fixed rate deals, the accumulated impact on variable rate product holders, lower levels of real household income and rental cover value. Therefore a judgemental uplift in ECL has been taken in these segments of the mortgages portfolio, either where inflation is expected to present a more material risk, or where segments within the model do not recognise UK Bank Rate as a material driver of predicted defaults.",

As elevated inflation erodes nominal wage growth, adjustments have been made to the econometric models to account for real, rather than nominal, income to produce adjusted predicted defaults. These adjustments also include the specific risk to affordability from increased housing costs, not captured by CPI. As these adjustments are made within predicted default models, they are calculated under each economic scenario and impact the staging of assets through increased PDs.\n\nAlongside these portfolio-wide adjustments management has also made an additional uplift to ECL for customers with lower income levels and higher indebtedness deemed most vulnerable to inflationary pressures and interest rate rises. Although this segment of customers has not exhibited any greater deterioration to date, uplifts continue to be applied to recognise that continued inflation and interest rates risks remain.\n\n## Other judgements\n\n## UK mortgages: \u00a363 million (2022: \u00a3214 million)\n\nThese adjustments principally comprise:\n\n## Increase in time to repossession: \u00a3106 million (2022: \u00a3118 million)\n\nDue to the Group suspending mortgage litigation activity between late-2014 and mid-2018 due to policy changes for the treatment of arrears, and as collections strategy normalises post COVID-19 pandemic, the Group's experience of possessions data on which our models rely is limited. This reflects an adjustment made to allow for an increase in the time assumed between default and repossession. A number of defaulted accounts, equivalent in scale to the estimated shortfall in possessions experienced, have had their provision coverage judgementally increased to the level of those accounts already in repossession. A further adjustment is made to accounts which have been in default for more than 24 months, with an arrears balance increase in the last six months. These accounts have their probability of possession judgmentally set to an increased level based on observed historical losses incurred on accounts that were of an equivalent status.\n\n## Asset recovery values: \u00a3nil (2022: \u00a369 million)\n\nThe low level of repossession volumes throughout 2020 to 2022 restricted the calibration of Forced Sale Discount (FSD) model parameters which uses the achieved sales price experience over the last 12 months. Over this period management partly incorporated an increasing trend in FSD rates through judgementally extending the observation period. At December 2023 the level of sales volumes observed over the past 12 months has subsequently returned to an adequate level for model calibrations to again be performed removing the need for judgemental adjustment.\n\n## Adjustment for specific segments: \u00a323 million (2022: \u00a325 million)\n\nThe Group monitors risks across specific segments of its portfolios which may not be fully captured through wider collective models. The judgement for fire safety and cladding uncertainty has been maintained. Though experience remains limited the risk is considered sufficiently material to address through judgement, given that there is evidence of assessed cases having defective cladding, or other fire safety issues.\n\n## Adjustment for Stage 2 oversensitivity: \u00a3(68) million (2022: \u00a3nil)\n\nManagement has observed an increasing degree of oversensitivity in the number of recently originated low risk accounts moving to Stage 2 through the PD trigger mechanism. This arises from a blend of factors currently present, with the combination of the Group's current MES assumptions and the uplift approach applied, disproportionately applying greater forward-looking uplifts to recent vintages. Given these accounts have shown no significant movement in observed credit scores and were originated under a similar or more adverse economic outlook, an adjustment has been made pending a model rebuild. Management has judgementally increased the threshold applied to these accounts by one further grade (to what is set out on page 277 ) which results in \u00a36 billion of assets being moved back to Stage 1 which results in a lower 12-month ECL.\n\n## Credit cards: \u00a315 million (2022: \u00a3(28) million) and Other Retail: \u00a346 million (2022: \u00a360 million)\n\nThese adjustments principally comprise:\n\n## Lifetime extension on revolving products: Credit cards: \u00a367 million (2022: \u00a382 million) and Other Retail: \u00a310 million (2022: \u00a314 million)\n\nAn adjustment is required to extend the lifetime used for Stage 2 exposures on Retail revolving products from a three-year modelled lifetime, which reflected the outcome data available when the ECL models were developed. Incremental defaults beyond year three are calculated through the extrapolation of the default trajectory observed throughout the three years and beyond. The judgement has reduced slightly in the period following refinement to the discounting methodology applied.\n\n## Adjustments to loss given defaults (LGDs): Credit cards: \u00a3(50) million (2022: \u00a3(96) million) and Other Retail: \u00a337 million (2022: \u00a313 million)\n\nA number of adjustments have been made to the loss given default assumptions used within unsecured and motor credit models. For unsecured portfolios, the adjustments reflect the impact of changes in collection debt sale strategy on the Group's LGD models, incorporating up to date customer performance and forward flow debt sale pricing. For motor, the adjustment captures a decline in used car prices.\n\n## Commercial Banking: \u00a3(282) million (2022: \u00a3(111) million)\n\nThese adjustments principally comprise:\n\n## Corporate insolvency rates: \u00a3(292) million (2022: \u00a3(35) million)\n\nDuring 2023, the volume of UK corporate insolvencies continued to exhibit an increasing trend beyond December 2019 levels, revealing a marked misalignment between observed UK corporate insolvencies and the Group's credit performance. This dislocation gives rise to uncertainty over the drivers of observed trends and the appropriateness of the Group's Commercial Banking model response which uses observed UK corporate insolvencies data to anchor future loss estimates to. Given the Group's asset quality remains strong with low new defaults, a negative adjustment is applied by using the long-term average rate. The larger negative adjustment in the period reflects the widening gap between the increasing industry level and the long-term average rate used.\n\n## Adjustments to loss given defaults (LGDs): \u00a3(105) million (2022: \u00a3(105) million)\n\nFollowing a review on the loss given default approach for commercial exposures, management deems that ECL should be adjusted to mitigate limitations identified in the approach which are causing loss given defaults to be inflated. These include the benefit from amortisation of exposures relative to collateral values at default and a move to an exposure-weighted approach being adopted. These temporary adjustments will be addressed through future model development.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 24: Allowance for expected credit losses continued\n\n## Commercial Real Estate (CRE) price reduction: \u00a367 million (2022: \u00a3nil)\n\nRolling the forecast model forwards into the period has resulted in the material fall in CRE prices seen in late 2022 moving out of the model assumptions used to assess ECL. Given the model uses future changes in the metric as a driver of defaults and loss rates there is a risk that the model benefit that arises does not reflect the residual risk caused by the sustained low level of prices. Management therefore considers it appropriate to judgementally reinstate the CRE price drop within the ECL model assumptions given the materially reduced level in CRE prices could still trigger additional defaults Within this adjustment management has refined the potential impact on loss rates through capturing updated valuations as well as stressing valuations on specific sectors where evidence suggests valuations may lag achievable levels, notably in cases of stressed sale.\n\n## Generation of multiple economic scenarios\n\nThe estimate of expected credit losses is required to be based on an unbiased expectation of future economic scenarios. The approach used to generate the range of future economic scenarios depends on the methodology and judgements adopted. The Group's approach is to start from a defined base case scenario, used for planning purposes, and to generate alternative economic scenarios around this base case. The base case scenario is a conditional forecast underpinned by a number of conditioning assumptions that reflect the Group's best view of key future developments. If circumstances appear likely to materially deviate from the conditioning assumptions, then the base case scenario is updated.\n\nThe base case scenario is central to a range of future economic scenarios generated by simulation of an economic model, for which the same conditioning assumptions apply as in the base case scenario. These scenarios are ranked by using estimated relationships with industry-wide historical loss data. With the base case already pre-defined, three other scenarios are identified as averages of constituent scenarios located around the 15th, 75th and 95th percentiles of the distribution. The full distribution is therefore summarised by a practical number of scenarios to run through ECL models representing an upside, the base case, and a downside scenario weighted at 30 per cent each, together with a severe downside scenario weighted at 10 per cent. The scenario weights represent the distribution of economic scenarios and not subjective views on likelihood. The inclusion of a severe downside scenario with a smaller weighting ensures that the non-linearity of losses in the tail of the distribution is adequately captured. Macroeconomic projections may employ reversionary techniques to adjust the paths of economic drivers towards long-run equilibria after a reasonable forecast horizon. The Group does not use such techniques to force the MES scenarios to revert to the base case planning view. Utilising such techniques would be expected to be immaterial for expected credit losses since loss sensitivity is highest over the initial five years of the projections. Most assets are expected to have matured, or reached the end of their behavioural life before the five-year horizon.\n\nA forum under the chairmanship of the Chief Economist meets at least quarterly to review and, if appropriate, recommend changes to the method by which economic scenarios are generated, for approval by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer. In June 2022, the Group judged it appropriate to include an adjusted severe downside scenario to incorporate a high CPI inflation and UK Bank Rate profiles and to adopt this adjusted severe downside scenario to calculate the Group's ECL. This is because the historic macroeconomic and loan loss data upon which the scenario model is calibrated imply an association of downside economic outcomes with easier monetary policy, and therefore low interest rates. The adjustment is considered to better reflect the risks around the Group's base case view in an economic environment where the potential for supply shocks remains an elevated concern. The Group has continued to include a non-modelled severe downside scenario for Group ECL calculations for 31 December 2023 reporting.\n\n## Base case and MES economic assumptions\n\nThe Group's base case economic scenario has been updated to reflect ongoing geopolitical developments, and further evidence of easing of inflationary pressures allowing shifts to less restrictive monetary policies globally. The Group's updated base case scenario has three conditioning assumptions: first, the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East remain geographically contained and do not lead to a major escalation in energy prices; second, China's economic stabilisation policy is effective; and third, less restrictive monetary and fiscal policy throughout this year.\n\nBased on these assumptions and incorporating the economic data published in the fourth quarter, the  Group's base case scenario is for slow expansion in GDP and a rise in the unemployment rate alongside modest changes in residential and commercial property prices. Following a reduction in inflationary pressures, UK Bank Rate is expected to be lowered during 2024. Risks around this base case economic view lie in both directions and are largely captured by the generation of alternative economic scenarios.\n\nThe Group has accommodated the latest available information at the reporting date in defining its base case scenario and generating alternative economic scenarios. The scenarios include forecasts for key variables in the fourth quarter of 2023, for which actuals may have since emerged prior to publication.\n\n## Scenarios by year\n\nThe key UK economic assumptions made by the Group are shown in the following tables across a number of measures explained below.\n\n## Annual assumptions\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation are presented as an annual change, house price growth and commercial real estate price growth are presented as the growth in the respective indices over each year. Unemployment rate and UK Bank Rate are averages over the year.\n\n## Five-year average\n\nThe five-year average reflects the average annual growth rate, or level, over the five-year period. It includes movements within the current reporting year, such that the position as at 31 December 2023 covers the five years 2023 to 2027. The inclusion of the reporting year within the five-year period reflects the need to predict variables which remain unpublished at the reporting date and recognises that credit models utilise both level and annual changes. The use of calendar years maintains a comparability between the annual assumptions presented.\n\n## Five-year start to peak and trough\n\nThe peak or trough for any metric may occur intra year and therefore not be identifiable from the annual assumptions, so they are also disclosed. For GDP, house price growth and commercial real estate price growth, the peak, or trough, reflects the highest, or lowest cumulative quarterly position reached relative to the start of the five-year period, which as at 31 December 2023 is 1 January 2023. Given these metrics may exhibit increases followed by greater falls, the start to trough movements quoted may be smaller than the equivalent 'peak to trough' movement (and vice versa for start to peak). Unemployment, UK Bank Rate and CPI inflation reflect the highest, or lowest, quarterly level reached in the five-year period.",

The stage allocation for an asset is based on the overall scenario probability-weighted probability of default and hence the staging of assets is constant across all the scenarios. In each economic scenario the ECL for individual assessments is held constant reflecting the basis on which they are evaluated. Judgemental adjustments applied through changes to model inputs or parameters, or more qualitative post model adjustments, are apportioned across the scenarios in proportion to modelled ECL where this better reflects the sensitivity of these adjustments to each scenario. The probability-weighted view shows the extent to which a higher ECL allowance has been recognised to take account of multiple economic scenarios relative to the base case; the uplift being \u00a3678 million compared to \u00a3692 million at 31 December 2022.\n\n|                    | At 31 December 2023      | At 31 December 2023   | At 31 December 2023   | At 31 December 2023   | At 31 December 2023   | At 31 December 2022      | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2022   | At 31 December 2022   |\n|--------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                    | Probability- weighted \u00a3m | Upside \u00a3m             | Base case \u00a3m          | Downside \u00a3m           | Severe downside \u00a3m    | Probability- weighted \u00a3m | Upside \u00a3m             | Base case \u00a3m          | Downside \u00a3m           | Severe downside \u00a3m    |\n| UK mortgages       | 1,115                    | 395                   | 670                   | 1,155                 | 4,485                 | 1,209                    | 514                   | 790                   | 1,434                 | 3,874                 |\n| Credit cards       | 810                      | 600                   | 771                   | 918                   | 1,235                 | 763                      | 596                   | 727                   | 828                   | 1,180                 |\n| Other Retail       | 945                      | 850                   | 920                   | 981                   | 1,200                 | 1,016                    | 907                   | 992                   | 1,056                 | 1,290                 |\n| Commercial Banking | 1,182                    | 793                   | 1,013                 | 1,383                 | 2,250                 | 1,869                    | 1,459                 | 1,656                 | 2,027                 | 3,261                 |\n| Other              | 32                       | 32                    | 32                    | 32                    | 32                    | 46                       | 46                    | 46                    | 47                    | 47                    |\n| ECL allowance      | 4,084                    | 2,670                 | 3,406                 | 4,469                 | 9,202                 | 4,903                    | 3,522                 | 4,211                 | 5,392                 | 9,652                 |\n\nThe impact of isolated changes in the UK unemployment rate and House Price Index (HPI) has been assessed on a univariate basis. Although such changes would not be observed in isolation, as economic indicators tend to be correlated in a coherent scenario, this gives insight into the sensitivity of the Group's ECL to gradual changes in these two critical economic factors. The assessment has been made against the base case with staging held flat to the reported probability-weighted view and is assessed through the direct impact on modelled ECL and only includes judgemental adjustments applied through changes to model inputs.\n\nThe table below shows the impact on the Group's ECL resulting from a 1 percentage point increase or decrease in the UK unemployment rate. The increase or decrease is presented based on the adjustment phased evenly over the first 10 quarters of the base case scenario. A more immediate increase or decrease would drive a more material ECL impact as it would be fully reflected in both 12-month and lifetime probability of defaults.\n\n|                    | At 31 December 2023             | At 31 December 2023             | At 31 December 2022             | At 31 December 2022             |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                    | 1pp increase in unemployment \u00a3m | 1pp decrease in unemployment \u00a3m | 1pp increase in unemployment \u00a3m | 1pp decrease in unemployment \u00a3m |\n| UK mortgages       | 33                              | (32)                            | 26                              | (21)                            |\n| Credit cards       | 38                              | (38)                            | 41                              | (41)                            |\n| Other Retail       | 19                              | (19)                            | 25                              | (25)                            |\n| Commercial Banking | 88                              | (83)                            | 100                             | (91)                            |\n| ECL impact         | 178                             | (172)                           | 192                             | (178)                           |\n\nThe table below shows the impact on the Group's ECL in respect of UK mortgages of an increase or decrease in loss given default for a 10 percentage point increase or decrease in the UK HPI.

This includes identifying the climate-related risk drivers that could influence future credit losses for loan portfolios that have the highest sensitivity to climate risks and commencing the use of more quantitative analysis on the impact of these risk drivers on ECL. This initial assessment has focused on specific climate-related risk drivers, with the intention to broaden and further develop the assessment in future years. The approach leverages the Group's climate scenario analysis, to identify the potential physical and transition risk impacts on credit quality. Retail mortgages and Commercial Banking portfolios were identified to have the highest sensitivity to climate risk, with both physical and transition risk drivers assessed. The assessment used a combination of macroeconomic and sector level modelling alongside similar techniques used in estimating judgemental adjustments for non-climate related risks at sector and segment level.\n\nUK mortgages physical and transition risks - additional costs resulting in affordability pressure for buy-to-let (BTL) borrowers of UK properties assessed with a low EPC rating requiring retrofitting to meet potential legislative regulations; and similarly additional costs driven by increased flood risk through property repair or rebuild - discussed below.\n\nCommercial Banking physical and transition risks - chronic and acute impacts of rising temperatures on a company's costs and revenues. Companies adapting to a sudden transition scenario could potentially lead to increased transition costs in operations, direct carbon costs, and deteriorating financial performance due to changing consumer perspectives - discussed below.\n\n## Macroeconomic and sector scenario risks assessments\n\nAn assessment was performed on the Group's internally generated economic scenarios used in the measurement of expected credit losses against external scenarios published by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) in November 2023. The analysis found the Group's base case, incorporating the impact of assumed policies over a five-year planning horizon, was positioned broadly within the range of the NGFS climate scenarios considered to be the most plausible, with limited differences in both directions for key impairment drivers. The Group's MES downside and severe downside together comprising 40 per cent weighting in ECL calculations, are generally more severe than the most adverse NGFS scenario (Net Zero 2050). The assessment suggests that no material changes are required to the Group's existing suite of economic scenarios.\n\nIn Retail, the potential incremental impact of climate factors on key economic drivers has been isolated from a range of NGFS scenarios management judged most plausible (Current Policies, Delayed Transition and Fragmented World scenarios). The incremental risk to ECL was then quantified by overlaying the specific climate impact of these scenarios on macroeconomic drivers, the Group's base case and MES scenarios. Given these more plausible scenarios exhibited very similar impacts, management modelled the ECL impact from the Delayed Transition scenario, which assumes strong environmental policies are needed to compensate for the absence of early action. The results from the most material portfolios, UK mortgages and credit card ECL models allowed management to conclude on an immaterial ECL impact for Retail.\n\nIn Commercial Banking, an exploratory top-down analysis using newly developed sectoral modelling was adopted to estimate the ECL impact of climate risk on commercial credit conditions. This assessment specifically segmented agriculture, automotive, transport, oil and gas and real estate sectors where climate impacts were judged to be more significant. Sector-specific, climate-adjusted credit cycle indices (CCI) were used to calculate probability of default and resulting ECL. These adjusted CCI model inputs combined external NGFS scenarios with client level valuation impacts where available, alongside historic impairment data. Taking into account methodological limitations, the additional ECL required was shown to be immaterial. However, the analysis has been an informative exercise to take further forward in 2024.\n\n## Physical and transition risks assessments\n\nIn 2023 the Group has progressed with third party consultants to enhance both its access to climate-related data and the development of climate modelling capabilities.\n\nIn the UK mortgage portfolio, an affordability stress for customers was applied, by considering a scenario with minimum EPC requirements being introduced for the UK and estimated average retrofitting costs to bring the estimated EPC distribution for the current UK mortgage portfolio into alignment. The potential default risk from additional costs linked to retrofitting risks was assessed, with independent EPC data used to estimate the ECL impact from increased costs to customers for upgrading or retrofitting to meet a potential legislative target of EPC rating of C by 2028 for BTL. The provision impact was assessed using sensitivity analysis that utilises the relationship between disposable income and probability of default. The impact on ECL has been estimated to be less than \u00a35 million for the potential legislative requirement in place for BTL.\n\nConsideration has also been given to flooding risk - a delayed transition climate outlook, out to 2035 was assessed, resulting in over 80 per cent of the book expected to have no risk of flood damage. The impact on ECL related to the affordability risk from flood damage has been estimated to be immaterial. Whilst this supports no judgemental adjustment to ECL being required, the narrow scope does not capture the wider impact on loss rates emanating from being located in a high risk area.\n\n| Assessment                                 | Nature of risk assessed      | Portfolios assessed                              | ECL impact    |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Macroeconomic impact from climate scenario | Scenario risk - macro level  | Retail                                           | < \u00a35 million  |\n| Sector level impacts from climate scenario | Scenario risk - sector level | Commercial Banking  (excluding Business Banking) | < \u00a315 million |\n| Retrofitting cost to meet EPC regulation   | Transition risk              | UK mortgages - BTL                               | < \u00a35 million  |\n| Flood risk                                 | Physical risk                | UK mortgages                                     | < \u00a35 million  |\n\nThe assessments are limited due to the degree of uncertainty underpinning key assumptions used, as well as the developmental nature of the data, approach and models used in the quantification. These include, but are not limited to the analyses being restricted to PD impacts only, client level valuation impacts not incorporating climate transition plans, only considering the most material hazard (flooding) for UK mortgages and more broadly the political landscape, future climate data enhancements and further model development.\n\nHowever, the conclusions made using the Group's best internal view of likely outcomes across all analyses further strengthens management's view there is a low residual risk of material error or omission in the Group's financial statements due to climate-related risks at present and as a result no adjustments have been made to the ECL measured as at 31 December 2023. The current behavioural lives of the Group's lending dilutes the potential exposure to the later emergence of potential physical climate impacts, with the incorporation of climate risk within underwriting assessments in Commercial Banking providing further mitigation on more recent originations.",

The acquisition, which supports the Group's sustainability ambitions, will enable the Group to expand its salary sacrifice proposition within motor finance. The total fair value of the purchase consideration was \u00a3331 million, settled in cash, and the business has been consolidated into the Group's results since 21 February 2023. The acquisition is expected to provide significant growth opportunities and funding synergies. Goodwill of \u00a3143 million has been recognised on the transaction. None of the goodwill recognised is deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition-related costs of \u00a33 million have been included in operating expenses for the year ended 31 December 2023. The revenue included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income since 21 February 2023 contributed by Tusker was \u00a3171 million, with net loss after tax of \u00a311 million over the same period. Had Tusker been consolidated from 1 January 2023, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income would have included revenue of \u00a3196 million and a net loss after tax of \u00a36 million.\n\nThe goodwill held in the Group's balance sheet is tested at least annually for impairment. For the purposes of impairment testing the goodwill is allocated to the appropriate cash-generating unit; of the total balance of \u00a32,798 million (2022: \u00a32,655 million), \u00a32,171 million, or 78 per cent (2022: \u00a32,171 million, 82 per cent) has been allocated to the Life and pensions cash-generating unit; \u00a3302 million, or  11 per cent (2022: \u00a3302 million, 11 per cent) has been allocated to the Credit card cash-generating unit in the Group's Retail division; and \u00a3309 million, or 11 per cent (2022: \u00a3166 million, 6 per cent) to the Motor business cash-generating units, both in the Group's Retail division.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Scottish Widows is based on a value-in-use calculation. The calculation uses pretax projections of future cash flows based upon budgets and plans approved by management covering a  four-year period, the related run-off of existing business in-force and a discount rate (pre-tax) of 11.0 per cent. The budgets and plans are based upon past experience adjusted to take into account anticipated changes in sales volumes, product mix and margins having regard to expected market conditions (which will reflect current and future risks, such as climate and expected economic activity conditions) and competitor activity. The discount rate is determined with reference to internal measures and available industry information. New business cash flows beyond the four-year period have been extrapolated using a reducing balance growth rate that falls from 3.5 per cent to 2.0 per cent after 20 years, which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the life assurance market. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Scottish Widows to fall below its balance sheet carrying value .\n\nThe recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to the Motor business is based on a value-in-use calculation using post-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management covering a four-year period and a discount rate (posttax) of 10.5 per cent, based on the Group's cost of equity. This is equivalent to a pre-tax rate of 14.0 per cent. The budgets and plans are based upon past experience adjusted to take into account anticipated changes in sales volumes having regard to expected market conditions and competitor activity. The cash flows beyond the four-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 3.5 per cent which does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which the Motor business participates. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, including from the impacts of climate change or climate-related legislation, would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to the Motor business to fall below the balance sheet carrying value.",

This is equivalent to a pre-tax rate of 14.0 per cent. The budgets and plans are based upon past experience adjusted to take into account anticipated changes in credit card volumes having regard to expected market conditions and competitor activity. The cash flows beyond the four-year period assume 3.5 per cent growth, which does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which the Cards business participates. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Credit cards to fall below the balance sheet carrying value.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nThe acquired value of in-force non-participating investment contracts includes \u00a393 million (2022: \u00a3106 million) in relation to OEIC business.\n\nThe brand arising from the acquisition of Bank of Scotland in 2009 is recognised on the Group's balance sheet and has been determined to have an indefinite useful life. The carrying value at 31 December 2023 was \u00a3380 million (2022: \u00a3380 million). The Bank of Scotland name has been in existence for over 300 years and there are no indications that the brand should not have an indefinite useful life. The recoverable amount has been based on a value-in-use calculation. The calculation uses post-tax projections for a fouryear period of the income generated by the Bank of Scotland cash-generating unit, a discount rate of 10.5 per cent and a future growth rate of 3.5 per cent. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of the Bank of Scotland brand to fall below its balance sheet carrying value.\n\n## Note 27: Other assets\n\n|                                                                      | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 1 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Insurance contract assets                                            | 1         | -           |\n| Reinsurance contract assets                                          | 442       | 372         |\n| Investment in joint ventures and associates                          | 401       | 385         |\n| Property, plant and equipment:                                       |           |             |\n| Investment properties (see below)                                    | 2,862     | 2,532       |\n| Premises                                                             | 920       | 871         |\n| Equipment                                                            | 1,170     | 1,285       |\n| Operating lease assets (see below)                                   | 6,523     | 4,816       |\n| Right-of-use assets (note 28)                                        | 1,055     | 1,156       |\n|                                                                      | 12,530    | 10,660      |\n| Settlement balances and items in the course of collection from banks | 912       | 658         |\n| Prepayments                                                          | 1,455     | 1,224       |\n| Deferred acquisition and origination costs                           | 39        | 54          |\n| Other assets                                                         | 1,364     | 1,183       |\n| Total other assets                                                   | 17,144    | 14,536      |\n\n## Investment properties\n\nThe Group's investment properties are predominantly held by the Insurance, Pensions and Investments business where they back policyholder liabilities. They are valued by external Chartered Surveyors using industry standard techniques based on guidance from the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. The valuation methodology includes an assessment of general market conditions and sector level transactions and takes account of expectations of occupancy rates, rental income and growth. Property valuations undergo individual scrutiny using cash flow analysis to factor in the timing of rental reviews, capital expenditure, lease incentives, dilapidation and operating expenses; these reviews utilise both observable and unobservable inputs. Within the fair value hierarchy, all of the Group's investment properties are categorised as level 3 (see note 21 for details of levels in the fair value hierarchy). The table below analyses movements in level 3 investment properties, which are carried at fair value.\n\n|                                               | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                                  | 2,532     | 3,612     |\n| Acquisition of new properties                 | 450       | 60        |\n| Additional expenditure on existing properties | 19        | 50        |\n| Change in fair value (note 7)                 | (87)      | (511)     |\n| Disposals                                     | (52)      | (679)     |\n| At 31 December                                | 2,862     | 2,532     |\n\nRental income of \u00a3146 million (2022: \u00a3145 million) and direct operating expenses of \u00a316 million (2022: \u00a332 million) arising from investment properties that generate rental income have been recognised in the income statement.\n\nCapital expenditure in respect of investment properties which had been contracted for but not recognised in the financial statements was \u00a3488 million (2022: \u00a3119 million).",

From time to time, the obligations of the Group to provide collateral may increase due to the formal requirements of the programmes. The Group may also voluntarily contribute collateral to support the ratings of the covered bonds.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group's securitisation notes in issue held by external parties includes \u00a323 million at fair value through profit or loss (2022: \u00a326 million). Those notes held internally, are secured on loans and advances to customers amounting to \u00a330,716  million (2022: \u00a329,384 million), the majority of which have been sold by subsidiary companies to bankruptcy remote structured entities. As the structured entities are funded by the issue of debt on terms whereby the majority of the risks and rewards of the portfolio are retained by the subsidiary, the structured entities are consolidated fully and all of these loans are retained on the Group's balance sheet, with the related notes in issue included within debt securities in issue at amortised cost.\n\nCertain loans and advances to customers have been assigned to bankruptcy remote limited liability partnerships.\n\nCash deposits of \u00a33,794 million (2022: \u00a33,896 million) which support the debt securities issued by the structured entities, the term advances related to covered bonds and other legal obligations, are held by the Group. Additionally, the Group has certain contractual arrangements to provide liquidity facilities to some of these structured entities. At 31 December 2023 these obligations had not been triggered; the maximum exposure under these facilities was \u00a329 million (2022: \u00a325 million).\n\nThe Group recognises the full liabilities associated with its securitisation and covered bond programmes within debt securities in issue, although the obligations of the Group in respect of its securitisation issuances are limited to the cash flows generated from the underlying assets. The Group could be required to provide additional support to a number of the securitisation programmes to support the credit ratings of the debt securities issued, in the form of increased cash reserves and the holding of subordinated notes. Further, certain programmes contain contractual obligations that require the Group to repurchase assets should they become credit-impaired or as otherwise required by the transaction documents. The Group has not provided financial or other support by voluntarily offering to repurchase assets from any of its public securitisation programmes during 2023 (2022: none).",

The Group uses information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future conditions to inform these expectations. The Group's estimate of future cash flows is the mean of a range of scenarios that reflect the full range of possible outcomes, considering all reasonable and supportable information available at the reporting date. The probability-weighted average of the future cash flows is calculated using a deterministic scenario representing the probability-weighted mean of a range of scenarios.\n\nThe Group uses assumptions to develop estimates of future cash flows. These assumptions are reassessed at each reported date to reflect conditions existing at the measurement date.\n\nThe Group has applied judgment in determining the characteristics which make a product illiquid, the level of illiquidity premium to apply to the discount rate of different products and how the illiquidity premium is determined, where material.\n\nThe products to which an illiquidity premium has been applied to the discount rate are annuity contracts, due to the illiquid nature of their cash flows, certain reinsurance contracts held where the underlying contracts are annuity contracts, due to the transfer of longevity risk to the reinsurer, and whole of life protection contracts, due to the inherent policyholder value and zero surrender option.\n\nFor annuity contracts, at initial recognition, the illiquidity premium is calculated with reference to a strategic portfolio of assets, and subsequently measured to reflect the mix of actual assets backing annuity contracts, adjusted to reflect the impacts of transition from initial recognition. To reflect differences between the characteristics of insurance contracts and the derivation of discount rates based on a reference portfolio, adjustments for credit risk are required, and the Group uses the fundamental spread to maintain consistency with its Solvency II approach. For protection contracts, the illiquidity premium is based on the spread on a covered bond index.\n\nThe average yield curves (GBP currency) that were used to discount the estimates of future cash flows that do not vary based on the returns of the underlying items are as follows:\n\n|      |   1 year |   5 year |   10 year |   20 year |   30 year |\n|------|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| 2023 |     5.37 |     4.15 |      4.79 |      4.72 |      4.19 |\n| 2022 |     6.11 |     5.15 |      5.03 |      4.84 |      4.42 |\n\nThe Group has also applied judgement to determine if a drawdown feature added to its longstanding and workplace pension products was a modification that required derecognition. See note 10 for more details.\n\nThe Group determines the quantity of benefits provided under each contract as follows:\n\n| Product                      | Basis                                                                         |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| With-Profits and unit linked | 1 Policyholder account value                                                  |\n| Annuities                    | Pre-vesting date 2 : defined amount payable Post-vesting date: annuity payout |\n\n## Mortality\n\nThe mortality assumptions for the main classes of business are set with regard to recent Group experience and general industry trends, all of which are adjusted for smoker status and age/gender specific factors. The base mortality tables used for the annuities business for the year ended 31 December 2023 and the prior period were selected from the bespoke mortality tables. The mortality improvements adopt the 100% Bespoke tables and CMI 2022\\_{M/F}\\_(7.25)\\_{2.0/1.8}%\\_{0.0/0.2}A\\_2013 for the year ended 31 December 2023 and the 100% Bespoke tables and CMI 2021\\_{M/F}\\_(7.25)\\_{2.0/1.8}%\\_{0.0/0.2}A\\_2013 for the prior period.\n\n## Lapse rates\n\nLapse rates refer to the rate of policy termination or the rate at which policyholders stop paying regular premiums due under the contract. Historical persistency experience is analysed using statistical techniques. As experience can vary considerably between different product types and for contracts that have been in force for different periods, the data is broken down into broadly homogeneous groups for the purposes of determining the Group's lapse rate in determining the assumptions, which are set on a best estimates basis, based on investigations of historical experience with some expert judgement overlays reflecting expectations of future trends and other external data. The lapse rates for workplace pensions range from 0.8 per cent to 14.6 per cent (2022: 0.8 per cent to 15.7 per cent) and for longstanding business range from 0.5 per cent to 74.1 per cent (2022: 0.5 per cent to 74.1 per cent), the wide range being a result of the age and variety of products.",

The risk adjustment represents the difference in the value of the best estimate cash flows with and without these margins. The risk adjustment is calculated at a policy level.\n\nThe confidence level corresponding to the risk adjustment is 90 per cent (2022: 90 per cent). The risk adjustment is calibrated to the value at risk over a one-year time horizon at this confidence level for non-financial risks. This is translated, using statistical approximations, into an equivalent confidence level on a value at risk basis over the expected lifetime of in-force policies of approximately 70 per cent (2022: 70 per cent) at end of the reporting period.\n\n## Note 33: Impacts of insurance and participating investment contracts recognised in the year\n\n|                                                        | 2023                           | 2023                        | 2023     | 2022                           | 2022                        | 2022     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|\n| Life                                                   | Profitable contracts issued \u00a3m | Onerous contracts issued \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m | Profitable contracts issued \u00a3m | Onerous contracts issued \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Insurance and participating investment contracts       |                                |                             |          |                                |                             |          |\n| Insurance acquisition cash flows                       | 87                             | 142                         | 229      | 85                             | 173                         | 258      |\n| Claims and other directly attributable expenses        | 5,450                          | 447                         | 5,897    | 82,246                         | 1,130                       | 83,376   |\n| Estimates of the present value of future cash outflows | 5,537                          | 589                         | 6,126    | 82,331                         | 1,303                       | 83,634   |\n| Estimates of the present value of future cash inflows  | (5,708)                        | (525)                       | (6,233)  | (84,754)                       | (1,244)                     | (85,998) |\n| Risk adjustment for non-financial risk                 | 79                             | 7                           | 86       | 630                            | 16                          | 646      |\n| Contractual service margin                             | 92                             | -

In practice this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some assumptions may be correlated. The sensitivities below are on a gross of reinsurance basis, which do not differ materially from the sensitivities net of reinsurance. These amounts include movements in liabilities relating to insurance and participating investment contracts and related assets in order to demonstrate the impacts on shareholder profit and equity. Therefore, these sensitivities have not been applied to the proportion of assets and liabilities where the risks are borne by the policyholder and where assets and liabilities are well matched so as not to have a significant impact on shareholder profit.\n\n|                                                         |                    | 2023                                         | 2023

judgement:                    | Determining whether a present obligation exists and whether it is more likely than not that an outflow of  resources will be required to settle that obligation   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|

  |\n\nDetermining the amount of the provisions, which represent management's best estimate of the cost of settling these issues, requires the exercise of significant judgement and estimation. It will often be necessary to form a view on matters which are inherently uncertain, such as the scope of reviews required by regulators, and to estimate the number of future complaints, the extent to which they will be upheld, the average cost of redress and the impact of decisions reached by legal and other review processes that may be relevant to claims received. Consequently the continued appropriateness of the underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis against actual experience and other relevant evidence and adjustments made to the provisions where appropriate.",

Any matters discussed or identified during such discussions and inquiries may result in, among other things, further inquiry or investigation, other action being taken by governmental and/or regulatory authorities, increased costs being incurred by the Group, remediation of systems and controls, public or private censure, restriction of the Group's business activities and/or fines. The Group also receives complaints in connection with its past conduct and claims brought by or on behalf of current and former employees, customers (including their appointed representatives), investors and other third parties and is subject to legal proceedings and other legal actions from time to time. Any events or circumstances disclosed could have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial position, operations or cash flows. Provisions are held where the Group can reliably estimate a probable outflow of economic resources. The ultimate liability of the Group may be significantly more, or less, than the amount of any provision recognised. If the Group is unable to determine a reliable estimate, a contingent liability is disclosed. The recognition of a provision does not amount to an admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of the Group. During the year ended 31 December 2023 the Group charged a further \u00a3675 million in respect of legal actions and other regulatory matters and the unutilised balance at 31 December 2023 was \u00a31,105 million (31 December 2022: \u00a3803 million). The most significant items are outlined below.\n\n## Motor commission review\n\nA \u00a3450 million provision, all recognised in the fourth quarter, has been established for the potential impact of the recently announced FCA review into historical motor finance commission arrangements and sales.\n\nAs disclosed in previous periods, the Group continues to receive a number of court claims and complaints in respect of motor finance commissions and is actively engaging with the FOS in its assessment of these complaints. On 10 January 2024, the FOS issued its Final Decision on a complaint relating to the Group, as well as decisions relating to other industry participants. On 11 January 2024, the FCA announced a section 166 review of historical motor finance commission arrangements and sales and plans to communicate a decision on next steps in the third quarter of 2024 on the basis of the evidence collated in the review. The FCA has indicated that such steps could include establishing an industry-wide consumer redress scheme and/or applying to the Financial Markets Test Case Scheme, to help resolve any contested legal issues of general importance.\n\nFollowing the FCA Motor Market Review in March 2019, the FCA issued a policy statement in July 2020 prohibiting the use of discretionary commission models from 28 January 2021, which the Group adhered to. The Group continues to believe that its historical practices were compliant with the law and regulations in place at that time.\n\nAs noted above, in response to both the FOS decisions and the FCA announcement the Group has recognised a charge of \u00a3450 million. This includes estimates for operational and legal costs, including litigation costs, together with estimates for potential awards, based on various scenarios using a range of assumptions, including for example, commission models, commission rates, applicable time periods (between 2007 and 2021), response rates and uphold rates. Costs and awards could arise in the event that the FCA concludes there has been misconduct and customer loss that requires remediation, or from adverse litigation decisions. However, while the FCA review is progressing there is significant uncertainty as to the extent of misconduct and customer loss, if any, the nature and extent of any remediation action, if required, and its timing. The ultimate financial impact could therefore materially differ from the amount provided, both higher or lower. The Group welcomes the FCA intervention through an independent section 166 review.\n\n## HBOS Reading - review\n\nThe Group continues to apply the recommendations from Sir Ross Cranston's review, issued in December 2019, including a reassessment of direct and consequential losses by an independent panel (the Foskett Panel), an extension of debt relief and a wider definition of de facto directors. The Foskett Panel's full scope and methodology was published on 7 July 2020. The Foskett Panel's stated objective is to consider cases via a non-legalistic and fair process and to make its decisions in a generous, fair and common sense manner, assessing claims against an expanded definition of the fraud and on a lower evidential basis.\n\nIn June 2022, the Foskett Panel announced an alternative option, in the form of a fixed sum award which could be accepted as an alternative to participation in the full re-review process, to support earlier resolution of claims for those deemed by the Foskett Panel to be victims of the fraud. Around 90 per cent of the population have now had outcomes via this new process. The provision is unchanged in 2023. Notwithstanding the settled claims and the increase in outcomes which builds confidence in the full estimated cost, uncertainties remain and the final outcome could be different from the current provision once the re-review is concluded by the Foskett Panel. There is no confirmed timeline for the completion of the Foskett Panel re-review process nor the review by Dame Linda Dobbs. The Group is committed to implementing Sir Ross Cranston's recommendations in full.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 38: Provisions continued\n\n## Payment protection insurance (PPI)\n\nThe Group has incurred costs for PPI over a number of years totalling \u00a321,960 million. The Group continues to challenge PPI litigation cases, with mainly legal fees and operational costs associated with litigation activity recognised within regulatory and legal provisions .\n\n## Customer claims in relation to insurance branch business in Germany\n\nThe Group continues to receive claims from customers in Germany relating to policies issued by Clerical Medical Investment Group Limited (subsequently renamed Scottish Widows Limited), with smaller numbers of claims received from customers in Austria and Italy. The total provision made to 31 December 2023, was \u00a3709 million (31 December 2022: \u00a3709 million) with \u00a313 million utilisation of the provision during the year, leaving an unutilised provision at 31 December 2023 of \u00a375 million. The ultimate financial effect, which could be significantly different from the current provision, will be known only once all relevant claims have been resolved.\n\n## Other\n\nThe Group carries provisions of \u00a3137 million (2022: \u00a3112 million) in respect of dilapidations, rent reviews and other property-related matters.\n\nProvisions are also made for staff and other costs related to Group restructuring initiatives at the point at which the Group becomes committed to the expenditure; at 31 December 2023 provisions of \u00a3245 million (31 December 2022: \u00a3112 million) were held.\n\nThe Group carries provisions of \u00a346 million (2022: \u00a386 million) for indemnities and other matters relating to legacy business disposals in prior years. Whilst there remains significant uncertainty as to the timing of the utilisation of the provisions, the Group expects the majority of the remaining provisions to have been utilised by 31 December 2026.\n\n## Note 39: Subordinated liabilities\n\nThe movement in subordinated liabilities during the year was as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                  | Preference shares \u00a3m   | Preferred securities \u00a3m   | Undated \u00a3m   | Dated \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|------------|------------|\n| At 1 January 2022                                                                                | 488                    | 1,661                     | 174          | 10,785     | 13,108     |\n| 1 Issued during the year :                                                                       |                        |                           |              |            |            |\n| 7.953% Fixed Rate Reset Dated Subordinated notes 2033 (US$1,000 million)                         | -

The claims of holders of preference shares and preferred securities are generally junior to those of the holders of undated subordinated liabilities, which in turn are junior to the claims of holders of the dated subordinated liabilities.

In addition, the Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and/or voting rights.\n\nThe directors have authority to allot and issue ordinary and preference shares and to make market purchases of ordinary and preference shares as granted at the annual general meeting on 18 May 2023. The authority to issue shares and the authority to make market purchases of shares will expire at the next annual general meeting. Shareholders will be asked, at the annual general meeting, to give similar authorities.\n\nSubject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares, on a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company every holder of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote has one vote and on a poll every member present and entitled to vote has one vote for every share held. The special rights attached to any class of shares in the Company may, subject to the statutory provisions, be varied or abrogated either with the consent in writing of the holders of three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of the class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of the class (but not otherwise).\n\nThe holders of ordinary shares, who held 100 per cent of the total ordinary share capital at 31 December 2023, are entitled to receive the Company's report and accounts, attend, speak and vote at general meetings and appoint proxies to exercise voting rights. Holders of ordinary shares may also receive a dividend (subject to the provisions of the Company's articles of association) and on a winding-up may share in the assets of the Company.\n\nThe rights and obligations attached to the Company's ordinary shares are set out in the Company's articles of association, a copy of which can be found at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are/group-overview/corporate-governance.html .\n\n## Preference shares\n\nThe Company has in issue various classes of preference shares which are all classified as liabilities under accounting standards and which are included in note 39.\n\n## Note 41: Earnings per share\n\n|                                                                    | 2023 \u00a3m      | 2022 \u00a3m      | 2021 \u00a3m      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders - basic and diluted 1 | 4,933        | 3,389        | 5,355        |\n|                                                                    | 2023 million | 2022 million | 2021 million |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue - basic        | 64,953       | 68,847       | 70,937       |\n| Adjustment for share options and awards                            | 807          | 835          | 848          |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue - diluted      | 65,760       | 69,682       | 71,785       |\n| Basic earnings per share 1                                         | 7.6p         | 4.9p         | 7.5p         |\n| Diluted earnings per share 1                                       | 7.5p         | 4.9p         | 7.5p         |\n\nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, which has been calculated after deducting 180 million (2022: 198 million; 2021: 19 million) ordinary shares representing the Group's holdings of own shares in respect of employee share schemes.\n\nFor the calculation of diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares that arise in respect of share options and awards granted to employees. The number of shares that could have been acquired at the annual average price of the Company's shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options and awards is determined. This is deducted from the number of shares issuable under such options and awards to leave a residual bonus amount of shares which are added to the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, but no adjustment is made to the profit attributable to equity shareholders.\n\nThere were 41 million anti-dilutive share options and awards excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share (2022 : 63 million; 2021: 143 million).\n\n## Note 42: Share premium account\n\n|                                     | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                        | 18,504    | 18,479    | 17,863    |\n| Issued under employee share schemes | 64        | 25        | 19        |\n| Redemption of preference shares 1   | -         | -         | 597       |\n| At 31 December                      | 18,568    | 18,504    | 18,479    |",

After the first reset date or any reset date thereafter, in the event that they are not redeemed, the AT1 securities will bear interest at rates fixed periodically in advance for five-year periods based on market rates\n- \u00b7 Interest on the securities will be due and payable only at the sole discretion of Lloyds Banking Group plc, and Lloyds Banking Group plc may at any time elect to cancel any interest payment (or any part thereof) which would otherwise be payable on any interest payment date.

The loans attracted interest rates of between 1.09 per cent and 32.40 per cent in 2023 (2022: 1.01 per cent and 30.15 per cent; 2021: 0.39 per cent and 22.93 per cent).\n\nNo provisions have been recognised in respect of loans given to key management personnel (2022 and 2021 : \u00a3nil).\n\n| Deposits                                                         | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                                                     | 10        | 11        | 10        |\n| Placed (includes deposits of appointed key management personnel) | 44        | 37        | 26        |\n| Withdrawn (includes deposits of former key management personnel) | (40)      | (38)      | (25)      |\n| At 31 December                                                   | 14        | 10        | 11        |\n\nDeposits placed by key management personnel attracted interest rates of up to 6.25 per cent (2022: 5.0 per cent; 2021: 1.0 per cent). At 31 December 2023, the Group did not provide any guarantees in respect of key management personnel (2022 and 2021: none).\n\nAt 31 December 2023, transactions, arrangements and agreements entered into by the Group's banking subsidiaries with directors and connected persons included amounts outstanding in respect of loans and credit card transactions of \u00a323.4 thousand with five directors and no connected persons (2022: \u00a32.0 thousand with two directors and no connected persons; 2021: \u00a30.9 million with two directors and one connected person).",

        "page_content": "## Note 47: Related party transactions continued\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nDetails of the Group's subsidiaries and related undertakings are given on pages 344 to 356 . In accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements , transactions and balances with subsidiaries have been eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Pension funds\n\nThe Group provides banking and some investment management services to certain of its pension funds. At 31 December 2023, customer deposits of \u00a3133 million (2022: \u00a3155 million) related to the Group's pension funds. As disclosed in note 16, the Group's main pension funds have entered into a longevity insurance arrangement that was structured as a pass-through involving Scottish Widows .\n\n## Collective investment vehicles\n\nThe Group manages 129 (2022: 125) collective investment vehicles, such as Open-Ended Investment Companies (OEICs) and of these 68 (2022: 73) are consolidated. The Group invested \u00a355 million (2022: \u00a3196 million) and redeemed \u00a3210 million (2022: \u00a3486 million) in the unconsolidated collective investment vehicles during the year and had investments, at fair value, of \u00a31,448 million (2022 : \u00a31,491 million) at 31 December. The Group earned fees of \u00a372 million from the unconsolidated collective investment vehicles during 2023 (2022: \u00a380 million).\n\n## Joint ventures and associates\n\nAt 31 December 2023 there were loans and advances to customers of \u00a347 million (2022: \u00a321 million) outstanding and balances within customer deposits of \u00a36 million (2022: \u00a358 million) relating to joint ventures and associates.\n\nDuring the year the Group paid fees of \u00a34 million (2022: \u00a35 million) to its Schroders Personal Wealth joint venture and no payment was made (2022: \u00a318 million) under the terms of agreements put in place on the establishment of the joint venture.\n\nIn addition to the above balances, the Group has a number of other associates held by its venture capital business that it accounts for at fair value through profit or loss. At 31 December 2023, these companies had total assets of \u00a37,519 million (2022 : \u00a34,709 million), total liabilities of \u00a35,927 million (2022: \u00a35,557 million) and for the year ended 31 December 2023 had turnover of \u00a33,381 million (2022 : \u00a34,196 million) and made a net loss of \u00a3293 million (2022: net loss of \u00a3228 million ). In addition, the Group has provided \u00a31,574 million (2022: \u00a31,466 million) of financing to these companies on which it received \u00a3120 million (2022: \u00a398 million) of interest income in the year.\n\n## Note 48: Contingent liabilities, commitments and guarantees\n\n## Contingent liabilities, commitments and guarantees arising from the banking business\n\nAt 31 December 2023 contingent liabilities, such as performance bonds and letters of credit, arising from the banking business were \u00a32,849 million (2022: \u00a32,986 million).\n\nThe contingent liabilities of the Group arise in the normal course of its banking business and it is not practicable to quantify their future financial effect. Total commitments and guarantees were \u00a3143,319 million (2022: \u00a3143,795 million), of which in respect of undrawn formal standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments to lend, \u00a375,080 million (2022: \u00a374,692 million) was irrevocable.\n\n## Capital commitments\n\nExcluding commitments in respect of investment property (note 27), capital expenditure contracted but not provided for at 31 December 2023 amounted to \u00a31,240 million (2022: \u00a31,663 million) and related to assets to be leased to customers under operating leases. The Group's management is confident that future net revenues and funding will be sufficient to cover these commitments.\n\n## Interchange fees\n\nWith respect to multi-lateral interchange fees (MIFs), the Group is not a party in the ongoing or threatened litigation which involves the card schemes Visa and Mastercard (as described below). However, the Group is a member/licensee of Visa and Mastercard and other card schemes. The litigation in question is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Litigation brought by or on behalf of retailers against both Visa and Mastercard in the English Courts, in which retailers are seeking damages on grounds that Visa and Mastercard's MIFs breached competition law (this includes a judgment of the Supreme Court in June 2020 upholding the Court of Appeal's finding in 2018 that certain historic interchange arrangements of Mastercard and Visa infringed competition law)\n- \u00b7 Litigation brought on behalf of UK consumers in the English Courts against Mastercard\n\nAny impact on the Group of the litigation against Visa and Mastercard remains uncertain at this time, such that it is not practicable for the Group to provide an estimate of any potential financial effect. Insofar as Visa is required to pay damages to retailers for interchange fees set prior to June 2016, contractual arrangements to allocate liability have been agreed between various UK banks (including the Group) and Visa Inc, as part of Visa Inc's acquisition of Visa Europe in 2016. These arrangements cap the maximum amount of liability to which the Group may be subject and this cap is set at the cash consideration received by the Group for the sale of its stake in Visa Europe to Visa Inc in 2016. In 2016, the Group received Visa preference shares as part of the consideration for the sale of its shares in Visa Europe. A release assessment is carried out by Visa on certain anniversaries of the sale (in line with the Visa Europe sale documentation) and as a result, some Visa preference shares may be converted into Visa Inc Class A common stock from time to time. Any such release and any subsequent sale of Visa common stock does not impact the contingent liability.\n\n## LIBOR and other trading rates\n\nCertain Group companies, together with other panel banks, have been named as defendants in ongoing private lawsuits, including purported class action suits, in the US in connection with their roles as panel banks contributing to the setting of US Dollar, Japanese Yen and Sterling London Interbank Offered Rate and the Australian BBSW reference rate.\n\nCertain Group companies are also named as defendants in (i) UK-based claims, and (ii) two Dutch class actions, raising LIBOR manipulation allegations. A number of claims against the Group in the UK relating to the alleged mis-sale of interest rate hedging products also include allegations of LIBOR manipulation.\n\nIt is currently not possible to predict the scope and ultimate outcome on the  Group of any private lawsuits or ongoing related challenges to the interpretation or validity of any of the Group's contractual arrangements, including their timing and scale. As such, it is not practicable to provide an estimate of any potential financial effect.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 48: Contingent liabilities, commitments and guarantees continued\n\n## Tax authorities\n\nThe Group has an open matter in relation to a claim for group relief of losses incurred in its former Irish banking subsidiary, which ceased trading on 31 December 2010. In 2013, HMRC informed the Group that its interpretation of the UK rules means that the group relief is not available. In 2020, HMRC concluded its enquiry into the matter and issued a closure notice. The  Group's interpretation of the UK rules has not changed and hence it appealed to the First Tier Tax Tribunal, with a hearing having taken place in May 2023. If the final determination of the matter by the judicial process is that HMRC's position is correct, management believ es that this would result in an increase in current tax liabilities of approximately \u00a3920 million (including interest) and a reduction in  the Group's deferred tax asset of approximately \u00a3285 million. The Group, following conclusion of the hearing and having taken appropriate advice, does not consider that this is a case where additional tax will ultimately fall due.\n\nThere are a number of other open matters on which the Group is in discussions with HMRC (including the tax treatment of certain costs arising from the divestment of TSB Banking Group plc), none of which is expected to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.\n\n## FCA investigation into the Group's anti-money laundering control framework\n\nThe FCA has opened an investigation into the Group's compliance with domestic UK money laundering regulations and the FCA's rules and Principles for Businesses, with a focus on aspects of its anti-money laundering control framework. The Group has been fully cooperating with the investigation. It is not currently possible to estimate the potential financial impact, if any, to the Group.\n\n## Other legal actions and regulatory matters\n\nIn addition, in the course of its business the Group is subject to other complaints and threatened or actual legal proceedings (including class or group action claims) brought by or on behalf of current or former employees, customers (including their appointed representatives), investors or other third parties, as well as legal and regulatory reviews, enquiries and examinations, requests for information, audits, challenges, investigations and enforcement actions, which could relate to a number of issues. This includes matters in relation to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, such as those relating to prudential regulation, consumer protection, investment advice, business conduct, systems and controls, environmental, competition/anti-trust, tax, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and sanctions, some of which may be beyond the Group's control, both in the UK and overseas. Where material, such matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the Group incurring a liability. The Group does not currently expect the final outcome of any such case to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, operations or cash flows. Where there is a contingent liability related to an existing provision the relevant disclosures are included within note 38.\n\n## Note 49: Structured entities\n\nThe Group's interests in structured entities are both consolidated and unconsolidated. Details of the Group's interests in consolidated structured entities are set out in note 29 for securitisations and covered bond vehicles, note 16 for structured entities associated with the Group's pension schemes, and below in part (A) and (B). Details of the Group's interests in unconsolidated structured entities are included below in part (C).\n\n## (A)  Asset-backed conduits\n\nIn addition to the structured entities discussed in note 29, which are used for securitisation and covered bond programmes, the Group sponsors an active asset-backed conduit, Cancara, which invests in client receivables and debt securities. The total consolidated exposure of Cancara at 31 December 2023 was \u00a32,808 million (2022: \u00a32,357 million), comprising \u00a31,521 million of loans and advances (2022: \u00a31,464 million), \u00a3698 million of debt securities (2022: \u00a3850 million) and \u00a3589 million of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (2022: \u00a343 million).\n\nAll lending assets and debt securities held by the Group in Cancara are restricted in use, as they are held by the collateral agent for the benefit of the commercial paper investors and the liquidity providers only. The Group provides liquidity facilities to Cancara under terms that are usual and customary for standard lending activities in the normal course of the Group's banking activities. During 2023 there have continued to be planned drawdowns on certain liquidity facilities for balance sheet management purposes, supporting the programme to provide funding alongside the proceeds of the asset-backed commercial paper issuance. The Group could be asked to provide support under the contractual terms of these arrangements including, for example, if Cancara experienced a shortfall in external funding, which may occur in the event of market disruption.\n\nThe external assets in Cancara are consolidated in the Group's financial statements.\n\n## (B)  Consolidated collective investment vehicles and limited partnerships\n\nThe assets of the Insurance business held in consolidated collective investment vehicles, such as Open-Ended Investment Companies and limited partnerships, are not directly available for use by the Group. However, the Group's investment in the majority of these collective investment vehicles is readily realisable. As at 31 December 2023, the total carrying value of these consolidated collective investment vehicle assets and liabilities held by the Group was \u00a358,351 million (2022: \u00a354,749 million).\n\nThe Group has no contractual arrangements (such as liquidity facilities) that would require it to provide financial or other support to the consolidated collective investment vehicles; the Group has not previously provided such support and has no current intentions to provide such support.\n\n## (C)  Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe Group considers itself the sponsor of a structured entity where it is primarily involved in the design and establishment of the structured entity and further where the Group transfers assets to the structured entity, markets products associated with the structured entity in its own name and/or provides guarantees regarding the structured entity's performance.\n\nThe Group sponsors a range of diverse investment funds and limited partnerships where it acts as the fund manager or equivalent decision-maker and markets the funds under one of the Group's brands.",

The carrying amount of assets transferred to securitisation vehicles at the time of transfer was \u00a35,625 million and the Group recognised a gain of \u00a331 million on transfer.\n\n## Continuing involvement in financial assets that have been derecognised\n\nThe Group has derecognised financial assets in their entirety following transactions with securitisation vehicles, as noted above. The continuing involvement largely arises from funding provided to the vehicles through the purchase of issued notes. The majority of these notes are recognised as debt securities held at amortised cost. The remaining notes held by the Group, together with interest rate derivatives transacted with the vehicles, are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. The carrying amount of these interests and the maximum exposure to loss is included in the table above. At 31 December 2023 the fair value of the retained notes was \u00a34,142 million. The income from the Group's interest in these structures for the year ended 31 December 2023 and cumulatively for the lifetime was \u00a3133 million.\n\n## Note 50: Transfers of financial assets\n\n## Transferred financial assets derecognised in their entirety with ongoing exposure\n\nThrough asset securitisations, the Group has transferred financial assets which were derecognised in their entirety, with some continuing involvement. Further details are available in note 49.\n\n## Transferred financial assets that continue to be recognised\n\nDetails of transferred financial assets that continue to be recognised in full are as follows.\n\nThe Group enters into repurchase and securities lending transactions in the normal course of business that do not result in derecognition of the financial assets as substantially all of the risks and rewards, including credit, interest rate, prepayment and other price risks are retained by the Group. In all cases, the transferee has the right to sell or repledge the assets concerned.\n\nAs set out in note 29, included within financial assets measured at amortised cost are loans transferred under the Group's securitisation and covered bond programmes. As the Group retains all or a majority of the risks and rewards associated with these loans, including credit, interest rate, prepayment and liquidity risk, they remain on the Group's balance sheet. Assets transferred into the Group's securitisation and covered bond programmes are not available to be used by the Group while the assets are within the programmes. However, the Group retains the right to remove loans from the covered bond programmes where they are in excess of the programme's requirements. In addition, where the Group has retained some of the notes issued by securitisation and covered bond programmes, the Group has the ability to sell or pledge these retained notes.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 52: Financial risk management\n\nAs a bancassurer, financial instruments are fundamental to the Group's activities and, as a consequence, the risks associated with financial instruments represent a significant component of the risks faced by the Group.\n\nThe primary risks affecting the Group through its use of financial instruments are: market risk, which includes interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk; credit risk; liquidity risk; capital risk; and insurance risk. The following disclosures provide quantitative and qualitative information about the Group's exposure to these risks.\n\n## Market risk\n\n## (A)  Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk arises from the different repricing characteristics of the Group's assets and liabilities. Liabilities are generally either insensitive to interest rate movements, for example interest free or very low interest customer deposits, or are sensitive to interest rate changes but bear rates which may be varied at the Group's discretion and that for competitive reasons generally reflect changes in the UK Bank Rate, set by the Bank of England. The rates on the remaining liabilities are contractually fixed for their term to maturity.\n\nMany banking assets are sensitive to interest rate movements; there is a large volume of managed rate assets such as variable rate mortgages which may be considered as a natural offset to the interest rate risk arising from the managed rate liabilities. However, a significant proportion of the Group's lending assets, for example many personal loans and mortgages, bear interest rates which are contractually fixed. Interest rate sensitivity analysis relating to the Group's banking activities is set out in the tables marked audited on page 188 .\n\nThe Group's risk management policy is to optimise reward while managing its market risk exposures within the risk appetite defined by the Board. The largest residual risk exposure arises from balances that are deemed to be insensitive to changes in market rates (including current accounts, a portion of variable rate deposits and investable equity), and is managed through the  Group's structural hedge. The structural hedge consists of longer-term fixed rate assets or interest rate swaps and the amount and duration of the hedging activity is reviewed regularly by the Group Asset and Liability Committee.\n\nThe Group establishes hedge accounting relationships for interest rate risk components using cash flow hedges and fair value hedges. The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on its variable rate loans and deposits together with its floating rate subordinated debt. The derivatives used to manage the structural hedge may be designated into cash flow hedges to manage income statement volatility. The economic items related to the structural hedge, for example current accounts, are not eligible hedged items under IAS 39 for inclusion into accounting hedge relationships. The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate customer loans, its fixed rate customer deposits and the majority of its subordinated debt, and to cash flow interest rate risk on its variable rate loans and deposits together with its floating rate subordinated debt. The Group applies netting between similar risks before applying hedge accounting.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness arises during the management of interest rate risk due to residual unhedged risk. Sources of ineffectiveness, which the Group may decide to not fully mitigate, can include basis differences, timing differences and notional amount differences. The effectiveness of accounting hedge relationships is assessed between the hedging derivatives and the documented hedged item, which can differ to the underlying economically hedged item.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 the aggregate notional principal of interest rate and other swaps (predominantly interest rate) designated as fair value hedges was \u00a3153,639 million (2022: \u00a3152,662 million) with a net fair value liability of \u00a3345 million (2022: liability of \u00a3493 million) (note 22). The losses on the hedging instruments were \u00a32,663 million (2022: gains of \u00a31,284 million). The gains on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were \u00a32,396 million (2022: losses of \u00a31,325 million). The gains and losses relating to the fair value hedges are recorded in net trading income.\n\nThe notional principal of the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges at 31 December 2023  was \u00a3463,660 million (2022: \u00a3249,703 million) with a net fair value asset of \u00a31 million (2022: liability of \u00a32 million) (note 22). In 2023, ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement that arises from cash flow hedges was a gain of \u00a319 million (2022: loss of \u00a310 million).\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nFollowing the completion of industry events, including the two London Clearing House USD derivatives transition events in the second quarter of the year, together with bilateral customer consents, the Group has transitioned materially all of its LIBOR linked products. We continue to work with customers to transition a small number of remaining contracts that were not subject to the above events and either have a future dated transition trigger or have defaulted to the relevant synthetic LIBOR benchmark in the interim. Each remaining contract has a known path to transition which is not expected to have a material impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\nWhile the volume of outstanding transactions impacted by IBOR benchmark reforms continues to reduce, the Group does not expect material changes to its risk management approach.\n\n## (B)  Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe corporate and retail businesses incur foreign exchange risk in the course of providing services to their customers. All non-structural foreign exchange exposures in the non-trading book are managed centrally within allocated exposure limits. Trading book exposures in the authorised trading centres are allocated exposure limits. The limits are monitored daily by the local centres and reported to the market and liquidity risk function in London. Associated VaR and the closing, average, maximum and minimum are disclosed in the tables marked audited on page 190 .\n\nThe Group manages foreign currency accounting exposure via cash flow hedge accounting, utilising currency swaps and forward foreign exchange trades.\n\nRisk arises from the Group's investments in its overseas operations. The Group's structural foreign currency exposure is represented by the net asset value of the foreign currency equity and subordinated debt investments in its subsidiaries and branches. Gains or losses on structural foreign currency exposures are taken to reserves. The Group's main overseas operations are in the Americas and Europe.",

Credit risk appetite is set at Board level and is described and reported through a suite of metrics devised from a combination of accounting and credit portfolio performance measures, which include the use of various credit risk rating systems as inputs and assess credit risk at a counterparty level using three components: (i) the probability of default by the counterparty on its contractual obligations; (ii) the current exposures to the counterparty and their likely future development, from which the Group derives the exposure at default; and (iii) the likely loss ratio on the defaulted obligations, the loss given default. The Group uses a range of approaches to mitigate credit risk, including internal control policies, obtaining collateral, using master netting agreements and other credit risk transfers, such as asset sales and credit derivatives based transactions.\n\n## (A)  Maximum credit exposure\n\nThe maximum credit risk exposure of the Group in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations is detailed below. No account is taken of any collateral held and the maximum exposure to loss, which includes amounts held to cover unit-linked and With Profits Funds liabilities, is considered to be the balance sheet carrying amount or, for non-derivative off-balance sheet transactions and financial guarantees, their contractual nominal amounts.\n\n|                                                                                              | 2023                | 2023        | 2023            | 2022 1              | 2022 1      | 2022 1          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|-----------------|\n|                                                                                              | Maximum exposure \u00a3m | 2 Offset \u00a3m | Net exposure \u00a3m | Maximum exposure \u00a3m | Offset 2 \u00a3m | Net exposure \u00a3m |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 3,4                                    | 84,583              | -           | 84,583          | 73,887              | -           | 73,887          |\n| Derivative financial instruments                                                             | 22,356              | (9,862)     | 12,494          | 24,753              | (12,330)    | 12,423          |\n| Financial assets at amortised cost, net 5 :                                                  |                     |             |                 |                     |             |                 |\n| Loans and advances to banks, net 5                                                           | 10,764              | -           | 10,764          | 10,632              | -           | 10,632          |\n| Loans and advances to customers, net 5                                                       | 449,745             | (2,214)     | 447,531         | 454,899             | (2,171)     | 452,728         |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements, net 5                                                         | 38,771              | -           | 38,771          | 44,865              | -           | 44,865          |\n| Debt securities, net 5                                                                       | 15,355              | -           | 15,355          | 9,926               | -           | 9,926           |\n|                                                                                              | 514,635             | (2,214)     | 512,421         | 520,322             | (2,171)     | 518,151         |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive  3 income                         | 27,360              | -           | 27,360          | 22,871              | -           | 22,871          |\n| Reinsurance contract assets                                                                  | 442                 | -           | 442             | 372                 | -           | 372             |\n| Off-balance sheet items:                                                                     |                     |             |                 |                     |             |                 |\n| Acceptances and endorsements                                                                 | 191                 | -           | 191             | 58                  | -           | 58              |\n| Other items serving as direct credit substitutes                                             | 286                 | -           | 286             | 781                 | -           | 781             |\n| Performance bonds, including letters of credit, and other  transaction-related contingencies | 2,372               | -           | 2,372           | 2,147               | -           | 2,147           |\n| Irrevocable commitments and guarantees                                                       | 75,080              | -           | 75,080          | 74,692              | -           | 74,692          |\n|                                                                                              | 77,929              | -           | 77,929          | 77,678              | -           | 77,678          |\n|                                                                                              | 727,305             | (12,076)    | 715,229         | 719,883             | (14,501)    | 705,382         |\n\n- 4 Includes assets within the Group's unit-linked funds for which credit risk is borne by the policyholders and assets within the Group's With-Profits Funds for which credit risk is largely borne by the policyholders.

Credit policies and appetite statements are aligned to the Group's risk appetite and restrict exposure to higher risk countries and potentially vulnerable sectors and asset classes. Exposures are monitored to prevent both an excessive concentration of risk and single name concentrations. The Group's largest credit limits are regularly monitored by the Board Risk Committee and reported in accordance with regulatory requirements. As part of its credit risk policy, the Group considers sustainability risk (which incorporates environmental (including climate), social and governance) in the assessment of Commercial Banking facilities.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 the most significant concentrations of exposure were in mortgages.\n\n|                                                                              | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Agriculture, forestry and fishing                                            | 7,038     | 7,447     |\n| Construction                                                                 | 3,878     | 4,066     |\n| Energy and water supply                                                      | 3,468     | 2,552     |\n| Financial, business and other services                                       | 35,112    | 37,666    |\n| Lease financing                                                              | 17,374    | 16,795    |\n| Manufacturing                                                                | 4,021     | 3,619     |\n| Personal:                                                                    |           |           |\n| Mortgages 1                                                                  | 323,627   | 323,923   |\n| Other                                                                        | 25,342    | 26,154    |\n| Postal and telecommunications                                                | 2,654     | 2,526     |\n| Property companies                                                           | 20,904    | 21,499    |\n| Transport, distribution and hotels                                           | 10,044    | 13,170    |\n| Total loans and advances to customers before allowance for impairment losses | 453,462   | 459,417   |\n| Allowance for impairment losses (note 24)                                    | (3,717)   | (4,518)   |\n| Total loans and advances to customers                                        | 449,745   | 454,899   |\n\nThe Group's operations are predominantly UK based and as a result an analysis of credit risk exposures by geographical region is not provided.",

Consequently, the Group has no significant exposure to credit risk for such assets which back those contract liabilities.\n\n## Loans and advances banks\n\nSignificantly all of the Group's loans and advances to banks are assessed as Stage 1.\n\n## Loans and advances to customers\n\nThe analysis of lending has been prepared based on the division in which the asset is held; with the business segment in which the exposure is recorded reflected in the ratings system applied. The internal credit ratings systems used by the Group differ between Retail and Commercial, reflecting the characteristics of these exposures and the way that they are managed internally; these credit ratings are set out below. All probabilities of default (PDs) include forward-looking information and are based on 12-month values, with the exception of credit-impaired.\n\n| Retail                 |                 | Commercial             |                 |\n|------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------|\n| Quality classification | IFRS 9 PD range | Quality classification | IFRS 9 PD range |\n| RMS 1-3                | 0.00-0.80%      | CMS 1-5                | 0.000-0.100%    |\n| RMS 4-6                | 0.81-4.50%      | CMS 6-10               | 0.101-0.500%    |\n| RMS 7-9                | 4.51-14.00%     | CMS 11-14              | 0.501-3.000%    |\n| RMS 10                 | 14.01-20.00%    | CMS 15-18              | 3.001-20.000%   |\n| RMS 11-13              | 20.01-99.99%    | CMS 19                 | 20.001-99.999%  |\n| RMS 14                 | 100.00%         | CMS 20-23              | 100.000%        |\n\nStage 3 assets include balances of \u00a3364 million (2022: \u00a3727 million) (with outstanding amounts due of \u00a31,167 million (2022: \u00a31,360 million)) which have been subject to a partial write-off and where the Group continues to enforce recovery action.\n\nStage 2 and Stage 3 assets with a carrying amount of \u00a3180 million (2022: \u00a3126 million) were modified during the year.

Commitments to extend credit represent unused portions of authorisations to extend credit in the form of loans, guarantees or letters of credit. The Group is theoretically exposed to loss in an amount equal to the total guarantees or unused commitments, however, the likely amount of loss is expected to be significantly less. Most commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards.",

The terms and conditions associated with the use of the collateral are varied and are dependent on both the type of agreement and the counterparty. The Group holds collateral against loans and advances and irrevocable loan commitments; qualitative and, where appropriate, quantitative information is provided in respect of this collateral below. Collateral held as security for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and for derivative assets is also shown below.\n\nThe Group holds collateral in respect of loans and advances to customers and reverse repurchase agreements as set out below. The Group does not hold collateral against debt securities which are classified as financial assets held at amortised cost.\n\n## Loans and advances to customers\n\n## Retail lending\n\n## UK mortgages\n\nAn analysis by loan-to-value ratio of the Group's UK residential mortgage lending is provided below. The value of collateral used in determining the loan-to-value ratios has been estimated based upon the last actual valuation, adjusted to take into account subsequent movements in house prices. The market takes into account many factors, including environmental considerations such as flood risk and energy efficient additions, in arriving at the value of a home.\n\nIn some circumstances, where the discounted value of the estimated net proceeds from the liquidation of collateral (i.e. net of costs, expected haircuts and anticipated changes in the value of the collateral to the point of sale) is greater than the estimated exposure at default, no credit losses are expected and no ECL allowance is recognised.\n\n|                             | Gross drawn exposures   | Gross drawn exposures   | Gross drawn exposures   | Gross drawn exposures   | Gross drawn exposures   | Allowance for expected credit losses   | Allowance for expected credit losses   | Allowance for expected credit losses   | Allowance for expected credit losses   | Allowance for expected credit losses   |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|                             | Stage 1 \u00a3m              | Stage 2 \u00a3m              | Stage 3 \u00a3m              | POCI \u00a3m                 | Total \u00a3m                | Stage 1 \u00a3m                             | Stage 2 \u00a3m                             | Stage 3 \u00a3m                             | POCI \u00a3m                                | Total \u00a3m                               |\n| At 31 December 2023         |                         |                         |                         |                         |                         |                                        |                                        |                                        |                                        |                                        |\n| Less than 70 per cent       | 193,235                 | 28,754                  | 3,882                   | 7,168                   | 233,039                 | 57                                     | 208                                    | 226                                    | 118                                    | 609                                    |\n| 70 per cent to 80 per cent  | 36,413                  | 4,506                   | 290                     | 333                     | 41,542                  | 37                                     | 75                                     | 61                                     | 26                                     | 199                                    |\n| 80 per cent to 90 per cent  | 20,949                  | 2,821                   | 87                      | 142                     | 23,999                  | 48                                     | 53                                     | 27                                     | 20                                     | 148                                    |\n| 90 per cent to 100 per cent | 5,981                   | 2,389                   | 30                      | 91                      | 8,491                   | 19                                     | 31                                     | 12                                     | 14                                     | 76                                     |\n| Greater than 100 per cent   | 18                      | 63                      | 48                      | 120                     | 249                     | -

Lending decisions are predominantly based on an obligor's ability to repay rather than reliance on the disposal of any security provided. Where the lending is secured, collateral values are rigorously assessed at the time of loan origination and are thereafter monitored in accordance with business unit credit policy.\n\nThe Group's credit risk disclosures for unimpaired other retail lending show assets gross of collateral and therefore disclose the maximum loss exposure. The Group believes that this approach is appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 52: Financial risk management continued\n\n## Commercial lending\n\n## Stage 1 and Stage 2 secured lending\n\nFor Stage 1 and Stage 2 secured commercial lending, the Group reports assets gross of collateral and therefore discloses the maximum loss exposure.\n\nStage 1 and Stage 2 secured commercial lending is predominantly managed on a cash flow basis. On occasion, it may include an assessment of underlying collateral, although, for Stage 3 lending, this will not always involve assessing it on a fair value basis. No aggregated collateral information for the entire unimpaired secured commercial lending portfolio is provided to key management personnel.\n\n## Stage 3 secured lending\n\nThe value of collateral is re-evaluated and its legal soundness reassessed if there is observable evidence of distress of the borrower; this evaluation is used to determine potential loss allowances and management's strategy to try to either repair the business or recover the debt.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, Stage 3 secured commercial lending amounted to \u00a3507 million, net of an impairment allowance of \u00a3133 million (2022: \u00a3410 million, net of an impairment allowance of \u00a3160 million). The fair value of the collateral held in respect of impaired secured commercial lending was \u00a3608 million (2022: \u00a3484 million). In determining the fair value of collateral, no specific amounts have been attributed to the costs of realisation. For the purposes of determining the total collateral held by the Group in respect of impaired secured commercial lending, the value of collateral for each loan has been limited to the principal amount of the outstanding advance in order to eliminate the effects of any over-collateralisation and to provide a clearer representation of the Group's exposure.\n\nStage 3 secured commercial lending and associated collateral relates to lending to property companies and to customers in the financial, business and other services; transport, distribution and hotels; and construction industries.\n\n## Reverse repurchase agreements\n\nThere were reverse repurchase agreements which are accounted for as collateralised loans with a carrying value of \u00a338,771 million (2022: \u00a344,865 million), against which the Group held collateral with a fair value of \u00a338,510 million, capped at the reverse repurchase agreement carrying value (2022: \u00a333,715 million). These transactions were generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard secured lending activities.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (excluding equity shares)\n\nIncluded in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are reverse repurchase agreements treated as collateralised loans with a carrying value of \u00a317,413 million (2022: \u00a311,781 million). Collateral is held with a fair value of \u00a317,301 million, capped at the reverse repurchase agreement carrying value (2022: \u00a39,598 million), all of which the Group is able to repledge. At 31 December 2023, \u00a39,926 million had been repledged (2022: \u00a35,232 million).\n\nIn addition, securities held as collateral in the form of stock borrowed amounted to \u00a317,280 million (2022 : \u00a326,368 million). Of this amount, \u00a39,363 million (2022: \u00a314,375 million) had been resold or repledged as collateral for the Group's own transactions.\n\nThese transactions were generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard secured lending activities.\n\n## Derivative assets, after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements\n\nThe Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquid securities. In respect of the net derivative assets after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements of \u00a312,494 million (2022: \u00a312,423 million), cash collateral of \u00a33,361 million (2022: \u00a33,951 million) was held.\n\n## Irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related contingencies\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group held irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related contingencies of \u00a377,929 million (2022: \u00a377,678 million). Collateral is held as security, in the event that lending is drawn down, on \u00a313,036 million (2022 : \u00a316,442 million) of these balances.\n\n## Collateral repossessed\n\nDuring the year, \u00a3229 million of collateral was repossessed (2022: \u00a3219 million), consisting primarily of residential property.\n\nIn respect of retail portfolios, the Group does not take physical possession of properties or other assets held as collateral and uses external agents to realise the value as soon as practicable, generally at auction, to settle indebtedness. Any surplus funds are returned to the borrower or are otherwise dealt with in accordance with appropriate insolvency regulations. In certain circumstances the  Group takes physical possession of assets held as collateral against commercial lending. In such cases, the assets are carried on the  Group's balance sheet and are classified according to the Group's accounting policies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (E)  Collateral pledged as security\n\nThe Group pledges assets primarily for repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions which are generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard securitised borrowing contracts.\n\n## Repurchase transactions\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nThere are balances arising from repurchase transactions of \u00a337,703 million (2022: \u00a348,596 million), which include amounts due under the Bank of England's Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME). The fair value of the collateral provided under these agreements at 31 December 2023 was \u00a337,655 million, capped at the repurchase agreement carrying value (2022: \u00a353,827 million including over collaterisation).\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nThe fair value of collateral pledged in respect of repurchase transactions, accounted for as secured borrowing, where the secured party is permitted by contract or custom to repledge was \u00a317,941 million, capped at the repurchase agreement carrying value (2022: \u00a310,427 million).",

Further details of these assets are provided in note 29.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group has insufficient financial resources to meet its commitments as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost. Liquidity risk is managed through a series of measures, tests and reports that are primarily based on contractual maturity. The Group carries out monthly stress testing of its liquidity position against a range of scenarios, including those prescribed by the PRA. The Group's liquidity risk appetite is also calibrated against a number of stressed liquidity metrics.\n\nThe table below analyses assets and liabilities of the Group, other than liabilities arising from insurance and investment contracts, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining contractual period at the balance sheet date; balances with no fixed maturity are included in the over 5 years category. Liabilities arising from insurance and investment contracts are analysed on a behavioural basis. Certain balances, included in the table below on the basis of their residual maturity, are repayable on demand upon payment of a penalty.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                            | Up to 1 month \u00a3m   | 1 to 3 months \u00a3m   | 3 to 6 months \u00a3m   | 6 to 9 months \u00a3m   | 9 to 12 months \u00a3m   | 1 to 2 years \u00a3m   | 2 to 5 years \u00a3m   | Over 5 years \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|\n| At 31 December 2023                                                        |                    |                    |                    |                    |                     |                   |                   |                   |            |\n| Assets                                                                     |                    |                    |                    |                    |                     |                   |                   |                   |            |\n| Cash and balances at central banks                                         | 78,110             | -

The Group's assets and liabilities may be repaid or otherwise mature earlier or later than implied by their contractual terms and readers are, therefore, advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Group's liquidity position. In particular, amounts in respect of customer deposits are usually contractually payable on demand or at short notice. However, in practice, these deposits are not usually withdrawn on their contractual maturity.\n\nThe table below analyses financial instrument liabilities of the Group, excluding those arising from insurance and participating investment contracts, on an undiscounted future cash flow basis according to contractual maturity, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date; balances with no fixed maturity are included in the over  5 years category.\n\n|                                                                 | Up to 1 month \u00a3m   | 1 to 3 months \u00a3m   | 3 to 12 months \u00a3m   | 1 to 5 years \u00a3m   | Over 5 years \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|\n| At 31 December 2023                                             |                    |                    |                     |                   |                   |            |\n| Deposits from banks                                             | 2,093              | 1,073              | 623                 | 2,394             | -                 | 6,183      |\n| Customer deposits                                               | 427,695            | 11,133             | 22,572              | 10,767            | 325               | 472,492    |\n| Repurchase agreements at amortised cost                         | 3,627              | 4,092              | 1,085               | 31,399            | -                 | 40,203     |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss      | 8,801              | 4,157              | 5,694               | 1,808             | 5,845             | 26,305     |\n| Debt securities in issue at amortised cost                      | 2,334              | 8,492              | 21,111              | 40,741            | 8,085             | 80,763     |\n| Liabilities arising from non-participating investment contracts | 44,978             | -                  | -                   | -                 | -                 | 44,978     |\n| Lease liabilities                                               | 18                 | 70                 | 247                 | 779               | 666               | 1,780      |\n| Subordinated liabilities                                        | 32                 | 80                 | 1,274               | 6,627             | 7,822             | 15,835     |\n| Total non-derivative financial liabilities                      | 489,578            | 29,097             | 52,606              | 94,515            | 22,743            | 688,539    |\n| Derivative financial liabilities                                |                    |                    |                     |                   |                   |            |\n| Gross settled derivatives - outflows                            | 80,148             | 46,874             | 47,777              | 35,807            | 20,302            | 230,908    |\n| Gross settled derivatives - inflows                             | (78,031)           | (45,249)           | (46,575)            | (35,753)          | (20,327)          | (225,935)  |\n| Gross settled derivatives - net flows                           | 2,117              | 1,625              | 1,202               | 54                | (25)              | 4,973      |\n| Net settled derivative liabilities                              | 12,095             | 138                | 161                 | 402               | 1,501             | 14,297     |\n| Total derivative financial liabilities                          | 14,212             | 1,763              | 1,363               | 456               | 1,476             | 19,270     |",

The Group assesses both its regulatory capital requirements and the quantity and quality of capital resources it holds to meet those requirements in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD V) and Capital Requirements Regulation (UK CRR). This is supplemented through additional regulation set out under the PRA Rulebook and through associated statements of policy, supervisory statements and other regulatory guidance. Regulatory capital ratios are considered a key part of the budgeting and planning processes and forecast ratios are reviewed by the Group Asset and Liability Committee. Target capital levels take account of current and future regulatory requirements, capacity for growth and to cover uncertainties. Details of the Group's capital resources are provided in the table marked audited on page 149 .\n\nEach insurance company within the Group is regulated by the PRA. The insurance businesses are required to calculate solvency capital requirements and available capital in accordance with Solvency II. The Group complied with these requirements in 2023 and 2022. The Insurance business of the Group calculates regulatory capital on the basis of an internal model, which was approved by the PRA on 5 December 2015, with the latest major change to the model approved in November 2020. The capital position of the Group's insurance businesses is reviewed on a regular basis by the Insurance, Pensions and Investments Executive Committee.\n\n## Insurance risk\n\nInsurance underwriting risk is the risk of adverse developments in the timing, frequency and severity of claims for insured/underwritten events and in customer behaviour, leading to reductions in earnings and/or value and arises within the Group's Insurance business. Insurance underwriting risk is measured using a variety of techniques including stress, reverse stress and scenario testing, as well as stochastic modelling. Current and potential future insurance underwriting risk exposures are assessed and aggregated on a range of stresses including risk measures based on 1-in-200 year stresses for the Insurance business's regulatory capital assessments and other supporting measures where appropriate. The Group also mitigates insurance underwriting risk via the use of reinsurance arrangements. The Group's critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty for its Insurance business are set out in note 36.\n\n## Note 53: Cash flow statement\n\n(A)  Change in operating assets\n\n|                                                                 | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 1,2 \u00a3m   | 2021 2 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|\n| Change in financial assets held at amortised cost               | 12,311    | (1,639)       | (2,379)     |\n| Change in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss | (22,539)  | 26,219        | (15,565)    |\n| Change in derivative financial instruments                      | 1,805     | (7,704)       | 6,132       |\n| Change in other operating assets                                | (687)     | (141)         | 1,447       |\n| Change in operating assets                                      | (9,110)   | 16,735        | (10,365)    |\n\n- 1 Restated for the adoption of IFRS 17; see notes 1 and 54.\n- 2 Restated for presentational changes; see note 1.",

The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nThe financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and all derivative contracts. The accounting policies of the Company are the same as those of the Group, which are set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Investments in subsidiaries are carried at historical cost, less any provisions for impairment. Fees payable to the Company's auditors by the Group are set out in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 2: Measurement basis of financial assets and liabilities Measurement basis of financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe accounting policies in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describe how different classes of financial instruments are measured, and how income and expenses, including fair value gains and losses, are recognised. The following table analyses the carrying amounts of the Company's financial assets and liabilities by category and by balance sheet heading.\n\n|                                                            | Derivatives  designated   | Mandatorily held at fair  value through profit or loss   | Mandatorily held at fair  value through profit or loss   | Designated             | Held at   |        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------|--------|\n|                                                            | as hedging                | Held for                                                 |                                                          | at fair value  through | amortised |        |\n|                                                            | instruments               | trading                                                  | Other                                                    |                        | cost      | Total  |\n|                                                            | \u00a3m                        | \u00a3m                                                       | \u00a3m                                                       | profit or loss \u00a3m      | \u00a3m        | \u00a3m     |\n| At 31 December 2023                                        |                           |                                                          |                                                          |                        |           |        |\n| Financial assets                                           |                           |                                                          |                                                          |                        |           |        |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                  | -

The contractual terms of such instruments contain certain write-down and conversion features and so are not considered to satisfy the solely payments of principal and interest test.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss represent debt securities in issue which are accounted for at fair value to significantly reduce an accounting mismatch. The changes in the credit risk of these liabilities are linked to the changes in credit risk on corresponding assets that the Company holds at fair value through profit or loss, representing debt securities issued by subsidiaries. Given the economic relationship between these assets and liabilities, the Company presents changes in the credit risk of its liabilities in profit or loss in order to avoid creating or enlarging an accounting mismatch.\n\nThe amount contractually payable on maturity of the debt securities held at fair value through profit or loss at 31 December 2023 was \u00a318,397 million, which was \u00a376 million lower than the balance sheet carrying value (2022: \u00a314,433 million, which was \u00a3568 million higher than the balance sheet carrying value). At 31 December 2023 there was a cumulative \u00a3756 million increase in the fair value of these liabilities attributable to changes in credit risk (2022: increase of \u00a3425 million), of which a \u00a3331 million increase arose in 2023 and a \u00a3117 million decrease arose in 2022; this is determined by reference to the quoted credit spreads of the Company.\n\n## Note 3: Fair values of financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe valuation techniques for the Company's financial instruments are as discussed in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Valuation hierarchy\n\nThe table below analyses the assets and liabilities of the Company. With the exception of derivatives and those financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value through profit or loss, all assets and liabilities are held at amortised cost. They are categorised into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which their fair value is observable. No assets or liabilities were categorised as level 1 (2022: none).\n\n|                                                             | 2023     | 2023   | 2023                | 2023                | 2022     | 2022   | 2022                | 2022                |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|--------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                             | Carrying | Fair   | Valuation hierarchy | Valuation hierarchy | Carrying | Fair   | Valuation hierarchy | Valuation hierarchy |\n|                                                             | value    | value  | Level 2             | Level 3             | value    | value  | Level 2             | Level 3             |\n|                                                             | \u00a3m       | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m                  | \u00a3m                  | \u00a3m       | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m                  | \u00a3m                  |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss       | 21,453   | 21,453 | 21,453              | -                   | 20,292   | 20,292 | 20,292              | -                   |\n| Derivative financial instruments                            | 552      | 552    | 552                 | -                   | 1,197    | 1,197  | 1,197               | -                   |\n| Amounts due from subsidiaries                               | -        | -      | -                   | -                   | -        | -      | -                   | -                   |\n| Debt securities                                             | 2,429    | 2,259  | 2,259               | -                   | 2,279    | 2,279  | 2,279               | -                   |\n| Loans to subsidiaries                                       | 14,742   | 14,742 | 14,742              | -                   | 14,119   | 14,119 | 14,119              | -                   |\n| Total financial assets                                      | 39,176   | 39,006 | 39,006              | -                   | 37,887   | 37,887 | 37,887              | -                   |\n| Due to subsidiaries                                         | 3        | 3      | 3                   | -                   | 27       | 27     | 27                  | -                   |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or  loss | 18,473   | 18,473 | 18,473              | -                   | 13,865   | 13,865 | 13,865              | -                   |\n| Derivative financial instruments                            | 1,129    | 1,129  | 1,129               | -                   | 1,550    | 1,550  | 1,550               | -                   |\n| Debt securities in issue at amortised cost                  | 10,211   | 9,948  | 9,948               | -                   | 15,366   | 14,663 | 14,663              | -                   |\n| Subordinated liabilities                                    | 9,707    | 9,515  | 9,515               | -                   | 9,218    | 8,221  | 8,221               | -                   |\n| Total financial liabilities                                 | 39,523   | 39,068 | 39,068              | -                   | 40,026   | 38,326 | 38,326              | -                   |\n\nThe carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents (2023: \u00a317 million; 2022: \u00a348 million) is a reasonable approximation of fair value.\n\n## Note 4: Amounts due from subsidiaries\n\nThese comprise short-term lending to subsidiaries, repayable on demand. As required by IFRS 9, the Company has established an allowance for impairment losses for amounts due from its subsidiaries (31 December 2023: \u00a36 million; 31 December 2022: \u00a316 million) based on the probability of its subsidiaries defaulting on the amounts payable in the next 12 months.

The movement in the deferred tax asset during 2023 primarily related to financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss (giving rise to a \u00a333 million charge to the income statement) and shared-based payments (giving rise to a \u00a311 million credit in equity).\n\n## Note 6: Debt securities in issue at amortised cost\n\nThese comprise notes issued by the Company in a number of currencies, although predominantly US Dollars and Euros, with maturity dates ranging up to 2038.",

If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is and we would ask that shareholders take steps to protect themselves. We strongly recommend seeking advice from an independent financial adviser authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Shareholders can verify whether a firm is authorised via the Financial Services Register which is available at www.fca.org.uk  .\n\nIf a shareholder is concerned that they may have been targeted by such a scheme, please contact the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 or use the online 'Share Fraud Reporting Form' available from their website (see above). We would also recommend contacting the Police through Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or visiting www.actionfraud.org.uk   for further information.\n\n## Important shareholder and registrar information\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompany website www.lloydsbankinggroup.com\n\n## Shareholder information help.shareview.co.uk\n\n(from here you will be able to email your query securely)\n\n## Registrar\n\nEquiniti Limited Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing\n\nWest Sussex BN99 6DA\n\n## Shareholder helpline\n\n+44 (0) 371 384 2990*\n\n(please use the country code when contacting Equiniti Limited from outside the UK)\n\n- * Lines are open 8:30am to 5:30pm (UK time), Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays in England and Wales).\n\nFor deaf and speech impaired customers, we welcome calls via Relay UK.

Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about the Group's or its directors' and/or management's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Words such as, without limitation, 'believes', 'achieves', 'anticipates', 'estimates', 'expects', 'targets', 'should', 'intends', 'aims', 'projects', 'plans', 'potential', 'will', 'would', 'could', 'considered', 'likely', 'may', 'seek', 'estimate', 'probability', 'goal', 'objective', 'deliver', 'endeavour', 'prospects', 'optimistic' and similar expressions or variations on these expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements concern or may affect future matters, including but not limited to: projections or expectations of the Group\u03e0s future financial position, including profit attributable to shareholders, provisions, economic profit, dividends, capital structure, portfolios, net interest margin, capital ratios, liquidity, risk-weighted assets (RWAs), expenditures or any other financial items or ratios; litigation, regulatory and governmental investigations; the Group\u03e0s future financial performance; the level and extent of future impairments and write-downs; the Group\u03e0s ESG targets and/or commitments; statements of plans, objectives or goals of the Group or its management and other statements that are not historical fact and statements of assumptions underlying such statements. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend upon circumstances that will or may occur in the future. Factors that could cause actual business, strategy, targets, plans and/or results (including but not limited to the payment of dividends) to differ materially from forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: general economic and business conditions in the UK and internationally; acts of hostility or terrorism and responses to those acts, or other such events; geopolitical unpredictability; the war between Russia and Ukraine; the conflicts in the Middle East; the tensions between China and Taiwan; political instability including as a result of any UK general election; market related risks, trends and developments; changes in client and consumer behaviour and demand; exposure to counterparty risk; the ability to access sufficient sources of capital, liquidity and funding when required; changes to the Group\u03e0s credit ratings; fluctuations in interest rates, inflation, exchange rates, stock markets and currencies; volatility in credit markets; volatility in the price of the Group's securities; tightening of monetary policy in jurisdictions in which the Group operates; natural pandemic and other disasters; risks concerning borrower and counterparty credit quality; risks affecting insurance business and defined benefit pension schemes; changes in laws, regulations, practices and accounting standards or taxation; changes to regulatory capital or liquidity requirements and similar contingencies; the policies and actions of governmental or regulatory authorities or courts together with any resulting impact on the future structure of the Group; risks\n\nassociated with the Group's compliance with a wide range of laws and regulations; assessment related to resolution planning requirements; risks related to regulatory actions which may be taken in the event of a bank or Group failure; exposure to legal, regulatory or competition proceedings, investigations or complaints; failure to comply with anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing, anti-bribery and sanctions regulations; failure to prevent or detect any illegal or improper activities; operational risks including risks as a result of the failure of third party suppliers; conduct risk; technological changes and risks to the security of IT and operational infrastructure, systems, data and information resulting from increased threat of cyber and other attacks; technological failure; inadequate or failed internal or external processes or systems; risks relating to ESG matters, such as climate change (and achieving climate change ambitions) and decarbonisation, including the Group's ability along with the government and other stakeholders to measure, manage and mitigate the impacts of climate change effectively, and human rights issues; the impact of competitive conditions; failure to attract, retain and develop high calibre talent; the ability to achieve strategic objectives; the ability to derive cost savings and other benefits including, but without limitation, as a result of any acquisitions, disposals and other strategic transactions; inability to capture accurately the expected value from acquisitions; assumptions and estimates that form the basis of the Group\u03e0s financial statements; and potential changes in dividend policy. A number of these influences and factors are beyond the Group's control. Please refer to the latest Annual Report on Form 20-F filed by Lloyds Banking Group plc with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), which is available on the SEC\u03e0s website at www.sec.gov, for a discussion of certain factors and risks. Lloyds Banking Group plc may also make or disclose written and/or oral forward-looking statements in other written materials and in oral statements made by the directors, officers or employees of Lloyds Banking Group plc to third parties, including financial analysts. Except as required by any applicable law or regulation, the forward-looking statements contained in this document are made as of today's date, and the Group expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this document whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
