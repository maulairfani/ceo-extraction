Moller - Maersk\n\nAnnual Report 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLETTER FROM THE CHAIR AND THE CEO\n\n## Dedicated to fulfilling our customers' supply chain needs\n\nIn 2023, our purpose of 'Improving life for all by integrating the world' was prominently reflected in our role as leaders in the decarbonisation of the maritime industry and our consistent investments into advanced and robust logistic solutions, aimed at equipping our customers for various type of disruption and ensuring the resilience of global supply chains.\n\nTogether with our customers, we navigated a year of profound change in the global logistics industry, marked by a rapidly evolving market environment. We are pleased to report that A.P. Moller - Maersk delivered financial performance in line with our guidance for the year, demonstrating resilience and adaptability throughout these highly transformative times.\n\nMarkets normalised after the years of lock-down and subsequent boom in consumer demand. The market correction began in the fourth quarter of 2022 as supply chain bottlenecks gradually eased. In the first six months of the year, we saw a trend of reducing stock, leading to a decrease in demand. The second half revealed a new industry standard, marked by robust volumes but constrained by pricing pressures due to oversupply in shipping, with no immediate signs of more ships being idled or recycled.\n\n## Measures for a changed reality\n\nDuring the year, we actively responded to the shifting environment. Early cost containment measures were initiated, deployed capacity was adjusted, and efficient management of Ocean unit costs, cost per move in terminals, and SG&A cost level in Logistics & Services helped safeguard our financial performance. Our workforce was realigned with our evolving book of business, reducing our global staff from 110,000 to around 100,000. Moreover, we prudently reduced our capital expenditure plans for 2023 and 2024.",

Moller - Maersk\n\nAnnual Report 2023\n\n## Post-pandemic resilient supply chains\n\nDespite the absence of significant congestions, the vulnerabilities that triggered disruptions during the pandemic years still linger in global supply chains, and new challenges keep emerging. Supply chains have become increasingly complex and fragmented, and customers are dealing with uncertainty from geopolitical tensions and changing consumer behaviour causing fluctuating demand. Consequently, steps are taken to diversify sourcing and nearshore production to enhance resilience and flexibility in logistics.\n\nThroughout the year, we have further deepened our understanding of our customers' diverse supply chain needs to help them develop resilient solutions. We remain committed to manage any complexities our customers may experience by continuously improving and innovating our services and offerings.\n\nAdditionally, Terminals is further enhancing supply chain efficiency by expanding current terminals and establishing new ones. Key projects include the USD 1 billion expansion in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, advancements in automation at Pier400 in Los Angeles, USA and plans for new terminal developments, like the announced strategic partnership in Hai Phong, Vietnam. Terminals consistently demonstrates robust business performance, maintaining a strong focus on cost management, safety and operational excellence.\n\n## Digitising to deliver on customer needs\n\nWe have advanced further on enhancing the operational reliability of our digital infrastructure, enabling very stable execution of business and significantly improved system availability. Furthermore, we have hit some fundamental milestones in our efforts to develop modern platforms across the supply chain. Aiming to unlock truly integrated logistics for our customers, we have moved from basic visibility to multi-carrier, multi-modal visibility.\n\nBeyond this, we have made progress on standardising and rolling out our inland platform and our warehousing solution across regions. Focus is now on unlocking productivity gains through further platform integration and work-flow automation.\n\n## Decarbonising logistics\n\nIn 2023, we marked a noteworthy achievement in our efforts to decarbonise the logistics industry by introducing the world's first green fuel-enabled vessel - Laura M\u00e6rsk. As a pioneering force in decarbonising the industry, we are acutely aware that we heavily rely on the partnership and support from the industry, from regulations and, fundamentally, from our customers.\n\nTo transition away from fossil fuels, collaboration across sectors is crucial. By 2030, A.P. Moller - Maersk alone will need up to 5 million tonnes of green fuels to deliver on our green pledges, while current global production of green methanol is under 100,000 tonnes. The need for green fuels in shipping is immense and the challenge to provide it is too big a task for any one company or investor to manage alone.\n\nOur industry's progress depends on robust regulatory frameworks. At UN's annual COP meeting in November 2023, we stood united with leading players in our industry calling for\n\nlawmakers to introduce measures that - if implemented - will accelerate the decarbonisation of global maritime transport. Together with CEOs from four of the largest container carriers, we proposed in a joint declaration a carbon tax scheme to help close the price gap between fossil and green fuels recognising that not all customers are ready to pay the higher prices currently associated with sustainable transport.\n\n## Reconfirming our transformational journey\n\nWhile we continue to streamline our organisation and operations, we remain dedicated to our strategy of fulfilling our customers' diversified supply chain needs while pursuing growth opportunities across our Terminals and Logistics & Services businesses. We are pleased to note great commercial wins, which reflect the value our customers place on our integrated logistics solutions and close partnerships.\n\nIn our Ocean business, focus is steadfast on maintaining best-in-class margins and building an even more efficient and reliable future Ocean network. In Logistics & Services, we are looking to expand our offering while optimising performance and driving growth. Meanwhile, in Terminals focus is on continued optimisation and ongoing growth initiatives.\n\nThe market dynamics of 2023 underscored the critical importance of diversifying our revenue streams beyond the Ocean business and forging stronger, more collaborative relationships with our customers. These efforts are key to our ongoing success and adaptation in a rapidly evolving market and to our strategy of being the global integrator of logistics.\n\n## Thank you for your support\n\n2023 ended with multiple distressing attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, including two A.P. Moller - Maersk vessels. We are horrified by the escalation of this unfortunate conflict. Ensuring the safety of our people and customers' supply chains is our priority. We are encouraged by the strong international support to restore this essential shipping lane. Our sincere wish is for rapid control of the situation, to allow for the resumption of safe transportation in 2024.\n\nIn closing, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to all A.P. Moller - Maersk colleagues around the world for their relentless efforts and unwavering dedication. We would also like to express our appreciation to the Executive Leadership Team and the Board of Directors. In particular, we welcome Kasper R\u00f8rsted, who joined the Board in 2023.\n\nLast but not least, we are extending a profound thanks to our customers. The support and partnership from our customers are the driving force behind our commitment to delivering excellence in global logistics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVincent Clerc\n\nCEO of A.P.

Moller - Maersk\n\nAnnual Report 2023\n\n## A year of normalisation\n\nIn 2023, the logistics markets experienced a normalisation from the disruptions of the logistics industry in 2020-2022, due to COVID-19, accelerating already existing issues in the global supply chains and with a significant impact on world trade.\n\nIn previous years, the demand for logistics services significantly increased, and, in turn, freight rates saw all-time highs due to capacity shortages, where container availability and air capacity remained tight, and wait times for vessels outside of ports remained lengthy given the bottlenecks in landside transportation and warehousing.\n\nIn this exceptional market, freight rates peaked in Q3 2022, which for A.P. Moller - Maersk was the 16th quarter in a row with year-on-year earnings growth. After that, the high demand eventually started to normalise as congestions eased, and consumer demand declined leading to an inventory overhang, the correction of which resulted in rapid and steep declines in shipped volumes and rates starting in late Q3 2022.\n\nRevenue illustrated in quarters\n\nQ1 2019\n\nQ1 2020\n\nQ1 2021\n\nQ1 2022\n\nQ1 2023\n\nQ2 2023\n\nQ3 2023\n\nQ4 2023\n\n## Revenue\n\nQ1\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nSolid results in line with expectations, while continued destocking in Europe and especially North America together with easing of congestions implied lower volumes across all segments, while a maintained focus on proactively managing costs was key in adjusting to a radically changed business environment.\n\nA strong first half of the year, with A.P. Moller - Maersk responding to ongoing market normalisation prompted by destocking and a subdued growth environment, following the pandemic-fuelled years, leading to lower volumes and lower rates. Decisive actions on cost containment together with the contract portfolio cushioned some of the effects of this market normalisation.\n\nOcean\n\nLogistics & Services\n\nTerminals\n\nDeterioration of rates\n\nregained momentum\n\nnow as a result of\n\nincreased supply in\n\nOcean with rates well\n\noff their 2022 peak\n\nand continued lower\n\nvolumes. The business\n\nwas facing a new normal\n\nwith subdued demand,\n\nprices back in line with\n\nhistorical levels and\n\ninflationary pressure\n\non the cost base. Over-\n\ncapacity across most\n\nregions had since sum-\n\nmer triggered price\n\ndrops and no noticeable\n\nuptick in vessel recycling\n\nor idling. Several cost\n\nand cash containment\n\nmeasures had been\n\naccelerated to safe-\n\nguard the financial\n\nperformance.\n\nVolumes were up but rates continued to erode. Market conditions remained volatile, and the impact of high levels of additional supply increased with subdued idling and ship recycling initiatives across the business. Despite a temporary change in market conditions towards the end of the quarter amid the concerning disruptions in the Red Sea/Gulf of Aden, the underlying   structural supply challenges remained unchanged.\n\n10,000\n\n5,000\n\n0\n\n## 51.1bn\n\n(USD 81.5bn)\n\nUSDbn\n\nEBIT\n\n3.9bn\n\n(USD 30.9bn)\n\nEBIT decreased by USD 26.9bn, negatively impacted by the declining freight rates and with an impact from Ocean of USD 26.9bn.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFree cash flow\n\n4.0bn\n\n(USD 27.1bn)\n\nThe decrease in free cash flow was negatively impacted by lower cash flow from operating activities, partly offset by lower CAPEX and higher financial income and sales proceeds.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor specifics on the financial performance See page 32 Guidance for 2024 with the roadmap to 2025 and the ESG targets all the way to 2040 See pages 34-35\n\nUSDbn\n\nUSDbn",

Moller - Maersk continued maturing the roadmaps and processes identified in previous years to fully integrate ESG into the company's business, delivering many examples of its environmental and social commitments. This included a milestone for A.P. Moller - Maersk and the entire industry - the arrival of the world's first vessel capable of running on green methanol.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Validated\n\nscience-based targets\n\n## 1.5\u00b0C aligned\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk is the shipping industry's first to secure validation from the Science Based Targets Initiative for 1.5\u00b0C- aligned 2030 targets and Net Zero 2040 targets, to be reported on from 2024 replacing previous targets.\n\n## Investing in green solutions\n\nLaura M\u00e6rsk, the world's first green methanol capable container vessel, completed her first voyage from South Korea to Copenhagen, Denmark, entirely on green methanol. 24 more methanol-capable vessels are on order, as well as a pilot for the world's first methanol vessel retrofit.\n\nIn 2023, A.P. Moller - Maersk further continued investing in end-to-end logistics decarbonisation solutions, including electric trucks in Germany, Norway, Sweden, the UK and China. Low emissions dry storage warehouses were opened in the UK, Malaysia and Colombia, as well as a state-of-the-art cold storage space in New Zealand.\n\nIn Terminals, the equipment electrification continued, and 10 terminals are now running on 100% renewable energy.\n\n## Engagement\n\nPercentile\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe challenging business climate of 2023, combined with uncertainty from A.P. Moller - Maersk's large structural reorganisation in the beginning of the year and a workforce reduction had a dampening effect on employee engagement, which fell from the 67th percentile in 2022 to 60th percentile in 2023, measured in the biannual engagement survey relative to the global benchmark.\n\n## Safety\n\nLost-time injury frequency (LTIf)\n\n1.11\n\n(0.93 LTIF)\n\nIn 2023, the lost-time injury frequency rate increased from 0.93 to 1.11, partly driven by a focus on improving the reporting culture, which has led to more reported cases.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Diversity\n\n% in headcount\n\n27% (26%)\n\nThe share of women in leadership roles, including leaders, senior leaders and executives, increased to 27% (26%), requiring continued attention.",

In the same period, the contract logistics business continued to remain resilient. The inventories that retailers were trying to reduce had to be stored and processed, making the weakness of one segment the strength of the other. The tide turned in the second half of the year, bringing demand growth back on Ocean, while contract logistics entered a period of realignment.\n\n## A more resilient global economy than expected in 2023\n\nThe global economy has demonstrated resilience in the face of rapid increases in interest rates. Consequently, the growth rate for 2023 stands at 2.7% according to Oxford Economics, surpassing the initially projected 2% at the year's outset. Strength was concentrated in the service sector that completed its recovery from the pandemic shock. Conversely, global manufacturing remained in contraction. Throughout 2023, the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) consistently registered values below 50 - the threshold indicating contraction - and concluded the year at 49.\n\nThe stalwart of this unexpected resilience has been the US consumer, bolstered by accumulated savings and a robust labour market. Consumer goods spending experienced a notable uptick of 2.1% in 2023. Despite a robust demand for goods, inflation followed a downward trajectory, decreasing from an initial 6.4% at the start of the year to 3.4% by December. The impact of high interest rates on economic activity has proven more lagged than market expectations.\n\nUnlike in the US, the European economy has evolved broadly as expected, and it is in fact following the central bank playbook: the impact of increased interest rates has slowed economic activity, evidenced by a negative sequential growth in Q3 and flat growth in Q4. Overall, economic activity has remained stagnant throughout the year.\n\nRetail sales in the Euro area experienced a decline of 1.7% in 2023. However, it is important to highlight that this decline is partly driven by the fuel and food sectors. Excluding these groups, retail sales only saw a 0.5% decrease. With inflation gradually receding to 2.9% in December and nominal wage growth picking up, growth in real compensation of employees turned positive in the second half of the year. The drag on consumption from declining real earnings started to ease.\n\nWorking in the opposite direction is slower employment growth, which is unlikely to bring the unemployment rate down from the 6.4% in December.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chinese economy grappled with persistent structural imbalances, characterised by high household savings, low consumption, unproductive investment and ongoing deleveraging in the housing market. After the initial disappointments stemming from the end of the zero-COVID-19 policy, the short-term outlook failed to improve in the second half of the year.\n\n## The inventory correction continued its course\n\nThe inventory correction has been a significant issue affecting trade in 2023. The combination of weak imports and strong consumer demand brought US inventories into a better balance. Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics show that, in November, retailers' (excl. auto) inventories-to-sales ratio was 1.14, comparable to pre-pandemic levels in the US. However, despite progress, there are still pockets of inventory risk within specific retail segments, particularly in categories such as food and beverages, building materials, garden equipment and furniture. In contrast, the inventores-to-sales-ratio for cars and parts is very low. Wholesalers' inventories-to-sales ratio also continued to trend down. Unlike in the US, the inventory picture remains mixed in Europe. At the aggregate level, inventories have continued to accumulate at a relatively fast pace in Europe during 2023, also because of the slowdown in consumer goods spending growth. Underneath the Europe headline, there are large cross-country differences. The inventory situation looks more challenging in countries like Germany and France and a bit less so in Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. In the UK, there has been outright destocking for several quarters, such that the inventory-to-demand  ratio has declined slightly despite weak final demand growth, and it is currently fairly close to historical averages.\n\n## Demand for logistics services pivoted from contract logistics to container trade\n\nIn the first half of 2023, global container trade demand growth was in negative territory by 6.4% y/y. In the same quarters, contract logistics demand continued to remain resilient with 3% growth y/y. The inventories that retailers were trying to bring down had to be stored and processed, making the weakness of one segment the strength of the other.\n\nAs the year progressed, the tide turned on Ocean. Demand growth was 2% in Q3 and 6% to 8% in Q4, driven by technology and automotive. On the other hand, as inventories were brought in line with expected sales, demand for contract logistics started to contract in Q3.\n\nRegionally, the full-year container trade import growth in 2023 was notably negative in North America by -10% and in Oceania by -5%, remained flat in Far-East Asia, and was strong in Africa by 12% and in West Central Asia by 7%. Imports into Europe and Latin America were robust, each recording a year-over-year growth of 5%, see figure 1.\n\nDemand for air freight forwarding has been exceptionally weak in 2023. Demand declined, bringing volumes below pre-pandemic levels. The combination of slow demand and low rates on Ocean points to a possible modal shift. Weakness is broad-based with all verticals showing negative growth, except reefer.",

In the US, it declined by 6% y/y, following the exceptional growth of 2021 and the first half of 2022. Despite negative growth, demand held up in the second half of the year for Less-ThanLoad (LTL) services compared to full truckload freight (FTL), as shippers traded down to smaller consignment formats. Demand for road freight has been negative in Europe as well, but the contraction has been more modest. This is consistent with growth during the pandemic recovery, which has been positive but more modest. Among the large Europe markets, Germany has been the weakest due to the importance of manufacturing, while in the UK a reset is in place following Brexit and pandemic shock.\n\n## Supply has been a problem for container trade and US road freight\n\nThe improvement in container trade demand throughout the year failed to support rates due to the increase in capacity available in the market. Nominal capacity expanded by 8% in 2023. The supply-demand balance deteriorated in the first half of the year, and marginally improved in the second half thanks to stronger demand. The accumulation of overcapacity brought utilisation down throughout the year.\n\nThis is in stark contrast with contract logistics. Vacancy rates for warehouses remained on the low end of historical data due to the slow intake of newbuilds. In Europe, the vacancy rate ended in Q3 2023 at 5.2% according to Savills, while the Q4 2023 rate was 5.2% in the US (Cushman & Wakefield).",

Record high rates saw large numbers of small, independent carriers enter the market, significantly increasing total supply. Throughout much of 2023, despite falling rates, carriers proved resilient and remained in the market despite higher costs. There were a couple of exits, particularly in the LTL and brokerage segments, but for much of 2023 carriers were able to weather higher costs and lower rates better than expected.\n\n## Geopolitics is reshaping trade flows\n\nThe concerted efforts in both Europe and the US to reduce dependency on imports from China have altered trade dynamics in container trade and air freight. Historically, North America relied on China for approximately half of its total container imports until 2019. However, by 2023, the share of China in total North America decreased to 42%. Concurrently, there has been a notable surge in imports from Southeast Asia, compensating for most, though not entirely, of the decline in imports from China. Additionally, there is a growing trend in North American imports originating from the Indian sub-continent.\n\nCHN Global Export Share (rhs)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDespite this trade diversion, China's share of global exports has remained steadfast at around onethird, showing minimal change over the past decade, see figure 2. What stands out is China's success in expanding its exports into regions like Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, despite a challenging macroeconomic and market outlook in these areas.\n\nChange is visible also on air freight forwarding, where exports from China has softened to the US and strengthened to Mexico, and more so differently than from other countries. Mexican import volumes from China are small compared to the US, but their share increased recently. Notably, tech products have been the driver of the decline in US imports from China and the rise of Mexican imports.\n\n## The risks map thickened\n\nTowards the end of 2023, the resilience of the economy faded away. Slower economic growth is likely to characterise 2024. The consensus forecast for global GDP growth is in the range of 2%. Despite a weak economy, air freight forwarding demand is expected to grow positively again in 2024, between 2% and 5% y/y. Container trade as well, between 2.5% and 4.5%. Contract logistics in the US is expected to be flat. In Europe, road freight and contract logistics are expected to grow modestly around 1%, while the US road freight demand will continue to adjust, with growth expected to remain negative.\n\nConsiderable uncertainty looms over the macroeconomic and market outlook, owing to several key risks:\n\n- \u00b7 Geopolitical tensions persist as the most visible risks, with the situation around the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea being a very current example. To date, a resolution to conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine remains elusive. Geopolitical tensions can impact energy prices and disrupt supply chains, subsequently affecting global growth and business costs, in addition to the significant human toll.\n- \u00b7 As climate patterns shift, the frequency of extreme events is increasing. Prolonged disruptions caused by low rainfall in Panama are expected to persist into the first half of 2024, affecting schedule reliability for container trade and logistics.\n- \u00b7 Inflation might prove challenging to curb further, potentially prompting central banks to delay interest rate cuts. Prolonged high interest rates could trigger a financial event in the coming months.\n- \u00b7 The convergence of slowing economic growth and elevated interest rates raises concerns about the sustainability of debt, posing risks for both corporate entities and sovereigns. A potential debt crisis could escalate a soft economic landing into a severe downturn, impacting global markets across the board.\n- \u00b7 Conversely, Europe might surprise with positive momentum stemming from an improving consumer outlook. Restored purchasing power, fuelled by decreasing inflation and consistent wage growth, could enhance sentiment and positively impact demand for logistics.",

Moller - Maersk's transformation from diversified conglomerate to be the integrator of container logistics made progress, with the objective to connect and simplify customer's supply chains while providing increased transparency, tighter control and drive higher efficiencies.\n\nThe vision includes the combination of a broad product and service offering of Logistics & Services with a highly dependable and more differentiated Ocean transportation offering. Significant financial and operational synergies are realised between Terminals and Ocean, including leveraging the company's own Ocean volumes to optimise and de-risk terminal operations.\n\nDespite the highly dynamic market situation observed in 2023, rich in disruptions on the back of the COVID-19-fuelled boom and the supply chain disruptions, A.P. Moller - Maersk's strategy remains 'in season'. Although the business in Logistics & Services did not grow in 2023,\n\n## The road from a conglomerate to the global integrator\n\n## Demerger of entities\n\nMaersk Tankers, Maersk Oil and Maersk Drilling to focus the company towards container logistics\n\n## Reorganisation\n\nThe reorganisation of Ocean and Logistics & Services completed and the integration of the Safmarine brand, Damco air freight and LCL to improve customer experience and end-to-end service delivery\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2024\n\n## The vision\n\nA.P.

This is a strong testament that despite, and partly also because of the changing reality and radically different environment, the company's customers' buy-in to the integrator strategy, across verticals, size and geographies is unwavering. A.P. Moller - Maersk's strategy continues to generate tremendous interest among customers and across the industry, including competitors. They see tangible value and the value proposition is as relevant as ever for them, addressing their main pain points.\n\n## Performing while transforming\n\nThe strategy is underpinned by innovative technology, the Group's industry leading commitment to ESG, not least the Group's commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2040 across A.P. Moller - Maersk's businesses, and the Group's highly capable people.\n\nThe ability to put the customer first, help them navigate disruptions and absorb the inherent complexity of global logistics is a true differentiator which A.P. Moller - Maersk aspires will spearhead the Group's strategy and efforts in making A.P. Moller - Maersk a global integrator.\n\nThe key business segments continue to perform while transforming amidst some unprecedented market circumstances experienced in 2023 on the back of the COVID-19 period. As much as the company continues to optimise each business segment's operational and financial performance, the customers value the unmatched full A.P. Moller - Maersk network with its scale, connectivity and accessibility.\n\n## Project logistics solutions and contract logistics\n\nAcquisitions of Martin Bencher to complement A.P.

Moller - Maersk, following the years of strong business growth, 2023 marked a year of transition in Logistics & Services on the back of COVID-19.\n\nOver the course of 2023, consumers reverted back to normal spending patterns, increasing spending on experience economy and reducing on goods. Volumes going through the supply chain slowed down drastically as excess inventory had to be worked down and as a consequence, prices rapidly adjusted back to pre-pandemic levels, and in some cases below. This is expected to continue for most of 2024, where the market will gradually start recovering as inventory levels normalise and volumes start to pick up again.\n\nSimilarly to the market, 2023 was a year of adjustment also for the Group, where focus has shifted to operational excellence in order to deliver to the customers, which remain at the centre of the activities, with the product depth, breadth and service quality required.\n\nReliability, cost and speed remain the hygiene factors customers expect, while resilience is also a critical customer requirement. In the face of economic headwinds, geopolitical instability and accelerating paradigm shifts in the logistics industry, these requirements will become ever more important, and A.P. Moller - Maersk is continuing its focus on providing better solutions to meet those needs.\n\nAcquisitions have played a critical role in filling gaps in the company's ability to provide end-to-end solutions, securing critical knowledge, assets and geographic coverage. While the past years have been dominated by acquisitions, the focus in 2023 has been on integrating those acquisitions with the goal to deliver on the financial and operational synergies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn Ocean, normalisation on the back of COVID-19 was felt in the industry and in A.P. Moller - Maersk already in the second half of 2022, which continued throughout 2023 until the emergence of another supply chain crisis centred around the Red Sea.\n\nCustomers' business needs are evolving, and the need for supply chain resilience and stability has never been greater. The Red Sea crisis is another proof point, following the supply chain disruptions experienced during COVID-19.\n\nIn 2023, as the Ocean industry entered into a new chapter characterised by a deteriorating supply-demand balance, managing operations and improving EBIT margins became a sharp focus for the company. This required frequent and active adjustments of deployed capacity, while ensuring adequate and flexible access for customers to high-quality and reliable Ocean products.\n\nThat is why the company is designing a best-in-class ocean network that will offer an industry-leading combination of reliability, speed to market and geographical reach, all while continuing to support decarbonisation and the company's goal of being net-zero in the future.\n\nTo deliver this network, A.P. Moller - Maersk has entered a longterm operational collaboration with Hapag-Lloyd, the 'Gemini Cooperation', to be implemented from February 2025, immediately after the conclusion of the current 2M Alliance.\n\nThe new network design in combination with the launch of Gemini Coorporation represents an innovation that allow A.P. Moller - Maersk to continuously evolve to meet customer needs, while maintaining a disciplined approach to CAPEX and keeping the company's fleet around 4.3 million TEU.\n\nTerminals is an integral part of the end-to-end container shipping supply chain and remain critical for A.P. Moller - Maersk's inte grator strategy, enabling network stability while lowering costs to serve its customers and deliver stable and resilient earnings.\n\n2023 was another year of profitable earnings in Terminals, despite the onset of normalisation in ocean shipping enabled by cost management actions, strong focus on operational excellence and cooperation with local authorities to adjust tariffs in line with inflation.\n\nTerminals continues to be a global leader among terminal operators, aiming to delivering operational quality and efficiency, pursuing an ambitious ESG agenda and driving local economic engagement, growth and development. Through these differentiated and continuously evolving capabilities, Terminals is creating value for host governments and customers across the value chain.\n\nTerminals plays a key role to the integrator strategy, through the hub terminals which have been preparing for the launch of the new Ocean network in February 2025. Substantial investments in physical and digital infrastructure at the hubs, in addition to close operational collaboration with Ocean, are essential to unlocking target standard for Ocean reliability.",

Moller - Maersk's ambitious commitments on ESG are core to the purpose of the group, an integral part of its business strategy and a prerequisite for success as the global integrator.\n\nIn 2023, A.P. Moller - Maersk became the first in the shipping industry to have its 2030 and 2040 targets validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in alignment with a 1.5\u00b0C and net zero pathway, and the company made progress on its roadmap to decarbonise logistics across all business areas.\n\nA hallmark moment was the arrival of Laura M\u00e6rsk in 2023, the world's first container vessel capable of sailing on green methanol. In 2024, A.P. Moller - Maersk will see the arrival of more new methanolcapable vessels out of the 24 vessels currently on order. Securing access to green energy solutions at scale remains a key strategic priority.\n\nIn 2023, A.P. Moller - Maersk signed the first large-scale green methanol offtake agreement with Chinese developer Goldwind.\n\n2023 saw continued demand growth for the company's low emissions ECO Delivery Ocean product. Around 3% of Ocean volumes are now transported with ECO Delivery versus 2% in 2022.\n\nReflecting the Group's dedication and progress on decarbonisation and the broader ESG agenda, A.P. Moller - Maersk was for the first time awarded the highest scores in its top two prioritised ESG ratings in 2023, receiving a Platinum rating from EcoVadis and an A score in CDP Climate Change. These two ratings are significant because they are valued by the company's customers and the financial sector. The EcoVadis Platinum rating is reserved for top 1% of companies within the industry based on their ESG score, and in 2023, only 346 companies out of over 21,000 across all sectors made the CDP A list.

Moller - Maersk embarked on a process and tech trans formation journey in 2020 to enable growth through scalable platforms, deliver better quality and customer outcomes, and unlock user productivity.\n\nThe technology landscape in the broader logistics industry remains heavily fragmented, plagued by a lack of standards and data compatibility. This drives costs, operational friction, poor reliability, and limited visibility and control for A.P. Moller - Maersk's customers.\n\nAs part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's strategy, the company is on a journey to transform its process and technology landscape by:\n\n- \u00b7 Stabilising and modernising core applications and infrastructure\n- \u00b7 Accelerating the move to standardised processes and automated workflows by leveraging digital platforms\n- \u00b7 Integrating modern platforms to automate end-to-end workflows and enable seamless data flow.\n\nConsiderable progress has been made over the past year, including:\n\n- \u00b7 System availability and decreasing lost business hours\n- \u00b7 Simplifying the technology stack by decommissioning about half of the legacy applications that have been earmarked as redundant\n- \u00b7 Progressing the roll-out of modern platforms, including A.P. Moller - Maersk's landside platform (TMS), Warehouse Management System (WMS), and new Supply Chain Platform\n- \u00b7 Kick-starting the automation of processes through integrations, with Ocean Delivery now being one of the most integrated processes.\n\nThe company continues its efforts to digitise customer and operator workflows, including providing comprehensive visibility across supply chains along with greater control.\n\nAI represents a significant opportunity to unlock productivity, enhance employee experience, increase profitability and accelerate the transformation of A.P. Moller - Maersk. To capitalise on this opportunity and turn it into a competitive advantage, A.P. Moller - Maersk continues to invest both in established AI initiatives such as Digital Twin simulations and demand forecasts as well as early-stage pilots with generative AI based tools to automate otherwise manual, repetitive tasks and boost employee productivity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeople working at A.P. Moller - Maersk are essential  drivers in delivering customer value by addressing customer needs, developing deep content expertise and spearheading the transformation journey into an integrated logistics company.\n\nDelivering on the strategy requires building and rebalancing of skills and capabilities across the organisation, especially within logistics and technology, and of the company's DNA, while embedding a culture of customer centricity among thousands of colleagues, current and new.\n\nMaintaining strong capabilities in the focus areas, attracting and retaining talent as well as talent development are top priorities for A.P. Moller - Maersk. In 2023, the company continued investing in the People Strategy, making progress on initiatives for performance management, leadership capabilities, career building and upskilling its teams while ensuring the talent pipeline needed to bring the business strategy to life. Progress continued despite 2023's sharp market downturn, which necessitated a reduction of the workforce in 2023. In line with its values, A.P. Moller - Maersk worked to reduce the impact to its people as much as possible through natural attrition, local savings and organisational adjustments.\n\nTo secure and retain the needed talent, A.P. Moller - Maersk strives to remain an employer of choice, offering employees exciting development opportunities and a company environment that values diversity of thought. The company continued to build on the performance management approach and culture launched in 2022, moving away from traditional ratings to continuous performance conversations, with the goal of improving performance, alignment, and career growth.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk's strong commitment to create an engaging environment for all colleagues remains at the centre of the efforts, also covering Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) principles as the company aspire to create a safe and inclusive workplace for all where colleagues can develop and have thriving careers.

A.P. Moller - Maersk took delivery of the world's first container vessel capable of running on green methanol. This is only the beginning of the journey, however, and transitioning the industry is not something one company can do alone - it is dependent on the right regulatory framework, among others, and the willingness of customers to support decarbonisation.\n\nSustainable and responsible supply chains are a baseline requirement from customers, investors, employees, regulators and broader society today. In 2023, A.P. Moller - Maersk worked actively and strategically with all aspects of sustainability risks and impacts, as part of its comprehensive ESG strategy. A.P. Moller - Maersk's focus since the launch of this strategy in early 2022 has been on defining the roadmaps and ensuring strong governance to drive meaningful progress on the ESG commitments and to aim for fully integrating those activities across the business and into decision-making.\n\nThe ESG strategy is linked to the company's Purpose and Core Values. It is also an integral part of, and prerequisite for, the success of A.P. Moller - Maersk's global integrator strategy, including ambitious and science-based targets to reach net zero emissions by 2040. This is essential to supporting many of A.P. Moller - Maersk's customers' own ambitious decarbonisation targets. In 2023, the company achieved validation of an updated set of climate targets aligned with the Science Based Targets initiative's 1.5-degree pathway and net-zero standard. These will lead to a review and alignment of some of A.P. Moller - Maersk's current targets on decarbonisation. In other ESG areas, targets set for 2023 including for safety and security, business ethics and data ethics, will carry over into 2024 as annual training targets.\n\nLooking ahead, external expectations, regulation and reporting requirements continue evolving, and new ESG regulatory landscapes are taking shape regionally and globally - these will spark increased transparency and enhanced reporting practices which will unfold over the coming years. From 2024 and onwards, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) will require A.P. Moller - Maersk to fully integrate reporting according to European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) directly in the Annual Report. In 2023, in preparation for these requirements, A.P. Moller - Maersk conducted a double materiality assessment which will guide the 2024 integration of the company's annual and sustainability reports.\n\n## A.P.

Moller - Maersk's double materiality assessment, the company has assessed material impacts and risks across its operations and value chain as shown below. These are not exhaustive but highlight the variety of the material impacts and risks from the activities that the company manags as an integrator of global supply chains. For information on how these are managed to minimise harm and mitigate risk, see the relevant ESG category chapters.\n\nFor more information on the double materiality assessment see the 2023 Sustainability Report.\n\nWarehousing\n\nAs an end-to-end logistics provider, we store and manage data on customers, suppliers and workers.\n\nWe work with more than 41,000 suppliers, including 5,100+ high-risk suppliers in our global supply chain.\n\nImport\n\nterminal\n\nDistribution\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur assets are exposed to climate-related hazards.

Moller - Maersk has defined 14 ESG categories covering all material impacts and risks. Each category is owned by an executive sponsor and anchored in relevant functions that drive implementation and performance. The company reports on the strategy, governance and performance across all the 14 categories in the Annual Sustainability Report, supplemented by further details, TCFD and SASB indexes in an online ESG Factbook. From 2023, executive remuneration (LongTerm Incentive) has been linked to selected ESG KPI targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environment\n\nGlobal logistics is responsible for 11% of all greenhouse gas emissions. As a key industry player, A.P. Moller - Maersk is obligated to be part of the solution and play a leading role in the decarbonisation of logistics, with a commitment to support a green and just transition, based on respect for human rights, social dialogue and stakeholder engagement.\n\nThe results of the double materiality assessment confirm that climate change is a highly material topic to A.P. Moller - Maersk, both from an impact and financial risk perspective, see page 21. Wider environmental risks, addressed in the Environment & Ecosystems section of the 2023 Sustainability Report, are an area of growing focus from regulation and key stakeholders, in particular impacts on nature and biodiversity.\n\n## Climate change: delivering concrete progress towards net zero by 2040\n\nIn 2023, A.P. Moller - Maersk took delivery of Laura M\u00e6rsk, the world's first container vessel with an engine capable of running on green methanol. This important step sent a clear demand signal to the industry, and today there are some 180 methanol-capable vessels on order across the industry. Ocean activities are A.P. Moller - Maersk's primary source of GHG emissions, but not the only source, and 2023 also saw progress in decarbonising Terminals and Logistics & Services businesses, as detailed in this report's specific sections.\n\nIn early 2022, A.P. Moller - Maersk introduced an accelerated net zero 2040 target, including key milestones needed by 2030 from a 2020 baseline, and committed to aligning targets with the SBTi 1.5-degree pathway to 2030 and the 2040 net-zero standard. Following the publication of the long-awaited SBTi sectoral framework for maritime shipping in late 2022, A.P. Moller - Maersk has during 2023 worked to prepare and submit 2030 and 2040 targets. With a successful validation of the targets by the SBTi, A.P. Moller - Maersk is the first in the industry to have its 2030 and 2040 targets validated by the Science Based Targets initiative, in alignment with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway and the Net Zero standard.\n\nOne of the key drivers behind A.P. Moller - Maersk's approach to decarbonising supply chains is providing customers with green solutions to help them reach their own targets.\n\nToday almost 60% of the company's top 200 customers have committed to, or set science-based targets to decarbonise their supply chains. Many of these are on equally ambitious timelines as A.P. Moller - Maersk to reach their targets by 2040 or even sooner.\n\nIn 2023, A.P. Moller - Maersk had a total GHG footprint of 79.5 million tonnes, a decrease of 4.1% compared to 2022. The decrease was mainly driven by reduced purchases of capital goods (scope 3) and reduced fuel consumption (scope 1 and 3). Moreover, to align with the SBTi-validated targets, the 2022 baseline has been recalculated, which led to a 6% increase of previously stated emissions.\n\nIn 2023, A.P. Moller - Maersk continued increasing the energy efficiency of its fleet through a focus on more energy-efficient operations and the ongoing roll-out of efficiency technologies on owned and time-chartered vessels such as new and improved propellers, bulbous bows, and shore power enablement. Combined with the continued use of second-generation biodiesel in the fleet, the company was able to lower relative emissions intensity, measured by the Energy Efficiency Operating Indicator (EEOI), from 13.0 in 2022 to a record low of 11.68. In 2023, A.P. Moller - Maersk implemented better governance  and forecasting processes for EEOI and leading indicators to be able to better track and act on progress during 2024.\n\nCommitments to science-based targets validated by the Science Based Targets initiative 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Scope 1   Own operation           | 35%   | Absolute reduction in   total scope 1 emissions   | 96%   | Absolute reduction in total  Scope 1  and scope 2 emissions   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Scope 2   Purchased   electricity | 100%  | Renewable electricity   sourcing                  |       |                                                               |\n| Scope 3   Value chain             | 22%   | Absolute reduction in   total scope 3 emissions   | 90%   | Absolute reduction in total   scope 3 emissions               |\n\nAligned with 1.5-degree pathway by 2030\n\nNet zero by 2040\n\n## Regulatory impact changing the playing field\n\nA strong supportive regulatory framework will be critical to deliver the green transition of the shipping and logistics industries. 2023 saw promising developments: Regionally, the US Inflation Reduction Act and the European Union's Green Deal are driving significant investments and action\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Globally, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) agreed on a framework at the 80th session of the IMO's Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC 80) for member states that sets enhanced ambition levels for reducing GHG emissions over the mid and long-term, and for the uptake of zero or near-zero GHG emission technologies, fuels and/or energy sources.\n\nFor A.P. Moller - Maersk, the most important elements in the revised strategy are the IMO's mandate to develop two pivotal and complementary measures by 2025 - a global fuel standard and a maritime GHG emissions pricing mechanism. While the GHG price will address energy efficiency, a global fuel standard of 5-10% green fuels by 2030 will ramp up the use of green fuels in shipping. A variety of GHG pricing mechanisms are currently on the table. A.P. Moller - Maersk, along with other World Shipping Council members, have put forward a proposal for a Green Balance Mechanism that places a relatively modest fee on fossil fuel emissions, which would be used to subsidise the use of green fuels without leading to global inflation.\n\n## Ensuring the right fuels for a sustainable green transition\n\nAlthough there is promising momentum, securing sustainable, green fuels at scale remains a significant challenge for the years ahead. It requires a massive ramp-up of renewable energy to produce low emissions fuels which follow A.P. Moller - Maersk's life cycle assessment approach. This in turn requires supportive policy, for example new permitting processes and safety standards for methanol bunkering in more ports.\n\nTo help catalyse this ramp-up, A.P. M\u00f8ller Holding, together with A.P. Moller - Maersk as a minority owner, created a seed investment in C2X - an independent company aiming to build, own and operate assets to produce green methanol at scale. C2X plans to bring 3 million tonnes of green fuels to market annually starting in 2030, and large projects are underway in Egypt and Spain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Social\n\nUnder the social dimension, the results of the 2023 double materiality assessment confirm that the social topics included in A.P. Moller - Maersk's ESG strategy are also those that come out as most material, including the health and safety of all people within A.P. Moller - Maersk's duty of care, and - from a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion point of view - the risk of violence and harassment. Wider aspects of DE&I, as well as human capital (talent development) and labour practices and human rights, are equally assessed as material topics.\n\n## The right safety culture for safe workplaces\n\nIn the area of safety and security, A.P. Moller - Maersk's commitment is to ensure that everyone gets home safe by preventing fatal and life-altering incidents. In 2023, the company failed to live up to that commitment and, with deepest regret, four people lost their lives while on active duty for A.P. Moller - Maersk, including two employees and two contractors. A.P. Moller - Maersk's duty of care extends to its entire value chain, and the company is actively working on better understanding the risks associated with partners and how to best ensure they understand and comply with company safety standards.\n\nThis also extends to the company's Logistics & Services business, where rapid growth of 460+ warehouses since 2018 has increased the risk profile in new locations with diverse practices and safety cultures. A.P. Moller - Maersk is proactively addressing this challenge with a comprehensive Safety & Security Transformation Programme across its global transportation and fulfilment portfolios. See the 2023 Sustainability Report for more details.\n\nA critical focus in A.P. Moller - Maersk's core safety approach is building a culture of trust, enabling all to contribute to safety reporting, raising concerns, and challenging how things are done to find safer ways of working. The goal is to create a physically and psychologically safe workplace with a strong reporting culture where all colleagues feel safe to speak up. In support, a training and upskilling programme was launched in 2023 to sharpen company risk and incident reporting processes and systems across the regions.\n\n## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\nIn 2023, A.P. Moller - Maersk updated its Diversity, Equity & Inclusion strategy to put DE&I at the core of its People strategy and drive real, long-term results with enhanced metrics and leader accountability. A fundamental part of this commitment is the protection of underrepresented and vulnerable groups at greater risk of harassment and discrimination. Moreover, diversity of thought is part of improving and developing the business providing access to a larger, more diverse talent pool.\n\nIn 2023, A.P. Moller - Maersk strengthened its DE&I performance management and datadriven decision-making with the launch of a new DE&I dashboard to support leaders. The DE&I strategy also changed from emphasising diversity targets to a greater focus on inclusion as a driver of behaviour change. This includes developing leadership inclusion capabilities to create advocates and drive accountability. 2023's roll-out focused on A.P. Moller - Maersk's top 160+ leaders. In 2024, inclusion training will be required for all people leaders.\n\n2023 saw progress on many fronts, including improvement in both representation for gender diversity (women in management and leadership) and diverse nationality even as market conditions significantly toughened. A.P. Moller - Maersk expects 2024 will continue to present market challenges that could impact the company's growth journey and hence the opportunity to attract new and diverse talent. Current metrics indicate that progress towards 2025 targets is impacted. This was in part due to 2023's sharp market slowdown, which necessitated a freeze on external hires and advancement across many parts of the organisation.",

M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S, the parent company of A.P. Moller - Maersk, and other management levels, as required by Section 99b of the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\nIn accordance with the guidelines from the Danish Business Authority, equal representation has been achieved in the Board of Directors of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S.\n\nDuring 2023, A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S has employed fewer than 50 employees in 'Other management', and hence in accordance with the guidelines from the Danish Business Authority, no policy for increasing the gender diversity in other management levels has been implemented.\n\n| Management level        | Number of members                  | Share of females   |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Board of Directors      | 9 (of which 6 males and 3 females) | 33%                |\n| Other management levels | 2 (of which 2 males)               | 0%                 |\n\nFor more information on A.P. Moller - Maersk's commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion, see the 2023 Sustain ability Report and the company's DE&I policy.\n\nFor information about gender distribution in other companies within the Group required to report upon the underrepresented gender, cf. section 99b of the Danish Financial Statements Act, refer to the Management Review of the subsidiary in question.\n\n## Human capital\n\nPeople are the foundation of A.P. Moller - Maersk's success. Whether they work on a vessel, in a terminal or warehouse or sit in an office, the company's ability to attract, retain and develop talented colleagues at all levels is critical to delivering on the company's Purpose and Global Integrator vision. In 2023, the company continued to make progress on initiatives for performance management, leadership capabilities, high performance teams, career building and upskilling while ensuring the talent pipeline needed to bring its business strategy to life.\n\nActivities in these areas continued despite the market downturn, which necessitated a reduction of the workforce at the end of 2023. In line with its core values, the company worked to reduce the impact to employees as much as possible through natural attrition, local savings and organisational adjustments, and ensured that all people changes were done in a responsible manner and in full compliance with local laws and all applicable labour agreements.\n\nThe challenging business climate of 2023, combined with uncertainty from A.P. Moller - Maersk's large structural reorganisation, had a dampening effect on the key human capital performance\n\nindicator, the biannual global Employee Engagement Survey (EES). 90,568 colleagues shared their views in the second half-year EES, a participation rate of 85% - significantly above the global benchmark average. The EES results indicate a reversal of the positive trend seen in previous years, with the grand mean declining to the 60th percentile. The company is taking several follow-up actions to return to a positive trend, including listening sessions, refining processes and policies as necessary, and continuous investment in leadership capabilities and team management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk's commitment to responsible business practices is strongly linked to its Purpose and how the company promotes sustainable, responsible trade and a more equal society. 2023 was a year of heightened risks with ongoing geopolitical tensions and inflationary economies.\n\nGeopolitical instability has made trade more complex, as sanctions and export controls restrict or ban the movement of goods and services or business with certain countries, individuals or companies. As a Danish-headquartered company and global leader in ocean transport and logistics services, A.P. Moller - Maersk complies with all applicable sanctions and export controls laws.\n\nIn the 2023 double materiality assessment, topics part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's ESG strategy were confirmed to be the most material topics under governance, including business ethics, data ethics and supplier relations. Positive impacts were identified within the topics of responsible tax and citizenship. Political engagement/lobbying, a topic cuts across categories of the ESG strategy, was also identified as a material issue comprising of both potential positive and negative impacts.\n\n## Business ethics\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk is committed to operating responsibly and have in place a robust compliance framework. By 2025, the aim is to have a best-in-class compliance programme that helps the company promote sustainable trade and a more equal society by preventing, detecting and correcting behaviour that is not aligned with A.P. Moller - Maersk's core values and Commit Rules on business ethics. See the 2023 Sustainability Report for details.\n\nIn 2023, a third Global Risk Assessment of all active entities was rolled out to monitor compliance risks, as well as a company-wide functional risk assessment. A new A.P. Moller - Maersk Code of Conduct introduction course was also rolled out along with an updated annual e-learning refresher course, with 92% of the employees completing the mandatory training against a target of 100%. Challenges in reaching all employee groups remain, particularly in years with large organisational changes, but the company is working to close this gap with a goal of 100% completion in 2024.",

Moller - Maersk and its customers who entrust the company with their data.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk's global integrator strategy revolves around the ability to offer customers digitally enabled products and services. A.P. Moller - Maersk is therefore committed to demonstrating leadership in technical innovation with the highest data ethics standards.\n\nBy end of 2023, over 91% of A.P. Moller - Maersk employees have completed the mandatory data ethics e-learning against a target of 100%. While challenges in reaching all employee groups are likely to persist, the company keeps the rigour of a 100% target for 2024, with a particular focus on ensuring all new employees are trained.\n\nThe rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications is a significant change and requires A.P. Moller - Maersk to balance opportunities and risks as the company creates a new generation of AI-powered solutions. Implementation of AI data management procedures continues to be based on the four cornerstones of the company's data ethics policy; transparency, respect, security and innovation, to ensure the early identification and mitigation of risks in the technology pipeline. This governance is already applied in Generative AI tools supporting sales, software engineering and the people function.\n\n## Sustainable procurement\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk relies on more than 41,000 suppliers, including 5,100+ in high-risk categories in the company's global supply chain. Addressing sustainability risks in the supply chain is critical in strengthening stakeholder trust in the A.P. Moller - Maersk brand and to live up to coming regulations on due diligence in supply chains.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk is committed to procuring sustainably, with an ambition to integrate ESG as a strategic topic across supplier life cycle stages and establish end-to-end visibility on supplier performance through collaboration and engagement. In 2023, the company continued building on the sustainable procurement foundation built in 2022, with a focus on driving execution and integrating ESG deeper into A.P. Moller - Maersk's procurement activities. This included scaling up supplier engagement, embedding ESG requirements into source-to-pay processes and preparing for increased regulatory due diligence requirements. In 2023, 95% of suppliers in scope committed to the Supplier Code of Conduct against a 2024 target of 100%.\n\n## EU Taxonomy reporting 2023\n\n- Taxonomy-aligned\n- Taxonomy-eligible but not aligned\n- Non-eligible\n\n|      |    | Revenue   | Revenue   | CAPEX   | CAPEX   | CAPEX   | OPEX   | OPEX   | OPEX   |\n|------|----|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n|      | 4% | 76%       | 20%       | 17%     | 57%     | 26%     | 7%     | 61%    | 32%    |\n| 2023 |    |           |           |         |         |         |        |        |        |\n|      | 3% | 82%       | 15%       | 7%      | 56%     | 37%     | 10%    | 90%    |        |\n| 2022 |    |           |           |         |         |         |        |        |        |\n\nIn 2023, A.P. Moller - Maersk continued its reporting of the share of its activities that are EU Taxonomy-aligned as well as eligible. Aligned activities are the share of the company's eligible activities that meet both the 'substantial contribution' and 'do no significant harm' criteria outlined in the EU Taxonomy Regulation - a classification system identifying environmentally sustainable economic activities. The results of the 2023 screening confirm that A.P. Moller - Maersk has a significant opportunity to make a substantial contribution towards climate change mitigation, and that it is in its early stages of the journey to decarbonise its end-to-end value chain. In 2023, 4% of revenue, 17% of CAPEX and 7% of OPEX are reported as taxonomy-aligned, and 76% of revenue, 57% of CAPEX and 61% of OPEX are taxonomy-eligible but not aligned.

Moller - Maersk is focused to support the strategic and operational objectives in the medium term and ensure the longevity of the company in the longer term. A.P. Moller - Maersk's Enterprise Risk Management framework enables a consistent approach to identification, assessment, mitigation and monitoring of key risks.\n\n## Identifying A.P. Moller - Maersk's key risks\n\nThe enterprise risk management (ERM) framework ensures that all A.P. Moller - Maersk businesses and functions identify risks that could affect their business objectives and operations. Risk identification is based on a combination of facilitated risk reporting from business areas and functions along with interviews with individual executives to gather their holistic view of the risks to the company's business objectives.\n\n## Figure 1 Overview of governance structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Board of Directors / Audit Committee                                       | Board of Directors / Audit Committee                                                                    | Board of Directors / Audit Committee                                                                                     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Provides oversight over ERM effectiveness                                  | Provides oversight over ERM effectiveness                                                               | Provides oversight over ERM effectiveness                                                                                |\n| Executive Leadership Team/  Risk & Compliance Committee                    | ERM Team                                                                                                | Enterprise Risk Owners                                                                                                   |\n| Review key risks Review effectiveness of ERM   across A.P.

After final consolidation, the risk landscape is reviewed by the Executive Leadership Team, which determines the key risks for the company. These risks are then discussed and validated by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\n## Managing A.P. Moller - Maersk's key risks\n\nThe key risks are assigned to an executive owner who is accountable for the management of the risk, including confirmation that adequate controls are in place and that the necessary action plans are implemented to bring or keep the key risk within risk appetite. To provide adequate oversight, key risk developments and mitigation progress are monitored and reported on throughout the year based on agreed metrics. Quarterly in-depth reviews of the status of the key risks and their mitigation are conducted in various oversight fora such as the Risk & Compliance Committee. In addition, the Audit Committee conducts deep dive sessions with executive risk owners throughout the year on selected key risks. Figure 1 presents an overview of A.P. Moller - Maersk's ERM governance structure.\n\n## Changes to the key risks\n\nThe 2023 risk called Technology roadmap and Process standardisation has been split into two separate risks in 2024, Technology roadmap and Process excellence, to create stronger focus on and ownership of the mitigating action.\n\nGiven the easing of the supply chain constraints and the lowering of inflation related to COVID-19 a few 2023 key risks, including Customer service level and Rising costs have moved out of the key risks list in 2024.\n\nOne new risk has entered the key risks list, Lack of growth pace in logistics, emphasising further the risks associated with the ongoing trans formation.\n\n## ERM roadmap\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk continues to develop and improve the ERM process. The areas in focus include further operationalisation of the ERM framework to ensure consistent and uniform performance of the ERM process across the company, implementation of a shared risk appetite framework, launch of a framework for management of project risks and implementation of a digital ERM system to support collation of comprehensive risk data and real-time monitoring of key risk metrics.",

From the market side, the risk is that industry EBIT margins remain negative for longer than expected.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has limited levers to impact the overall demand for container shipping and the level of rates. With the continuing development of differentiated value propositions, agile adaption of network, rigorous focus on volume performance management and cost discipline and a long-term contracts portfolio, the company will all else equal continue to reduce the exposure.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk assumes margins will continue to be under pressure in the short to medium term. In addition, the geopolitical environment and the development in the economic situation in Europe and the US makes the industry very volatile, emphasising the necessity for a strong balance sheet.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk aims to have alternative procurement supply-options in place and to be able to adjust network and capacity in the ocean, terminals and logistics space to accommodate potential disruptions and changes in customer needs.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk targets large and profitable growth in volumes across its warehousing, inland and air segments through acquisitions as well as through organic growth and stable financial performance across the business portfolio.\n\nIn 2024, A.P. Moller - Maersk targets significant progress in the implementation of best-in-class technology platforms to support end-to-end supply chain solutions and underpin customer convenience and satisfaction.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk aims to avoid a material cyberattack through increased threat intelligence and response capabilities, and builds digital resilience with business segments, third parties and wider supply chains.\n\nThe current situation of low freight rates due to increased capacity combined with low demand continues for a longer period than expected.\n\nMilitary conflicts or comprehensive and long-lasting naval blockades leading to obstruction of major network routes and potential wide sanctions inhibiting trade in major markets affected.\n\nThe implementation of the integrator strategy lags due to delays in achieving profitable growth in logistics as planned, and the company remains exposed to the financial volatility of the Ocean segment.\n\nUnsuccessful implementation of digitised supply chain solutions causes loss of digital competitive advantage and customer dissatisfaction and impacts the company's reputation and financial performance.\n\nDirect or indirect attack(s) on A.P. Moller - Maersk's or its business partners' network due to digitisation, threat sophistication or inherent vulnerabilities from, e.g. new M&A environments cause severe business disruption and/or data breaches leading to financial losses and loss of customer trust.\n\nEscalation of geopolitical tension may have a strong and immediate impact on the future supply chain, through disruptions in supply, demand and logistics infrastructure and, eventually, fragmentation of supply chains. This is particularly the case where tension mounts to military conflict and/or trade sanctions being applied.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk monitors geopolitical developments and takes adaptive steps as required, including reducing exposure to critical suppliers, evaluating alternative procurement options, implementing tail heavy payment profiles, creating external communication plans and advancing business continuity planning.\n\nTo fully deliver the objectives of the integrator strategy in a timely manner, including achievement of financial targets and stable results, A.P. Moller - Maersk must secure profitable growth in the logistics business according to plan.\n\nA serious delay or failure to execute the technology roadmap will have a material negative impact on A.P. Moller - Maersk's growth vision as an end-to-end integrator of global container logistics.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk focuses mitigation efforts on the growth side on strengthening the customer value proposition of the integrator strategy and lowering the customer churn-rate. On the profitability side, the focus is on review and optimisation of the asset utilisation within the Air and Warehousing segments together with timely implementation of planned process standardisation and automation.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk focuses on maturing and strengthening a multi-location talent sourcing and retention strategy within the technology organisation to ensure having the right skilled people to modernise and integrate the platforms. The company monitors progress and ensures adequate governance and prioritisation and cross-functional collaboration.\n\nAs A.P. Moller - Maersk becomes increasingly digitalised, more devices and control systems are connected online resulting in a wider technology surface. This, compounded with ever-increasing external threat capabilities, puts more pressure on systems to be cyber threat resilient. A cyberattack could lead to severe operational disruption and/or data breaches.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk continues to execute its cyber security programme, strengthen business continuity plans and enhance its cyber threat resilience. Over the recent years, the company has enhanced capabilities to control impact through appropriate preparedness and response procedures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3 NEW RISK Lack of growth pace\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Moller - Maersk's integrated solu tions and its growth vision as an end-to-end integrator of global logistics.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk continues to drive standardisation of processes with focus on process design and quality, assessing process maturity levels across the organisation and establishing the visibility of end-to-end process design progress. Process performance metrics are also being rolled out to measure the efficiencies achieved.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk continues to progress its strategy by offering eco-delivery products to customers. The supply of green fuel is secured through partnerships with green methanol suppliers as well as the investment in the new methanol company C2X. A.P. Moller - Maersk is also fully supporting the GHG IMO regulation.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has a dedicated post-merger integration office equipped with experienced capabilities to assist the business in effectively managing M&A integrations. A project risk management framework is also being rolled out to ensure risks are identified and managed along the integration.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has global and regional subject-matter experts in each compliance area and a robust compliance programme designed to fulfil the global requirements. The company has implemented many initiatives to improve focus and emphasis on compliance training, awareness, processes and controls.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk is constantly working to document, streamline and automate its core processes in terms of design and consistent implementation across the company.\n\nUnsuccessful standardisation of the processes will not bring the required level of qual ity and conformance, thereby making A.P. Moller - Maersk's product delivery unre liable and difficult to scale and forfeiting associated productivity gains and cost sav ings.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk fails to generate business value from decarbonisation by being too aggressive or linear in its efforts, as customers are unwilling to pay a premium for green products until there is greater cost parity between 'green' and 'black' solutions which is expected over time.\n\nA failure to successfully integrate a major acquisition due to inadequate integration approach, lack of internal processes or capabilities, or cultural differences cause value destruction in the form of unrealised synergies.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk targets achievement of a value-generating decarbonisation vision by innovating supply chain solutions and accelerating its decarbonisation initiatives to drive credibility towards the customers, investors and society.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk aims to have adequate and experienced capabilities and effective processes to warrant that substantial M&As are integrated successfully both during and after the 'hyper care' period to realise the anticipated benefits as planned.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk is committed to ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in all the countries where it operates.\n\nA violation of compliance regulation causes severe reputational damage and substantial legal fines, damages and costs.\n\nDecarbonisation is a business necessity and a mission-critical factor. It is imperative for A.P. Moller - Maersk to decarbonise its endto-end supply chain at a speed that meets the expectations of customers, investors and society, and in a way that generates business value for A.P. Moller - Maersk and its customers.\n\nA key driver to Logistics & Services growth is the expansion of product and people capabilities through M&As. Some of the acquisitions are substantial, and if A.P. Moller - Maersk fails to integrate those, it may derail the execution of the inte grator  strategy.\n\nThe legal and regulatory landscape in which A.P. Moller - Maersk operates is complex, and the company could be subject to compliance cases in connection with violations of anti-corruption laws, anti-trust regulations, international sanctions and/or data privacy.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk's strategy to become a global integrator of container logistics requires the right capabilities. Inability to retain and attract for key critical capabilities could impact the ambition to deliver a logistics-based, digitally transformed business model to support the integrator strategy.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk continues to strengthen global processes and people solutions for talent development, retention and attraction aligned to business and workforce requirements for key critical roles. Mitigation efforts will be focused on enhancing visibility of business and workforce requirements as well as on employee engagement through creation and implementation of specific actions based on biannual survey results.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk targets to be an employer of choice, able to attract and retain qualified talent who are highly engaged and committed to the company's values, goals and objectives.\n\nA.P.

Moller - Maersk delivered solid financial results for 2023 in line with guidance in a difficult market environment, with a strong performance in Terminals while Ocean and Logistics & Services faced strong headwinds coming off the pandemic peak. While volumes were up across most products and cost reductions improved results, rates continued to erode, in particular in Ocean.\n\nThe financials for 2023 declined significantly versus 2022, which was a year of all-time high results due to an exceptional market situation, which was not expected to continue. Revenue, EBITDA and EBIT saw substantial declines, predominantly due to the financial results in Ocean.\n\nOcean results were solid on a cumulative basis but declined in the second half of the year reaching break-even levels in Q3, and entering negative territory by Q4 as the result of the continuous pressure on rates. The impact of lower rates was partially offset by a strong cost containment focus.\n\nLogistics & Services performance continued to be impacted by lower rates, particularly in the air and haulage business and by lower volumes for lead logistics and e-commerce. Profitability declined versus previous year with an increased emphasis on cost management to resize the organisation and tackle a lower-rate environment.\n\nTerminals revenue declined given the normalisation of storage revenue and lower volumes, mostly due to ongoing construction work and exits of terminals. However, tariff increases in line with local inflation as well as strong cost control secured a continued solid financial performance.\n\n| Highlights for the year                      | USD million   | USD million   | USD million   | USD million   | USD million   | USD million   | USD million   | USD million   |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                              | Revenue       | Revenue       | EBITDA        | EBITDA        | EBIT          | EBIT          | CAPEX         | CAPEX         |\n|                                              | 2023          | 2022          | 2023          | 2022          | 2023          | 2022          | 2023          | 2022          |\n| Ocean                                        | 33,653        | 64,299        | 6,940         | 33,770        | 2,227         | 29,149        | 1,987         | 2,620         |\n| Logistics & Services                         | 13,916        | 14,423        | 1,251         | 1,378         | 446           | 814           | 771           | 657           |\n| Terminals                                    | 3,844         | 4,371         | 1,278         | 1,535         | 980           | 832           | 541           | 516           |\n| Towage & Maritime Services                   | 2,160         | 2,293         | 320           | 369           | 457           | 307           | 318           | 350           |\n| Unallocated activities,   eliminations, etc. | -2,508        | -3,857        | -198          | -239          | -176          | -242          | 29            | 20            |\n| A.P.

In Logistics & Services, total revenue decreased, due to destocking in the USA in lifestyle and retail volumes, lower growth in Europe and China, as well as lower air freight rates, only partially compensated by increased revenue from the integration of LF Logistics and Martin Bencher. Revenue decreased in Terminals due to lower volumes and significantly lower storage revenue, particularly in North America.\n\nEBITDA decreased to USD 9.6bn (USD 36.8bn) with a decrease in Ocean of USD 26.8bn due to lower rates, and smaller decreases in Logistics & Services of USD 127m and in Terminals of USD 257m.\n\nOcean, USDbn (2022: 33.8)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLogistics & Services, USDbn\n\n(2022: 1.4)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTerminals, USDbn (2022: 1.5)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEBIT decreased by USD 26.9bn to USD 3.9bn (USD 30.9bn) impacted by the declining EBITDA.

The new validated targets include near-term 2030 targets aligned to a 1.5-degree pathway and a 2040 net zero target, from an updated baseline year of 2022. The number of companies with SBTi commitments has nearly doubled every year over the past eight years, showing the importance and wide adoption of the SBTi framework. The introduction of these new absolute emissions reduction targets covering all greenhouse gas emissions scopes makes this a transitional year, where A.P.

Additionally, the global con gestion decreased considerably, leading to improved schedule reliability and operating conditions, which resulted in a reduction of expenses.\n\nRevenue reflected weak volume demand in the first half of the year and although picking up in the second half, revenue was severely impacted by a continued decline in the freight rates driven by higher supply availability. The freight rates decreased by 50% on average from 2022 levels, with volumes on par with 2022.\n\nUnit cost at fixed bunker decreased due to lower container handling unit costs and lower bunker consumption after the congestion bottlenecks eased.\n\nUtilisation at 91.6% was 2.3 percentage points better than in 2022, due to several structural capacity initiatives.\n\n## Line of business\n\nAt the heart of the integrator strategy, Ocean ensures that goods keep moving across the world, providing customers with a unique offering, combining flexibility and stability to manage and simplify their end-toend supply chains.\n\nWhile providing access to a competitive global network, Ocean offers resilient solutions and differentiated value propositions through its global network and digital products to fit the diverging customer needs and enhance long-term partnerships.

Steps were taken to remain agile with deploying the capacity in the most meaningful way, increase the quality of Ocean's products and preparing for a greener future of shipping.\n\n## Focus on network optimisation\n\nGlobal congestions have reduced significantly in 2023, which has allowed for an extensive network review with the objective to reduce emissions and improve reliability across services. The 2M alliance with MSC will terminate from January 2025 and a new operational cooperation with Hapag Lloyd will start from February 2025. Ocean will keep the focus on the Integrator strategy to meet the evolving needs of the customers, including reliability, flexibility and sustainability. The ambition is to provide customers with adequate volumes while limiting the deployed capacity and keeping a high utilisation.\n\n## Ongoing focus on cost discipline\n\nMany cost-saving initiatives have been implemented across the organisation to reduce costs, while maintaining focus on the quality and reliability of the Ocean products. In some instances, A.P. Moller - Maersk has been able to reduce its variable costs by partnering with the right suppliers and applying a more robust cost discipline within the company.\n\n## Value-adding products to customers\n\nBased on strong collaboration with customers from differ ent industries, the product team is exploring innovative and integrated transport solutions that can meet customers' diverse and evolving needs and requirements, with a focus on reliability and flexibility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Moller - Maersk\n\nAnnual Report 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDECARBONISATION\n\n## A landmark port call in Ocean decarbonisation\n\nThe two key levers to decarbonising the Ocean business are transitioning to green fuels and improving fuel efficiency. The most notable milestone in 2023 was the September arrival of the Laura M\u00e6rsk - the world's first container vessel capable of sailing on green methanol. The 2,100 TEU feeder vessel completed her entire 21,500 km first voyage from Hyundai Mipo Dockyard, South Korea to Copenhagen, Denmark, while sailing on green methanol. Laura M\u00e6rsk is now in service as a feeder vessel on the Baltic Sea and operating on green fuels.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk further expanded its green methanol shipping capacity in 2023, ordering six additional vessels of 9,000 TEU each to be delivered in 2026 and 2027 and bringing its total order book to 24 vessels. In 2024, the company will start taking delivery of the first eight of 12 larger container vessels of 16,000-17,000 TEU capacity. As an alternative path to newbuilds, A.P. Moller - Maersk also announced an industry-first pilot with MAN Energy Solutions to convert an existing 14,000 TEU vessel from a traditional fossil diesel engine to a dual-fuel methanol engine. The pilot vessel conversion will take place in 2024, with the intention of replicating the retrofit on additional vessels.\n\nOne of the main challenges in accelerating the transition to net zero shipping is the limited supply of green fuels. A.P. Moller - Maersk continuously works on green sourcing solutions with a broad range of global partners, and in 2023 signed a landmark offtake agreement with China's Goldwind, a leader in clean energy, to secure 500 kilotonnes of green methanol annually starting in 2026. This agreement will cover the fuel needs of half of the 24 methanol vessels currently on order. To further support the ramp-up of green fuels, A.P. M\u00f8ller Holding, together with A.P. Moller - Maersk as a minority owner, created a seed investment in C2X - an independent company that will build, own and operate assets to produce green methanol at scale. C2X plans to bring three million tonnes of green fuels to market annually starting in 2030, and large projects are underway in Egypt and Spain.\n\nThe second key lever for decarbonising shipping is improving fuel efficiency. Through more energy-efficient operations and the continuous roll-out of efficiency technologies on owned and time charter vessels, A.P. Moller - Maersk lowered its emissions intensity measure for Ocean, EEOI, to a record low of 11.68 (13.0) in 2023.",

Organic revenue decreased by 15%, driven by air due to lower rates and warehouse and distribution, mainly in North America, due to lower consolidation and deconsolidation volumes primarily in the retail and lifestyle segment. In 2023, more than 50% of the decline in organic revenue was driven by the top 200 customers.\n\nInorganic revenue of USD 1.7bn increased by 12% with the biggest contribution from LF Logistics, Pilot and Senator. EBITA was USD 619m (USD 944m), of which USD 55m was in organic. Pilot and Senator became organic during Q2 2023. LF Logistics has been organic since the start of September 2023, and Martin Bencher and Grindrod Logistics are considered inorganic all of 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Organic/inorganic USD million   | Organic/inorganic USD million   | Organic/inorganic USD million   | Organic/inorganic USD million   | Organic/inorganic USD million   |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                                 | 2022                            |                                 | Organic Inorganic               | 2023                            |\n| Revenue                         | 14,423                          | -2,220                          | 1,713                           | 13,916                          |\n| Growth                          |                                 | -15%                            | 12%                             |                                 |\n| EBITA                           | 944                             | -380                            | 55                              | 619                             |\n\n## Managed by Maersk's revenue\n\ndecreased by 13% to USD 2.2bn (USD 2.5bn), driven by 7.3% lower volumes in supply chain management volumes to 102,252k cbm (110,264k cbm). Customs services volumes increased by 2.2% to 5,684k declarations (5,559k declarations).\n\nFulfilled by Maersk's revenue was up by 11% to USD 5.5bn (USD 4.9bn) driven by the establishment of 17 new warehouses equivalent to 725k sqm, of which 259k sqm was from LF Logistics in 2023.\n\nTransported by Maersk's revenue was down by 10% to USD 6.3bn (USD 7.0bn), driven by lower freight rates and partly offset by increasing volumes in air and LCL. Organic intermodal volumes decreased by 11% to 4,031k FFE, (4,526k FFE) excl. Grindrod Logistic. Inorganic volumes from Grindrod Logistic increased by 5.5% or 249k FFE to 4,280k FFE. Lower organic volume from intermodal was due to lower ocean volumes given market normalisation, partly offset by higher non-carrier haulage volumes. Air volumes increased by 40%, or 8.2% in organic growth. The inorganic contribution from Senator increased volumes by 32%. Revenue was offset by demand slowdown and a decrease in rates due to post-COVID-19 normalisation.\n\nUSDbn\n\n## Gross profit\n\n## 4.2bn\n\n(USD 3.7bn)\n\nIncreased by USD 516m to a margin of 30.3% (25.7%). The increase was primarily driven by warehouse and distribution increasing its gross profit margin from 39% to 46%, affected positively by improving its deconsolidation, fulfilment and consolidation profitability. Furthermore, gross profit was positively affected by inorganic gross profit contribution from acquisitions.\n\n## EBITDA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.3bn\n\n(USD 1.4bn)\n\nEBITDA decreased by USD 127m due to lower freight rates with an EBITDA margin of 9.0% (9.6%).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 446m\n\n(USD 814m)\n\nEBIT decreased by USD 368m with the EBIT margin at 3.2% (5.6%) and an EBIT conversion of 10.6% (22.0%).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Logistics & Services highlights\n\nBy expanding in capacity and capabilities while becoming more digitalised, Logistics & Services continues to improve its end-to-end logistics solutions providing greater flexibility for the customers at every stage of their supply chain.\n\n## Transported by Maersk\n\nThe Less than Container Load (LCL) value proposition was strengthened by expanding the LCL network, with over 600 own direct consolidation lanes now open versus 400 lanes in 2022 and enhanced digital capability on Maersk.com for public track and trace, instant price and booking journey. This own-controlled and operated consolidation model with fixed sailing schedules and loading priority will help safeguard the highest-level reliability for customers.\n\n## Fulfilled by Maersk\n\nWith the acquisition of LF Logistics and with organic growth, the global warehousing footprint reached 7,829k sqm and 469 sites in 2023 from 7,104K sqm and 452 sites at the end of 2022. Fulfilled by Maersk is rolling out a modernised transport management system globally and are leveraging LF Logistics technology to develop and implement one global warehouse management system. These are key milestones in being able to provide customers with digitally enabled end-to-end logistics solutions.\n\n## Managed by Maersk\n\nMaersk Project Logistics (MPL) was launched as a global product family in January 2023. The product is an amalgamation of Maersk SPL and Martin Bencher, which was acquired to add additional project logistics competences and global coverage, with 350 dedicated project logistics professionals. The purpose of MPL is to meet customers' needs for end-to-end transportation and mobilisation of special cargo (out of gauge cargo) and integrated project logistics solutions that remove complexity and provide outcome certainty in a safe manner.",

Moller - Maersk increased delivery of decarbonisation solutions based on its 2022 groundwork on understanding customers' needs and the most promising and commercially viable technologies. For many customers, the GHG emissions from land-based logistics including contract logistics, cold chain and omnichannel fulfilment, are the most carbon-intense parts of their logistics supply chains, and there is significant appetite for end-to-end decarbonisation solutions. At the same time, scaling Logistics & Services decarbonisation offerings relies on regional solutions as well as local policy, capacity and infrastructure, such as sufficient electric vehicle charging.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk launched an ECO Delivery Inland product in select US locations using owned/ leased electric vehicles in 2023. The company also began deploying heavy duty electric trucks, together with partners, in Germany, Norway, Sweden, the UK and China, with pilots in Brazil. The first ECO Delivery Air pilots were also run for customers requiring air shipments in their supply chains.\n\nSustainable warehouse and distribution centre facilities are another key lever in decarbonising logistics. In 2023, A.P. Moller - Maersk launched low and very low emissions dry storage warehouses in the United Kingdom, Malaysia and Columbia. 'Low emission' facilities are defined as being fully compliant with a target based on facility size, use of renewable energy and no equipment running on fossil fuels.\n\nCold store warehouses are further required to use natural refrigerants in the main cooling system to be compliant. In 2023, A.P. Moller - Maersk inaugurated a state-of-the-art cold storage facility in Hamilton, New Zealand, built with a low-carbon construction policy and including advanced energy management, solar energy and rainwater harvesting.",

In the first half of the year, global demand dropped significantly, decongesting global supply chains and reducing terminal utilisation. Consequently, Terminals revenue decreased significantly with dwell time and hence storage revenue returning close to the pre-pandemic levels of 2019.\n\nMargins were actively protected through cost-saving initiatives and tariff increases resulting in an EBITDA margin of 33.2%, 5.4 percentage points above 2019 levels, with only a 1.9-percentage point drop from 2022. Volume adjusted for exits decreased by 0.8% in a contracting global market driven by a weak US market and construction closures in India (GTI), partially offset by growth in Poti, Georgia, and Callao, Peru. Revenue per move decreased by 8.2% due to lower storage revenue and exits, which outweighed the achieved tariff increases in many locations. Cost per move decreased by 4.5% on the back of exits and inflation offsetting cost-saving initiatives.\n\nExpansion projects were initiated in Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico, and Pipavav, India, while the terminal modernisation project in Onne, Nigeria, was completed. The significant modernisation projects in Los Angeles, USA, and Mumbai, India, are nearing completion as well.\n\n## 55 gateway terminals across 30 countries\n\nThe terminals are operated either exclusively by Terminals under the APM Terminals brand or together with a joint venture partner. The performance of seven hub terminals also operated by Terminals is reported under the Ocean segment.\n\nTerminals is uniquely positioned to help both shipping line and landside customers, with 75%/25% of revenue, respectively, to grow their business and achieve better supply chain efficiency, flexibility and dependability.\n\n| Terminals highlights                                                           | USD million   | USD million   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                                                | 2023          | 2022          |\n| Revenue                                                                        | 3,844         | 4,371         |\n| Concession fees                                                                | 308           | 362           |\n| Labour cost (blue collar)                                                      | 1,121         | 1,270         |\n| Other operational costs                                                        | 618           | 638           |\n| Selling, General & Administration (SG&A)   and other costs, etc.               | 519           | 566           |\n| Total operating costs                                                          | 2,566         | 2,836         |\n| Profit before depreciation, amortisation and  impairment losses, etc. (EBITDA) | 1,278         | 1,535         |\n| EBITDA margin                                                                  | 33.2%         | 35.1%         |\n| Profit before financial items (EBIT)                                           | 980           | 832           |\n| EBIT margin                                                                    | 25.5%         | 19.0%         |\n| Invested capital                                                               | 7,813         | 7,593         |\n| Gross capital expenditure, excl. acquisitions   and divestments (CAPEX)        | 541           | 516           |\n| Operational and financial metrics                                              |               |               |\n| Terminal volumes   - financially consolidated (moves in '000)                  | 12,204        | 12,752        |\n| Ocean segment                                                                  | 4,245         | 4,558         |\n| External customers                                                             | 7,959         | 8,194         |\n| Terminal revenue per move   - financially consolidated (USD)                   | 313           | 341           |\n| Terminal cost per move   - financially consolidated (USD)                      | 252           | 263           |\n| Result from joint ventures and associated   companies (USDm)                   | 282           | -46           |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Volumes from Ocean decreased by 6.9% (3.3% like-for-like) and volumes from external customers decreased by 2.9% (increased by 1.8% like-for-like). Despite the increase in volumes in the continuing portfolio, utilisation decreased to 73% (78%), mainly driven by a capacity increase from a terminal modernisation programme in North America.\n\nLower congestion-related storage revenue and exits resulted in an 8.2% reduction in revenue per move, even as underlying tariffs were increased in line with local inflation. Cost per move improved by 4.5% to USD 252 (USD 263), driven by mix impact, exits and an ability to limit the impact of inflation on the cost base.\n\nAdjusted for foreign exchange rates, volume mix and portfolio changes, revenue per move decreased by 4.3% and cost per move increased by 3.2%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUSDbn\n\n## EBITDA\n\n## 1.3bn\n\n(USD 1.5bn)\n\nEBITDA decreased by USD 257m driven by the normalisation of storage revenue, partly offset by higher tariffs. The EBITDA margin decreased to 33.2% (35.1%), but compared to the pre- congestion year in 2019, the EBITDA margin improved by 5.4 percentage points.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EBIT\n\nUSDm\n\n## 980m\n\n## (USD 832m)\n\nEBIT increased by USD 148m, driven by the impact of divesting GPI in 2022. Adjusted for the divestment EBIT decreased by USD 255m, driven by the normalisation of storage revenue, partly offset by increasing tariffs and cost-saving initiatives keeping increases below inflation. Compared to the pre- congestion year in 2019, EBIT improved by USD 335m.\n\n|   2023 |   2022 | 2021   |   2020 |   2019 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|    980 |    832 | 1,173  |    687 |    645 |\n\nUSDbn\n\n## CAPEX\n\n## 541m\n\n## (USD 516m)\n\nCAPEX increased by USD 25m as investments into the existing portfolio was largely unchanged with key projects being the ongoing moder nisation of terminals in Los Angeles, USA, Port Elizabeth, USA, and Barcelona, Spain, and the completion of construction work in Mumbai, India, and Poti, Georgia.\n\n## ROIC\n\nPer cent\n\n## 10.5%\n\n## (7.6%)\n\nROIC (LTM) increased by 2.9 percentage points, driven by the impact of the Global Port Investments (GPI) divestment in 2022.

Volumes in the rest of the portfolio increased by 6.9%, driven by strong volume in Callao, Peru, while utilisation reduced to 74% (75%) due to increased capacity.\n\nIn Asia and Middle East , volumes decreased by 3.2%, purely driven by construction work in Mumbai, India, where one berth was unavailable. Excluding Mumbai, volume grew 7.1% with all terminals increasing volumes year on year. Utilisation remained unchanged at 79% (79%).\n\nIn North America , volumes decreased by 8.4% due to a significantly weaker performance in Los Angeles, USA, and Port Elizabeth, USA. Additionally, capacity increased due to the ongoing modernisation programme, leading to a significant decrease in utilisation to 70% (86%).\n\nIn Africa , volumes decreased by 21% purely due to the divestment of Luanda, Angola. Adjusted for the exit, volume increased by 5.0%, mainly driven by San Pedro, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Onne, Nigeria.

Combined with further portfolio optimisation, the company is well positioned for future growth.\n\n## Growth\n\nThe focus on growing the portfolio continues after Terminals entered into a strategic partnership with Vietnamese HATECO group to develop a new terminal at Haiphong City, Vietnam. Further, the acquisition of a facility in Suape, Brazil, is on track, paving the way for building what will be Brazil's first 100% electrified terminal. In Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico, the Phase II expansion has started, which will increase the capacity by one million TEUs and position it as a hub for the Americas region.\n\n## Modernisation\n\nThe modernisation project in Los Angeles, USA, is concluding with 100% of the volumes now being managed through the new automated yard. In Mumbai, India, both berths are operational again after a planned temporary closure due to a modernisation programme and volumes are returning. In Onne, Nigeria, the terminal modernisation programme has also been completed, positioning the terminal well for future growth.\n\n## Portfolio optimisation\n\nTerminals divested the terminal facility in Castell\u00f3n, Spain, (APM Terminals Castell\u00f3n) upon reaching an agreement with Noatum Terminals, which is part of Noatum, an AD Ports Group company. Further APM Terminals Mauritanie S.A, operating terminals in Nouakchott and Nouadhibou, has been divested to local container operator Terminal \u00e0 Conteneurs de Nouakchott (TCN).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Moller - Maersk's commitment to decarbonisation also applies to Terminals' network of owned and operated terminals that connect ocean and landside operations. The challenge in addressing terminal emissions is the fragmented footprint across almost 4,000 pieces of equipment and nearly 40 different locations with unique infrastructure, regulatory and concession context.\n\nThe key levers in decarbonising terminals are switching to renewable electricity, direct electrification, battery electric mobile equipment, energy optimisation and green fuels when needed and possible.\n\nIn 2023, Terminals published a white paper with multinational logistics company DP World outlining the case for electrified container handling. The current global fleet of container handling equipment is estimated to account for 10-15 million tonnes of scope 1 and scope 2 annual carbon emissions from ports. The whitepaper offers a roadmap for container terminal electrification by engaging with stakeholders across the value chain, including terminal operators, equipment manufacturers, port authorities, affiliated government entities and shipping line operators.\n\nFollowing the launch of the whitepaper, Terminals and DP World announced the formation of the Zero Emission Port Alliance (ZEPA) during COP28 in December 2023. ZEPA is an industry-wide strategic coalition with the goal of accelerating the journey to zero emissions for container handling equipment on ports.\n\nIn 2023, Terminals completed energy optimisation assessments at 12 terminals to identify solutions that will reduce and optimise fuel and electricity use. The first of five electric equipment pilot projects at the Aqaba Container Terminal in Jordan, was also kicked off as a pilot project including electric reach stackers and empty container handlers as well as 10 electric terminal trucks.\n\nTo reduce scope 2 (purchased electricity) emissions, Terminals switched to 100% renewable electricity in Callao, Peru, and 40% renewable electricity in Pipavav, India. For the year, procured renewable electricity accounted for nearly 40% of Terminals' total electricity demand.\n\nGHG emissions from diesel generators from vessels at ports are Terminals' largest scope 3 category emissions. In 2023, a number of alternative maritime power systems, which provide vessels with power from shore to reduce fuel use as well as pollution and noise, were evaluated for future consideration.",

Harbour Towage revenue increased by USD 52m, driven by increased volumes of 3.4% across all regions and tariffs in Europe, Australia and Americas, supported by a new port entry in Brazil. Terminal towage revenue increased by USD 10m, driven by tariff adjustments and new contracts commenced in most regions.\n\nTowage EBITDA increased to USD 246m (USD 229m), due to increased revenue, partly offset by increased fuel and other operating costs. EBIT increased to USD 145m (USD 116m), driven by the higher EBITDA, slightly offset by higher depreciations and lower result from joint ventures and associated companies, while EBIT in 2022 was negatively impacted by impairment of tugs, driven by the withdrawal from operations in Russia.\n\nFor Maersk Container Industry , revenue was USD 496m (USD 499m) with 63% related to third-party customers.

The share price development also reflected the DKK 74.4bn (USD 10.9bn) returned to shareholders - the highest dividend ever paid in the history of A.P. Moller - Maersk. Share price performance was broadly aligned with global peers.\n\nThe Maersk B share closed 2022 at DKK 15,620. Following the return of DKK 74.4bn to shareholders through the full-year dividend paid in March 2023, the share price declined to reflect the post-dividend balance sheet. The share price remained relatively stable over the following seven months, performing in line with the transportation industry peers. In the third quarter results\n\nShare price development\n\nMaersk B\n\nMSCI Europe Transportation Index\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrice change, %\n\npublished in November 2023, the company readjusted guidance expectations towards the lower end of the financial guidance ranges previously communicated and highlighted the impact of the rapidly increasing oversupply in container shipping, resulting in a share price decline of 17% on the day. From mid-December, Maersk shares rallied strongly in response to a spike in freight rates, resulting from the concerning disruptions in the Red Sea/Gulf of Aden. Maersk B shares closed 2023 at DKK 12,140, representing a decline of 22% on the year. Assuming reinvestment of the dividend paid in March 2023, the total shareholder return over the year was 6%.\n\nThe Board of Directors in A.P.

M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' shares are listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen and are divided into two classes: A shares with voting rights and B shares without voting rights. Each DKK 1,000 A share entitles the holder to two votes.\n\nOn 7 June 2023, the cancellation of 227,390 A shares and 910,056 B shares was completed, corresponding to 6.08% of the total share capital in A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S before the cancella tion of shares.\n\nThe A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S share capital amounts to nominally DKK 17,569,715 divided between 10,107,046 A shares of nominally DKK 1,000 and 7,462,669 B shares of nominally DKK 1,000.\n\n## Ownership\n\nThe total number of registered shareholders increased by 18,000 to around 107,000 during 2023. Shareholders with more than 5% of share capital or votes held 59.6% of the share capital, while the 20 largest institutional shareholders together owned around 13.3% of the total share capital and around 32.9% adjusted for the free-float. Danish retail investor holdings were around 11.8% of the total share capital.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nThe A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S holding of treasury shares comprised 9.03% of the share capital at the end of 2023, cf. note 4.1 in the consolidated financial statements, a total of 306,636 A shares and 1,279,120 B shares.\n\n## Dividend\n\nA.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' dividend policy is an annual pay-out ratio of 30-50% of underlying net result adjusted for gains, impairments and restructurings.\n\n## The Board of Directors proposes a dividend to the shareholders of DKK 515 per share of DKK 1,000 (DKK 4,300 per share of DKK 1,000).\n\nDistribution to shareholders of excess cash will take place through dividends and the annual payout ratio and distribution will be decided from an evaluation of the outlook, cash flow, capital expenditures for organic CAPEX and merger & acquisition transactions, and the target of having an investment grade rating.\n\nThe Board of Directors proposes a dividend to the shareholders of DKK 515 per share of DKK 1,000 (DKK 4,300 per share of DKK 1,000). The proposed dividend payment represents a dividend yield of 4.2% (27.5%) and 30% (37.5%) of the net underlying profit, based on the Maersk B share's closing price of DKK 12,140 as of 29 December 2023. Payment is expected to take place on 19 March 2024.\n\n## The A.P.

Moller - Maersk has sufficient financial flexibility to meet the strategic growth objectives while maximising return to A.P. Moller - Maersk's shareholders.\n\nFor 2023-2024, the expectation for the accumulated CAPEX is unchanged at USD 8.0-9.0bn, driven by continued investment in the integrator strategy, with a focus on growth, automation and decarbonisation. A.P. Moller - Maersk is committed to shareholder returns starting with its dividend policy, see above.\n\n## Funding strategy\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk's focus is on long-term debt in order to minimise the ongoing refinancing risk and secure a solid capital structure over the business cycle. A.P. Moller - Maersk aims at having a diversified debt portfolio, based on funding from debt capital markets, commercial bank debt, export credit agencies and from multilateral agencies.\n\nThe target is to have an average maturity of the debt portfolio (excluding the impact of leases) between four to five years, and that the total amount of debt maturing (excluding the impact of leases) in a single 12-month rolling period should not exceed USD 3bn within the next three years.\n\n## Share buy-back\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk's share buy-back programme, originally planned for USD 5.0bn over 20222023, has been progressively extended to USD 12.0bn over 2022-2025 or USD 3.0bn annually.\n\nOf the planned share buy-back of around USD 12.0bn for the years 2022-2025, A.P. Moller - Maersk has bought back USD 6.3bn as of 31 December 2023.\n\nThe share buy-back is carried out with the purpose to adjust the capital structure of A.P. Moller - Maersk. At the Annual General Meeting in 2024, it will be proposed that shares which are not used for hedging purposes for the long-term incentive programmes are to be cancelled.\n\nNo shares may be bought back at a price exceeding the higher of i) share price of latest independent trade and ii) the highest current independent bid at NASDAQ Copenhagen at the time of trading. The maximum number of A and B shares that may be purchased on each trading day may not exceed 25% of the average daily trading volume of A and B shares, respectively, on NASDAQ Copenhagen or other regulated markets, on which the purchase is carried out, over the last 20 trading days prior to the date of purchase. A and B shares will be acquired in a 20/80 split reflecting the current trading volumes of the two share classes.\n\nThe company will fulfil its reporting obligations by announcing no later than every seventh trading day the purchases made under the share buy-back programme.\n\nGiven the heightened uncertainty, the Board of Directors has decided to immediately suspend the share buy-back programme, with a re-initiation to be reviewed once market conditions in Ocean have settled.\n\n## Financial calendar 2024\n\n| Thursday, 14 March 2024   | Thursday, 2 May 2024      |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Annual General Meeting    | Interim Report            |\n| Virtual event             | Q1                        |\n| Wednesday, 7 August 2024  | Thursday, 31 October 2024 |\n| Interim Report            | Interim Report            |\n| Q2                        | Q3                        |\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nThe Annual General Meeting will be held on 14 March 2024 as a virtual event.\n\n## Investor Relations\n\nInvestor Relations worked to ensure that the global investment community were kept updated on the latest financial performance and corporate developments.

Moller - Maersk was operating in a market environment that was significantly different from the most recent years, impacting key performance criteria and the remuneration outcome for 2023.\n\nIn conjunction with the change of leadership of A.P. Moller - Maersk early 2023, the remuneration structure of the members of the Executive Board was changed to further align remuneration with business results and shareholder interests both short and long term. This has resulted in an increase of the variable pay relative to base salary for the Executive Board members.\n\nAdditionally, the focus has been on the implementation of the new Performance Share Plan that incorporates not only financial performance goals, but also ESG goals as outlined in the 2023 Remuneration Policy.\n\n## Remuneration policy at a glance\n\nThe Policy supports the business needs by enabling an appropriate total remuneration package that has a clear link to the business strategy and aligns with shareholder interests.\n\n## The objectives of the Policy are to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure appropriate total remuneration : The remuneration design and decisions are guided by market practice, reflected in the remuneration components offered and the total remuneration value provided.\n- \u00b7 Link to business strategy : The Policy supports the business plan and the need for executive leaders to focus on delivering an on going progress to achieve the company's strategic goals, reflected in a combination of short and long term incentive components.\n- \u00b7 Align with shareholder interest : The Policy is designed to support the delivery of strong financial and operational results over time, which ultimately grow shareholder value.\n\nThe current Policy applies to members of the Executive Board and the Board of Directors and was adopted at the company's Annual General Meeting in 2022.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors receive a fixed annual fee which is differentiated based on the role:\n\n- \u00b7 Ordinary Board members receive a fixed amount, and the Chair and Vice Chair receive fixed multiples thereof.\n\nBoard of Directors members serving on the Board committees or performing ad hoc work beyond the normal responsibilities receive an additional fee. This does not apply to the Chair where the fixed annual fee is all inclusive.\n\n## Executive Board\n\nThe remuneration of the Executive Board members consists of a fixed base salary, a benefit allowance, short-term incentive as well as long-term incentive components.\n\nThe remuneration structure is intended to drive a 'reward for performance' culture by aligning individual reward to company performance and shareholder value creation. The individual remuneration level is set and reviewed based on peer companies of similar size and complexity to ensure they remain comparable and fit for the business.\n\n## Total remuneration 2023\n\nThe table shows the total remuneration awarded to members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board in aggregate from 2019 to 2023, as set out in note 2.2 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nFurther information regarding the share-based incentives is detailed in note 5.2 of the consolidated financial statements as cal culated according to IFRS 2.\n\nLong-term share-based incentives are different in both reporting and methodology in the company's Remuneration Report 2023, which is available at the company's website on:\n\n- investor.maersk.com/financials/financial-reports\n\n| 2019-2023 Remuneration Remuneration awarded                                                | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | USD million 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------------------|\n| Board of Directors                                                                         |        |        |        |        |                    |\n| Fixed annual fee                                                                           | 2      | 2      | 3      | 3      | 3                  |\n| Total                                                                                      | 2      | 2      | 3      | 3      | 3                  |\n| Executive Board                                                                            |        |        |        |        |                    |\n| Fixed pay                                                                                  | 3      | 8      | 9      | 8      | 10                 |\n| Short-term cash incentive                                                                  | 2      | 6      | 8      | 6      | 5                  |\n| Long-term share-based incentives 1                                                         | 2      | 8      | 3      | 2      | 1                  |\n| Remuneration in connection with   redundancy, resignations and   release from duty to work | -1     | 8      | -      | -      | 6                  |\n| Total                                                                                      | 6 2    | 30     | 20     | 16     | 22                 |",

Basis of preparation\n\nThis section sets out general accounting policies for the Group that relate to the financial statements as a whole. Where an accounting policy is generally applicable to a specific note to the financial statements, the policy is described within that note. In addition, this section describes the significant accounting estimates and judgements that Management has identified as having a potentially material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements. Reference is made to the specific note in the financial statements which is impacted by the significant accounting estimates and judgements.\n\nFurther, details are provided on the new accounting pronouncements that the Group will adopt in the coming years and on the Group's current view of the impact such pronouncements will have on the financial reporting.\n\n|   1.1 | General accounting policies  ..............................................................   |   67 |\n|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|\n|   1.2 | Significant accounting estimates and judgements  ...............................              |   69 |\n\n## Note 1.1 General accounting policies\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements for 2023 for A.P. Moller - Maersk have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies. The consolidated financial statements of A.P. Moller - Maersk are included in the consolidated financial statements of A.P. M\u00f8ller Holding A/S. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for 2022, except for the changes to accounting standards that were effective from 1 January 2023 and were endorsed by the EU. The changes have not had a material impact on the financial statements.\n\n## ESEF/iXBRL reporting\n\nA.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S is required to prepare and file the annual report in the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF), and the annual report for 2023 is therefore prepared in the XHTML format that can be displayed in a standard browser. The primary statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements are tagged using inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (iXBRL). The iXBRL tags comply with the ESEF taxonomy, which is included in the ESEF Regulation and developed based on the IFRS taxonomy published by the IFRS Foundation. Where a financial statement line item or note is not defined in the ESEF taxonomy, an extension to the taxonomy has been created. Extensions are anchored to elements in the ESEF taxonomy, except for extensions which are subtotals. The Annual Report submitted to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority consists of the XHTML document together with certain technical files, all included in a file named APMM-2023-12-31-en.zip.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the parent company A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S, its subsidiaries and proportionate shares in joint arrangements classified as joint operations.\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by\n\nA.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S. Control is based on the power to direct the relevant activities of an entity and the exposure, or right, to variable returns arising from it. In that\n\nconnection, relevant activities are those that significantly affect the investee's returns. Control is usually achieved by directly or indirectly owning or in other ways controlling more than 50% of the voting rights or by other rights, such as agreements on management control.\n\nJoint arrangements are entities in which A.P. Moller - Maersk, according to contractual agreements with one or more other parties, has joint control. The arrangements are classified as joint ventures, if the contracting parties' rights are limited to net assets in the separate legal entities, and as joint operations, if the parties have direct and unlimited rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the arrangement.\n\nEntities in which A.P. Moller - Maersk exercises a significant but non-controlling influence are considered associated companies. A significant influence is usually achieved by directly or indirectly owning or controlling 20-50% of the voting rights. Agreements and other circumstances are considered when assessing the degree of influence.\n\nConsolidation is performed by summarising the financial statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries in accordance with A.P. Moller - Maersk's accounting policies. Intra-group income and expenses, shareholdings, dividends, intra-group balances and gains on intra-group transactions are eliminated. Unrealised gains on transactions with associated companies and joint arrangements are eliminated in proportion to A.P. Moller - Maersk's owner ship share. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way unless they indicate impairment.\n\nNon-controlling interests' share of profit/loss for the year and of equity in subsidiaries is included as part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's profit and equity respectively but shown as separate items.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in USD, the functional currency of the parent company. In the translation to the presentation currency for subsidiaries, associates or joint arrangements with functional currencies other than USD, the total comprehensive income is translated into USD at average exchange rates, and the balance sheet is translated at the exchange rates as at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising from such translations are recognised",

For A.P. Moller - Maersk's principal shipping activities, the functional currency is typically USD. This means, among other things, that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and, hence, depreciation and amortisation, are maintained in USD from the date of acquisition. For other activities, including container terminal activities and land-based logistics activities, the functional currency is generally the local currency of the country in which such activities are performed, unless circumstances suggest a different currency is appropriate.\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary items in foreign currencies not settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate as at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the income statement as financial income or expenses.\n\nShare of profit/loss in associated companies and joint ventures is recognised net of tax and corrected for the share of unrealised intra-group gains and losses. The item also comprises any impairment losses for such investments and their reversal.\n\n## Statement of comprehensive income\n\nOther comprehensive income consists of gains and losses not recognised in the income statement, including exchange rate adjustments arising from the translation from functional currency to presentation currency, fair value adjustments of other equity investments (at FVOCI), cash flow hedges, forward points and currency basis spread as well as actuarial gains/losses on defined benefit plans, etc. A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of other comprehensive income in associated companies and joint ventures is also included.\n\nOn disposal or discontinuation of an entity, A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of the accumulated exchange rate adjustments relating to the relevant entity with a functional currency other than USD, is reclassified to the\n\nincome statement. Accumulated value adjustments of equity instruments classified as equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income will remain in equity upon disposal.\n\nOther comprehensive income includes current and deferred income tax to the extent that the items recognised in other comprehensive income are taxable or deductible.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nInvestments in associated companies and joint ventures are recognised as A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of the equity value inclusive of goodwill less any impairment losses. Goodwill is an integral part of the value of associated companies and joint ventures and is therefore subject to an impairment test together with the investment. Impairment losses are reversed to the extent the original value is considered recoverable.\n\nEquity instruments etc., including shares, bonds and similar securities, are recognised on the trading date at fair value, and subsequently measured at the quoted market price for listed securities and at estimated fair value for non-listed securities. Fair value adjustments from equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) remain in equity upon disposal. Dividends are recognised in the income statement.\n\nInventories mainly consist of bunker, spare parts not qualifying for property, plant and equipment, and other consumables. Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value, primarily according to the FIFO method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes direct and indirect production costs. Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value, plus any direct transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For loans and other receivables, write-downs are made for expected losses based on specific individual or group assessments. For trade receivables, the loss allowance is measured by the simplified approach according to IFRS 9, applying a provision matrix to calculate the expected lifetime losses. The provision matrix includes an impairment for non-due receivables.\n\n## Climate-related risks\n\nWhen preparing the consolidated financial statements, Management considers climate-related risks, where these could potentially impact reported amounts materially. The areas in which A.P. Moller - Maersk has assessed climaterelated risks at the end of 2023 are included in the individual notes outlined below:\n\n## Note 3.2 - Property, plant and equipment\n\n## New financial reporting requirements\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has not yet adopted new or amended accounting standards and requirements that have not yet become effective. The changes to IFRS Accounting Standards are not expected to have any significant impact on recognition and measurement.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes\n\nIn May 2023, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes, which provides temporary relief from the requirement to recognise and disclose deferred taxes arising from enacted or substantively enacted tax law that implements the Pillar Two Model Rules published by the OECD, including tax law that implements qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes. The amendments have been adopted by the EU and the company has applied this relief.\n\nDeferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction: The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exception so that it no longer applies to transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences such as leases and decommissioning liabilities. The amendments have no material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.",

Moller - Maersk\n\nAnnual Report 2023\n\n## Note 1.2 Significant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires Management to make estimates and judgements on an ongoing basis, and to form assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Management forms its estimates and judgements based on historical experience, independent advice, external data points as well as on in-house specialists and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nIn its assumption setting, Management deals with various aspects of uncertainty. One aspect of uncertainty is the assessment of control over investments classified as associates, joint ventures and subsidiaries, where the assessment forms the basis for classification. Another aspect is measurement uncertainty, where Management makes assumptions that derive the value of recognised assets and liabilities. These assumptions concern the timing and amount of future cash flows as well as the risks inherent in these.\n\nIn certain areas, the outcome of business plans, including ongoing negotiations with external parties to execute those plans or the outcome of negotiations to settle claims that are raised against A.P. Moller - Maersk, is highly uncertain. Therefore, assumptions may change, or the outcome may differ in the coming years, which could require a material upward or downward adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities.\n\nThe areas - and their related impact - in which A.P. Moller - Maersk is particularly exposed to material uncertainty over the carrying amounts as at the end of 2023 are included in the individual notes as outlined below:\n\n| Note     | Key accounting estimates and judgements                                              | Estimate /  Judgement   | Impact   |\n|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------|\n| Note 2.2 | Vessel sharing agreements (cost-sharing arrangements) estimates                      | Estimate                |          |\n| Note 3.1 | Cash-generating unit determination                                                   | Judgement               |          |\n| Note 3.1 | Impairment testing key assumptions                                                   | Estimate                |          |\n| Note 3.2 | Useful life and residual value estimates                                             | Estimate                |          |\n| Note 3.7 | Provisions for legal disputes assumptions                                            | Estimate                |          |\n| Note 5.1 | Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions       | Estimate                |          |\n| Note 5.5 | Operations in countries with limited access to repatriating surplus cash assumptions | Judgement               |          |\n\n## Level of potential impact to the consolidated financial statements:\n\nLow\n\nMedium\n\nHigh\n\n## Operating\n\n## 2. profit\n\nThe Group's businesses are managed from the perspective of the operating segments, and selected financial data is presented in this section on this basis.

Revenue for leasing out the vessels on time charter agreement, where the Group acts as a lessor, is based on the customer location. For non-current assets (e.g. terminals), which cannot be easily moved, geographical location is where the assets are located. For all other assets, geographical location is based on the legal ownership. These assets consist mainly of vessels and containers registered in China, Denmark, Singapore and the USA.",

Moller - Maersk's character as an integrated container logistics business and is in line with the internal management reporting. The reportable segments are as follows:\n\n| Ocean                          | Global container shipping activities,   including strategic transhipment hubs                                                                                               |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Logistics   & Services         | Integrated transportation, fulfilment  and management solutions, including  landside and air transportation as well  as warehousing and supply chain   management offerings |\n| Terminals                      | Gateway terminal activities                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Towage &   Maritime   Services | Towage and related marine activities,  production of reefer containers,   providing offshore supply service   and trading and other businesses                              |\n\nOperating segments have not been aggregated. The reportable segments comprise:\n\n## Ocean\n\n## Ocean activities\n\nActivities under Maersk Line and Alian\u00e7a and the retired brands Hamburg S\u00fcd and Sealand - A Maersk company, with ocean container freight being the main revenue stream. Ocean container freight is defined as the costper-weight measure of transporting goods on board a container vessel across the ocean, including demurrage and detention, terminal handling, documentation services, container services as well as container storage.\n\n## Hub activities\n\nActivities under the APM Terminals brand-generating revenue by providing port services only in major transhipment ports such as Maasvlakte-II, Algeciras, Tangier, TangierMed II, Port Said, and joint ventures in Salalah and Tanjung Pelepas. The respective terminals are included under the\n\nOcean segment, as the primary purpose of those ports is to provide transhipment services to A.P. Moller - Maersk's Ocean business, whereas third-party volumes sold in those locations are considered secondary.\n\n## Maersk Energy Markets\n\nSourcing marine fuels for A.P. Moller - Maersk's fleet and third-party customers, in addition to operating a fuel infrastructure in key bunker ports.\n\n## Logistics & Services\n\nManaged by Maersk\n\nService the supply chain with Lead Logistics (Supply Chain Management and 4PL), Cold Chain logistics and Custom Services, enabling customers to control or outsource part of or all their supply chain.\n\n## Fulfilled by Maersk\n\nActivities such as Contract Logistics (Warehousing, Distribution and Depot) and e-commerce supporting integrated fulfilment solutions, to improve customer consolidation.\n\n## Transported by Maersk\n\nIntegrated transportation solutions supported by Landside Transportation (Intermodal and Intercontinental Rail), Value Protect, Air & Less Than Container Load (LCL), Full Container Load (FCL) and Maersk Air Cargo, to facilitate supply chain control across A.P. Moller - Maersk.\n\n## Terminals\n\nTerminals activities\n\nActivities in ports fully or partially controlled by the APM Terminals brand, with the main revenue stream being port activities not considered a hub activity as described above.\n\n## Towage & Maritime Services\n\nTowage activities\n\nActivities under the Svitzer brand, a provider of offshore towage and marine services.\n\nMaersk Container Industry\n\nManufacturer that produces reefer containers.\n\n## Maersk Supply Service\n\nProvides marine services and integrated solutions to the energy sector worldwide with a large fleet of anchor handling tug supply vessels and subsea support vessels. The company was divested in May 2023.\n\n## Other businesses\n\nConsists of Maersk Growth, Maersk Training and other services to the maritime industry.\n\n## Unallocated items and inter-segment revenue\n\nMost Group-related costs in A.P. Moller - Maersk's corporate functions are not included in the reportable segments. These functions are reported as unallocated items. Revenue between segments is limited, except for the Terminals segment, where a large part of the services is delivered to the Ocean segment as well as the sale of containers from Maersk Container Industry to the Ocean segment.\n\n## Income statement\n\nRevenue for all businesses is recognised when the performance obligation has been satisfied, which happens upon transfer of control to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods and services.\n\nRevenue from shipping activities is recognised over time as the performance obligation is satisfied, including a share of revenue from incomplete voyages at the balance sheet date. Invoiced revenue related to an estimated proportion of remaining voyage time and activities at the destination port is deferred. Percentage of completion is calculated as the number of days of a voyage as a percentage of the total number of days a voyage is estimated to last. Detention and demurrage fees are recognised over time up until the time of the customer's late return or pick-up of containers.\n\nRevenue from terminal operations and towing activities is recognised upon completion of the service. In container terminals operated under certain restrictive terms of pricing and service, etc., the value of tangible assets constructed on behalf of the concession grantor is recognised as revenue during the construction.\n\nRevenue from most freight forwarding activities is recognised over time.\n\nRevenue from the sale of goods is recognised upon the transfer of control to the buyer.\n\nNo significant element of financing is deemed present as sales are made with a credit term of 20-45 days, which is consistent with market practice. Revenue from sales is recognised based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated volume discounts. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.",

In connection with a possible takeover offer, neither the Executive Board nor the Board of Directors will receive special remuneration. Fees and remuneration do not include pension. Key management comprises of the Executive Board, Board of Directors, and other key management personnel.\n\nTotal fees paid to other key management personnel in 2022 was USD 1.9m, comprising short-term employee benefits of USD 1.8m and long-term share-based incentives of USD 0.1.

Moller - Maersk mainly consist of transaction advice, accounting and tax-related services.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nVessel-sharing agreements (cost-sharing arrangements) Vessel-sharing agreements in shipping require that some vessels are committed towards specific service routes. The committed vessel's capacity is then shared with one or more container shipping providers in proportion to each party's contribution to the joint service. In practice, it is not always possible to provide tonnage precisely as\n\nagreed in the sharing arrangements, therefore financial settlement often takes place on the basis of relative capacity over/under-utilised on a monthly basis or other mutually agreed cycle. At A.P. Moller - Maersk, these capacity adjustments are settled as close to actual costs incurred as possible based on market rates applicable at that time.",

Invested capital\n\nInvested capital is primarily made up of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets. The intangible assets mainly consist of goodwill, terminal and concession rights and customer relationships. Goodwill arises when the Group acquires a business and pays a higher amount than the fair value of its net assets, primarily due to the synergies the Group expects to create. Goodwill is not amortised, but is subject to annual impairment reviews.\n\nFor further details refer to 'Significant accounting estimates and judgements' within note 3.1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n|   3.1 | Intangible assets  .............................................................................   |   75 |\n|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|\n|   3.2 | Property, plant and equipment  .........................................................           |   77 |\n|   3.3 | Right-of-use assets  .........................................................................     |   79 |\n|   3.4 | Acquisition/sale of subsidiaries and activities  ......................................            |   80 |\n|   3.5 | Term deposits and Other receivables, non-current ................................                  |   82 |\n|   3.6 | Assets held for sale or distribution  .....................................................        |   82 |\n|   3.7 | Provisions  ...................................................................................... |   83 |",

Moller - Maersk brands. Existing brands were retired during Q1 2023, resulting in the recognition of impairment losses of the full carrying amount of each respective retired brand on the balance sheet. Total impairment losses related to the retirement of brands in 2023 recognised in the income statement is USD 299m, of which USD 297m is within Ocean and USD 2m is within Logistics & Services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\n\n## Significant accounting judgements\n\nDetermination of cash-generating units Judgement is applied in the determination of cashgenerating units to which goodwill is allocated for impairment testing and in the selection of methodologies and assumptions applied in impairment tests.\n\nThe determination of cash-generating units differs based on the business area. Ocean operates its fleet of container vessels and hub terminals in an integrated net work. Consequently, the Ocean activities are tested for impairment as a single cash-generating unit.\n\nLogistics & Services, including intermodal activities, is considered a single cash-generating unit. Management views the Logistics & Services products as an integrated network, with the activities tested for impairment as a single cash-generating unit.\n\nIn Terminals, each terminal is considered an individual cash-generating unit for impairment tests, except when the capacity is managed as a portfolio.\n\nTowage & Maritime Services includes towage activities made up of two separate cash-generating units as well as several individual businesses, including Maersk Container Industry, which are each considered one cash-generating unit.\n\n## Significant accounting estimates\n\nImpairment - assessment inputs\n\nThe recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit is determined based on the higher of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell. The estimated value in use is calculated using certain key assumptions for the expected future cash flows and applied discount factor.\n\nCurrent market values for vessels, etc., are estimated using acknowledged brokers.\n\nThe cash flow projections are based on financial budgets and business plans. In nature, these projections are subject to judgement and estimates that are uncertain, though based on experience and external sources where available. Centralised processes and involvement of corporate functions ensure that indices and data sources are selected consistently while observing differences in risks and other circumstances.\n\nThe discount rates applied reflect the time value of money as well as the specific risks related to the underlying cash flows, i.e., project and/or country-specific risk premium. Further, any uncertainties reflecting past performance and possible variations in the amount or timing of the projected cash flows are generally reflected in the discount rates.\n\n## Impairment - key assumptions applied\n\nThe outcome of impairment tests is subject to estimates of the future development of freight rates and volumes, oil prices and the discount rates applied. Management determines these key assumptions by considering past experience as well as market analysis and future expectations based on supply and demand trends.\n\nFurther, the value in use calculation is highly sensitive to the terminal growth rate, which is determined based on the future expected economic growth rate, and replacement CAPEX during the terminal period, which is determined based on Management's plans and expectations for the future.\n\nThe future development in freight rates is a significant factor impacting the Ocean segment in particular and is influenced by regional and global economic environments, trade patterns, and by industry-specific trends in respect of capacity supply and demand. Freight rates have deteriorated throughout 2023 as a result of the pronounced market normalisation and are expected to face continued pressure for the next 1-2 years.\n\nThe future development of oil prices is also uncertain and is a significant factor impacting accounting estimates across A.P. Moller - Maersk, either directly or indirectly. Ocean is directly impacted by the bunker oil price, where the competitive landscape determines the extent to which the development is reflected in the freight rates charged to the customer. Bunker consumption is expected to continue to decline compared to 2023, driven by fleet outsourcing and efficiency improvements.\n\nLogistics & Services is impacted by rates and volumes across the Logistics & Services product lines, particularly in the air and haulage business. The future growth and productivity of the Fulfilled by Maersk product range is also considered a key assumption as volumes are sensitive to the development of the global economy. Management considers both the future economic outlook in key regions, namely North America and Europe, as well as expected synergies from completed acquisitions when determining the growth and productivity of Fulfilled by Maersk.\n\nTerminals located in oil-producing countries, e.g., Nigeria and Brazil, are indirectly impacted by the development in oil prices and the consequences for the respective countries' economies, which not only affects volumes handled in the terminals, but also foreign exchange rates. Continued economic deterioration and a lack of cash\n\nrepatriation opportunities in certain oil-producing countries could also put pressure on the carrying amounts of individual terminals. The other key sensitivities impacting Terminals include container moves, revenue and cost per move, and local port rates, all of which are impacted by the local economic outlook and competition, as well as concession right extensions and the discount rate applied.\n\nInflation is also expected to continue to have a high impact across A.P. Moller - Maersk in 2024, impacting both the discount rate and terminal growth rates.\n\nImpairment - results of impairment assessments The Ocean cash flow projection is based on the forecast as per Q3 2023, covering the five-year business plan for 2024-28. Management applied an assumption of growth in volumes based on a calculated terminal value with growth equal to 2.7% (2.5%) p.a. In the annual impairment test carried out in November 2023, a pre-tax discount rate of 9.8% (9.2%) p.a. was applied. The impairment test showed headroom between the value in use and the carrying amount. The major part of the carrying amount is comprised of vessels. Management is of the opinion that the assumptions applied are sustainable.\n\nThe Group's most significant goodwill component relates to the Logistics & Services segment. The annual impairment test is based on the estimated value in use from the five-year business plan for 2024-28, where the volume and improved margin growth assumptions, which are region-specific, reflect the current expectations for the relevant period. The applied terminal growth is 2.7% (2.0%). A discount rate of 9.0% (8.4%) p.a. before tax or 8.8% (8.2%) p.a. after tax was applied. The impairment test showed headroom from the value in use to the carrying amount. Management is of the opinion that the assumptions applied are sustainable.\n\nIn Terminals, Management assesses indicators of impairment including decreasing volumes and based on these indicators, estimates the recoverable amounts of the individual terminals whereby impairment indicators exist. Management also tests for impairment of the CGUs to which goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets are allocated. The cash flow projections for each terminal cover the concession period and extension options deemed likely to be exercised. The growth rates assumed reflect current market expectations for the relevant period, and the discount rates applied are between",

The impairment tests considered fair value less cost of disposal compared to the carrying amount and resulted in impairment losses of USD 134m across multiple terminals in 2023, of which USD 94m relates to a CGU in the Mediterranean, caused by lower-than-expected volumes, and is primarily related to equipment. Impairment losses of an immaterial amount across two terminals was recognised in 2022 as well as USD 350m on Terminals' minority stake in Global Ports Investments (GPI), which was sold in 2022. For more information on fair value determination, refer to Note 4.6 Financial instruments by category.\n\nImpairment - key assumptions sensitivity Using the discount rate as of 31 December 2023 and keeping all other assumptions constant, the Ocean CGU showed headroom of USD 3.9bn between the value in use and the carrying amount. The following changes in assumptions reflect the related impact on the value in use and thus the headroom for the Ocean CGU. The sensitivities are prepared with all other assumptions kept constant.\n\n| Key Ocean CGU assumption                             | Assumption   | Change       | Effect on value in use   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| Growth in terminal period                            | 2.7%         | +/- 0.5 ppts | USD 2.9bn                |\n| Discount rate p.a. before tax as of 31 December 2023 | 9.2%         | +/- 0.5 ppts | USD 3.4bn                |\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nIntangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. For container terminals operated under certain restrictive price and service conditions, etc., concessional rights to collect usage charges are included under intangible assets. The cost includes the present value of minimum payments under concession agreements and the cost of property, plant and equipment constructed on behalf of the grantor of a concession. The rights are amortised from the commencement of operations over the concession period. The concession period ranges from 10 to 34 years, with an average of 17 years.\n\nGoodwill and terminal rights have indefinite useful lives while all other classes have definite lives. Intangible assets regarding acquired customer relationships and technology are amortised over a useful life of 10-24 years and 5-10 years, respectively. Internally developed IT software is amortised over a useful life of 5 years.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds the higher of the estimated value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Goodwill is attributed to cash- generating units on acquisition and impaired before other assets. Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment if there is an indication of impairment.

When an asset's useful life changes, Management revises the estimates for individual assets or groups of assets with similar characteristics due to factors such as quality of maintenance and repair, technical development, or environmental requirements. Management has also considered the impact of decarbonisation and climate- related risks on the useful lives of existing assets. Such risks include new climate-related legislation restricting the use of certain assets, new technology demanded by climate-related legislation and the increase in restoration costs for terminal sites due to new and/or more comprehensive policies. The useful lives of vessels and related assets that operate on bunker fuel have been considered in conjunction with the net zero by 2040 target.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the useful life at an estimated residual value. The useful lives of new assets are typically as follows:\n\n| Vessels, etc.                                             | 20-25 years                                   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Containers, etc.                                          | 15 years                                      |\n| Buildings                                                 | 10-50 years                                   |\n| Terminal infrastructure                                   | 10-30 years or concession  period, if shorter |\n| Warehouses and related   infrastructure                   | 5-25 years, or lease term,  if shorter        |\n| Aircraft and related   components                         | 3-30 years                                    |\n| Plant and machinery, cranes  and other terminal equipment | 5-25 years                                    |\n| Other operating equipment,  fixtures, etc.                | 3-7 years                                     |\n\nResidual values of vessels are difficult to estimate given their long useful lives, the uncertainty of future economic conditions, the market for conventional fuel vessels and the uncertainty of future steel prices, which is considered the main determinant of the residual value. Additionally, the acceleration of development of vessels with a lower carbon footprint may generate downward pressure on the market for second-hand conventional fuel vessels. Generally, the residual values of vessels are initially estimated at 10% of the purchase price excluding dry-docking costs.\n\nEstimated useful lives and residual values are reassessed on a regular basis.\n\nThe cost of an asset is divided into separate components, which are depreciated separately if the useful life of the individual component differs. Dry-docking costs are recognised in the carrying amount of vessels when incurred and depreciated over the period until the next dry-docking.\n\nThe cost of assets constructed by A.P. Moller - Maersk includes directly attributable expenses. For assets with a long construction period, borrowing costs during the construction period from specific as well as general borrowings are attributed to cost. In addition, the cost includes the net present value of estimated costs of removal and restoration.",

In some cases, the leasing agreements comprise purchase options exercisable by the Group and options for extending the lease term. The Group also enters into concession agreements that provide the right-to-use some existing infrastructure or land as required to carry out the terminal business.\n\nTo optimise lease costs during the contract period, the Group sometimes provides residual value guarantees in relation to equipment leases. At the end of 2023, the expected residual values were reviewed if these reflect the actual residual values achieved on comparable assets and expectations about future prices. At 31 December 2023, USD 226m (USD 226m) is expected to be payable and is included in the measurement of the lease liabilities.\n\nLeases to which A.P. Moller - Maersk is committed, but for which the lease term has not yet commenced, have an undiscounted value of USD 2.6bn (USD 1.6bn). They comprise approx. 35 contracts commencing in 2024-2026.\n\nCertain terminal concession agreements contain variable payment terms that are linked to future performance, i.e., number of containers handled. Such payments are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the condition that triggers those payments occurs.\n\nTotal cash outflow from leases was USD 5.2bn (USD 5.1bn), of which USD 3.2bn (USD 3.1) relates to repayment of lease liabilities, USD 1.4bn (USD 1.5bn) to other lease expenses and USD 563m (USD 518m) to interest expenses.\n\nLease liabilities are disclosed in notes 4.2 and 4.5.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nRight-of-use assets are mainly leased vessels, containers, concession arrangements and real estate property. Lease contracts for vessels and containers are typically made for fixed periods of about five years, but may have extension options as described together with lease liabilities. Concession arrangements and real estate contracts are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of terms and conditions.\n\nLeases are recognised as a right-of-use asset with a corresponding lease liability at the date on which the leased asset is available for use. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straightline basis as an expense in the income statement.",

Identifiable intangible assets are recognised if they arise from a contractual right or can otherwise be separately identified. The difference between the fair value of the acquisition cost and the fair value of acquired identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value and any subsequent changes to contingent consideration are recognised as financial income or financial expense in the income statement. If contingent consideration is settled by issuing a predetermined number of shares, the contingent consideration is classified as equity and is subsequently not remeasured at fair value. Transaction costs are recognised as operating costs as they are incurred.\n\nWhen A.P. Moller - Maersk ceases to have control of a subsidiary, the value of any retained investment is remeasured at fair value, and the value adjustment is recognised in the income statement as a gain/loss on the sale of non-current assets. The difference between sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the subsidiary is recognised in the income statement including fair value of contingent consideration at the time of sale.

Svitzer is classified as held for sale or distribution and presented separately in the balance sheet. Comparative figures have not been restated. No gains or losses resulting from the fair value measurement of Svitzer have been recognised. Svitzer's results continue to be included in the Towage & Maritime Services segment and are included in note 2.1 Segment information as such.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAssets held for sale are recognised when the carrying amount of an individual non-current asset, or disposal group of assets, is recovered principally through a sales transaction rather than through continued use. Assets are classified as held for sale when activities to carry out a sale have been initiated, when the activities are available for immediate sale in their present condition, and when the activities are expected to be disposed of within 12 months. Liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities.\n\nAssets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount immediately before classification as held for sale and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment tests are performed immediately before classification as held for\n\nsale. Non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised while classified as held for sale. Measurement of deferred tax and financial assets and liabilities is unchanged.\n\nWhen an asset or a disposal group has been classified as held for sale or distribution, but the requirements are no longer met, the assets and related liabilities ceases to be classified as held for sale. The cessation of the classification as held for sale will be reflected in the period in which the change of circumstances has occurred. Comparative figures are not restated, and any adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities previously classified as held for sale are recognised in the period in which the circumstances have changed.",

Payment of dividends is expected to take place on 19 March 2024. Payment of dividends to shareholders does not trigger taxes to A.P. Moller - Maersk.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nEarnings per share is calculated as A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' share of the profit for the year divided by the average number of shares outstanding (of DKK 1,000 each), excluding A.P. Moller - Maersk's holding of treasury shares. Diluted earnings per share are adjusted for the dilutive effect of the average number of restricted shares, performance shares and share options outstanding as issued by the parent company.\n\nEquity includes total comprehensive income for the year comprising the profit for the year and other comprehensive income. Proceeds on the purchase and sale of treasury shares and dividend from such shares are recognised in equity.\n\nThe translation reserve is comprised of A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of accumulated exchange rate differences arising on translation from functional currency into presentation currency. The reserve for other equity investments is comprised of accumulated changes in the fair value of equity investments (at FVOCI), net of tax. Reserves for hedges includes the accumulated fair value change of derivatives qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting, less amounts already reclassified to the income statement or transferred as basis adjustments, net of tax, as well as forward points and currency basis spread.\n\n## Note 4.2  Borrowings and lease liability reconciliation\n\n|                                       | Net debt   31 December   | Cash flows                | Cash flows   |              |      | Non-cash changes                              |                                  |         | Net debt   31 December   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|--------------|------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------|--------------------------|\n|                                       | 2022                     | From financing activities | Other        | Addi-  tions |      | Dis posals Transfers,  assets  held for  sale | Foreign   exchange  move-  ments | Other 1 | 2023                     |\n| Borrowings:                           |                          |                           |              |              |      |                                               |                                  |         |                          |\n| Bank and other  credit institutions   | 1,053                    | -88                       | -3           | 3            | -    | -                                             | 8                                | -       | 973                      |\n| Issued bonds 2                        | 2,976                    | 308                       | -            | -            | -    | -                                             | 53                               | 56      | 3,393                    |\n| Total borrowings                      | 4,029                    | 220 3                     | -3           | 3            | -    | -                                             | 61                               | 56      | 4,366                    |\n| Classified as  non-current            | 3,774                    |                           |              |              |      |                                               |                                  |         | 4,169                    |\n| Classified as   current               | 255                      |                           |              |              |      |                                               |                                  |         | 197                      |\n| Leases:                               |                          |                           |              |              |      |                                               |                                  |         |                          |\n| Lease liabilities                     | 11,614                   | -3,226                    | 3            | 2,268 4      | -241 | -56                                           | 84                               | 2       | 10,448                   |\n| Classified as  non-current            | 8,582                    |                           |              |              |      |                                               |                                  |         | 7,798                    |\n| Classified as   current               | 3,032                    |                           |              |              |      |                                               |                                  |         | 2,650                    |\n| Total borrowings  and leases          | 15,643                   | -3,006                    | -            | 2,271        | -241 | -56                                           | 145                              | 58      | 14,814                   |\n| Derivatives hedge  of borrowings, net | 532                      | -46                       | -            | -            | -    | -                                             | -53                              | -81     | 352                      |\n\n- 1 Other includes fair value changes and amortisation of fees.\n- 2  Of the total issued bonds at 31 December 2023, USD 1.3bn are green bonds primarily used to finance the construction of green methanol vessels.\n\nThe maturity analysis of lease liabilities is disclosed in note 4.5.",

Subsequently, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, whereby transaction costs and any premium or discount are recognised as financial expenses over the term of the liabilities. Fixed interest loans subject to fair value hedge accounting are measured at amortised cost with an adjustment for the fair value of the hedged interest component.\n\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term, at the interest rate implicit in the lease, or at A.P. Moller - Maersk's incremental borrowing rate (IBR). A.P. Moller - Maersk's IBR reflects the Group's credit risk, leased amount, and contract duration, as well as the nature and quality of the asset's security and economic environment in which the leased assets operate. To determine the IBR, where possible, A.P. Moller - Maersk uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point, with adjustments to reflect changes in financing conditions since that financing was received. Where such financing is not available, A.P. Moller - Maersk uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk- free interest rate adjusted by credit risk and specific risks faced by the lessee such as asset type, geographical risks, etc.\n\nSubsequently, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost with each lease payment allocated between the repayment of the liability and financing cost. The finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period, using the IBR that was used to discount the lease payments.\n\n## The following lease payments are included in the net present value:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable\n- \u00b7 variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate\n- \u00b7 amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees\n- \u00b7 the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.\n\nExtension and termination options in lease contracts are included in contracts where it is reasonably certain that A.P. Moller - Maersk will exercise the options. These terms are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts. In determining the lease term, Management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option or to not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the lease will be extended or not terminate. Most of the extension and termination options held are exercisable only by A.P. Moller - Maersk and not by the respective lessor. This assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment, and which is within the control of the lessee. Where A.P. Moller - Maersk will probably exercise specific purchase options, those options are included in the measurement of the lease liability with corresponding right-of-use asset depreciated over the asset's useful life rather than lease term.",

Generally, the pension plans within the Group are defined contribution plans, where contributions are recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis. A number of entities have defined benefit plans, in which retirement benefits are based on length of service and salary level. To a limited extent, these defined benefit plans also include payment of medical expenses, etc.\n\nIn 2024, the Group expects to pay contributions totalling USD 17m (USD 25m) to funded defined benefit plans. 85% of the Group's defined benefit liabilities are in the UK. All of the plans in the UK are funded. Although all of the UK plans are now closed to new entrants, active members in the two largest plans continue to accrue new benefits. The smaller UK plans are all closed to new accruals, although a salary link remains in some of the plans. Overall, the plans have an average duration of 11 years, and approximately 60% of the obligation is related to\n\npensioner members.\n\nAs well as being subject to the risks of falling interest rates, which would increase the obligation, poor asset returns and pensioners living longer than anticipated, the Group is also subject to the risk of higher-than- expected inflation. This is because many pension benefits, particularly in the UK plans, increase in line with inflation although some minimum and maximum limits apply.\n\n|                              |   31 December |   31 December |   31 December |   31 December |\n|------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Life expectancy              |        2023   |        2043   |        2022   |        2042   |\n| 65-year-old male in the UK   |          21.7 |          23.3 |          22   |          23.5 |\n| 65-year-old female in the UK |          24.1 |          25.8 |          24.3 |          25.8 |\n\nThe sensitivity of the liabilities and pension costs to the key assumptions are as follows:\n\n| Sensitivities for key assumptions in the UK Factors   | 'Change in liability'                  |   Increase 2023 |   Decrease 2023 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Discount rate                                         | Increase/(decrease) by 25 basis points |             -42 |              44 |\n| Inflation rate                                        | Increase/(decrease) by 25 basis points |              19 |             -24 |\n| Life expectancy                                       | Increase/(decrease) by one year        |              62 |             -61 |\n\n| Specification of plan assets   | UK    | Other 2023   | Total 2023   | UK 2022   | Other 2022   | Total 2022   |\n|--------------------------------|-------|--------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                | 2023  |              |              |           |              |              |\n| Insurance contracts            | 1,255 | 54           | 1,309        | 1,172     | 54           | 1,226        |\n| Shares                         | 21    | 14           | 35           | 52        | 15           | 67           |\n| Government bonds               | 225   | 10           | 235          | 130       | 37           | 167          |\n| Corporate bonds                | 68    | 7            | 75           | 53        | 176          | 229          |\n| Real estate                    | 10    | 5            | 15           | 8         | 6            | 14           |\n| Other assets                   | 73    | 18           | 91           | 168       | 13           | 181          |\n| Fair value 31 December         | 1,652 | 108          | 1,760        | 1,583     | 301          | 1,884        |\n\nRates of life expectancy reflect the most recent mortality investigations, and in line with market practice an allowance is made for future improvements in life expectancy. The Group assumes that future improvements will be in line with the latest projections of 1.25% for all UK plans.\n\nThe liabilities are calculated using assumptions that are the Group's best estimate of future experience bearing in mind the requirements of IAS 19.\n\nThe Group's plans are funded in accordance with applicable local legislation. In the UK, each plan has a Trustee Board that is required to act in the best interests of plan members. Every three years, a formal valuation of the plan's liabilities is carried out using a prudent basis, and if the plan is in deficit, the Trustees agree with the Group or the sponsoring employer on a plan for recovering that deficit.\n\nAround 80% of the UK liabilities are now covered by insurance policies. Therefore, movement in the liabilities due to change in assumptions would equally impact the assets value related to the buy-in policies, resulting in a reduced movement in the overall balance sheet position.",

In most of the UK plans, any surplus remaining after the last member dies may be returned to the Group. However, the Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund (MNRPF), and the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund (MNOPF) contributions paid by the Group are not refundable in any circumstance and the balance sheet liability reflects an adjustment for any agreed deficit recovery contributions in excess of deficit determined using the Group's assumptions. In 2023, an adjustment of USD 11m (USD 3m) was applied in this respect.\n\nOther than the insurance contracts and a small proportion of other holdings, the plan assets held by the Group are quoted investments.\n\n| Change in net liability                                          | Present   value of   obligations   | Fair value   of plan   assets   | Adjust- ments   | Net   liability   | Of which: UK   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| 1 January 2023                                                   | 1,875                              | 1,884                           | 66              | 57                | -121           |\n| Current service costs, administration costs, etc.                | 57                                 | -6                              | -

In general, the contributions to the schemes are based on man hours worked or cargo tonnage handled, or a combination of these.\n\nFor the defined benefit pension plans, the Group has joint and several liabilities to fund total obligations. While the welfare/medical plans are by nature contribution plans funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. The Group's contributions to the pension and welfare/medical plans in 2023 are estimated at USD 86m (USD 124m) and USD 259m (USD 371m), respectively. The contributions to be paid in 2024 are estimated at USD 82m (USD 125m) for the pension plans and USD 249m (USD 374m) for the welfare/medical plans.\n\nNo reliable basis exists for allocation of the schemes' obligations and plan assets to individual employer participants. For the pension plans where the Group has an interest and there is a deficit, the net obligations for all employers amount to USD 216m (USD 19m). This net obligation is based on the most recent available financial data from the plan's trustees, calculated in accordance with the rules for such actuarial calculation in US GAAP. The deficit in some of the schemes may necessitate increased contributions in the future. Welfare/medical plans are pay-as-you-go and form a part of the Group's US collective bargaining agreements. They cover a limited part of employees' medical costs as occurred.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nPension obligations are the net liabilities of defined benefit obligations and the dedicated assets adjusted for the effect of minimum funding and asset ceiling requirements. Plans with a funding surplus are presented as net assets on the balance sheet. The defined benefit obligations are measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the balance sheet date. Plan assets are measured at fair value. The pension cost charged to the income statement consists of calculated amounts for vested benefits and interest in addition to settlement of gains or losses, etc. Interest on plan assets is calculated at the same rates as used for discounting the obliga tions. Actuarial gains/losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nPension plans where A.P. Moller - Maersk, as part of collective bargaining agreements, participates together with other enterprises - so called multi-employer plans - are treated as other pension plans in the financial statements.

The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.\n\nRisk management is carried out by a central finance department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Group's entities. Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group's profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The sensitivity analyses in the currency risk and interest rate risk sections relate to the position of financial instruments at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses for currency risk and interest rate risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in place at 31 December 2023. Furthermore, it is assumed that the exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses show the effect on profit and equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates and interest rates.\n\nHedges comprise primarily currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives, which are further described in the following sections.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe Group's currency risk relates to the fact that while income from Ocean activities is denominated mainly in USD, the related expenses are incurred in both USD and a wide range of other currencies such as EUR, DKK, CNY, HKD and SGD. As the net income is in USD, this is also the primary financing currency. Income and expenses from other activities are mainly denominated in local currencies, thus reducing the Group's exposure to these currencies.\n\nThe main purpose of hedging the Group's currency risk is to hedge the USD value of the Group's net cash flow and reduce fluctuations in the Group's profit. The Group uses various financial derivatives, including forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. The key aspects of the currency hedging policy are:\n\n- \u00b7 Net cash flows in significant currencies other than USD are hedged using a layered model with a 12-month horizon\n- \u00b7 Significant capital commitments or divestments in currencies other than USD are hedged\n- \u00b7 Most non-USD debt is hedged, however, depending on the asset-liability match and the currency of the generated cash flow.\n\nCurrency derivatives hedge future revenue, operating costs and investments/divestments, and are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income statement and the cost of property, plant and equipment, respectively. There is not any proxy hedging for the currency risk hedging, and therefore the economic relationship between the hedged exposure and the hedge is high. Effectiveness is assessed using the critical terms match approach according to IFRS 9.\n\nHedges of future revenue and operating costs matures within a year (matures within a year). There are no hedges of investments at the end of 2023 (matures within one year).\n\nFor hedges related to operating and investment cash flows, a loss of USD 8m in 2023 (gain of USD 94m) is recognised in other comprehensive income, and the cash flow hedge reserve amounts to a gain of USD 43m at 31 December (gain of USD 51m). For hedges where the cost of hedging is applied, the forward points are recognised in other comprehensive income and transferred with the effective hedge when the hedged transaction occurs. The cost of hedging reserve amounts to USD 0m (USD 0m). There was no ineffectiveness in 2023 (no ineffectiveness).\n\nBesides the designated cash flow hedges in the table, the Group uses derivatives to hedge currency exposures that do not qualify for hedge accounting. These derivatives are classified as fair value through profit or loss. The average FX hedge rates for swaps in cash flow hedge were EUR/USD 1.18 (1.18) and GBP/USD 1.52 (1.52). The average FX hedge rates for swaps in combined fair value hedge were EUR/USD 1.24 (1.24), GBP/USD 1.52 (1.52), USD/NOK 8.25 (8.25) and USD/JPY 119.39 (119.39).",

The Group strives to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks.\n\nInterest rate risk is managed within a range set for the percentage of gross debt carrying fixed interest, net of hedging. The level at 31 December is 41% (43%) excluding IFRS 16 Leases.\n\nA general increase in interest rates by 1 percentage point is estimated, all else being equal, to affect profit before tax and equity, excluding tax effect, positively by approx. USD 134m (positively by USD 215m) and positively by approx. USD 113m (positively by USD 199m), respectively.\n\nThis analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.\n\nThe hedging of the interest rate risk is done by cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The hedging is a mix of fair value hedging, combined fair value hedging and cash flow hedging.\n\nCombined fair value hedging is applied when cross-currency swaps are entered into to hedge the risk of debt denominated in currencies other than USD. Each hedge relationship is split into a fair value hedge, where value changes from market rates are recognised directly in profit or loss, and a cash flow hedge, where the value changes from the exchange rate exposure of the credit margin are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nIneffectiveness from cash flow hedges due to buy-back of issued bonds is recognised in the income statement with a cost of USD 1m (USD 0m).\n\nThe hedges are expected to be highly effective due to the nature of the economic relationship between the exposure and the hedge. The source of ineffectiveness is the credit risk of the hedging instruments. For hedges where the cost of hedging is applied, the change in basis spread is recognised in other comprehensive income and is a time effect during the lifetime of the swap and at maturity amounts to 0. If the hedged transaction is prepaid, the change in basis spread will be recognised in profit or loss as ineffectiveness. The cost of hedging reserve amounts to a gain of USD 7m (gain of USD 15m).",

oil, as the products are bought in larger quantities and stored for processing and re-sale. The oil price risk arising from these oil price exposures is mitigated by entering into commodity derivative agreements. The overall exposure limit is set in the Group's risk policy, defining a maximum net open position for the Group. On 31 December 2023, the Group entered into oil derivative positions as shown in the table.\n\nThe Group's sensitivity to an increase in the oil price of 5% is estimated, all else being equal, to affect profit and equity before tax negatively by approx. USD 24m (negatively by USD 21m), and negatively by USD 24m (negatively USD 21m), respectively. The sensitivities are based on the impact of financial instruments that are outstanding at the balance sheet date.",

To minimise the credit risk, financial vetting is undertaken for all major customers and financial institutions, adequate security is required for commercial counterparties, and credit limits are set for financial institutions and key commercial counterparties.\n\nThe Group applies the simplified approach to providing the expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. In accordance with IFRS 9, non-due trade receivables have also been considered for impairment.\n\nApproximately 50% (31%) of the provision for bad debt is related to trade receivables overdue by more than one year.\n\n## Other financial assets at amortised cost\n\nOther financial assets at amortised cost comprise loans receivable, finance lease receivables and other receivables. These financial assets are considered to have low credit risk, and thus the impairment provision calculated based on 12 months of expected losses is considered immaterial. The financial assets are considered to be low-risk when they have a low risk of default, and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.\n\n## Financial institutions\n\nDeposits and bank balances are primarily held in relationship banks with a credit rating of at least A-. No individual exposure is above 10%. A.P. Moller - Maersk has ISDA agreements for trading of derivatives, under which the Group has a right to net settlement in the event of certain credit events. This results in the credit risk being limited to the net position per counterparty.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\n| Net interest-bearing debt and liquidity reserve      | 2023   | 2022    |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Borrowings                                           | 14,814 | 15,643  |\n| Net interest-bearing debt                            | -4,658 | -12,632 |\n| Cash and bank balances                               | 6,701  | 10,057  |\n| Restricted cash                                      | -1,024 | -1,358  |\n| Term deposits not included in cash and bank balances | 12,693 | 17,615  |\n| Securities                                           | -      | 942     |\n| Undrawn revolving credit facilities > 12 months      | 6,050  | 6,000   |\n| Liquidity reserve 1                                  | 24,420 | 33,256  |\n\nFor information about cash and bank balances in countries with exchange control or other restrictions, refer to note 5.5 Cash flow specifications.\n\nBased on the liquidity reserve, loans for the financing of specific assets, the maturity of outstanding loans, and the current investment profile, the Group's financial resources are deemed satisfactory.\n\nThe average term to maturity of loan facilities in the Group was about five years (about five years) at 31 December 2023.",

At that time, the accumulated gains/losses are transferred to the items in which the hedged trans actions are recognised.\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the value of derivative financial instruments used to hedge the value of recognised financial assets and liabilities is recognised in the income statement together with changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities that can be attributed to the hedging relationship. Currency basis spread and forward points are considered a cost of hedging and recognised in other comprehensive income and deferred in equity until realisation.\n\nThe ineffective portion of hedge transactions and changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments, which do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised in the income statement as financial income or expenses for interest and currency-based instruments, and as other income/costs for oil price hedges and forward freight agreements.",

 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n- Level 2 -  Inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) and\n\nLevel 3 -  Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.\n\nFair value of listed securities is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Non-listed shares and other securities are within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFair value of derivatives is mainly within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated based on observable market data as of the end of the reporting period. A minor amount of crude oil price derivatives is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFair value of level 3 assets and liabilities is primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. A reasonably possible change in the discount rate is not estimated to affect the Group's profit or equity significantly.",

In general, fair value is determined primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Where a market price was available, however, this was deemed to be the fair value.\n\nFair value of listed issued bonds is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value of the remaining borrowing items is within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated based on discounted future cash flows.\n\n## Other equity investments (FVOCI)\n\nThe Group has investments in equity shares of both listed and non-listed companies. The Group holds non-controlling interests (between 0.1% and 15%) in these companies. These investments were irrevocably designated at fair value through OCI as the Group considers these investments to be strategic in nature.\n\n## 5. Other disclosures\n\nGlobal shipping activity is subject to various tax regimes, including tonnage tax which calculates corporate income tax based on the net tonnage of the fleet. These regimes apply to the vast majority of A.P. Moller - Maersk's activities and result in a stable annual tax liability.\n\nGiven that the liability to tonnage tax is not impacted by financial profits and is payable even in loss-making years, the effective tax rate can fluctuate significantly.\n\nFurther, disclosures are given on other statutory information not directly related to the operating activities of the Group.\n\n|   5.1 | Tax and deferred tax  ........................................................................  98    |\n|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   5.2 | Share-based payments  ....................................................................  100       |\n|   5.3 | Commitments   .................................................................................  102  |\n|   5.4 | Contingent liabilities  ........................................................................  103 |\n|   5.5 | Cash flow specifications  ...................................................................  103    |\n|   5.6 | Related parties  ...............................................................................  104 |",

Moller - Maersk generates profits from ocean, air or land-based activities.\n\nThe land-based activities, which are subject to normal corporate income tax, include terminals, logistics, services and shipping agencies through which the Group operate one of the world's most comprehensive port and integrated logistics service networks. The logistics products include transportation, warehousing and distribution including cold storage, customs services and supply chain management services. This expanding land-based activity has prompted the establishment and acquisition of entities in numerous countries.\n\nOn the ocean, A.P. Moller - Maersk moves millions of TEUs every year and operates hundreds of vessels delivering cargo to every corner of the globe, including dry cargo commodities, refrigerated cargo and dangerous cargo. This ocean activity, which represents the vast majority of the Group's current revenues, may be subject to special shipping tax rules, including tonnage and freight taxes.\n\n## Global Minimum Taxation (OECD Pillar Two)\n\nIn an effort to end tax avoidance and to address concerns about the erosion of the global corporate tax base, a global framework for corporate taxation has been formed by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework and is supported by over 135 jurisdictions. One of the key elements is to introduce a global minimum tax rate of 15%, based on group accounting income per jurisdiction.\n\nThe minimum tax rules are designed as a hierarchy of the right to claim income tax. If the income is not subject to a minimum effective tax rate of 15% in the country where it is earned, then the remaining tax payment (top-up tax) can be picked up by another jurisdiction where the Group is active. For the Group, Denmark will add top-up tax if not applied locally as the ultimate parent entity of the Group, A.P. M\u00f8ller Holding A/S, is located in Denmark.\n\nThe Danish implementation of Council Directive (EU) 2022/2523 of 14 December 2022 is effective from 1 January 2024. This means that A.P. Moller - Maersk's income is subject to the minimum tax rules for all jurisdictions via Danish implementation for the financial year 2024 and onwards. It is expected that many jurisdictions will implement similar legislation.\n\nBecause the Danish implementation covers the Group's global activities, it is not expected that other national implementations will have a significant additional impact to the global tax payments of the Group. It may, however, have an impact on the location where potential top-up taxes will be paid.\n\nThree elements are key to understanding how the rules will impact the Group. First, the Group does not set up artificial structures in low-tax jurisdictions for tax purposes or earn significant profits in such jurisdictions, which means that our business structure itself is not impacted significantly by the rules, but some additional tax may become payable where services are provided in low-tax jurisdictions. Second, tax incentives given to capital projects, such as critical infrastructure, will be considered less effective going forward as it will impact the effective tax rate and thereby the basis for potential top-up tax. Third, although the rules exclude 'international shipping income', the definition is more restrictive than the global definitions usually applied under a tax treaty following the OECD Model Tax Convention or under Danish tonnage tax.\n\nAlso, inland transportation is not a part of the international shipping income under the global minimum tax rules. This is relevant for the part of our land transport linked directly to ocean transportation which is recognised as shipping income for tax treatment in the OECD Model Tax Convention. The Group is awaiting further guidance on the application of the shipping income provision from the OECD Secretariat. Contrary to the purpose of the rules, top-up tax could be triggered by the shipping classification in years where shipping net income is negative. Due to the design of tonnage taxation, the Group's effective tax rate fluctuates significantly depending on the yearly results and will also be calculated on a consolidated basis with other activities in the given country in accordance with the global minimum tax rules.\n\nTaking the transitional Safe Harbour regulations into consideration, our analysis shows that no material top-up tax should apply to A.P. Moller - Maersk in 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nJudgement has been applied with respect to A.P. Moller - Maersk's ability to utilise deferred tax assets. Management considers the likelihood of utilisation based on the latest business plans and the recent financial performances of the individual entities. Net deferred tax assets recognised in entities having recognised an accounting loss in either the current or preceding period amount to USD 156m (USD 163m). These assets mainly relate to unused tax losses or deductible temporary differences generated during the construction of terminals, where taxable profits have been generated either in the current period or are expected to be generated within the foreseeable future.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTax comprises an estimate of current and deferred income tax as well as adjustments to previous years taxes. Income tax is tax on taxable profits, and consists of corporation tax, withholding tax of dividends, etc. In addition, tax comprises tonnage tax. Tonnage tax is classified as tax when creditable in, or paid in lieu of, income tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement to the extent that it arises from items recognised in the income statement, including tax on gains on intra-group transactions that have been eliminated in the consolidation.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is not recognised for differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities, where at the time of the transaction neither accounting nor taxable profit/loss is affected, unless the differences arise in a business combination. In addition, no deferred tax is recognised for undistributed earnings in subsidiaries, when A.P. Moller - Maersk controls the timing of dividends. No taxable dividends are currently expected. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that it can be utilised within a foreseeable future.\n\n## Uncertain tax positions\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk is engaged in a number of disputes with tax authorities of varying scope. Appropriate provisions and recognition of uncertain tax positions have been made where the probability of the tax position being upheld in individual cases is considered less than 50%. Claims for which the probability of A.P. Moller - Maersk's tax position being upheld is assessed by Management to be at least 50%, are not provided for. Such risks are instead evaluated on a portfolio basis by geographical area and country risk. Provisions and uncertain tax liabilities are recognised when the aggregated probability of the tax position being upheld is considered less than 50%.",

There were no key management personnel in 2023.\n\n## Share options plan\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk also has a share option plan granted to members of the Executive Board and other key employees. Each share option granted is a call option to buy an existing B share of nominal DKK 1,000 in A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S.\n\nThe share options are granted at an exercise price corresponding to 110% of the average of the market price on the first five trading days following the release of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' most recent Annual Report. Exercise of the share options is contingent upon the option holder still being employed at the time of vesting, which takes place when three years have passed from the date of grant. The share options can then be exercised when at least three years and no more than six years (seven years for share options granted to employees not members of the Executive Board) have passed from the date of grant. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the company's capital structure etc.\n\nThe share options can only be settled in shares. A part of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' holding of treasury B shares will be used to meet the company's obligations in respect of the share option plan.\n\nThe recognised remuneration expense related to the share option plan is USD 10m (USD 11m).\n\nThe average remaining contractual life of the outstanding share options as per 31 December 2023 is 4.4 years (4.6 years) and the range of exercise prices for the outstanding share options as per 31 December 2023 is DKK 7,605 to DKK 25,096 (DKK 7,605 to DKK 25,096).\n\nThe following principal assumptions are used in the 2023 granted share options valuation:\n\n|                                                                                            | Share options granted to members of the   Executive Board and other   key management

to employees of A.P. Moller - Maersk as part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's long-term incentive programme are recognised as remuneration expenses over the vesting period as per the estimated fair value at the grant date and result in a corresponding adjustment to equity.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, A.P. Moller - Maersk revises its estimated number of awards that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions and service conditions. Any impact of the revision is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.",

Some of these involve significant amounts and are subject to considerable uncertainty. Management continuously assesses the risks associated with the cases and disputes, and their likely outcome. It is the opinion of Management that, apart from items recognised in the financial statements, the outcome of these cases and disputes are not probable or cannot be reliably estimated in terms of amount or timing. The Group does not expect these to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe Group is subject to a tax audit in Germany concerning allocation of taxation rights to shipping income between Denmark and Germany as well as to a tax investigation in India concerning a deemed supply of services between Indian GST registrations of A.P. Moller - Maersk in India. The Group is also involved in various other tax disputes including indirect tax disputes, some of which involve significant amounts. Management continuously assesses the risks associated with tax disputes and their likely outcome and considers the risk related to these disputes remote and therefore does not expect these to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThrough participation in a joint taxation scheme with A.P.

Capitalisation of borrowing costs is considered as a non-cash item, and the actual payments of these borrowing costs are included in cash flow from financing.\n\nto repatriate surplus cash is complicated and time consuming. In these countries, Management makes judgements as to whether these cash positions can be recognised as cash and cash equivalents.\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank balances net of bank overdrafts where overdraft facilities form an integral part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's cash management.",

M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.\n\nThe accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for 2023, except for the changes to accounting standards that were effective from 1 January 2023 and were endorsed by the EU. These changes have not had a material impact on the financial statements.\n\nThe accounting policies are furthermore consistent with the accounting policies for the Group's financial statements with the following exceptions:\n\n- \u00b7 Shares in subsidiaries and associated companies are measured at cost or a lower recoverable amount\n- \u00b7 Dividends from subsidiaries and associated companies are recognised as income at the time of declaration unless considered a return of capital in subsidiary\n- \u00b7 No segment information is disclosed\n- \u00b7 Value of granted share options, restricted shares, and performance shares to employees in subsidiaries is expensed directly in the relevant subsidiary. At the time of the grant, the subsidiary settles the amount with A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S and the counter posting is made in equity. At the time of exercising, the proceeds are included in the company's equity.\n\n## New financial reporting requirements\n\nA.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S has not yet adopted new or amended accounting standards and requirements that have not yet become effective and any changes. The changes to IFRS Accounting Standards are not expected to have any significant impact on recognition and measurement.\n\nAmendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes - In May 2023, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes, which provides temporary relief from the requirement to recognise and disclose deferred taxes arising from enacted or substantively enacted tax law that implements the Pillar Two Model Rules published by the OECD, including tax law that implements qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes. The amendments have been adopted by the EU and the company has applied this relief. Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction - The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exception so that it no longer applies to transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences such as leases and decommissioning liabilities. The amendments had no material impact on the company's financial statements.\n\n## Note 1.2 Significant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of the parent company financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements on an ongoing basis, and to form assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Management forms its estimates and judgements based on historical experience, independent advice, external data points, as well as on in-house specialists and on other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nEstimates that are material to the company's financial reporting are made on the determination of impairment of financial non-current assets, including subsidiaries and associated companies. Reference is made to notes 3.1 and 4.3. Management assesses impairment indicators for investments in subsidiaries and associated com panies and in general determines the recoverable amounts consistent with the assumptions described in note 3.1 of the consolidated financial statements.",

The company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.\n\nRisk management is carried out by a central finance department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the company's entities. Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the company's profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The sensitivity analyses in the currency risk and interest rate risk sections relate to the position of financial instruments at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses for currency risk and interest rate risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in place at 31 December 2023. Furthermore, it is assumed that the exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses show the effect on profit and equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates and interest rates.\n\n|                                                                            | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Hedging interest rate risk                                                 | -24    | -25    |\n| Total effective hedging                                                    | -24    | -25    |\n| Ineffectiveness recognised in financial expenses                           | -1     | -      |\n| Total reclassified from equity reserve for hedges                          | -25    | -25    |\n| Derivatives accounted for as held for trading                              |        |        |\n| Currency derivatives recognised directly in financial income/expenses      | 168    | -256   |\n| Interest rate derivatives recognised directly in financial income/expenses | 45     | -142   |\n| Net gains/losses recognised directly in the income statement               | 213    | -398   |\n| Total                                                                      | 188    | -423   |\n\nHedges comprise primarily currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives, which are further described in the following sections.\n\n|                                                  | Fair value   |   Fair value |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Recognised at fair value through profit and loss | 2023         |         2022 |\n| Currency derivatives                             | 37           |           73 |\n| Interest derivatives                             | -            |            9 |\n| Total                                            | 37           |           82 |\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe company's currency risk arises primarily from its treasury activities where financing is obtained and provided in a wide range of currencies other than USD such as EUR, GBP and NOK.\n\nThe main purpose of hedging the company's currency risk is to hedge the USD value of the company's net cash flow and reduce fluctuations in the company's profit. The company uses various financial derivatives, including forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. The key aspects of the currency hedging policy are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Net cash flows in other significant currencies than USD are hedged using a layered model with a 12-month horizon\n- \u00b7 Significant capital commitments or divestments in other currencies than USD are hedged\n- \u00b7 Most non-USD debt is hedged, however, depending on the asset-liability match and the currency of the generated cash flow.\n\nThe company enters into derivatives to hedge currency exposures that do not qualify for hedge accounting. These derivatives are classified as fair value through profit or loss.\n\nAn increase in the USD exchange rate of 10% against all other significant currencies to which the company is exposed is presented in the table.\n\nThe sensitivities are based only on the impact of financial instruments that are outstanding at the balance sheet date and are thus not an expression of the company's total currency risk.\n\n|                  |   Profit before tax |   Profit before tax |   Equity before tax |   Equity before tax |\n|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                  |                2023 |                2022 |                2023 |                2022 |\n| DKK              |                 -30 |                -233 |                 -30 |                -233 |\n| EUR  1           |                  13 |                 228 |                  13 |                 228 |\n| Other currencies |                 -16 |                  18 |                 -16 |                  18 |\n| Total            |                 -33 |                  13 |                 -33 |                  13 |\n\n- 1 EUR sensitivity has been restated for 2022 from USD 91m/USD 91m to USD 228m/USD 228m for profit before tax and equity before tax, respectively.",

The sensitivities are based only on the impact of financial instruments that are outstanding at the balance sheet date and are thus not an expression of the company's total currency risk.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe company has most of its debt denominated in USD, but part of the debt (e.g. issued bonds) is in other currencies such as EUR, NOK, GBP and JPY. The company strives to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks.\n\nInterest rate risk is managed within a range set for the percentage of gross debt paying fixed interest, net of hedging. The level at 31 December is 41% (43%) excluding IFRS 16 Leases.\n\nA general increase in interest rates by one percentage point is estimated, all thing else being equal, to affect profit before tax and equity, excluding tax effect, positively by approx. USD 149m and positively by approx. USD 128m, respectively (negatively by approx. USD 163m and negatively by approx. USD 185m, respectively).\n\nThis analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.\n\nThe hedging of the interest rate risk is done by cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The hedging is a mix of fair value hedging, combined fair value hedging and cash flow hedging. Combined fair value hedging is applied when crosscurrency swaps are entered into to hedge the risk of debt denominated in other currencies than USD. Each hedge relationship is split into a fair value hedge, where value changes from market rates are recognised directly in profit or loss, and a cash flow hedge, where the value changes from the exchange rate exposure of the credit margin are recognised in OCI.\n\nThe hedges are expected to be highly effective due to the nature of the economic relationship between the exposure and the hedge. The source of ineffectiveness is the credit risk of the hedging instruments. For hedges where the cost of hedging is applied, the change in basis spread is recognised in other comprehensive income and is a time effect during the lifetime of the swap and at maturity amounts to 0. If the hedged transaction is prepaid, the change in basis spread will be recognised in profit or loss as ineffectiveness. The cost of hedging reserve amounts to a gain of USD 7m (USD 15m).\n\n| Borrowings and interest-bearing debt  to subsidiaries by interest rate levels   | Carrying   amount   | Next interest rate fixing   | Next interest rate fixing   | Next interest rate fixing   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| inclusive of interest rate swaps                                                |                     | 0-1 year                    | 2-5 years                   | 5- years                    |\n| 2023                                                                            |                     |                             |                             |                             |\n| 0-3%                                                                            | 742                 | 196                         | -                           | 546                         |\n| 3-6%                                                                            | 5,473               | 4,303                       | 576                         | 594                         |\n| 6%-                                                                             | 2,899               | 2,899                       | -                           | -                           |\n| Total                                                                           | 9,114               | 7,398                       | 576                         | 1,140                       |\n| Of which:                                                                       |                     |                             |                             |                             |\n| Bearing fixed interest                                                          | 1,730               |                             |                             |                             |\n| Bearing floating interest                                                       | 7,384               |                             |                             |                             |\n| 2022                                                                            |                     |                             |                             |                             |\n| 0-3%                                                                            | 2,790               | 2,264                       | -                           | 526                         |\n| 3-6%                                                                            | 39,932              | 39,033                      | 659                         | 240                         |\n| 6%-                                                                             | 1,721               | 1,721                       | -                           | -                           |\n| Total                                                                           | 44,443              | 43,018                      | 659                         | 766                         |\n| Of which:                                                                       |                     |                             |                             |                             |\n| Bearing fixed interest                                                          | 1,637               |                             |                             |                             |\n| Bearing floating interest                                                       | 42,806              |                             |                             |                             |",

To minimise the credit risk, financial vetting is undertaken for all major customers and financial institutions, adequate security is required for commercial counterparties, and credit limits are set for financial institutions and key commercial counterparties.\n\n## Financial assets at amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets at amortised cost comprise loan receivables, lease receivables, and other receivables. These are all considered to have low credit risk and thus the impairment provision calculated based on 12 months of expected losses is considered immaterial. The financial assets are considered to be low risk when they have low risk of default, and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.\n\nOther financial assets at amortised cost include loans to subsidiaries. As of 31 December 2023, the loans amount to USD 8.8bn (USD 4.6bn) and are considered to have a low credit risk, thus the impairment provision to be recognised during the period is limited to 12 months of expected losses. The credit risk has not increased significantly since the initial recognition and is considered low based on the investment grade credit rating for the Group and consequently the financial strength of the major subsidiaries within the Group.\n\n## Financial institutions\n\nDeposits and bank balances are primarily held in relationship banks with a credit rating of at least A-. No individual exposure is above 10%. A.P. Moller - Maersk has ISDA agreements for trading of derivatives, under which the Group has a right to net settlement in the event of certain credit events. This results in the credit risk being limited to the net position per counterparty.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nIt is of great importance for the company to maintain a financial reserve to cover the company's obligations and investment opportunities and to provide the capital necessary to offset changes in the company's liquidity due to changes in the cash flow from operating activities.\n\nThe flexibility of the financial reserve is subject to ongoing prioritisation and optimisation, among other things by focusing on the release of capital and following up on the development in working capital.\n\n| Net interest-bearing debt and liquidity              | 2023    | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Borrowings                                           | 9,114   | 44,443 |\n| Net interest-bearing debt                            | -17,159 | 13,691 |\n| Cash and bank balances                               | 5,123   | 8,082  |\n| Term deposits not included in cash and cash balances | 12,693  | 17,615 |\n| Securities                                           | -

 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n\n- Level 2 -  Inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)\n\nLevel 3 -  Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.\n\nFair value of listed shares falls within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Non-listed shares and other securities fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFair value of derivatives falls mainly within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated on the basis of observable market data as of the end of the reporting period.\n\nFair value of level 3 assets and liabilities is primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. A reasonably possible change in the discount rate is not estimated to affect the company's profit or equity significantly.\n\n## Financial instruments carried at amortised cost\n\nFair value of the short-term financial assets and other financial liabilities carried at amortised cost is not materially different from the carrying amount. In general, fair value is determined primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Where a market price was available, however, this was deemed to be the fair value. Fair value of listed issued bonds is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFair value of the remaining borrowing items is within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated on the basis of discounted interests and instalments.",

M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S\n\n## Report on the audit of the Financial Statements\n\n## Our opinion\n\nIn our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements (pages 61 to 120) give a true and fair view of the Group's and the Parent Company's financial position at 31 December 2023 and of the results of the Group's and the Parent Company's operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2023 in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\nOur opinion is consistent with our Auditor's Long-form Report to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\n## What we have audited\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2023 comprise income statement and statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, cash flow statement, statement of changes in equity and notes, including material accounting policy information for the Group as well as for the Parent Company. Collectively referred to as the 'Financial Statements'.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and the additional ethical requirements applicable in Denmark. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 were not provided.\n\n## Appointment\n\nWe were first appointed auditors of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S on 12 April 2012 for the financial year 2012. We have been reelected annually by shareholder resolution for a total period of uninterrupted engagement of 12 years including the financial year 2023. We were reappointed, following a tendering procedure, at the General Meeting on 15 March 2022.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements for 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRecognition of revenue is complex due to the volume of transactions and the variety of different revenue streams within the segments.\n\nWe focused on this area due to the significance of amounts involved and because recognition of revenue involves accounting policy decisions, and judgements made by Management originating from different customer behaviour, market conditions, terms and nature of services in the various segments.\n\nFurther, the volume of transactions and extent of different revenue streams involve internal controls, various IT applications and Management's monitoring hereof, to ensure correct revenue recognition, which are complex and introduce an inherent risk to the revenue recognition process.\n\nReference is made to note 2.1 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nOur audit procedures included considering the appropriateness of the revenue recognition accounting policies and assessing compliance with applicable accounting standards.\n\nWe performed risk assessment procedures with the purpose of achieving an understanding of IT-systems and applications, business procedures and relevant controls regarding revenue recognition. For the relevant key internal controls including IT dependencies supporting revenue recognition, we assessed whether they were designed and implemented to address the risk of errors in revenue recognised in the Financial Statements. For selected controls that we planned to rely on, we tested whether they were performed on a consistent basis and Management's monitoring hereof.\n\nWe applied data analytics on selected revenue streams in order to identify and test transactions outside the ordinary transaction flow and performed substantive procedures over invoicing and relevant contracts in order to assess the accounting treatment and principles applied, and tested journal entries on revenue.\n\nFurther, we tested timing to ensure that the revenue is recognised in the correct financial year.\n\nFinally, we assessed the adequacy of disclosures provided by Management in the Financial Statements.\n\n## Recoverability of the carrying amount of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets\n\nThe most significant risks in relation to Management's assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amount of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets relate to the definition of cash-generating units (CGUs), identification of CGUs with indicators of impairment and, where relevant, the estimate of the fair values less costs to sell and the values in use, including determination of key assumptions.\n\nManagement identified impairment indicators for the Ocean CGU, for individual terminals and also performed an impairment test related to goodwill in the Logistics & Services CGU.\n\nConsidering the generally long-lived nature of the assets, the significant assumptions in estimating the future cash flows are Management's long-term outlook for freight rates, terminal rates, margins in Logistics & Services, volumes, CAPEX and operating expenses as well as determining the discount rates.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nExecutive\n\nsummary\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPerformance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe focused on this area, as the carrying amounts are significant and as Management is required to exercise considerable judgement because of the inherent complexity in estimating the fair value less cost to sell or the value in use.\n\nReference is made to notes 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nWe considered the appropriateness of the defined CGUs within the businesses and examined the methodology used by Management to assess the carrying amount of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets assigned to CGUs, as well as the process for identifying CGUs that require impairment testing to determine compliance with IFRS.\n\nWe performed detailed testing of Management's impairment tests for goodwill and for the CGUs where indicators of impairment were identified, and challenged the significant assumptions affecting the future cash flows, including internal assumptions related to freight rates, terminal rates, Logistics & Services margins, volumes, CAPEX and operating expenses.\n\nWe used our internal valuation specialists to independently challenge the discount rates. In calculating the discount rates, the key inputs used were independently sourced from market data, and we assessed the methodology applied.\n\nFurther, we tested the mathematical accuracy of the impairment models prepared by Management.\n\nFinally, we assessed the adequacy of disclosures provided by Management in the Financial Statements.\n\n## Statement on Management Review\n\nManagement is responsible for Management Review (pages 4 to 59 and 126).\n\nOur opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover Management Review, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read Management Review and, in doing so, consider whether Management Review is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nMoreover, we considered whether Management Review includes the disclosures required by the Danish Financial Statements Act and Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (EU Taxonomy Regulation).\n\nBased on the work we have performed, in our view, Management Review is in accordance with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act and the disclosure requirements of Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (EU Taxonomy Regulation). We did not identify any material misstatement in the Management Review.\n\n## Management's responsibilities for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the Financial Statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Parent Company's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.",

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n## Report on compliance with the ESEF Regulation\n\nAs part of our audit of the Financial Statements we performed procedures to express an opinion on whether the annual report of A.P.

The nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material departures from the requirements set out in the ESEF Regulation, whether due to fraud or error. The procedures include:\n\n- \u00b7 Testing whether the annual report is prepared in XHTML format;\n- \u00b7 Obtaining an understanding of the company's iXBRL tagging process and of internal control over the tagging process;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the completeness of the iXBRL tagging of the Consolidated Financial Statements including notes;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of the company's use of iXBRL elements selected from the ESEF taxonomy and the creation of extension elements where no suitable element in the ESEF taxonomy has been identified;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to elements in the ESEF taxonomy; and\n- \u00b7 Reconciling the iXBRL tagged data with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements including notes.\n\nIn our opinion, the annual report of A.P.
