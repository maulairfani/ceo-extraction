        "page_content": "During 2023, the Group continued to improve profitability, delivering on our objective to achieve a double-digit return on tangible equity (RoTE) for the full year. Our high-growth markets, where we are intent on making further investment, continue to deliver strongly despite an uncertain picture for the global economy.\n\nThis performance came against a backdrop of rising interest rates in many large economies, which undoubtedly gave a strong tailwind for the business. However, it is also a product of our clear strategy, discipline and tireless execution - a significant achievement for our colleagues, led by our Group Chief Executive, Bill Winters, and his Management Team. Their skills and dedication remain essential to our performance, and my deepest thanks go to all of them.\n\nWe have recently bid a fond farewell to Andy Halford, who formally stepped down as Group Chief Financial Officer on 3 January 2024. Since his arrival in the role in 2014, Andy has been a much-valued colleague and friend and made a phenomenal contribution by helping to steer the business through a challenging external environment. Under his watch we strengthened our foundations, reset our risk appetite and redefined the Group's strategy. He leaves with our very best wishes, and will continue in an advisory role until his retirement in August. It is with pleasure that we welcome Diego De Giorgi who joins us as Andy's successor. I am looking forward to working closely with Diego and Bill to drive further excellence for clients and higher value for shareholders.\n\n## Advancing our strategic and financial goals\n\nI have said before that our objective is to grow income in a strong, safe and sustainable manner, while maintaining both cost and capital discipline, and I am delighted to say that was the case last year. We are confident that our improved RoTE, which reached 10.1 per cent in 2023, will be a milestone on the way to further long-term success for the Group, underpinned by strong performance across the business. We grew income 13 per cent on a constant currency basis while maintaining a strong capital and liquidity position and positive income-tocost jaws. We expect our RoTE to steadily increase from 10 per cent, and are targeting 12 per cent in 2026 and to progress thereafter.\n\nThe strength of our financial performance affirms that the strategy that we set out in 2021 is working. We remain focused on investment in high-growth markets and have made significant progress against our strategic priorities across Network, Affluent, Mass Retail, and Sustainability.\n\nI am acutely aware of the underperformance of our share price in recent months, which I believe does not reflect the progress we are making. Both the Board and the Management Team are absolutely focused on delivering sustained, long-term value for our shareholders. I believe our solid performance in 2023 gives us a good base from which to do this. As Bill details in the following pages, we have further sharpened the actions we will take to accelerate performance and future growth.\n\n'We remain focused on investment in high-growth markets and have made significant progress against our strategic priorities'\n\nFirstly, we will continue to rely on our stronger capabilities to further enhance returns in our Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking and Consumer, Private & Business Banking businesses, with a focus on driving income growth in high-returning areas. Secondly, we will improve operational leverage within the Group, addressing structural inefficiencies and complexities whilst protecting income. Finally, we will continue to return substantial capital to shareholders. This year, we are pleased to be able to provide an increased full-year dividend of 27 cents per share and are announcing a further share buyback of $1 billion.\n\nAlongside the importance of delivering improved financial performance, our Purpose and brand promise to be here for good remain cornerstones of our business. We are keenly aware of our role in supporting our clients and communities as they anticipate and respond to economic and social challenges. This is why we remain true to our Stands Accelerating Zero, Resetting Globalisation and Lifting Participation - which are delivered through the execution of our strategy, and which give us an active framework for positive impact across our footprint.\n\nWe updated our net zero roadmap in April 2023, committing to an absolute emissions target and trajectory for the oil and gas sector. In this year's Annual Report, we disclose the targets and science-based methodologies for our financed emissions in 11 of the 12 high-emitting sectors identified as decarbonisation priorities by the Net Zero Banking Alliance, demonstrating our commitment to support the transition of the real-world economy.\n\nWe have also recently announced our decision to become an early adopter of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures, highlighting the rising importance of nature and biodiversity as a necessary consideration in sustainability. Given that our footprint represents some of the most complex and diverse natural capital in the world, working across our business and with our clients to preserve, restore and enhance nature is critically important.\n\nIt is my honour to be able to act as a voice for our Stands on behalf of the Group as Co-Chair of the United Nations' Global Investors for Sustainable Development Alliance, as well as at various global platforms and by engaging with stakeholders across our markets.\n\n## Driving higher standards\n\nThe Board remains committed to firmly embedding a culture of excellence across the organisation, building high standards through a 'one bank' culture of ambition, action and accountability that puts our clients at the heart of all we do. We are at our best when we harness the full talent and potential of the diverse markets in which we operate.\n\nBoth the Board and the Management Team are dedicated to maintaining our status as an employer of choice. That means offering our colleagues a variety of ways to build their skillset, attracting the best talent through our doors with a diverse set of career paths within the Group and progressive employee policies, such as the standardised parental leave announced last year.\n\nAs the world continues to change around us, we also recognise the ongoing importance of technology and continuous improvement in maintaining our competitive edge, and in building an innovation-led culture that allows colleagues to try new things within an effective and comprehensive risk management framework. We are intent on capturing the benefits of new, game-changing technologies like artificial intelligence, whilst protecting the information and financial security of our clients.",

        "page_content": "## Group Chairman's statement\n\ncontinued\n\nIt has been an extremely active year for the Board, with frequent in-depth briefings on geopolitical, cyber and sectoral risks, and a sharp focus on corporate governance. We continue to build out our resilience in both the financial and non-financial dimensions of risk and compliance across our varied markets. This gives us the confidence to achieve our strategic goals and act decisively to grasp new business opportunities.\n\nWe continue to maintain a diverse range of skillsets and backgrounds on our Board. Jasmine Whitbread, a longstanding director and impactful former chair of the Culture and Sustainability Committee, stepped down from the Board at last year's AGM. As announced on 16 February 2024, Gay Huey Evans will step down from the Board with effect from 29 February 2024 after serving nine years and contributing significantly to the Board and its Committees, especially as Chair of the former Board Financial Crime Risk Committee. Carlson Tong, another much-valued Board member, will step down from the Board on 9 May 2024, ahead of the AGM. I would like to thank Jasmine, Gay and Carlson for their many contributions during their time with us.\n\nOn 16 February 2024, we announced that Diane Jurgens will join the Board from 1 March 2024. Diane is a highly experienced and respected technologist who will bring significant technology and transformation expertise and insight to the Board having operated across a variety of sectors and the Group's key markets.\n\n## Our dynamic markets\n\nIn 2023 I continued to spend time across our markets, seeing their dynamism first-hand and experiencing the ambition of our colleagues as they work together for greater growth.\n\nGuided by our Purpose - to drive commerce and prosperity through our unique diversity - we are investing heavily in fast-growing economies and trade corridors in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and bringing innovative digital products to new clients. A good example of this is Solv, our e-commerce platform for small and medium-size enterprises. We're also positioning ourselves to be a positive force in the expansion of sectors that will deliver a more sustainable global economy, like renewables and electric vehicles.\n\nI'm more confident than ever that we are investing in the right places for strong, safe and sustainable growth, and in our role as a connector bank in an ever more complex and fragmenting world. We provide our clients with the right solutions gained from deep experience of our markets, and continue to be a trusted partner for them as they look to seize opportunities across our footprint.\n\n'I'm more confident than ever that we're investing in the right places for strong, safe and sustainable growth, and in our role as a connector bank in an ever more complex, fragmenting world'\n\n## Looking ahead with confidence\n\nWe expect to see a 'soft landing' for the world economy in 2024. This is no small achievement as we have witnessed the most aggressive period of monetary policy tightening in decades. This, plus other favourable supply side developments have led to a fall in inflation in most countries, engendering expectations of official interest rate cuts in many economies this year. Growth, in turn, remains resilient, with emerging markets expected to keep growing considerably faster than developed economies, and Asia continuing to lead global growth.\n\nHowever, one cannot be complacent about the years ahead. The 'last mile' of inflation may prove stickier than expected, and geopolitical risks abound. As we begin 2024, the war between Ukraine and Russia continues, increasing uncertainty for nations in Europe and elsewhere. We see renewed conflict in the Middle East, bringing tragedy to many communities and disruption to the Red Sea, a key chokepoint in global supply chains.\n\n2024 is also a year of major elections in the United States, India and probably the United Kingdom, as well as other markets in our footprint. These all have the potential to affect the economic situation.\n\nWith so much at stake, we must take care not to needlessly damage the means of growth and wealth creation. I have frequently spoken in defence of open, rules-based trade as a lynchpin of global economic growth. This year, the challenges around it remain powerful, with the risk of further fragmentation.\n\nI believe the system of global trade that has been created with such care over many decades is one of humanity's foremost achievements. It is not perfect by any means, but it has arguably brought more opportunity and prosperity to a greater number of people than any other force in history. Like every intricate system, it is easy to damage and hard to rebuild. Safeguarding and making it more inclusive and sustainable requires constant vigilance and cooperation from policymakers, legislators, and the private sector in an evolved, modernised multilateral system.\n\nWhile the external landscape remains uncertain, we are confident that we are well positioned to navigate the challenges and seize the opportunities ahead. Our results in 2023 show we are doing just that. We remain focused on continuing to deliver excellence for our clients, and sustained value for shareholders, in 2024 and beyond.\n\nDr Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als Group Chairman 23 February 2024\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "We produced strong results in 2023, demonstrating the value of our franchise and delivering our target to push past the 10 per cent Return on Tangible Equity ('RoTE') milestone. But 10 per cent is not the extent of our ambition. We have the right strategy, business model and intent to build on this momentum. We have set out clear actions to deliver sustainably higher returns, with RoTE increasing steadily from 10 per cent, targeting 12 per cent in 2026, and to progress thereafter.\n\nFull year 2023 income of $17.4 billion was up 13 per cent on a constant currency basis, benefitting not only from rising interest rates but also encouraging underlying business momentum. Good cost discipline has enabled us to generate significantly positive income-to-cost jaws of 4 per cent for the year, even with continued underlying investment. Loan impairment declined, primarily due to reduced impairments from China commercial real estate and sovereign risks, with the overall portfolio remaining resilient. All this has helped us grow underlying profit before tax 27 per cent year-on-year, to $5.7 billion, the highest level for ten years.\n\nWe remain highly liquid and strongly capitalised. We finished the year with a Common Equity Tier 1 ('CET1') ratio of 14.1 per cent, above the top of our target range, allowing us to increase our full year ordinary dividend by 50 per cent to 27 cents per share. We undertook in February 2022 to return over $5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2024. With this full year dividend and the $1 billion share buyback announced today, we will have exceeded that target well ahead of schedule.\n\nAs we start the new year, I would like to take a moment to thank my friend and much valued colleague, Andy Halford, who decided to retire this year. Andy has been a great partner to me and the Board and has successfully helped steer the Group over the last ten years. I'd also like to extend a warm welcome to Diego De Giorgi as he takes over as the Group Chief Financial Officer. Diego brings with him over 30 years of financial services experience and I am sure he will continue to build on the progress we have made.\n\n## Our strategy is driving success\n\nOur strategy is designed to deliver our Purpose: to drive commerce and prosperity through our unique diversity. We set out four strategic priorities in early 2021: continue to grow our Network and Affluent client businesses, return to growth in Mass Retail and advance on all fronts of our Sustainability agenda. We are making good progress in every area.\n\n- \u00b7 Income from our cross-border Network business grew 31 per cent in 2023, with standout growth rates in our China offshore corridors to the Middle East and ASEAN, up 67 per cent and 53 per cent respectively\n- \u00b7 We increased the total number of Affluent clients to 2.3 million. This helped drive significantly higher levels of net new money in 2023, with net inflows of $29 billion, up 50 per cent, year-on-year, and deliver 24 per cent growth in income from this client segment\n- \u00b7 We grew our Mass Retail client base by over 1 million to 9.5 million. We have continued to grow our digital banks, Mox in Hong Kong and Trust in Singapore. They remain two of the fastest growing digital banks globally and underline our ability to partner and launch differentiated customer propositions. The Mass Retail business also serves a valuable strategic purpose as a pipeline for future Affluent clients, with 224,000 of our Mass Retail clients moving up to Affluent clients in 2023\n- \u00b7 Our dedicated Chief Sustainability Office unit acts as a centre of excellence and a catalyst for the execution of the Group-wide Sustainability strategy and the achievement of our net zero roadmap, further details of which are set out in the Annual Report. Our Sustainable Finance franchise generated over $0.7 billion income in 2023, a year-on-year growth rate of 42 per cent and we are well on our way to deliver a billion dollars in income by 2025. We have mobilised $87 billion of sustainable finance since the beginning of 2021, making good progress as we advance towards our $300 billion target by 2030\n\n## Great execution on our 2022 strategic actions\n\nWe set out five actions in 2022 designed to accelerate delivery of double-digit RoTE. The strong execution of these actions over the last two years, where we have either achieved our targets ahead of plan or they are well on track, has enabled us to reach that milestone in 2023.\n\n- \u00b7 We are ahead of schedule to drive improved returns in Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking ('CCIB'). We targeted around 160 basis points improvement in income return on risk-weighted assets ('IRoRWA') to 6.5 per cent in 2024. The team exceeded this target in 2023, delivering an IRoRWA of 7.8 per cent. This was driven by particularly strong growth in income from Financial Institution clients, which now accounts for 49 per cent of CCIB income, delivering close to the 50 per cent target one year early. The team has also successfully executed $24 billion in risk-weighted assets optimisation over the last two years, exceeding the target of $22 billion. The completion of the sale of the Aviation Finance business also created further capacity for CCIB to grow higher returning business\n- \u00b7 We are also ahead of our 2024 target to transform profitability in Consumer, Private and Business Banking ('CPBB'). The team has achieved its 60 per cent cost-toincome target one year ahead of plan, with a ninepercentage point improvement in 2023. They have delivered $0.4 billion of structural expense savings from rationalising the branch network, process re-engineering, headcount efficiencies and further automation\n- \u00b7 We have continued to seize the China opportunity , with our China-related business performing well, despite post-COVID domestic recovery tracking below expectations. We set a target of doubling the operating profit before tax of our onshore and offshore China business by the end of 2024 and we almost achieved that in 2023, generating $1.3 billion. This was driven primarily by offshore-related income, which delivers significantly higher returns, growing 42 per cent. Our onshore income, despite the domestic headwinds, grew 4 per cent. Looking forward, we continue to be confident in the long-term opportunities that China re-opening will generate for our unique franchise\n- \u00b7 We continued to create operational leverage , and are on track to deliver the three-year $1.3 billion expense savings target, which has helped us absorb inflationary pressure and continue to invest. Our cost-to-income ratio is down 7 percentage points since the end of 2021 to 63 per cent for 2023, so we are well advanced towards our target of around 60 per cent by 2024\n- \u00b7 Our equity generation and discipline on risk-weighted assets this year have created capacity for us to continue to deliver substantial shareholder distributions . With the final ordinary share dividend for 2023 and a new $1 billion share buyback programme starting imminently, means we are well ahead of our total target of returning in excess of $5 billion by the end of 2024. We will continue to actively manage the Group's capital position with the target of a further capital return of at least $5 billion over the next three years",

        "page_content": "## Group Chief Executive's review\n\ncontinued\n\n## Building on our achievements to deliver sustainably higher returns\n\nOur unique footprint across the world's most dynamic markets gives us a strategic advantage and underpins my confidence that we can continue to grow even in a less supportive interest rate environment. Our objective is to ensure that income growth translates into structurally higher profitability, striking a balance between maintaining the diversity that our clients value, while taking out unnecessary complexity that slows us and drags returns.\n\nWe are therefore taking further action in each of our three client businesses to drive income growth:\n\n- \u00b7 In CCIB, we will seek to drive growth in high-returning businesses such as cross-border income, targeting an 8 to 10 per cent underlying growth rate over the next three years. Additionally, building on our strength as a top two network trade bank, we are targeting to grow Trade and Working Capital income by 6 to 8 per cent between 2024 and 2026. The team is also driving growth in financing related income (Global Credit and Lending) with a particular focus on accelerating the originate to distribute strategy, targeting an 8 to 10 per cent CAGR to 2026\n- \u00b7 In CPBB, we will build on our strengths in the Affluent client business , targeting to attract over $80 billion of net new money over the next three years, a 19 per cent increase from the previous three years. We also intend on accelerating the growth in our international client business, with the target of increasing the number of international Affluent clients from 274,000 to over 375,000 by 2026\n- \u00b7 Building on the remarkable momentum in our two digital banks, Mox and Trust, we are targeting for the Ventures segment to be RoTE accretive by 2026\n\nBy executing these actions, we expect to grow income at a compound annual rate of between 5 and 7 per cent over the next three years, well above the anticipated rate of growth for the global economy.\n\nWe are also taking action to transform the way we operate, addressing structural inefficiencies and complexity whilst protecting income. Starting this year, we will run a bank-wide programme called Fit for Growth, to accelerate our previous efforts to simplify, standardise and digitise our business. We will fundamentally improve our productivity, client and employee experience and create capacity to reinvest in incremental growth initiatives.\n\nThis programme will save around $1.5 billion of cumulative expenses over the next three years and we expect to incur a similar amount in terms of the cost to achieve these permanent organisational and financial benefits. This will help us to deliver positive income-to-cost jaws in each of the next three years and keep operating expenses below $12 billion in 2026.\n\nContinuing to deliver strong income growth, combined with improving operational leverage and maintaining our responsible approach to risk and capital, means we expect RoTE to increase steadily from 10 per cent, targeting 12 per cent in 2026 and to progress thereafter.\n\n## Uniquely positioned and confident in the future\n\nWe are in a privileged position to take advantage of significant growth opportunities that will continue to come from the markets in our footprint, generating value for our clients and the communities in which we operate.\n\nWhilst we expect global growth to stay below potential at 2.9 per cent in 2024, as high interest rates put a drag on consumers as well as investment spending, Asia is likely to be the fastest-growing region continuing to drive global growth, expanding by 4.9 per cent. Easing inflation is likely to allow major central banks to start cutting rates in the second half of 2024, with a focus on supporting softening economic activity.\n\nDownside risks to this outlook include a sharper than expected slowdown in major economies, sustained inflationary pressures, a sluggish housing market in China and increased geopolitical tensions. But we also see significant opportunities emerging:\n\n- \u00b7 Higher capex to meet sustainability targets and moves towards digitalisation could boost productivity growth\n- \u00b7 Within emerging markets, countries in Asia are best placed to take advantage of digitalisation, including generative AI\n- \u00b7 Relatively younger populations, as well as the adoption of digital technology, will allow emerging markets to become increasingly important to global growth\n\nOur share price reflects little of our optimism about prospects and seems heavily influenced by the downside concerns mentioned above. The concerns are real, and we take them seriously. We maintain a strong capital position and liquidity to absorb any adverse impact on us and our clients. We believe that the value of our franchise will become increasingly clear to the broader market as we continue to grow our profits and exceed market expectations in those very areas of most concern.\n\n## In conclusion: significant progress with ambition for more\n\nWe delivered a strong performance in 2023, achieving our 10 per cent RoTE milestone, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and a robust capital position. But we know we must do more.\n\nWe have made significant progress on our five strategic actions, with most targets either delivered ahead of plan or well on track, providing a strong platform to grow and drive sutainably higher returns. And while much external uncertainty persists, we are optimistic for the markets and strength of our businesses in our footprint. But we are far from complacent, and my Management Team and I remain focused on delivering on our targets, seizing the growth opportunities we have, driving a culture of excellence and creating exceptional long-term value for our clients, shareholders and communities.\n\nFinally, I would like to acknowledge the remarkable efforts of our colleagues again this year. Their impressive dedication to our customers and the communities that we serve help to manifest our brand promise to be here for good.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBill Winters\n\nGroup Chief Executive\n\n23 February 2024",

SubSaharan Africa likely saw growth of 3 per cent in 2023, nearly unchanged from 2022, supported by domestic reform momentum in key economies.\n- \u00b7 Among the majors, despite a banking-sector crisis in the first half of the year, the US recorded annual growth of 2.5 per cent on the back of resilient domestic demand, while growth slowed sharply in the UK to 0.1 per cent.\n- \u00b7 Global growth is likely to stay below-trend at 2.9 per cent in 2024 as high interest rates drag on consumers as well as investment spending.\n- \u00b7 Asia will likely be the fastest-growing region and will continue to drive global growth, expanding by 4.9 per cent. Among the majors, the US is expected to experience below-trend growth of 1.8 per cent in 2024, the UK will grow just 0.1%, while the euro area is likely to see an overall modest expansion of 0.6 per cent.\n- \u00b7 Easing inflation is likely to allow major central banks to start cutting rates from Q2 2024, with a focus on supporting softening economic activity.\n\n## High interest rate environment\n\n- \u00b7 Trade fragmentation and heightened geopolitical risks and related supply disruptions together with still resilient labour markets have the potential to keep inflation elevated over the medium term.\n- \u00b7 Concerns about inflation are likely to see central banks adopting a cautious approach to monetary easing,  with the risk that rates stay elevated for an extended period of time.\n- \u00b7 Fiscal policy might also turn from a tailwind to a headwind for growth. High public debt and government deficits also mean that most economies are looking to tighten fiscal policy over the medium term.\n- \u00b7 There may be adverse environmental, agricultural, and economic consequences of a severe El Ni\u00f1o weather cycle. South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa economies are most at risk from the impact on agricultural production; and although El Ni\u00f1o has varying impacts on GDP growth, it is inflationary for most economies.\n- \u00b7 Growing trade fragmentation could undermine the resilience of globalisation, driving up consumer prices, and slowing the pace of economic convergence for emerging markets.\n- \u00b7 The euro-area economy grew by 0.5 per cent in 2023 following 3.4 per cent growth in 2022, supported by household demand and a positive contribution from exports in H1.\n- \u00b7 In most majors, labour markets remained strong, with low unemployment rates that helped support consumer confidence.\n- \u00b7 Major central banks like the Fed and ECB continued to tighten monetary policy in the first three quarters of 2023 with a view to bringing inflation back to target levels. Fiscal policy remained accommodative as governments tried to shield consumers and businesses from still elevated prices.\n- \u00b7 Unfavourable global liquidity conditions are likely to make it difficult for some emerging markets to access international financing, forcing them to seek multilateral support.\n- \u00b7 Downside risks to this outlook include a sharper than expected slowdown in major economies, sustained inflationary pressures, a sluggish housing market in China, and another flare-up of geopolitical tensions.\n\n## Broader global trends\n\n- \u00b7 The world economy could see a permanent loss of economic output or 'scarring' due to the recession following the pandemic. This would make it harder for emerging markets to catch up with developed markets.\n- \u00b7 Long-term growth in the developed world is constrained by ageing populations and high levels of debt, exacerbated by the policy response to COVID-19.\n- \u00b7 Rising nationalism, anti-globalisation and protectionism are threats to long-term growth prospects in emerging markets.\n- \u00b7 However, there are potential offsets. Higher capex to meet sustainability targets, and moves towards digitalisation could boost productivity growth, proving an antidote to economic scarring concerns. Within emerging markets, countries in Asia are best placed to take advantage of digitalisation, including generative artificial intelligence (AI).\n- \u00b7 Relatively younger populations, and the adoption of digital technology, will allow emerging markets to become increasingly important to global growth.\n- \u00b7 In order to meet net zero targets, energy-related spending will have to increase significantly; headwinds include insufficient funds across emerging markets, labour shortages and supply chain constraints.",

        "page_content": "## Asia\n\n- \u00b7 China's economic activity remains below potential, leaving room for further recovery. We forecast 2024 growth at 4.8 per cent. The post-COVID recovery has been disappointing, due to continuing contraction of the property sector, a negative contribution from foreign trade, and a lack of confidence on the part of consumers and private businesses. While GDP growth picked up to 5.2 per cent in 2023 on the reopening boost, policy support and a favourable base, economic activity is currently 2-3 percentage points below trend according to our estimate. We expect the government to set a growth target of around 5 per cent in 2024, the same as in 2023, to narrow the negative output gap and prevent deflation expectation from becoming entrenched.\n- \u00b7 While housing market adjustment will likely continue, we expect it to exert less of a drag on growth next year. The authorities have turned more supportive of the sector since the July Politburo meeting, relaxing purchase restrictions, lowering mortgage rates, accelerating renovation of urban villages, and pledging to meet reasonable financing need from eligible property developers. Consumption is likely to remain the key driver of the economy, with consumers showing renewed willingness to draw on their excess savings. The easing bias of macro policies is likely to remain to consolidate the recovery. We expect the People's Bank of China to increasingly rely on expansion of its balance sheet to inject ample liquidity, keeping the credit condition relatively easy. The official budget deficit may exceed the implicit ceiling of 3 per cent of GDP, with the central government more willing to share the debt burden. However, the upside is likely to be capped by private sector's hesitation to expand investment.\n- \u00b7 Hong Kong's outlook remains challenging. We expect growth to slow to 2.9 per cent in 2024 from 3.2 per cent in 2023, a reflection of still cautious household and business sentiment. The positive factors, including a continued normalisation in tourist arrivals and a persistently tight labour market, may not be sufficient to offset a weak property market and elevated US interest rates that keep weighing on investment appetite. We expect Korea's growth to accelerate to 2.1 per cent from 1.4 per cent in 2023, benefiting from a potential upcycle of semiconductors, but prolonged high-interest rates and rising commodity prices will adversely affect Korean consumption and construction investment.\n- \u00b7 In India, we expect FY25 (year beginning April 2024) GDP growth to likely moderate to 6.3 per cent vs 6.8 per cent for FY24 amid slower global growth, higher interest rates and slowing consumer demand . However, the growth dynamics are likely to stay strong. Rising real wages are likely to support rural demand and we expect private capex recovery post national elections in April/May 2024; the current ruling party is widely expected to return to power. Meanwhile, inflation pressures are expected to ease slightly to 5 per cent in FY25 vs 5.4 per cent in FY24. Hence, we see a shallow rate cut cycle of 50 bps starting June 2024 amid easing global rates. Ample foreign exchange (FX) reserves and yet another year of balance of payment surplus led by index inclusion related inflows, remain a strong buffer for the economy and are likely to limit FX market volatility. The key risks to our view can emanate from higher oil prices and/or tighter global financial conditions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nActual and projected growth by market in 2023 and 2024 %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| China     |   2024 | 4.8 %   |\n|-----------|--------|---------|\n|           |   2023 | 5.2 %   |\n| Hong Kong |   2024 | 2.9 %   |\n|           |   2023 | 3.2 %   |\n| Korea     |   2024 | 2.1 %   |\n|           |   2023 | 1.4 %   |\n| India     |   2024 | 6.3 %   |\n|           |   2023 | 6.8 %   |\n| Indonesia |   2024 | 5.2 %   |\n|           |   2023 | 5.1 %   |\n| Singapore |   2024 | 2.6 %   |\n|           |   2023 | 1.1 %   |\n\n- \u00b7 While global demand may remain soft in 2024, we expect the external drag on externally oriented economies in Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), including Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand, to be more moderate due to favourable base effects. In addition, a bottoming of the global electronics cycle may help these economies, though we do not expect a significant recovery given weak external demand and uncertainty. Domestic activity may see consumption and investment sentiment partly affected by higher interest rates and still-high inflation earlier in the year. But potential rate cuts and easing inflation in H2 and likely stable labour markets should provide support. Election spending in Indonesia may also provide a boost to consumption earlier in the year. Tourism recovery may continue to bolster growth in 2024 but the support may be fading. Inflation is expected to moderate in 2024 on favourable base effects and tighter monetary policies but upside risks arise from potentially higher food and energy prices, especially with the latest developments in the Middle East.\n- \u00b7 Monetary policy in the region may remain tight for longer given upside risks to inflation, and this poses a downside risk to economic growth, but some easing is expected in H2 which will help support growth sentiment. On balance, growth may remain somewhat subdued and similar to 2023, but lower inflation and rate cuts in H2 may help offset a weaker H1.",

Constrained or more expensive access to external financing is a challenge, especially given a concentration of external debt maturities in the years ahead. Scaled-up multilateral support for emerging and frontier economies is likely to be a partial mitigant. Whether the US  can avoid a hard landing will be key to risk appetite. FX liquidity remains an issue, although encouragingly FX reforms are now underway in key markets. Higher oil prices may increase pressures. Common Framework debt restructuring progress in Zambia and Ghana remains key to economic prospects, as they look to build resilience to further shocks.\n- \u00b7 In Nigeria, with a new cabinet and central bank leadership in place, we expect fuel subsidy and FX reforms to be completed in 2024. New investment in LNG production and a scaling up of domestic refining capacity should add to economic resilience.  In South Africa, while load shedding has improved, port and rail bottlenecks may hold back growth. In Kenya, increased concessional financing and a partial refinancing of the 2024 Eurobond have eased external liquidity concerns, but fiscal consolidation will be key to stabilising high debt levels.\n- \u00b7 Higher for longer rates, higher commodity prices and elevated regional tensions highlight the divergence between MENAP oil exporting and oil importing economies. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is likely to continue using oil windfalls to reverse the deterioration in government balance sheets stemming from the late-2014 and 2020 oil price shocks. The UAE, Oman and Qatar have committed to de-leveraging alongside the rebuilding of external buffers. In Saudi Arabia, drawdowns at the Central Bank continue to support growing Public Investment Fund assets; robust domestic investment and execution of giga-projects aim to expand potential in the non-oil economy. Headline growth in Saudi Arabia may be modest, given extension of oil output cuts. However, GCC non-oil growth remains robust against external headwinds, aided by lower levels of domestic inflation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee our regional performance on page 32\n\n## Europe and the Americas\n\nActual and projected growth by market in 2023 and 2024 %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 The US economy has been resilient in the face of sustained monetary policy tightening. But as credit growth slows, housing affordability weakens and delinquencies rise as higher rates feed through to the real economy, and we expect a slowdown in growth over the course of 2024. In the euro area, we expect growth to be elusive until rate cuts start in Q2, before picking up modestly in H2.\n- \u00b7 Headline inflation has fallen sharply for both the US and Euro area, but core inflation still remains off target. Central banks will remain alert to any signs of renewed upside risks to inflation, stemming from ongoing tight labour markets and geopolitical tensions.\n- \u00b7 The Fed and ECB have likely completed their rate-hiking cycles. Lower inflation leaves room for cuts from both central banks beginning in Q2; we expect the Fed to deliver 100bps and the ECB to deliver 125bps by end-2024.\n- \u00b7 There is likely to be less of a tailwind to growth in Europe from fiscal policy as new fiscal rules and higher interest rates force consolidation of budget deficits, and programmes introduced during the 2022-2023 energy crisis come to an end. The US economy has benefitted from fiscal support for infrastructure investment, but this impulse is likely to fade in 2024.\n- \u00b7 In Latin America, weakening domestic demand, and a downtrend in inflation should support further monetary easing by the region's central banks, most of which have already started rate cuts. Lower interest rates are likely to support better recovery in H2 2024, although sluggish external demand and tight global financial conditions could be headwinds.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee our regional performance on page 33",

This will require efforts across stakeholder groups to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy. Policymakers, corporates and financial institutions must play a substantial part in this to ensure that finance is an enabler of change. The need for a just transition that addresses environmental challenges, while ensuring inclusive economic and social development in the footprint markets where we operate, is a priority for the Group.\n\nInequality, along with gaps in economic inclusion, mean that many young people, women, and small businesses struggle to gain access to the financial system to save for their futures and to grow their businesses. We want to increase access to financial services and make them available at low cost. We strive to expand the reach and scale of accessible banking and to connect clients and our wider communities to the skills and educational opportunities that promote and sustain access to finance and economic opportunity.\n\nGlobalisation has lifted millions out of poverty but left many behind. We advocate for a new model of globalisation based on transparency to build trust, renew confidence and promote dialogue and innovation. We connect the capital, expertise and ideas needed to drive new standards and create innovative solutions for sustainable growth. We work across our markets to shape a new understanding of growth, one that is based on inclusivity, sustainability and our ambition to support people and communities for the long term.",

        "page_content": "## Summary of financial performance\n\nThe Group delivered on its key financial objective for 2023, achieving a 10 per cent underlying return on tangible equity, supported by significant progress on the five strategic actions set out in 2022. Underlying profit before tax increased 27 per cent at constant currency as the Group delivered 4 per cent positive income-to-cost jaws. Income grew 13 per cent on a constant currency basis as the Group took advantage of the favourable interest rate environment. Expenses increased 8 per cent at constant currency, while the Group incurred a loan loss rate of 17 basis points, well below its historical average. The Group reduced the carrying value of its investment in China Bohai Bank ('Bohai') by $850 million and booked a $262 million net gain from selling its Aviation Finance business. The Group remains well-capitalised and highly liquid with a liquidity coverage ratio of 145 per cent and a CET1 ratio of 14.1 per cent, above its target range, enabling the Board to announce a further $1 billion share buyback programme. The terms of the buyback will be published, and the programme will start shortly.\n\nAll commentary that follows is on an underlying basis and comparisons are made to the equivalent period in 2022 on a reported currency basis, unless otherwise stated.\n\n- \u00b7 Operating income of $17.4 billion increased by 10 per cent year-on-year or 13 per cent on a constant currency basis as the Group benefitted from the positive impact of rising interest rates, and a partial recovery in Wealth Management partly offset by losses from hedges\n- \u00b7 Underlying net interest income increased 20 per cent or 23 per cent on a constant currency basis as the net interest margin increased 26 basis points or 18 per cent with the Group having increased its pricing on assets and the yield on its Treasury portfolio more quickly than it repriced its liability base, reflecting strong pricing discipline and passthrough rate management as interest rates increased in key footprint currencies. This was partly offset by an additional 15 basis points drag from short-term and structural hedges due to rising interest rates, 16 basis points headwind from migration into higher priced term deposits from lower rate paid current and savings accounts ('CASA') as well as adverse changes in the mix between Treasury and customer assets\n- \u00b7 Underlying non NII was stable, or 2 per cent higher on a constant currency basis. This was in part due to a strong Wealth Management performance, which was up 10 per cent on a constant currency basis as it benefitted from a steady flow of new to bank clients and net new money. An accounting asymmetry resulting from Treasury management of business as usual FX positions also contributed to an increase in non NII, with a partial offset from reduced net interest income\n- \u00b7 Operating expenses excluding the UK bank levy increased 7 per cent, or 8 per cent on a constant currency basis, reflecting the Group's continued investment into business growth initiatives, strategic investments and higher inflation partly funded by cost efficiency actions. The Group generated 4 per cent positive income-to-cost jaws at constant currency and the cost-to-income ratio improved by 2 percentage points to 63 per cent\n- \u00b7 Credit impairment was a $528 million charge, a reduction of $308 million representing an annualised loan loss rate of 17 basis points. The impairment charge includes $282 million in relation to the China commercial real estate sector, $354 million in the Consumer, Private and Business Banking ('CPBB') portfolio and $85 million from Ventures partly offset by a $45 million net release from sovereign-related exposures and a net release in other Corporate exposures\n- \u00b7 Other impairment increased by $91 million to $130 million primarily relating to write-off of software assets\n- \u00b7 Profit from associates and joint ventures decreased 44 per cent to $94 million reflecting a lower profit share from Bohai\n- \u00b7 Restructuring, other items and goodwill and other impairment totalled $585 million. This included an impairment charge of $850 million reflecting a reduction in the carrying value of the Group's investment in Bohai following a refresh of the value-in-use calculation. Other items include the sale of the Aviation Finance business, of which there was a gain on sale of $309 million on the leasing business and a loss of $47 million in relation to a sale of a portfolio of Aviation loans. Restructuring charges of $14 million include the impact of actions to transform the organisation to improve productivity, partly offset by profits from businesses classified as held-for-sale. Movements in the Debit Valuation Adjustment ('DVA') were a positive $17 million\n- \u00b7 Taxation was $1,631 million on a reported basis, with an underlying effective tax rate of 29.1 per cent down from 29.9 per cent in the prior year reflecting a favourable change in the geographic mix of profits partly offset by increased losses in the United Kingdom where the Group currently does not recognise a tax benefit\n- \u00b7 Underlying return on tangible equity ('RoTE') increased by 240 basis points to 10.1 per cent reflecting an increase in profits and lower average tangible equity benefitting from distributions to shareholders and movements in reserves primarily through the course of 2022\n- \u00b7 Underlying basic earnings per share ('EPS') increased 32 per cent to 128.9 cents and reported EPS of 108.6 cents increased by 26 per cent\n- \u00b7 A final ordinary dividend per share of 21 cents has been proposed taking the full-year total to 27 cents, a 50 per cent increase. The Group also completed two share buyback programmes totalling $2 billion which along with a new share buyback programme of $1 billion to start imminently. Since 1 January 2022, total shareholder distributions announced total $5.5 billion",

Goodwill and other impairment include $850 million (2022: $308 million) impairment charge relating to the Group's investment in its associate China Bohai Bank ('Bohai')\n- 4.   Underlying performance for relevant periods in 2022 has been restated for the removal of (i) exit markets and businesses in AME (ii) Aviation Finance and (iii) DVA. No change to reported performance\n- 5.   To be consistent with how we the compute Net Interest Margin ('NIM'), and to align with the way we manage our business, we have changed our definition of Underlying Net Interest Income ('NII') and Underlying non NII. The adjustments made to NIM, including interest expense relating to funding our trading book, will now be shown against Underlying non NII rather than Underlying NII. Prior periods have been restated. There is no impact on total income\n- 6.   Other items includes the sale of the Aviation Finance business, of which there was a gain on sale of $309 million on the leasing business and a loss of $47 million in relation to a sale of a portfolio of Aviation loans\n\n## Reported financial performance summary\n\n|                                                          | 2023  $million   | 2022  $million   | Change  %   | Constant  currency   change\u00b9 %   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|\n| Net interest income                                      | 7, 769           | 7, 5 9 3         | 2           | 5                                |\n| Non NII                                                  | 10,250           | 8,725            | 17          | 20                               |\n| Reported operating income                                | 18,019           | 16,318           | 10          | 13                               |\n| Reported operating expenses                              | (11,551)         | (10,913)         | (6)         | (7)                              |\n| Reported operating profit before impairment and taxation | 6,468            | 5,405            | 20          | 25                               |\n| Credit impairment                                        | (508)            | (836)            | 39          | 34                               |\n| Goodwill and other impairment                            | (1,008)          | (439)            | (130)       | (130)                            |\n| Profit from associates and joint ventures                | 141              | 156              | (10)        | (10)                             |\n| Reported profit before taxation                          | 5,093            | 4,286            | 19          | 24                               |\n| Taxation                                                 | (1,631)          | (1, 384)         | (18)        | (25)                             |\n| Profit for the year                                      | 3,462            | 2,902            | 19          | 24                               |\n| Reported return on tangible equity (%) 2                 | 8.4              | 6.8              | 160         |                                  |\n| Reported earnings per share (cents)                      | 108.6            | 85.9             | 26          |                                  |\n\n- 1.

Trade & Working Capital decreased 1 per cent, reflecting lower balance sheet and contingent volumes due to a reduction in economic activity and clients' preference for local currency financing provided by local banks. This was partly offset by higher margins as the Group focused on higher-returning trade products.\n\nFinancial Markets income decreased 2 per cent and was up 3 per cent excluding the non-repeat of $244 million gain on mark-to-market liabilities in 2022. Flow income grew by 7 per cent which was more than offset by the 15 per cent reduction in episodic income, driven by subdued market volatility, reduced issuances and the non-repeat of prior year fair value gains on mark-to-market liabilities. Macro Trading was down 1 per cent with declines in FX and Commodities partly offset by a double-digit increase in Rates from an expanded product offering. Credit Markets income was up 5 per cent primarily from higher Credit Trading income. Financing & Securities Services income was down 22 per cent as the benefit of higher interest rates on Securities Services balances was offset by negative movements in XVA and the non-repeat of mark-to-market gains.\n\nLending and Portfolio Management income decreased 9 per cent reflecting the impact of risk-weighted assets optimisation actions which contributed to lower balances and an increase in portfolio management costs.\n\nWealth Management income grew 10 per cent with Bancassurance up 17 per cent and Treasury Products up 16 per cent partly offset by lower income from Wealth Management Lending which was down 15 per cent on the back of client deleveraging and margin compression. There was continued strong growth in net new sales, which totalled $14 billion and offset adverse market movements as Wealth Management assets under management remained broadly stable.\n\nRetail Products income increased 26 per cent. Deposits income was up 74 per cent due to active passthrough rate management in a rising interest rate environment partly offset by migration of Retail CASA balances into Time Deposits. Mortgage & Auto income decreased 62 per cent on the back of lower volumes and the impact of the Best Lending Rate cap in Hong Kong restricting the ability to reprice mortgages, despite an increase in funding costs from higher interest rates. CCPL income decreased 1 per cent reflecting reduced margins from increased funding costs partly offset by increased balances, driven by partnerships and the new digital banks.\n\nTreasury income was a $902 million loss primarily due to losses from structural and short-term hedges in a rising interest rate environment. The remaining short-term hedges mature in February 2024.",

Income grew 20 per cent with Cash Management benefitting from disciplined pricing initiatives in a rising interest rate environment partly offset by lower episodic income within Financial Markets and lower Lending income as CCIB delivered on its RWA optimisation initiatives. Expenses were 10 per cent higher while credit impairment decreased $302 million with lower charges in relation to the China commercial real estate sector and releases on historic provisions within the remaining portfolio.\n\nConsumer, Private & Business Banking ('CPBB') profit increased 60 per cent, with income up 22 per cent, benefitting from higher interest rates on Retail Deposits income and a recovery in Wealth Management. This was partly offset by lower Mortgage income negatively impacted by the Best Lending Rate cap in Hong Kong. Expenses increased 6 per cent while credit impairment was $92 million higher.\n\nVentures loss increased 12 per cent to $408 million, reflecting the Group's continued investment in transformational digital initiatives. Income increased five-fold to $156 million while expenses grew by 27 per cent. This resulted in a lower operating loss before impairment year-on-year. The impairment charge increased $69 million to $85 million reflecting increased bankruptcy related write-offs in Mox where credit criteria have now been adjusted to reduce the current elevated delinquency rate.\n\nCentral & other items (segment) recorded a loss of $1.8 billion as income declined by $1.3 billion mostly reflecting the losses from structural and short-term hedges booked within Treasury. Expenses increased by $43 million while there was a net release in credit impairment primarily relating to sovereign-related exposures. Associate income reduced by $65 million reflecting lower profits at Bohai.\n\nAsia profits increased 32 per cent as income grew 15 per cent, expenses increased by 8 per cent and credit impairments reduced by $146 million. The income growth reflects strong double-digit increases across Cash Management, Retail Deposits and Wealth Management partly offset by lower Mortgage income and a loss in Treasury Markets. The profit share from Bohai reduced by $65 million. The lower credit impairment charge reflects in part a lower level of impairments booked in the year relating to the China commercial real estate sector.\n\nAfrica & Middle East ('AME') profits increased 90 per cent as income increased 26 per cent with strong growth in Cash Management and Retail Deposits income partly offset by a loss in Treasury Markets following de-risking actions in certain markets. Expenses grew 6 per cent while credit impairment charges were a net release of $91 million, a $210 million reduction, reflecting a non-repeat of the prior year's sovereign-related impairments and releases relating to historic Corporate provisions.\n\nEurope & Americas recorded a loss of $330 million as income reduced by 40 per cent, reflecting the increased cost of hedges within Treasury whilst strong growth in Transaction Banking income was partly offset by lower Financial Markets income. Expenses increased 12 per cent reflecting the impact of inflation and higher investment spend. There was a $59 million reduction in credit impairment releases.\n\nCentral & other items (region) recorded a loss of $43 million compared to a $597 million loss in the prior year. This improvement is mainly due to higher returns paid to Treasury on the equity provided to the regions in a rising interest rate environment while expenses increased by 8 per cent.",

The net interest margin was also depressed by loss making hedges within Treasury and an accounting asymmetry from Treasury's business as usual management of FX positions within its portfolio.\n\n- \u00b7 Average interest-earning assets grew 1 per cent, or 2 per cent excluding the impact of currency translation and risk-weighted asset optimisation actions, reflecting an increase in cash and balances at central banks partly offset by lower customer loan balances.

The Group continues to actively manage the credit portfolio whilst remaining alert to a volatile and challenging external environment including increased geopolitical tensions which has led to idiosyncratic stress in a select number of markets and industry sectors.\n\nCredit impairment was a $528 million charge, down 37 per cent year-on-year, representing a loan loss rate of 17 basis points. There was a $282 million impairment charge relating to the China commercial real estate sector, including a $32 million decrease in the management overlay which now totals $141 million. The decrease in the management overlay reflects repayments and loans moving into stage 3. The Group has provided $1.2 billion in total, in relation to China commercial real estate sector primarily over the last three years. There was a net release of $45 million relating to sovereign downgrades. Excluding the China commercial real estate portfolio and sovereign-related exposures, there was a net release relating to Corporate exposures, primarily historical provisions. CPBB charge of $354 million reflects an uptick in delinquency trends across the year and the $85 million charge in Ventures is primarily from portfolio growth and increased bankruptcy related write-offs in Mox where credit criteria have now been adjusted to reduce the current elevated delinquency rate.\n\nGross stage 3 loans and advances to customers of $7.2 billion were 8 per cent lower year-on-year as repayments, client upgrades and write-offs more than offset new inflows. Credit-impaired loans represented 2.5 per cent of gross loans and advances, flat on the prior year.\n\nThe stage 3 cover ratio before collateral of 60 per cent increased by 3 percentage points, while the cover ratio post collateral at 76 per cent was flat on the prior year, with the cover ratio before collateral increasing due to an increase in stage 3 provisions in relation to the China commercial real estate sector and a reduction in gross stage 3 balances.\n\nCredit grade 12 balances have increased by 37 per cent to $2.2 billion substantially from a change in instrument on an existing sovereign exposure with no increase in risk. Excluding this temporary inflow, credit grade 12 balances declined 24 per cent reflecting both improvements into stronger credit grades and downgrades to stage 3. Early Alert accounts of $5.5 billion have increased by 11 per cent, reflecting new inflows relating to a select number of clients including sovereign-related exposures. The Group is continuing to carefully monitor its exposures in vulnerable sectors and select markets, given the unusual stresses caused by the currently challenging macro-economic environment.\n\nThe proportion of investment grade corporate exposures fell by 3 percentage points to 73 per cent, mainly due to a reduction in repurchase agreement balances across various central clearing counterparties.",

In 2023, the Group completed the sale of its Jordan business, closed its Lebanon representative office and signed agreements for sale of the remaining exit markets. Additionally, the Group sold its global Aviation Finance leasing business to Aircraft Leasing Company ('AviLease') for proceeds of approximately $3.6 billion including $0.7 billion consideration and $2.9 billion repayment of net-intra-group financing, giving rise to a gain on disposal of $309 million. The $1 billion Aviation loan businesses was sold separately, giving rise to a loss on disposal of $47 million. Both of these transactions are recorded in Other items. As a result of these disposals, effective 1 January 2023, the Group has not included the exit markets and the Aviation Finance business within the Group's underlying operating profit before taxation but reported them within restructuring.\n\nThe Group has also classified movements in the debit valuation adjustment ('DVA') out of its underlying operating profit before taxation and into Other items. To aid comparisons with prior periods the Group has removed the exit markets, Aviation Finance business and DVA from its underlying operating profit before taxation for 2022.\n\nRestructuring loss of $14 million reflects the impact of actions to transform the organisation to improve productivity, primarily additional redundancy charges, technology simplification and optimising the Group's property footprint. This was partly offset by the profits from the AME exit markets and Aviation Finance business before the completion of their exit from the Group.\n\nOther impairment of $850 million is in relation to a further reduction in the carrying value of the Group's investment in its associate Bohai, to align to a lower value-in-use computation following banking industry challenges and property market uncertainties in Mainland China, that may impact Bohai's future profitability. The carrying value of the Group's investment in Bohai has reduced to $0.7 billion from $1.5 billion.\n\nMovements in DVA were a positive $17 million driven by the widening of the Group's asset swap spreads on derivative liability exposures. The portfolio subject to DVA did not change materially during the year.",

The Group was able to fund $2.7 billion of capital returns to ordinary shareholders from underlying profits. The CET1 ratio remains 3.5 percentage points above the Group's latest regulatory minimum of 10.5 per cent and above the top of the 13-14 per cent target range.\n\nAs well as the 169 basis points of CET1 accretion from underlying profits, the Group's CET1 ratio decreased 34 basis points from a net $5.9 billion increase in risk-weighted assets as the Group exercised tight control over capital consumption. A further 22 basis points uplift was the result of an increase in Other Comprehensive Income from fair value gains on debt instruments as long-term interest rates began to fall in the latter half of the year. The sale of the Group's Aviation Finance business increased the CET1 ratio by 20 basis points.\n\nOrdinary shareholder distributions reduced the CET1 ratio by approximately 111 basis points. The Group spent $2 billion purchasing 230 million ordinary shares of $0.50 each during the year, representing a volume-weighted average price per share of \u00a37.06. These shares were subsequently cancelled, reducing the total issued share capital by 7.9 per cent and the CET1 ratio by 82 basis points. The Board has recommended a final dividend of 21 cents per share resulting in a total 2023 ordinary dividend of 27 cents per share or $728 million, reducing the CET1 ratio by approximately 30 basis points. Payments due to AT1 and preference shareholders cost approximately 17 basis points.\n\nThe Board has announced a share buyback for up to a maximum consideration of $1 billion to further reduce the number of ordinary shares in issue by cancelling the repurchased shares. The terms of the buyback will be published, and the programme will start shortly and is expected to reduce the Group's CET1 ratio in the first quarter of 2024 by approximately 40 basis points.\n\nThe $850 million impairment of Bohai also resulted in a RWA reduction of $2.1 billion, the net effect of which resulted in a reduction of the CET1 ratio by 23 basis points.\n\nThe Group's leverage ratio of 4.7 per cent is 6 basis points lower than at 31 December 2022. This is primarily driven by a decrease in Tier 1 capital of $0.8 billion as CET1 capital increased by $0.2 billion and was more than offset by the redemption of $1.0 billion Additional Tier 1 securities. The reduction in Tier 1 capital was broadly offset by a $7.2 billion reduction in leverage exposures. The Group's leverage ratio remains significantly above its minimum requirement of 3.7 per cent.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe have updated our guidance for 2024 and have provided additional guidance for 2025 and 2026 as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Income:\n- -  Operating income to increase 5-7 per cent for 2024 to 2026 and around the top of 5-7 per cent range in 2024\n- -  Net interest income for 2024 of $10 billion to $10.25 billion, at constant currency\n- \u00b7 Expenses:\n- -  Operating expenses to be below $12 billion in 2026, at constant currency\n- -  Expense saves of around $1.5 billion and cost to achieve of no more than $1.5 billion from 2024 to 2026\n- -  Positive income-to-cost jaws, excluding UK bank levy, at constant currency in each year from 2024 to 2026\n- \u00b7 Assets and RWA:\n- -  Low single-digit percentage growth in loans and advances to customers and RWA each year from 2024 to 2026 (pre-Basel 3.1 day-1 impact)\n- -  Basel 3.1 day-1 impact, pending clarification of rules, expected to add no more than 5 per cent incremental RWA\n- \u00b7 Continue to expect the loan loss rate to normalise towards the historical through-the-cycle 30 to 35 basis points range\n- \u00b7 Capital:\n- -  Continue to operate dynamically within the full 13-14 per cent CET1 target range\n- -  Plan to return at least $5 billion to shareholders cumulative 2024 to 2026\n- -  Continue to increase full-year dividend per share over time\n- \u00b7 RoTE increasing steadily from 10%, targeting 12% in 2026 and to progress thereafter\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Diego De Giorgi\n\nGroup Chief Financial Officer\n\n23 February 2024",

Increased levels of volatility were seen in early 2023 as several bank failures prompted fears of a global contagion. Despite having no material exposures to the failed banks, the Group took proactive steps to further strengthen our liquidity position and monitor for any signs of second order impacts. 2023 also saw a fundamental shift in global power dynamics, including with the BRICS expansion. Sovereign risks persisted across emerging markets in the Africa and Middle East region. In Asia, despite slower than expected economic growth in China, we saw positive signs of growth in the second half of the year. We continued to keep our focus on the challenges in the China real estate sector and any contagion risks. The Group has limited direct exposure in Ukraine and to the countries in the Middle East which are currently most impacted by conflict. However, we remained cognisant of the volatility and the potential second order market impacts, including those from elevated oil and commodity prices or supply chains disruption, which we continue to actively monitor through stress testing and portfolio reviews.\n\nAs we enter 2024, we stay vigilant and continue to review our exposure and limits across our portfolios to identify vulnerable industries and clients for closer monitoring.\n\n## Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking (CCIB)\n\nOur CCIB credit portfolio remained resilient with overall good asset quality, as evidenced by our largely investment grade corporate portfolio (31 December 2023: 73 per cent, 31 December 2022: 76 per cent). We actively tracked geopolitical risks to enable us to act should the need materialise. In consideration of the macroeconomic challenges, additional reviews were conducted throughout 2023 across US regional Banks, Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI), Leveraged Lending books, Global Commercial Real Estate (CRE) portfolio and select geographies. We closely monitored vulnerable sectors and identified clients that may face difficulties on account of increased interest rates, foreign exchange movements, commodity volatility or increased prices of essential goods. In China, the property market recovery remained slower than expected amidst government support measures and we continued to monitor our developers and sponsors portfolios through dedicated reviews.",

        "page_content": "## Consumer, Private and Business Banking (CPBB)\n\nThe CPBB credit portfolio remained alert to the risks of the uncertain economic outlook but continued to demonstrate resilience. An increase in delinquency rates (Stage 2 provisions as at 31 December 2023: $139 million, 31 December 2022: $118 million) highlights the emerging pressure on customers' debt servicing capacity, as our customers continue to adapt to the prolonged higher interest rate environment. We continued to monitor potential secondary impacts of local challenges arising from heightened country risks across Bangladesh, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, amongst others. There was no material impact on the CPBB portfolio due to the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East. For both our secured and unsecured consumer credit portfolios, we continued to monitor customer affordability across our key markets and dynamically adjusted origination criteria, portfolio management and collections strategies, as appropriate. We were mindful of the higher credit risk associated with increased lending to the mass market segment through our digital partnerships and digital banks and have tailored our lending criteria and portfolio management approach to the unique risks and customer behaviours observed in these segments.\n\n## Treasury Risk\n\nOur liquidity and capital risks are managed to ensure a strong and resilient balance sheet that supports sustainable growth. We continued to enhance our Treasury Risk framework to incorporate the lessons from recent market events as well as horizon risks. Liquidity remained resilient across the Group and major legal entities. Group liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) is 145.4 per cent as at December 2023 (31 December 2022: 147 per cent) with a surplus to both Risk Appetite and regulatory requirements. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 14.1 per cent as at December 2023 (31 December 2022: 14.0 per cent) while Leverage ratio was 4.7 per cent (31 December 2022: 4.8 per cent). In March 2023, we saw sharp moves in funding markets and customer behaviours triggering several bank failures in the US and Switzerland. This resulted in a heightened focus on Treasury risks including capital, liquidity, and interest rate risk on the banking book, with problems most acute in the US market and reverberating globally. We maintained a resilient liquidity position throughout the period and continued to focus on managing risks even as those event risks receded.\n\nThe Risk function remains actively engaged in providing independent review and challenge to internal and regulatory stress tests and recovery and resolution capabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on Risk Management for our Principal Risk Types can be found in page 314\n\nFurther details on Climate Risk can be found in page 298\n\n## Risk Performance Summary\n\nAsset quality is resilient. The percentage of investmentgrade corporate net exposure remained high at 73 per cent (31 December 2022: 76 per cent). Exposure to our top 20 corporate clients as a percentage of Tier 1 capital decreased to 62 per cent (31 December 2022: 65 per cent), mainly driven by reduction in Transaction Banking exposures. However, the Group remained vigilant of persistent challenging conditions in some markets and sectors. In 2023, we saw a $0.5 billion increase in Early Alerts exposure (31 December 2023: $5.5 billion, 31 December 2022: $5.0 billion), driven by inflows relating to a select number of clients including sovereignrelated exposures, partially offset by transfers to Purely Precautionary, regularisations, exposure reductions and outflows to Credit grades 12-14. Credit grade 12 balances increased to $2.2 billion (31 December 2022: $1.6 billion) due to sovereign and client downgrades, partially offset by outflows to non-performing loans.",

Stage 3 was a charge of $369 million (31 December 2022: $430 million), and the reduction was driven by CCIB releases and lower impairment charges for our China commercial real estate clients. This reduction was offset by higher bankruptcy related write-offs in CPBB across Singapore, Hong Kong and Korea, and portfolio growth in digital partners.\n\n## Credit impairment\n\n|                                               | 2023                   | 2023               | 2023             | 2022 1                 | 2022 1             | 2022 1           |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n|                                               | Stage 1 & 2   $million | Stage 3   $million | Total   $million | Stage 1 & 2   $million | Stage 3   $million | Total   $million |\n| Ongoing business portfolio                    |                        |                    |                  |                        |                    |                  |\n| Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking | 11                     | 112                | 123              | 148                    | 277                | 425              |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking          | 129                    | 225                | 354              | 151                    | 111                | 262              |\n| Ventures                                      | 42                     | 43                 | 85               | 13                     | 3                  | 16               |\n| Central & other items                         | (44)                   | 10                 | (34)             | 95                     | 38                 | 133              |\n| Credit impairment charge/(release)            | 138                    | 390                | 528              | 407                    | 429                | 836              |\n| Restructuring business portfolio              | -                      | -                  | -                | -                      | -                  | -                |\n| Others                                        | 1                      | (21)               | (20)             | (1)                    | 1                  | -                |\n| Credit impairment charge/(release)            | 1                      | (21)               | (20)             | (1)                    | 1                  | -                |\n| Total credit impairment charge/(release)      | 139                    | 369                | 508              | 406                    | 430                | 836              |\n\n- 1 Underlying credit impairment has been restated for the removal of (i) exit markets and businesses in AME and (ii) Aviation Finance.

        "page_content": "## An update on our risk management approach\n\nOur Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) outlines how we manage risk across the Group, as well as at branch and subsidiary level 1 . It gives us the structure to manage existing risks effectively in line with our Group Risk Appetite, as well as allowing for holistic risk identification. The ERMF also sets out the roles and responsibilities and the minimum governance requirements for the management of Principal Risks.\n\nIn revisions made in the ERMF in 2023, effective 1 January 2024, the concepts of Integrated Risk Types (IRTs) and IRT Owner roles were discontinued. Oversight on existing IRTs, i.e. Climate Risk, Digital Asset and Third Party Risk, is achieved through the Risk Type Frameworks (RTFs) and dedicated policies. The subject matter experts, as the policy owners for these risks, provide overall governance and ensure a holistic view of how risks are monitored and managed across the Principal Risk Types (PRTs).\n\n## Principal Risk Types\n\nPRTs are risks inherent in our strategy and business model. These are formally defined in our ERMF, which provides a structure for monitoring and controlling these risks through the Risk Appetite Statement. We will not compromise compliance with our Risk Appetite in order to pursue revenue growth or higher returns.\n\nThe table below provides an overview of the Group's PRTs and their corresponding risk appetite statements.\n\n| Risk Types                           | Risk Appetite Statement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Credit Risk                          | The Group manages its credit exposures following the principle of diversification across  products, geographies, client segments and industry sectors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Traded Risk                          | The Group should control its financial markets and activities to ensure that market and  counterparty credit risk losses do not cause material damage to the Group's franchise.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Treasury Risk                        | The Group should maintain sufficient capital, liquidity and funding to support its operations,   and an interest rate profile ensuring that the reductions in earnings or value from movements   in interest rates impacting banking book items does not cause material damage to the Group's  franchise.

        "page_content": "## Topical and Emerging Risks (TERs)\n\nEmerging Risks refer to unpredictable and uncontrollable outcomes from certain events which may have the potential to adversely impact our business. Topical Risks refer to themes that may have emerged but are still evolving rapidly.\n\nAs part of our continuous risk identification process, we have updated the Group's TERs from those disclosed in the 2022 Annual Report and 2023 Half-Year Report; these remain applicable, with nuances in their evolution noted where pertinent. Below is a summary of the TERs, and the mitigating actions we are taking based on our current knowledge and assumptions. This reflects the latest internal assessment as performed by senior management.\n\nThe TER list is not exhaustive and there may be additional risks which could have an adverse effect on the Group. There are some horizon risks that, although not highly likely at present, could evolve into a threat in the future and we are therefore monitoring them. These include future pandemics and the world's preparedness for them, and other potential cross-border conflicts. Our mitigation approach for these risks may not eliminate them but demonstrates the Group's awareness and attempt to reduce or manage the risks. As certain risks develop and materialise over time, management will take appropriate steps to mitigate them based on their materiality on the Group.\n\n## Macroeconomic and geopolitical considerations\n\nThere is interconnectedness between risks due to the importance of US Dollar financing conditions for global markets, the global or concentrated nature of key supply chains for energy, food, semi-conductors and rare metals, and the direct influence of geopolitics on geoeconomics.\n\nThe Group is exposed to these risks directly through investments, infrastructure and staff, and also indirectly through its clients. Whilst the main impacts are financial, other ramifications may exist such as reputational, compliance or operational considerations.\n\n## Expanding array of global tensions and new geopolitical order\n\nGlobal power dynamics have shifted, with different political and economic alliances beginning to create a multipolar power system. This has been accelerated by the war in Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East. Whilst the Group has limited direct exposure to Russia, Ukraine or Israel, it may be impacted by second order effects on its clients and markets for agricultural commodities, oil or gas.\n\nThe positioning of 'middle powers' is complex and evolving, and could tip the geopolitical scales. The negotiating power of exporters of energy and other natural resources has expanded and can shape global markets, as they can use global divisions to raise their own profile. One such example is the envisaged expansion of BRICS to seek a counterweight to Western power axes.\n\nUS-China tensions remain, with protectionist measures imposed by both sides. Tariffs, embargos, sanctions, new taxes such as that on carbon, and restrictions on technology exports and investments, are being used to achieve goals beyond just economic. Further economic or political actions could escalate distrust and accelerate the decoupling of trade links, leading to increasingly inefficient production and inflation pressures.\n\nDespite attempts to become more pragmatic, a number of potential flashpoints remain. A push by China to increase RMB trade and establish RMB as a secondary global reserve currency presents new business opportunities but also potential disruption to the balance of power.\n\nWith many elections due across the world in the next twelve months, there is uncertainty over the political direction of domestic and foreign policy. There is a risk of short-term political expediency taking precedence over long-term strategic decision making. The malicious use of AI-enabled disinformation could also cause disruption and undermine trust in the political process.\n\nThere is an ongoing threat of terrorism, with unpredictability exacerbated by the wider range of ideologies at play. Cyber warfare by state related actors could also be used to disrupt infrastructure or institutions in rival countries.\n\nA more complex and less integrated global political and economic landscape has the potential to challenge cross border business models, but also provides new business opportunities.\n\n## Persistent high inflation and interest rates\n\nAlthough rate cuts have been signalled by the Federal Reserve, global rates could remain elevated for longer. Structurally higher spending and continued supply disruptions increase the probability of inflation remaining sticky. During 2023, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Trade Organisation lowered their initial forecasts for trade growth and increased that of inflation in 2024, suggesting that several economies will walk a fine line between recession and stagflation.\n\nConcern for the credit environment spans both commercial and retail lending, with price inflation and the cliff effects of energy, mortgage and debt re-pricing ultimately leading to higher defaults. This is visible in bond markets with yields widening markedly and prone to high volatility.\n\nDrives to de-risk supply chains combined with no obvious resolution to ongoing conflicts continue to disrupt supply chains. This complicates efforts to combat inflation as supply constrained markets dent the effectiveness of monetary policy.",

        "page_content": "Some sectors are particularly sensitive to high rates, notably commercial real estate, non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) and leveraged finance due to their reliance on the availability of cheap financing. Bank failures in Q1 2023 highlighted challenges in managing liquidity, credit, refinancing and market risks. They also raised questions of competence and confidence in the finance industry.\n\n## Economic slowdown in China\n\nWhilst China's exit from COVID restrictions has had an overall positive impact, it has failed to deliver a sustained boost to the global economy as the country contends with strain in several sectors such as real estate. There has also been a change in the corporate operating environment, with reduced clarity on the economic outlook.\n\nGiven China's importance to global trade a slowdown would have wider implications across the supply chain, especially for its trading partners, as well as to countries which rely on it for investment, such as those in Africa. However, opportunities arise from the diversification of intra-Asia trade and other global trade routes, and growth acceleration in South Asia, especially India.\n\n## Sovereign risk\n\nCredit fundamentals have been eroding across both emerging and advanced economies due to persistently high interest rates, food and energy prices. Emerging markets will also be affected by weakness in local currencies versus the US Dollar and the resultant cost of refinancing existing debt, or availability of hard currency liquidity. Issues and challenges have already been observed across several of the Group's footprint markets, including the recent default of Ghana, political instability in Pakistan, high inflation in Turkey, economic turmoil in Sri Lanka, and coups in Africa.\n\nFor some countries there is a heightened risk of failure to manage social demands, which might culminate in increased political vulnerability. Furthermore, food security exacerbated by the influences of armed conflict and climate change, and energy security challenges have the potential to drive social unrest.\n\nDebt moratoria and refinancing initiatives are complicated by larger number of financiers, with much financing done on a bilateral basis outside of the Paris Club. Whilst the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable has made some progress on coordinating approaches between the Paris Club and other lenders their interests do not always match. This can lead to delays in negotiations on debt resolutions for developing nations.\n\n## Supply chain issues and material shortages\n\nDemand and supply imbalances in global supply chains are increasingly becoming structural in nature and affect a wide range of commodities including food, energy, minerals and raw materials, plus targeted restrictions on certain industry sectors.\n\nThere is growing political awareness around the need for key component and resource security at national level. Countries are enacting rules to 'de-risk' by reducing reliance on rivals or concentrated suppliers (for example semiconductors) and look to either re-industrialise or make use of near-shoring and friend-shoring production.\n\nThe growing need for minerals and rare earth metals to power green energy technologies could increase the geopolitical standing of the main refiners, such as China, Indonesia and some African nations. However, there are also environmental and social costs to rapidly increasing extraction. A desire to avoid dependence may slow down the move by some nations towards the transition.\n\n## How these risks are mitigated/next steps\n\n- \u00b7 We remain vigilant in monitoring risk and assessing impacts from geopolitical and macroeconomic risks to portfolio concentrations.\n- \u00b7 We conduct thematic stress tests and portfolio reviews at the Group, country, and business level, with regular reviews on vulnerable sectors, and undertake any necessary mitigating actions.\n- \u00b7 We maintain a diversified portfolio across products and geographies, with specific risk appetite metrics to monitor concentrations.\n- \u00b7 Increased scrutiny is applied when onboarding clients and in ensuring compliance with sanctions.\n- \u00b7 Collateral and credit insurance are used to manage concentrations.\n- \u00b7 We track the participation of our footprint countries in the G20's Common Framework Agreement and Debt Service Suspension Initiative for Debt Treatments and the associated exposure.\n- \u00b7 Our NBFI exposure is closely monitored in terms of both limits, products and counterparties.\n\n## Regulatory considerations\n\n## Changing regulatory environment\n\nGiven notable bank failures in 2023 (and the response of resolution authorities to those failures), the regulatory framework for banks remains subject to continued change in addition to the implementation of Basel 3.1 in various jurisdictions. Additionally, the differing pace and scale of regulatory adoption between jurisdictions, along with increasing extraterritorial reach and prescriptiveness, can make it challenging for multinational groups to manage their business. Implementation timelines are a focus.\n\nThe scale of upcoming regulatory change in 2024 and 2025 is significant with major regime changes in capital and operational resilience due to take effect.\n\n## How these risks are mitigated/next steps\n\n- \u00b7 We actively monitor regulatory developments, including those related to sustainable finance and ESG, and respond to consultations either bilaterally or through well-established industry bodies.",

        "page_content": "## ESG considerations\n\n## ESG stakeholder expectations\n\nOrganisations across the corporate and financial sectors are setting ambitious sustainability goals and net zero targets with many embedding them in their business models. This has prompted increased attention from various stakeholders in ensuring that net zero targets are being met with credible action plans. Stakeholder scrutiny around greenwashing risk relating to ESG focused financial products, as well as companies' commitments, transpires in the various regulatory developments and early enforcement actions taken by several key regulators.\n\nFragmentation in the pace and scale of adoption of ESG regulations around the world remains, particularly around taxonomies and disclosure requirements, which may lead to unintended consequences including misallocation of capital, increased implementation costs and litigation risks.\n\nThe Group's net zero aspirations may be impacted by governments or corporates scaling back their sustainability targets, especially as economic conditions remain challenging, and budgets are constrained. There have been examples in developed nations, such as the UK revisiting its electric vehicle transition timeline. A slower transition from key clients may also weigh reputational pressure on the Group's roadmap.\n\nHigher frequencies of extreme weather-related events such as wildfires, floods and famines may lead to physical climate risk and the cost of managing it becoming a heavier burden on global economies. This will be particularly impactful to developing markets. Alongside climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and depletion of key resources, such as water, pose incremental risks to food and health systems, energy security and contribute to the disruption of supply chains.\n\nHuman rights concerns are increasingly in focus, with the scope expanding beyond direct abuses to cover other areas such as technological advancement and supply chains.\n\n## How these risks are mitigated/next steps\n\n- \u00b7 We update our environmental and social standards for providing financial services to clients every two years, with a new version scheduled for 2024.\n- \u00b7 We focus on embedding our values through our Position Statements for sensitive sectors and a list of prohibited activities\n- \u00b7 We integrate the management of greenwashing risks into our Reputational and Sustainability Risk Framework and policies\n- \u00b7 'Green', 'sustainable' and 'transition' labels for products and transactions reflect the criteria set out in the Group's Sustainable Finance frameworks, which are regularly reviewed. We obtain external verification on the Group's Sustainable Finance asset pool.\n- \u00b7 We assess our clients and suppliers against various international human rights principles, as well as through our social safeguards and supplier charter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nModern slavery statement:\n\nhttps://www.sc.com/modernslavery\n\nHuman Rights Position Statement:\n\nhttps://www.sc.com/humanrights\n\n- \u00b7 Detailed portfolio reviews and stress tests are conducted to test resilience to climate-related risks and enhance modelling capabilities to understand the financial risks and opportunities from climate change.\n- \u00b7 Work is underway to embed Climate Risk considerations across all relevant PRTs. This includes client-level Climate Risk assessments, including setting adequate mitigants or controls as part of decision making and portfolio management activities.\n\n## Technological considerations\n\n## Data and digital\n\nThe Group's digital footprint will expand as more services and products are digitised and made more accessible. Scale in operations and interactions with digital systems will further reduce the tolerance for errors and outages. The risk of data breaches is amplified by highly organised actors, with threats such as 'Ransomware as a Service' and affordable, sophisticated AI systems helping to facilitate attacks on organisations and individuals.\n\nData regulation continues to be fluid and fragmented. Geopolitical tensions have accelerated the implementation of data sovereignty laws, including data localisation requirements and cross-border access restrictions. These regulations often have an extraterritorial reach which could increase operating costs significantly, and also impact cross-border business models. Stakeholder expectations on data management have also increased, particularly relating to quality, integrity, record keeping, privacy, sovereignty, the ethical use of data and application of AI.\n\nThe sophistication and adoption of AI solutions are growing exponentially and will increase exposure to existing risks such as model, fraud, financial crime, compliance and Information and Cyber Security (ICS) risks. In response, regulation is accelerating, particularly around the ethical application of AI in decision-making, necessitating robust governance measures. The Group needs to ensure that it develops sufficient in-house subject matter expertise.\n\n## New business structures, channels and competition\n\nFailure to harness new technologies and new business models would place banks at a competitive disadvantage. The continued exploration of partnerships, alliances, digital assets, generative AI and nascent technologies, such as quantum computing, provides both opportunities and unique challenges. This is increasingly important as digital assets and distributed ledger technology become progressively prevalent and interconnected with the financial ecosystem. Supply chains are becoming more complex, interconnected and digital. Highly extended enterprises expand opportunities available for malicious actors, with risk cascading further down supply chains beyond just direct and third party risks.\n\nThese innovations require specialist in-house expertise, new operating models and adapting risk frameworks to perform robust risk assessment and management of new threats. There is also growing regulatory attention in many of these areas. Balancing resilience and agility is essential given the global nature of new technologies alongside the maintenance of existing systems. It is imperative to establish clear ownership, frameworks, and oversight of the use of emerging technologies.",

        "page_content": "## How these risks are mitigated/next steps\n\n- \u00b7 We monitor emerging trends, opportunities and developments in technology as well as emerging business models that may have implications for the banking sector.\n- \u00b7 We invest in our capabilities, to better prepare and protect ourselves against possible disruption and new risks.\n- \u00b7 We track the evolving regulatory landscape affecting key areas such as data management, digital assets and AI, including country-specific requirements, and actively collaborate with regulators to support important initiatives.\n- \u00b7 We have established enhanced governance for novel areas through the Digital Asset Risk Committee and Responsible AI Council, which considers emerging regulatory guidance.\n- \u00b7 We manage data risks through our Compliance Risk Type Framework and information security risks through our ICS Risk Type Framework.\n- \u00b7 We have developed a Group Data Strategy, to strengthen ownership of related data risks.\n- \u00b7 We maintain a dedicated Data Compliance Policy with globally applicable standards. These standards undergo regular review to ensure alignment with evolving regulations and industry best practice.\n- \u00b7 We maintain programmes to enhance our data risk management capabilities and controls, including compliance with BCBS239 requirements on effective risk data aggregation, with progress tracked at executive level risk governance committees\n- \u00b7 The Group has implemented a 'defence-in-depth' ICS control environment strategy to protect, detect and respond to known and emerging ICS threats.\n- \u00b7 New risks arising from partnerships, alliances, digital assets and generative technologies are identified through the New Initiatives Risk Assessment and Third Party Risk Management Policy and Standards.\n\n## Demographic considerations\n\n## Talent pools of the future\n\nThe expectations of the workforce, especially skilled workers, continue to evolve. The COVID pandemic accelerated changes on how people work, connect and collaborate, with expectations on hybrid working now a given. The focus is increasingly on 'what' work people do and 'how' they get to deliver it, which are becoming differentiators in the war for future talents. There is greater desire to seek meaning and personal fulfilment at work that is aligned to individual purpose.\n\nThese trends are even more distinct among Millennials and Generation Z who make up an increasing proportion of the global talent pool, and as digital natives possess the attributes and skills we seek to pursue our strategy.\n\nTo sustainably attract, grow and retain talent, we must continue to invest in and further strengthen our Employee Value Proposition (EVP) and our brand promise, here for good, through both firm-wide interventions as well as targeted action.\n\n## Demographic trends\n\nDivergent demographic trends across developed and emerging markets create contrasting challenges. Developed markets' state budgets could be strained by ageing and shrinking populations, whilst political stances reduce the ability to fill skills gaps through immigration. Conversely emerging markets are experiencing fast-growing, younger workforces. Whilst it is an opportunity to develop talent, population growth will put pressure on key resources such as food, water, education and health, as well as government budgets.\n\nPopulation displacement, whether as a result of climate events, lack of key resources, political issues or war, may increase the fragility of societal structures in vulnerable centres. Large scale movement could cause social unrest, as well as propagate disease transmission and accelerate the spread of future pandemics.\n\n## How these risks are mitigated/next steps\n\n- \u00b7 Our culture and EVP work aims to address the emerging expectations of the diverse talent we seek. The Brand and Culture Dashboard monitors our diversity and inclusion, colleagues' perceptions of our EVP, and whether we are living our Valued Behaviours. Management teams discuss many of these metrics (including employee survey responses) to identify actions.\n- \u00b7 We are undertaking a multi-year journey of developing future-skills amongst our colleagues by focusing on continuous learning, to balance appropriately between 'building' and 'inducting' skills into the Group.\n- \u00b7 Our internal Talent Marketplace provides colleagues with opportunities to learn through experience by signing up for cross-functional (or even cross-geography) projects.\n- \u00b7 Employees in 44 markets are on agreed flexible working arrangements. We continue to enhance support and resources to People Leaders and colleagues to help balance productivity, collaboration and wellbeing.\n- \u00b7 Our Stands continue to be operationalised through our strategy, and help address the talent pool's increased expectations of us being purpose-led.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSadia Ricke\n\nGroup Chief Risk Officer\n\n23 February 2024",

We enable individuals to grow and protect their wealth; we help businesses trade, transact, invest and expand; and we help a variety of financial institutions, including banks, public sector and development organisations, with their banking needs.\n\n## How we serve and engage\n\nOur presence in high-growth markets - and ongoing roll out of digital platforms - helps connect our clients to the global engines of trade and innovation. As part of our aim to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, our transition finance team have been working closely with our clients in hard-toabate sectors on their own transitions. This is in addition to our plan to mobilise $300 billion of Sustainable Finance between 2021 and 2030.\n\nAcross the bank, we have processes and controls to mitigate greenwashing risks, and to support transparency we publish the details of what constitutes our sustainable products and investments universe externally.\n\nWe work closely with third-party Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) data providers to support the development of product ideas, and due diligence is conducted by our in-house team on our high conviction suite of sustainable funds.\n\nOur push for a best-in-class client experience is underpinned by innovative products and digital straight-through services. This includes building capability to protect our clients against evolving risks in the ecosystem, like fraud and cyber security, and comes with education and increased client communication.\n\nTo act in the best interests of our clients, we use our insights gathered from our data alongside robust policies, procedures and the Group's risk appetite to design and offer products and services that meet client needs, regulatory requirements and Group performance targets, while contributing to a sustainable and resilient environment.\n\nFees and charges are disclosed to clients in line with regulatory requirements and industry best practice and, where available, benchmarked against competitors. For Personal and Business Banking products, agreed interest rates, fees and other charges as billed to clients are monitored and assessed locally, with global oversight.\n\nTriggers for outlier fees and charges are defined and subject to annual review. Complaints are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are one of the factors that are taken into account prior to amendments to annual interest, fees and charges.\n\nWe also assess our product portfolio for new risks to ensure they remain appropriate for client needs and aligned to emerging regulation. These quantitative and qualitative assessments, including Periodic Product Reviews, are intended to provide a complete view of whether to continue, enhance, grow or retire products.\n\nTraining is provided to frontline staff across our branches, contact centres and digital channels to identify and support vulnerable clients, and we have also implemented an educational training programme for those clients who require assistance in navigating online and mobile channels.\n\nThroughout 2023, we maintained our sharp focus on improving the client experience across the Bank. We engaged with clients to show them the opportunities trade corridors could bring and how using our network could help them flourish.\n\n## Consumer, Private & Business Banking\n\nIn Consumer, Private & Business Banking (CPBB), 2023 saw significant enhancements in digital wealth with the delivery of around 20 new capabilities across our markets. This includes client DIY Wealth Lending for Funds in Hong Kong and the UAE and MyInsure in India where relationship managers can leverage a digital tool to perform comprehensive insurance needs analysis and portfolio reviews for clients.\n\nOur focus on partnerships continues to show results with the growth of our existing partnerships business in China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Singapore, and we have expanded the partnership business to Malaysia. In 2023, the Bank launched partnerships with Ctrip in China, SeaMoney in Indonesia, and Atome in Singapore and Malaysia. These new and existing partnerships have incrementally added 2.6 million active clients, growth to 1.7 billion in balances, and a total of 7.5 billion of new disbursements with impressive revenue growth in 2023.\n\nAdditionally, we made significant progress in our advisory business with the launch of SC Wealth Select in 14 markets. SC Wealth Select aims to bring a portfolio approach to client conversations and is supported by our digital advisory tool MyWealth Advisor. Across CPBB, 8,000 colleagues have completed the SC Wealth Select e-learning training and 930 frontline colleagues have completed or are undertaking the Standard Chartered INSEAD Wealth Academy Advisory programme.\n\nImportantly, we leverage our cross-border scale by using the same technology and open architecture product platform in different markets to offer competitive products and solutions globally. Examples of this include our series of Signature CIO Funds which is now available in 12 markets, with more to come in 2024, and Wealth Saver, an innovative savings product, now available in three markets.",

CCIB also focused on building a consistent digital experience and accelerated delivery through Cash, Trade, Financial Markets and Data Solutions.\n\nRefining our processes through continuous improvement has enabled us to achieve benefits in revenue and cost savings by creating capacity and reducing client waiting times. We are transforming our bank-wide processes by taking a clientfocused, data-driven digital bank approach that will enable us to serve the needs of our clients better and faster, and reduce the amount of friction and complexity in our network.\n\nWe have set in place processes and guidelines specific to our client businesses for us to better understand and promptly address issues.\n\nWe implemented self-serve digital tools and capabilities such as chatbot, our mobile banking app, application programming interface (API) connectivity and data analytics. These have reduced operational costs and enhanced the overall client experience. Agile ways of working accelerated our decision-making processes and change delivery to create great experiences and make it easier for our clients to bank with us.\n\nWe continue to engage in partnerships that help us offer enhanced services to customers. Collaborations with Linklogis and Taulia, which is part of SAP, aid clients with supply chain financing through blockchain and dynamic discounting. Our work with the Partior platform allows us to deliver the speed, efficiency and visibility of domestic settlement systems to cross-border payments and settlements networks to absolve significant wholesale cross border payment frictions and deliver instant, 24/7 settlement of digital assets on the blockchain.\n\nOur work with digital trade transaction portal Trade Track-It integrates DHL's tracking system and Lloyd's List Intelligence vessel tracking system through API, to offer clients end-to-end visibility of their trade transaction status globally.\n\nAcross both CCIB and CPBB, throughout 2024, we will continue to listen and respond to stakeholder priorities and concerns, addressing feedback as it emerges, strengthen our digital transformation and innovation capabilities, and support our clients as they transition to net zero.\n\n## Using artificial intelligence (AI) to serve CCIB clients\n\nIn 2023, we deployed artificial intelligence (AI) and other cutting-edge technology to improve how we serve our Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking clients.

We believe that our integrated approach to ESG issues, as well as a strong risk and compliance culture, are key differentiators.\n\nThe Group delivered a strong set of results in 2023 and achieved its financial objective of a double-digit return on tangible equity (RoTE) for the year. We set out five actions in 2022 designed to accelerate delivery of this RoTE target. The strong execution of these actions over the last two years, where we either achieved our targets ahead of plan or they are well on-track, supported us to reach that milestone in 2023. We will now build on this success, taking action to deliver sustainably higher returns with a focus on driving income growth and improving operational leverage, to deliver a RoTE of 12 per cent in 2026\n\nRegular and transparent engagement with our investors, and the wider market, helps us understand investors' needs and tailor our public information accordingly. In addition to direct engagement from our Investor Relations team, we communicate through quarterly, half-year and full-year results, conferences, roadshows, investor days and media releases.\n\nWe continued to expand our use of virtual meetings during the year 2023, coupled with a growing number of face-to-face interactions. We hosted two capital market days, focusing on our Asia region and the Sustainability opportunity in May and November respectively.\n\nKey investor feedback, recommendations and requests are considered by the Board, whose members keep abreast of current topics of interest. Standard Chartered PLC's Annual General Meeting (AGM) in May was open to shareholders to attend either in person or electronically where they were provided a platform to view a live video feed of the meeting. All participants were provided with the opportunity to submit their votes and ask the Board questions.\n\nSimilarly, the Group Chairman, alongside some members of the Board, hosted a hybrid stewardship event for institutional investors in November which provided a platform for shareholders to receive an update on a number of topics, including sustainability, net zero and governance matters. The event included an open question-and-answer session across a range of key issues.",

We do this through our Third-Party Risk Management Policy. This, in conjunction with the Principal Risk Type Policies and Standards, set out the Group's minimum control requirements for the identification, mitigation and management of risks arising from the use of suppliers.\n\nOur Supplier Charter sets out our principles in relation to ethics, human rights, diversity and inclusion, and environmental performance. All newly onboarded suppliers are expected to agree with these principles. We seek to reinforce this through the terms of our standard contract templates, where possible, and we further encourage alignment by sending an annual letter to all active suppliers. This includes guidance regarding our stance on ethics and conduct, sustainability aspirations, payment processes and other relevant principles such as Anti-Bribery and Corruption. Our Charter covers all geographies and categories of suppliers, and we plan to refresh the Charter in 2024.\n\n## Supporting our suppliers to achieve net zero\n\nOur supply chain is critical to achieving the Group's sustainability aspirations, and we continue to make good progress. We encourage our suppliers to set science-based emissions reduction targets and by 2028 we plan to direct 70 per cent of our total expenditure to suppliers who have set or committed to setting science-based emission reduction targets. In 2023, we held group sessions with our suppliers to support them reduce their emissions, discuss progress and next steps.\n\n## Supporting a diverse and inclusive supply chain\n\nWe recognise the value of supply chain diversity to our business and society. In 2023, we continued to integrate supplier diversity into our business strategy and make efforts to include diverse suppliers in sourcing activities and improve spending levels with diverse suppliers as appropriate. To do this we have continued to collaborate with non-governmental organisations (NGOs), business incubators and others to help build and develop our diverse and talented supplier pool. In 2023, this included joining member-buyer events, local procurement networking activities and best practice sharing events with partners like WEConnect International - a global network supporting women-owned businesses to connect with larger companies.",

Highlighting our commitment, we have been awarded the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply Asia Excellence in Procurement Award for outstanding Diversity and Inclusion practices in procurement teams and Best Initiative to Build a Diverse Supplier Base. In 2023, approximately 40 per cent of our newly onboarded suppliers were diverse* including, for example, KASHow. KASHow is a micro-owned and predominately women-led business, which managed the logistics and planning of Standard Chartered Hong Kong's 25th marathon in 2023. In addition, KASHow was supportive of our sustainability objectives by using recycled materials for the marathon event logistics and the building of the carnival event booth.\n\n*For Standard Chartered, diverse suppliers are defined as:\n\n- \u00b7 Small enterprise (10-49 employees + turnover <USD10 million)\n- \u00b7 Micro enterprise (<10 employees + turnover <USD2 million)\n- \u00b7 Medium enterprise (50-249 employees + turnover <USD50 million)\n- \u00b7 Women owned (51 per cent or more owned by Women (South Africa 30 per cent owned by women as per local government regulations))\n- \u00b7 Ethnic minority owned (51 per cent owned by ethnic minorities)\n- \u00b7 Veteran Owned (51 per cent or more owned by veterans)\n- \u00b7 Disabled owned (51 per cent or more owned by differently abled people)\n- \u00b7 LGBT+ owned (51 per cent owned by LGBT+ (not possible in some countries due to local legal regulations))\n- \u00b7 Social enterprises (NGOs and charities)\n\n## Their interests:\n\n- \u00b7 Open, transparent and consistent tendering process\n- \u00b7 Accurate and on-time payments\n- \u00b7 Willingness to adopt supplier-driven innovations\n- \u00b7 Obtain guidance on implementation of Sustainability matters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Society\n\n## How we create value\n\nWe strive to operate as a sustainable and responsible company, working with local partners to promote social and economic development.\n\n## How we serve and engage\n\nWe engage with a wide range of civil society, international and local NGOs, from those focused on environmental and public policy issues to partners delivering our community programmes. To shape our strategy, we aim for constructive dialogue that helps us to understand alternative perspectives and ensure that our approach to doing business is understood. This includes working with NGOs that approach us about a specific client, transaction or policy.\n\nIn 2023, climate change, our net zero pathway, human rights and nature continued to underpin many of our conversations. We primarily received NGO feedback via our public inbox and responded to queries in line with our standards. For complex issues such as climate change, we held bilateral virtual meetings with NGOs to exchange perspectives in greater depth.\n\nIn 2023, together with the Standard Chartered Foundation, we continued to engage with NGOs, charities and other organisations to empower the next generation to learn, earn and grow through Futuremakers by Standard Chartered, our global community initiative to tackle inequality by promoting greater economic inclusion. We provided education, employability and entrepreneurship support to more than one million young people, with 62 per cent of those engaged being women.\n\nTo close the gender gap and promote access to finance, we piloted financing facilities to support women-led microbusinesses with green and social ambitions. At the UN Climate Change Conference, COP 28, we held a Futuremakers Youth Panel in Dubai, and online in Nairobi to generate insights on scaling tech solutions for a green and inclusive economy. In 2024, we will conduct a study on our social return on investment to assess the impact of Futuremakers.\n\nBy offering three days paid volunteering leave, we instilled a strong culture of volunteering where 61 per cent of our colleagues contributed over 76,000 days giving back to the community. In 2024, we will increase our skills-based activities leveraging our colleagues' skills to deepen our impact, with a target of 75,000 skills-based hours across our footprint.\n\n## Their interests\n\n- \u00b7 Climate change and decarbonisation\n- \u00b7 Nature\n- \u00b7 Human rights\n- \u00b7 Financial inclusion\n- \u00b7 Economic empowerment\n- \u00b7 Gender equity\n- \u00b7 Community impact.",

To lead the way in addressing the evolving needs of our clients and advances in technology, we are developing a workforce that is futureready, and are co-creating with our employees to build an inclusive, innovative and client-centric culture that drives ambition, action and accountability.\n\n## How we serve and engage\n\nBy engaging employees and fostering a positive experience for them, we can better serve our clients and deliver on our Purpose. A culture of inclusion and ambition enables us to unlock innovation, make better decisions, deliver our business strategy, live our valued behaviours and embody our brand promise. We proactively assess and manage people-related risks, such as, capacity, capability and culture, as part of our Group Risk Management Framework.\n\nOur People Strategy, which was approved by the Board, stays relevant and future-focused, with external events having accelerated many of the future of work trends which continue to inform our approach.\n\n## Their interests\n\nTranslating our here for good brand promise and Purpose of driving commerce and prosperity through our unique diversity into our colleagues' day-to-day experience is critical to us remaining an employer of choice across our footprint. The research we have on our Employee Value Proposition (EVP) tells us that our existing and potential employees want to: have interesting and impactful jobs; innovate within a diverse set of markets and for a spectrum of clients; cultivate a brand that sustainably drives commerce and offers enriching careers and development; and be supported by great people leaders. They want these elements to be anchored in competitive rewards and a positive work-life balance. The employment proposition is a key input to our People Strategy which supports the delivery of our business strategy.\n\n## Listening to employees\n\nFrequent feedback from employee surveys helps us identify and close gaps between colleagues' expectations and their experience. In addition to our annual survey, colleague sentiment is captured more frequently, through a rolling culture survey and through surveys at key moments for our employees, such as when they join us, when they leave, and when they return to work after parental leave. In addition to leveraging inputs from employee surveys, the Board and Management Team also engage with and listen to the views of colleagues through interactive sessions. More information on the Board's engagement with the workforce can be found on page 161 in the Directors' report.\n\nIn 2023, our annual My Voice survey was conducted in May and June: 87 per cent of our employees (69,935) and 58 per cent of eligible agency workers (2,203) participated in the survey. Key measures of employee satisfaction have continued to improve year-on-year, with an 8.3 point increase in our employee Net Promoter Score (NPS) (which measures whether employees would recommend working for us) as well as a 3 percentage point increase in our employee engagement index. Over 87 per cent say that the Group meets or exceeds their expectations. More colleagues are saying that we are simplifying the client experience, that we are collaborating better to deliver results, that decisionmaking is becoming easier and our processes are becoming more efficient. It is also encouraging to see that 97 per cent of employees feel committed to doing what is required to help the Group succeed, and 90 per cent feel proud about working for the Group. The consistent increase in scores indicates that we are continuing to improve as a place to work.\n\nThis is also underscored by the 'Great Place to Work' certifications that we have received across multiple markets, including in India, Vietnam, Bahrain, Poland, the UK and the US. Our Glassdoor rating (out of five) has increased from 3.7 in 2019 to 3.9 in 2023, and 77 per cent would recommend working with us to friends. We also continue to be recognised as an employer of choice and details of our accolades can be found on page 522 of the Report and on sc.com/awards.\n\nAll of this is indicative of our progress in further strengthening our EVP to attract, retain and grow the skills and talent that are critical to delivering our strategy and outcomes for clients.\n\n## Strengthening our culture of high performance\n\nAs the Group transforms to achieve our strategic ambitions, we continue to embed our refreshed approach to managing, recognising and rewarding performance. We are strengthening a culture of ambition, action and accountability by increasing the frequency of performance and development conversations and emphasising the importance of two-way feedback. We are placing greater focus on recognising outperformance that is driven by collaboration and innovation, and are encouraging more aspiration during goal-setting and flexibility in reward decisions (supported by the removal of formulaic performance decisions starting 2022).\n\nBehavioural changes are visible. Colleagues are telling us that they are having more regular performance check-ins with their leaders - with over two-thirds doing so at least every quarter. In 2023, almost 250,000 pieces of feedback were exchanged among colleagues (which is close to 1.4 times the amount of feedback exchanged in 2021, before our refreshed approach was launched across the Group). We know that recognition is also an important enabler of high performance, and we have launched a digital platform in January 2024 to encourage democratised, peer-to-peer recognition for all colleagues.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Employees continued\n\nThe wellbeing of our colleagues is critical to sustainable high-performance, and supporting their health, safety, and resilience continues to be a key priority. In 2023, levels of high work-related stress felt by employees continued to drop. Employees felt more supported with their mental, physical, social and financial wellbeing needs, and their satisfaction with work-life balance continued to increase. Globally, colleagues are provided with access to wide-ranging support and tools to manage their wellbeing, including several progressive benefits, a mental health app, an employee assistance programme, wellbeing toolkits, and a network of trained mental health first aiders. We continue to tackle the drivers of work-related stress, which includes inserting wellbeing skills-building into learning interventions.\n\nWe have been embedding the flexible working model that we initiated in 2021, combining flexibility in working patterns and locations, to enhance both the productivity and experience of our workforce. Over 52,000 employees in 44 markets are now on agreed flexi-working arrangements, with the majority having signed up to work from the office for two to three days a week. Our model consciously balances client needs and business priorities with individual choice, allowing us to be inclusive of the diverse needs of our workforce. Colleagues continue to adopt ways of working that balance the benefits of remote working with face-to-face interactions. Toolkits and guidance are being provided to people leaders and individuals to help navigate flexible working. These include support on organising team and individual work to enhance productivity and wellbeing; on leading in key moments such as onboarding new team members, returning from parental leave and during performance conversations; and on strengthening connections in flexible work environments. We also continue to re-imagine our physical workspaces with the relevant infrastructure and technology to provide hubs for teamwork, collaboration and learning. As a result of these ongoing interventions, employees who are working flexibly express greater satisfaction with overall employee experience and work-life balance in comparison to employees working fully remotely or fully in the office. Also, over 80 per cent of colleagues expressed in the 2023 My Voice survey that flexible working has had a positive impact on their ability to get work done and to collaborate, as well as their sense of belonging and social connection with others.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our approach to flexible working at sc.com/flexibleworking\n\n## Building leadership capabilities\n\nExceptional performance needs exceptional leadership, and it is encouraging to see that manager NPS continues to increase to 37.9 points in 2023 (up 4.8 points year-on-year). Engaging, developing, and measuring our people leaders continues to be a critical enabler of our performance and culture. Our Leadership Agreement sets out clear expectations from our leaders to Aspire, Inspire and Execute. It also forms the foundation of a modernised leadership development curriculum through which one-third of our people leaders are being covered each year to help them build new skills and habits across different leadership stages - including skills on coaching, performance management in business-specific contexts, leading for transformation, and leading through ambiguity. While more than 4,700 leaders learned through face-to-face leadership programmes during the year, leadership skill-building was also made accessible to all colleagues to build the capability deeper into the organisation. Almost 17,000 employees signed up to our 60-day Leadership Health journey of regular micro-learning activities; over 26,000 accessed the monthly Leadership Insights newsletter and over 8,500 tuned into leadership sessions during our annual Global Learning Week.\n\nIn 2023, 84 per cent of our people leaders received feedback through our 'always on' feedback tool available to all colleagues, as well as through the structured 360-degree feedback tool that is available to mid-to-senior people leaders. Leaders are also provided a consolidated view of the environment they are creating for their teams, and feedback on their leadership skills, as part of their Leadership Dashboard. The dashboard has been designed to bring transparency to performance and development conversations, and to highlight the value we place on leadership.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead our Leadership Agreement at sc.com/leadershipagreement\n\n## Developing skills of future strategic value and enabling careers\n\nTo keep pace with technological innovation, evolving customer expectations and the changing world of work, we are adopting a 'skills-led' approach - accelerating the development of future skills among our workforce and bringing in greater agility to how skills are deployed to areas of opportunity across the Group. We are helping employees build the skills needed for high performance today, to reskill and upskill for tomorrow, and to be global citizens who understand the changing nature of the world in which we operate. This includes helping them strengthen a combination of human and technical skills, as well as building a culture of continuous learning that empowers them to grow and follow their aspirations. Since 2020, the average hours invested by employees in personal development has increased by 23.9 per cent to 26.8 hours in 2023.",

        "page_content": "## Stakeholders\n\ncontinued\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employees continued\n\nLearning in classrooms is balanced with learning through our online learning platform diSCover, which is also accessible via a mobile app. Over 70,000 colleagues actively used the platform in 2023 and 30,000 colleagues have used one or more of our Future Skills Academies which include the Data & Analytics, Digital, Cyber, Client Advisory, Sustainable Finance and Leadership Academies. Employees are also building and practicing new skills on the job by signing up for projects (often cross-functional and cross-location) through our AI-enabled internal Talent Marketplace platform. Since its launch in 2020, over 28,000 employees have registered on the platform, with over 2,000 of them being assigned to projects. Deploying their skills at speed across our network has resulted in unlocking over $6.2 million in terms of productivity. By combining such project opportunities with purposeful internal talent moves, we continue to enhance the career experience of colleagues. The Marketplace also acts as a platform to connect employees to mentors across the Group.\n\nThe 2023 My Voice scores indicate that our efforts are in the right direction, as employee satisfaction with development and growth opportunities increased compared to previous years, and highlight that this is an area we must continue to focus on.\n\nWe continue to expand targeted learning journeys to upskill colleagues towards critical 'future' roles where our strategic workforce planning analysis has predicted an increasing need for talent, including universal banker, data translator, cloud security engineer, product owner/scrum master and cyber security analyst roles. At the same time, we have been strengthening and scaling the proposition to support colleagues in building systemic skills, in areas such as sustainability, innovation, data, digital and leadership, which an increasing population of the workforce is anticipated to need to keep pace with the changes happening in the sector.\n\n## Embedding a focus on skills across the employee lifecycle\n\nIn our CCIB business, we have been embedding a focus on skills across the employee lifecycle in the way we hire, identify, develop and deploy talent. We have updated part of our skills library to develop 35 skills-based role profiles and job descriptions for the highest impact roles that will help enhance our client proposition and deliver on our business strategy. In 2024, we will further enable a democratised career and development experience for colleagues in CCIB through our internal Talent Marketplace, which will allow them to better understand and develop the skills needed to excel in their existing role as well as to grow and move to their aspired roles. It will also enable leaders and recruiters to rapidly identify, access and deploy skills at scale in a cost-efficient manner.\n\nWe are also further embedding a focus on skills across our talent management processes. Our refreshed approach to identifying the future potential of our workforce focuses on their ability against a range of skills, along with their aspiration to put these skills into action by taking on complex responsibilities (in turn moving away from the traditional emphasis on past performance being a primary indicator of future potential). Through this approach we are placing strong emphasis on learning agility to identify the talent that we want to accelerate as well as deploy in areas of highest impact for clients and the business.\n\n## Creating an inclusive workplace\n\nWe believe that inclusion is what enables our diverse talent to truly deliver impact and drive business success. Through our annual My Voice survey and supplemented by qualitative feedback gathered, we aim to better understand the lived experiences of our colleagues, and then act to make targeted and meaningful changes to further drive inclusion and enhance their experience.\n\nOur progress in this space is reflected in the 83.2 per cent of employees who shared positive sentiments around our culture of inclusion in the 2023 survey, consistent as last year. This has been enabled by continued efforts towards increasing awareness around diversity and inclusion principles, unconscious bias and micro-behaviours as well as by emphasising the importance of creating an inclusive environment - aspects that are covered in the 'When we're all included' learning programme which has been completed by more than 34,000 colleagues by the end of 2023. Further, the 'Respect at Work' e-learning programme that helps understand what constitutes harassment, bullying, discrimination and victimisation, is now mandatory for all employees.\n\nWe aim to further strengthen our inclusive culture, where all our people feel that their identity is understood and recognised for its uniqueness and anyone with the capability to excel can do so. Employees are provided, where legally permissible, with the ability to share their identity data through our internal employee portal. We are focused on initiatives that encourage and increase self-declaration (including socio-economic status in the UK), so that we can further improve colleague experience by introducing policies and interventions that are representative of the needs of our diverse workforce.\n\nOur continued partnership with Purple Tuesday is one of the many initiatives through which we are creating a work environment where colleagues are encouraged to bring their whole selves to work. The partnership is helping increase the visibility of role models and careers for those with disabilities across more than 50 markets. It is also helping to drive an ongoing conversation, to build awareness and break down myths and stereotypes when engaging with clients and colleagues with disabilities. The SC-Out Pride Leadership Summit this year saw Employee Resource Group leads, allies and advocates come together from across 14 markets to define our approach for further building a respectful, supportive, and safe work environment for our LGBT+",

We also recognise six key dates 1 across the year and use these as focal points to facilitate open dialogue on inclusion internally and externally. Through these global campaigns we engage and strengthen relationships with clients and external stakeholders, collectively raising awareness, promoting best practices and committing to take practical steps to advance the overall Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) agenda in our communities.\n\nOur gender diversity continues to grow, with more women leaders moving up to senior roles. Women currently represent 38 per cent of the Board, 14 of our CEOs are women, and representation of women in senior leadership roles increased to 32.5 per cent at the end of 2023. We are committed to continuous improvement in this area and aspire to have 35 per cent representation of women at a senior level by 2025. We remain focused on building a workforce that is truly representative of our client base and footprint. As of 2023, 31 per cent of our Board identifies as being from a minority ethnic background, above our aspiration of 30 per cent. Further, 26.3 per cent of our Global Management Team and their direct reports identify as Black, Asian or minority ethnic. In the UK, Black representation in senior leadership is 2.5 per cent and Black, Asian and minority ethnic in senior leadership is 27.8 per cent. In the US, Black/African American representation in senior leadership is 4 per cent and Hispanic/ Latinx in senior leadership is 10.1 per cent. We continue to develop strategic partnerships and experiment with programmes to widen our talent pools (such as the Spring Insights Programme in 2023 that provided a multi-day immersive experience to Black, African American, Hispanic and Latinx students in New York and London to learn about our CCIB business, and access internship opportunities).\n\nAs we work towards achieving our 2025 UK and US ethnicity senior leadership aspirations, we will also be updating these targets to extend to 2027. At the same time, we are focused on nurturing local talent in markets across Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\n\nLeadership commitment is core to our approach on D&I. Our Global D&I Council is chaired by our CEO, CCIB and Europe & Americas and comprises of enterprise-wide leaders representing various business, functions and geographies from across the Group. The Council is responsible for our overall D&I strategy, direction setting, and overseeing the implementation of sustainable and measurable improvements. In 2023, as a result of our listening exercises and data insights, we also established a Black and African Talent Steering Committee and Working Group, and appointed Group Management Team and Global D&I Council sponsors to advocate for leadership action in focus areas identified, such as career progression and the international mobility experience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our approach towards strengthening diversity and inclusion at sc.com/diversityfairpayreport",

Going beyond our minimum standard for maternity leave, all colleagues, irrespective of gender, relationship status, or how a child comes to permanently join their family, are now eligible for a minimum of 20 weeks of paid parental leave. We are also expanding medical benefits to make comprehensive coverage accessible for menopause-related treatments to all colleagues and their partners, including access to specialised medical practitioners and prescription. This is in addition to the existing support for managing menopause symptoms through flexible working options, paid leave for treatment, workspace adjustments and access to menopause counselling. We believe that such benefits continue to be critical levellers for gender equality, encouraging women's participation in the workforce and LGBT+ inclusion, aligning to our Lifting Participation Stand.\n\n## Equal pay - gender and ethnicity pay gaps\n\nTo better understand the strengths and gaps of the organisation and develop action plans to enable the potential of our truly diverse and inclusive workforce, we have been analysing and publishing our gender pay gap statistics for our five hub locations (UK, US, Hong Kong, Singapore, and UAE) since 2017. The gender pay gap is calculated based on the approach by the UK government and compares the average pay of men and women without accounting for some of the key factors which influence pay, including different roles, skills, seniority and market pay rates.\n\nCompared with last year, our mean hourly and bonus pay gaps have decreased in most markets, particularly in the UK and the US. While this shows continuous improvement since our first disclosure, they remain at a level that signifies there are proportionally more male than female colleagues in senior roles and/or roles with higher market rates of pay.\n\nTo complement the legislative approach in the UK, we also calculate an adjusted pay gap, which compares women and men at the same hierarchy level and in the same business area. Mirroring previous years, the narrow margins for the adjusted pay gap analysis indicate that our female and male colleagues in the same business areas and at the same levels of seniority are paid similarly.\n\nIn addition to the gender pay gap analysis, we are publishing our ethnicity pay disclosure for the UK and the US for the second year, and this year we have expanded the disclosure to include hourly and bonus pay gaps for each ethnic group. The results indicate that there are proportionally more White and fewer Black, and in the case of the US, also fewer Hispanic, colleagues in senior roles and/or roles with higher market rates of pay. While our adjusted ethnicity pay gaps indicate that colleagues with different ethnicity backgrounds are paid similarly in the same business areas and at the same levels of seniority, there is still more work to be done to promote representation of different ethnic groups within the organisation.\n\nEqual pay is a key commitment in our Fair Pay Charter and we carry out checks during hiring, promotion and year-end review in all markets to challenge potential bias and ensure there is equal pay for equal work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our gender and ethnicity pay gap analysis at sc.com/ diversityfairpayreport\n\n| 2023 Gender pay gap   | UK   | Hong Kong   | Singapore   | UAE   | US   |\n|-----------------------|------|-------------|-------------|-------|------|\n| Mean hourly pay gap 1 | 22%  | 21%         | 29%         | 30%   | 21%  |\n| Mean bonus pay gap 2  | 44%  | 35%         | 40%         | 56%   | 36%  |\n\n- 1 The hourly pay gap is calculated by taking the difference between the mean female and male hourly pay, expressed as a percentage of the male amount\n\n|                             | Mean Pay Gap   | Mean Pay Gap   |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| 2023 UK ethnicity pay gap 1 | Hourly pay 2   | Bonus pay 3    |\n| Asian                       | 13%            | 26%            |\n| Black                       | 25%            | 48%            |\n| Multi-racial                | 6%             | 14%            |\n| Other                       | 14%            | 22%            |\n\n|                             | Mean Pay Gap   | Mean Pay Gap   |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| 2023 US ethnicity pay gap 1 | Hourly pay 2   | Bonus pay 3    |\n| Asian                       | 14%            | 28%            |\n| Hispanic                    | 27%            | 51%            |\n| Black                       | 28%            | 51%            |\n| Dual or Multi               | 0%             | -36%           |\n\n- 1.

Since its creation, we have made substantial progress, by continuing to embed sustainability across the organisation and strengthening our support for clients on their transition journeys. The longer-term vision and areas of focus expressed by our Stands and our Sustainability Aspirations have helped shape our nearterm execution priorities defined by our Sustainability Strategic Pillars.\n\nOur footprint - with its access to capital markets and operations in regions most vulnerable to climate change - means that Standard Chartered sits at the intersection between capital providers and those who need it most. For many of our markets and clients, getting to net zero will be a long and complex task. Their transition must be on a just basis to address environmental challenges without sacrificing their economic growth and social development ambitions.\n\nDelivering a just transition brings significant opportunity for innovation and growth. To leverage this, we created a series of thematic innovation hubs in 2023, covering: Adaptation Finance, Blended Finance, Carbon Markets and Nature Positive Solutions. Each hub is helping to advance emerging thematic areas of sustainability that are nascent, but offer the potential for scale, and are where the Group has a core competency. The themes covered by the hubs are particularly relevant to our clients across our footprint markets and serve to support innovation at the forefront of sustainability.\n\nFurthermore in 2023, we expanded our work on social sustainability, with a dedicated investment to bring the breadth of our Sustainable Finance offering together with our commitment to the people and communities we serve.\n\nWe have also welcomed new team members including experts in blended finance, sustainable and transition finance, climate risk, nature and carbon accounting, building up our people power to allow us to effectively leverage the CSO organisation across the Group, as we look to deliver on our strategy.\n\nAs I reflect on my first full year at the bank, it is clear that our sustainability ambition has the unwavering commitment of the Group's Board of Directors and the Management Team, backed by an extraordinary level of enthusiasm and engagement. Looking ahead to 2024, my priority is on driving our four Sustainability Strategic Pillars: scaling up Sustainable Finance; further embedding sustainability across the Group; delivering on our net zero roadmap; and leveraging our innovation hubs to drive ecosystem development and future income.\n\nThis section provides an overview of the Group's approach to sustainability and details on how we manage climate risk. A more detailed Sustainability Review section, including our broader risk view, is available from page [XX] to [XX] for further information. Our Sustainable Finance franchise has generated over $720 million^, or over six per cent of our total Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking (CCIB) income in 2023, a year-on-year growth rate of 42 per cent. Following on from this performance and building on the momentum in our business, our focus turns to our stated ambition to deliver at least $1 billion in sustainable finance income in 2025. To do that, we are hard at work investing in people, systems and infrastructure to build further capability and capacity. This enables our teams across the Group to support our clients' transition and sustainable growth plans by deploying lending, cash, trade, corporate financing and advisory services, and providing capital to advance the next wave of sustainability and technological solutions.\n\n## Sustainability overview content map\n\n| Introduction and overview       | Introduction and overview                                                                 | Introduction and overview                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Page 66                 |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| and approach to  sustainability | Sustainability   Aspirations:   our long-term goals                                       | Aspiration 1:  Mobilise $300 billion of Sustainable Finance by 2030 Aspiration 2:   Operationalise our interim 2030 financed emissions  targets to meet our 2050 net zero ambition Aspiration 3:  Enhance and deepen the sustainability ecosystem | Page 68 Page 68 Page 68 |\n| and approach to  sustainability | Sustainability   Strategic Pillars:   our short-term   targets and   immediate priorities | Aspiration 4:  Drive social impact with our clients and communities Pillar 1:  Scale Sustainable Finance income                                                                                                                                   | Page 68                 |\n| and approach to  sustainability | Sustainability   Strategic Pillars:   our short-term   targets and   immediate priorities | Pillar 2:  Further embed sustainability across the organisation                                                                                                                                                                                   | Page 70 Page 71         |\n| and approach to  sustainability | Sustainability   Strategic Pillars:   our short-term   targets and   immediate priorities | Pillar 3:   Deliver on the annual milestones set forth in our net zero  roadmap Pillar 4:  Leverage our innovation hubs                                                                                                                           | Page 73 Page 75         |\n\nValues noted with a caret symbol (^) are subject to independent limited assurance by EY, report available at sc.com/sustainabilityhub .",

        "page_content": "## Pillar 3: Deliver on the annual milestones set forth in our net zero roadmap\n\nWe aim to reach net zero emissions in our financed emissions by 2050 and in our own operations by 2025. Since 2018 we have been working on aligning our direct and indirect emissions to the Paris Agreement's goal of well below two degrees Celsius of global warming by the end of the century. We focus on three areas to reduce emissions: our operations, our supply chain and financed emissions associated with our clients. The majority of our GHG emissions are linked to our lending activities, known\n\nas financed emissions. Therefore, we have prioritised our measurement and decarbonisation efforts in the highest-emitting and most carbon-intensive sectors of our portfolio, and where working with our clients can have the greatest impact. Due to our footprint - with many emerging markets reliant on carbonintensive industries - our financed emissions may increase before they decrease but our approach is to remain aligned to a science-based 1.5 degrees Celsius pathway by 2050.\n\n## High-emitting and carbon-intensive sectors with interim 2030 targets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShipping\n\nAviation\n\n## Financed emissions\n\nA brief summary of the movements in the 11 high-emitting sectors is as follows:\n\nAluminium sector emissions have trended down as the power supply into the smelters has become less carbon-intensive and the Group has funded clients with less emission intensive operations.\n\nThe physical intensity of the Automotive manufacturers' sector (CO 2 per km distance travelled) decreased slightly due to the Group having a larger exposure to zero tailpipe Electric Vehicle manufacturing within the Group's Automotive Manufacturers portfolio.\n\nThe physical intensity of the Cement sector has remained relatively consistent year-on-year. This will be a hard-to-abate sector in the medium-term until lower carbon energy sources are utilised, especially in emerging markets where we are actively engaging with our clients on their decarbonisation plans and strategies.\n\nIn the Commercial Real Estate portfolio, building intensities have fallen due to investment in regions with lower emissions power supplies and certain markets' power suppliers decarbonising. We continue to work with technology providers on solutions for individual building emissions measurement and management.\n\nAbsolute Oil and Gas emissions remained relatively stable year-on-year and are significantly lower versus the baseline year. We continued to pursue overall portfolio decarbonisation, pivoting exposure to counterparties and technologies that are less carbon-intensive.\n\nThe Power sector's intensity decreased as some of our contractual obligations to coal-fired power plants ended. We also actively pursued lower emissions technologies, including new gas power plants, and expanded our renewables financing.\n\nThe emissions intensity of the Residential Mortgage portfolio has remained consistent year-on-year and will decrease over time in line with electricity grid decarbonisation.\n\nThe Shipping sector's alignment delta has worsened due to the impact from the container sector, which enjoyed very strong profits in 2022, encouraging owners to sail faster, leading to higher emissions. Looking ahead, tightening environmental regulations and mechanisms from both the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and European Union (EU) are expected to lead to better alignment between shipowners' behaviours and the Group's 2030 targets.\n\nThe Steel sector is hard-to-abate and requires significant capital to decarbonise. Decarbonisation is reliant on the shift from blast to electric arc furnaces and many of our emerging markets are at early stages of their transition journeys. While the emissions intensity of our steel portfolio remained relatively unchanged year-on-year, we are actively working with our clients in this sector to support their transition.\n\nOur Thermal Coal Mining exposure is decreasing in line with our coal revenue thresholds as detailed in our Position Statements and related contractual commitments. No new Thermal Coal Mining use of proceeds loans have been provided in line with our Position Statements.\n\nThe Group completed the sale of its global Aviation finance leasing business and the majority of its aviation lending book in August 2023. Noting the distortive effects that the sale of this business would create in our emissions profile, the progress against this target has been paused for year-end 2023. This will be re-assessed based on the size and materiality of the remaining portfolio in 2024.\n\nIncluded in analysis\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2024",

All targets have been informed by what the Group considers pre-eminent scientific forward-looking scenario providers. This includes the International Energy Agency (IEA) for energy sectors, the Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) for metals, International Maritime Organization (IMO) for shipping and Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) for the residential real estate sector.\n\nFor our Scope 3 financed emissions, we set science-based targets accounting for differing states of transition readiness across our markets. Due to our footprint - with many emerging markets reliant on carbon-intensive industries - our financed emissions may increase before they decrease. The upper end of our 2030 target may represent low-overshoot scenarios. However, our approach is to remain aligned to a science-based 1.5 degrees Celsius scientific pathway by 2050. Given our science-based approach, we will strive to update our targets both as the scientific community updates their reference scenarios and as data availability improves.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 Strengthened our Oil and Gas emissions metric from a revenue-based intensity to an absolute financed emissions target and trajectory. This places an emissions budget on the sector and requires a reduction of 29 per cent by 2030 when calculated from a 2020 baseline, aligned with the IEA's NZE trajectory. Our approach ensures we maintain a direct link to absolute GHG emissions in the Oil and Gas sector and allows us to directly assess our progress with the IEA NZE scenario that we have set our target against. By moving away from a revenue-based intensity metric, we remove an element of financial volatility and complexity from our calculations that could restrict transparency and accountability in measuring and disclosing our financed GHG emissions. Oil and Gas is the second sector for which the Group set an absolute financed emission target, in addition to our target for Thermal Coal Mining.\n- \u00b7 Updated our Power and Steel sector targets from a revenue-based intensity metric to a production-based intensity metric (i.e., emissions intensity per unit of production). The progression from an economic-based intensity to a production/physical-based intensity reduces the financial volatility in the calculation and improves the connection to clients' actual GHG emissions by linking directly to units of production, or a physical activity.\n\nWe published the second edition of the Group's 'Net zero methodological white paper - The journey continues', which sets out the methodology, assumptions and scientific pathways for each high-emitting sector and is available via sc.com/sustainabilityhub .\n\n|          |                           |                       |                                 | 2030                     | 2030                                      | 2022 3                          | 2022 3                          | 2021 3                          | 2021 3                           |\n|----------|---------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Sector 1 | Sector 1                  | Emissions  approach 2 | Scientific  reference  scenario | 2030 Target              | 2030 Target  reduction   % from  baseline | Absolute  emissions  (MtCO 2 e) | Production/  Physical intensity | Absolute  emissions  (MtCO 2 e) | Production/   Physical intensity |\n| CCIB w   | CCIB w                    | CCIB w                | CCIB w                          | CCIB w                   | CCIB w                                    | CCIB w                          | CCIB w                          | CCIB w                          | CCIB w                           |\n|          | Aluminium                 | Production  intensity | MPP                             | 6.1 tCO 2 e/t  Aluminium | Maintain                                  | -

        "page_content": "## Pillar 4: Leverage our innovation hubs\n\nAnnounced in 2023, the four thematic innovation hubs - Adaptation Finance, Blended Finance, Carbon Markets and Nature Positive Solutions - focus on emerging sustainability themes that are nascent but ripe for scale, aligned to areas where the Group has a core competency, and are particularly suited to clients in our footprint markets.\n\nEach hub is transversal, run by senior leaders in the CSO organisation, and aims to identify opportunities for future returns outside of our core range of traditional products and services. By being deliberate in demonstrating leadership to advance the ecosystem in these emerging thematic areas, the Group will be well-positioned to take advantage of the significant and differentiated revenue potential that will result from maturation of these themes in the future.\n\n## 1. Adaptation Finance\n\nThere is an urgent global need to unlock and scale public and private climate adaptation finance to build shared societal resilience, especially across our footprint markets, where adaptation represents both a risk and an opportunity for clients and communities.\n\nAcknowledging our geographical footprint and the multiplier effect of investment in adaptation - where every dollar spent on adaptation this decade could generate up to $12 of economic benefit - it is our ambition to act decisively and mobilise others on adaptation.\n\n## 2. Blended Finance\n\nThe Independent High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance estimate that by 2030 there will be a $2.5-3 trillion per year financing gap between current baselines and what is required to deliver the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in emerging markets and developing countries other than China. Blended finance - using concessional public funds to mobilise much larger volumes of private capital - can help to close this gap. We work to bring together public and private expertise across the Group to help commercialise blended finance.\n\n## 3. Carbon Markets\n\nA high-integrity carbon market, combined with corporate commitments to cut emissions and high standards of reporting can accelerate the global progress towards net zero by 2050.\n\nThe use of high-quality carbon credits can play a part in a multi-faceted and urgent approach to decarbonisation, as it enables climate action in sectors and geographies that remain severely underfunded today.\n\nCarbon credits can be complementary to a credible corporate net zero transition plan and help bridge the gap between the emissions reductions that can be implemented now, and the longer lead time for technological solutions that are yet to scale.\n\n## 4. Nature Positive Solutions\n\nIt is estimated that over half of global GDP is moderately or highly dependent upon nature. Despite its importance, biodiversity is rapidly declining. Having applied international environmental and social standards in our financing for more than 20 years, our presence in markets with some of the richest biodiversity in the world positions us to engage with a range of stakeholders. We are guided by our commercial ambition to increasingly shift financial flows toward naturepositive outcomes and thereby contribute to the halting and reversing of biodiversity loss.\n\nIn 2023, we closed the Group's first Adaptation Finance transaction - an adaptation letter of credit with a parametric insurance provider for the renewable energy sector.\n\nWe also collaborated with KPMG and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) to develop the market's first Guide to Adaptation and Resilience Finance (GARF), which was announced at COP28 and is due to be published in early 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more see our Adaptation Economy report via sc.com/adaptation-economy or page 118\n\nIn 2023, we worked through international fora and industry groups (e.g., GFANZ) to leverage the Group's expertise and support - alongside other international banks blended finance projects and programmes, including the development of frameworks for early coal retirement, and hosted both the Vietnamese and Indonesian governments as they launched their Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) events at COP28.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more on Blended Finance see page 118\n\nStandard Chartered has been at the forefront of several initiatives that are working to ensure that high-integrity, scalable carbon markets develop. We offer trading, advisory, financing and risk management services to our clients around the world.\n\nIn 2023, we were involved in some of the largest carbon market transactions, including the Regional Voluntary Carbon Market Company (RVCMC) and Climate Impact X (CIX) auctions, and established primary supply partnerships with clients in Kenya, Brazil, China and Vietnam.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more on Carbon Markets see page 119\n\nNature is also a critical lever for climate change mitigation and adaptation and the hub collaborates with the Carbon Markets and Adaptation Finance hubs to explore natural climate solutions and ecosystem-based adaptation opportunities.\n\nIn 2023, we conducted an initial impact and dependency assessment to identify our exposure to potentially material sectors in our CCIB segment. In January 2024, we joined a cohort of early adopters of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) framework, preparing to publish our first TNFD-aligned disclosures in early 2026.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more on Nature Positive Solutions see page 119",

Board-level oversight is exercised through the Board Risk Committee (BRC), and regular Climate Risk updates are provided to the Board and BRC. At an executive level, the Group Risk Committee has appointed the Climate Risk Management Committee (CRMC), consisting of senior representatives from business, risk, and other functions such as audit, which oversees the implementation of our Climate Risk workplan and progress made by the Group in meeting regulatory requirements. The CRMC meets at least six times a year to monitor the Group's Climate Risk profile, review, challenge and provide input on climate-related disclosures and stress tests and provide oversight on the development and results of climate models. We have also strengthened country and regional governance oversight for the Climate Risk profile across our key markets in 2023 by cascading relevant Risk Appetite metrics, supported by management information.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the Group's governance approach for climate-related risks and opportunities see pages 120 to 123\n\nWe are continuously expanding the scope and coverage of our risk appetite metrics for enhanced risk identification and management.

Risk Framework Owners for the relevant Principal Risk Types are responsible for embedding such requirements within their Risk Type Frameworks, policies, standards, as well as risk appetite statements and metrics as appropriate and ensuring compliance to the minimum requirements defined by the Climate Risk Policy. In 2023, we have continued to build on embedding Climate Risk into existing risk-management processes, focusing on a 'Business as Usual' state to identifying, assessing, and monitoring across risk types.\n\n| Risk type                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Credit Risk -   CCIB                  | We assess Climate Risk vulnerabilities and readiness levels for ~85-90 per cent of the CCIB corporate  portfolio for subsequent consideration within our credit decisioning process.

        "page_content": "## Scenario analysis\n\nIn 2023, significant progress was made to enhance our climate scenario design and analysis capabilities. We assessed the resilience of 95 per cent of CCIB Exposure at Default across three external scenarios based on Version 3 of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). These were Net Zero 2050, Delayed Transition and Current Policies and three internal scenarios. The internal scenarios include a Base Case linked to current sovereign commitments to meet their net zero targets, and two short term 'tail risk scenarios' to assess Transition Risk from a green trade war and Physical Risk from population migration linked to climate change. The tail scenarios also include second order impacts such as food price inflation and displacement leading to decreased productivity. The severity of the scenarios is aligned to the annual cyclical scenario and driven by GDP shocks in our key markets.\n\nAcross the NGFS scenarios, the impact on incremental Expected Credit Loss (ECL) as of 2050 for the overall CCIB portfolio is highest in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, followed by Delayed Transition and Current Policies, primarily driven by impact on our corporate clients. Sectors such as Oil and Gas, Construction, Transportation and Utilities are most impacted, primarily due to the rise in carbon prices in the scenarios and to some extent, by the consequent macroeconomic changes. For internal scenarios, the impacts of GDP and second order risks in the short-term impacts corporate clients across Transportation, Automobiles, Construction, and Commercial Real Estate sectors. The highest impact in the short-term (2030) is seen in the tail transition risk scenario.\n\nResults from the scenario analysis are consistent with the hot spots identified with our net zero strategy across highemitting sectors. At a client level, outputs from scenario analysis inform our Climate Risk Assessments, while at a portfolio level we have put in place Risk Appetite metrics to measure stressed losses under the Base Case and Net Zero 2050 scenarios.\n\nKey limitations include: (i) benign impact from physical risk due to nascent methodologies for transforming the level of physical risk into business disruption, which is compounded by lack of client-level asset locations; (ii) assuming static balance sheets; and (iii) client business models remaining unchanged.\n\nIt's also pertinent to note that while the results do not factor in the potential impact from management actions from our net zero strategy, outputs were reviewed by an expert panel comprising first line and second line representatives, followed by a discussion at the Climate Risk Management Committee and subsequent update to the Board Risk Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the Group's approach to scenario analysis, please refer to pages 309 to 313\n\n## Qualitative review of climate risks and opportunities in annual business strategy and financial planning\n\nIn 2023, Climate Risk was considered as part of our formal annual corporate strategy and financial planning process. In addition, we developed management scenarios with an aim to strengthen business strategy and financial planning to support the Group's net zero roadmap.\n\nWe use both qualitative and quantitative aspects focusing on revenue reliance from clients in high-emitting sectors and/or locations in regions most exposed to physical risk, considering adequacy of mitigation plans. The results are then independently reviewed by regional and client-segment Chief Risk Officers (CROs) and the ESG and Reputational Risk team. Climate Risk impact is also included in the Risk review of our Corporate Plan, which is considered by the Board as part of their approval of the overall Corporate Plan. The 2024 Corporate Plan includes an increase in loan impairment due to the impact from Climate Risk.\n\nIn most cases, the physical and transition risks identified were assessed to be well controlled in the short term. We are starting to work with our clients in high-emitting sectors by prioritising sustainable finance products to decarbonise their business models and help enable their transition journeys. We also continue to proactively work with clients in sectors with lower carbon intensity and emissions such as clean technology to support the growth of these industries. Our Sustainable and Transition Finance product suite and our dedicated Sustainable Finance, Transition Acceleration and ESG Advisory teams, are a robust response to transition risks in the short term, strengthening our resilience towards a two degrees Celsius or lower transition scenario. However, longer-term transition risks were highlighted, particularly for the Africa and Middle East region, given its dependency on fossil fuels; and longer-term physical risks were deemed to be most relevant for the Asia region.\n\n## Regulatory landscape\n\nKey financial regulators across our footprint have proposed or set supervisory expectations on climate and environmental risk management. Those expectations are broadly aligned with the Basel Committee principles for the management of climate-related financial risks, but local implementations vary.\n\nWe have been and are actively engaging with industry bodies and regulators to drive consistency in policymaking across our markets. A process has been established for tracking various Climate Risk-related regulatory developments and obligations set by both financial and non-financial service regulators at Group, regional and country level, with roles and responsibilities set out in the Group's Climate Risk Policy. Regulatory requirements or enhancements are recorded through workplans across various country and regional teams.",

The directors will continue to monitor and consider the appropriateness of this period.\n\nThe directors have reviewed the corporate plan, the output of the Group's formalised process of budgeting and strategic planning. For the 2024 Corporate Plan, the forward-looking cash flows and balances includes the anticipated impact of global interest rates on revenues and inflationary pressure on costs . The Corporate Plan is evaluated and approved each year by the Board with confirmation from the Group Chief Risk Officer that the Plan is aligned with the Enterprise Risk Management Framework and within Group Risk Appetite Statement and considers the Group's future projections of profitability, cash flows, capital requirements and resources, liquidity ratios and other key financial and regulatory ratios over the period. The Corporate Plan details the Group's key performance measures, of forecast profit, CET 1 capital ratio forecast, return on tangible equity forecasts, cost to income ratio forecasts and cash investment projections. The Board has reviewed the ongoing performance management process of the Group by comparing the reported results to the budgets and corporate plan.\n\nThe Group performs enterprise-wide stress tests using a range of bespoke hypothetical scenarios that explore the resilience of the Group to shocks to its balance sheet and business model.\n\nTo assess the Group's balance sheet vulnerabilities and capital and liquidity adequacy, severe but plausible macro-financial scenarios explore shocks that trigger one or more of:\n\n- \u00b7 Global slowdowns including recessions in China, Asian and Western economies that can be acute or more protracted, resulting in severe declines in property prices\n\n- \u00b7 Sharp falls in world trade volumes and disruption to global supply chains, including the severe worsening of trade tensions and rise of protectionism.\n- \u00b7 Inflationary pressures in the global economy including volatility in commodity prices\n- \u00b7 Significant rises in interest rates and depreciation in emerging market currencies, resulting in heightened sovereign risk\n- \u00b7 Financial market volatility, including significant moves in asset prices driven by a combination of macroeconomic and geopolitical events\n\nThis year, the primary focus has been on:\n\n- \u00b7 The effect of high interest rates and persistent inflation, including spikes in the oil price, combined with severe market volatility and severe economic downturns in China and other economies.\n- \u00b7 The impact of intensifying geopolitical tensions on economic and financial activity in our footprint markets including an assessment of both financial and operational risks.\n- \u00b7 Testing liquidity resilience of the Group in case it experiences a very severe stress informed by different, actual stress events observed for e.g. Silicon Valley Bank or by Credit Suisse\n\nIn 2023, the Group undertook a number of Climate Risk stress tests, including those mandated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Central Bank UAE and internal management scenario analysis. We expanded our portfolio coverage to assess the resilience of 95 per cent of CCIB Exposure at Default across three external scenarios based on Version 3 of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and three internal management scenarios. The three internal scenarios refer to one bespoke base case and a physical and a transition tail risk scenario.\n\nThe loan impairment (LI) intensity which measures the level of gross expected credit losses (ECL) against the exposure at default (EAD) enables us to assess the relative size of our exposure subject to potential losses from climate risks. LI intensity is not currently material.\n\nOverall, we believe that the level of potential credit losses can be mitigated by continuing to take necessary actions which the Group is already doing across sectors, engaging with our clients on this topic and support them in enhancing their climate transition plans. The impact of sea level rises under various Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios was used to explore the Physical Risk impact on the Consumer, Private and Business Banking (CPBB) residential mortgage portfolio. In 2023, Climate Risk was also considered as part of our formal annual corporate strategy and financial planning process.",

        "page_content": "Under this range of scenarios, the results of these stress tests demonstrate that the Group has sufficient capital and liquidity to continue as a going concern and meet regulatory minimum capital and liquidity requirements.\n\nTo assess the Group's business model vulnerabilities, extreme and unlikely scenarios are explored that, by design, result in the Group's business model no longer being viable these scenarios have included for the Group escalation of geopolitical tensions which results in reciprocal target sanctions and the bifurcation of financial system between the West and East , impacting key industries including technology, telecommunications and financial institutions. Insights from these reverse stress tests can inform strategy, risk management and capital and liquidity planning.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Further information on stress testing is provided in the Risk management approach section (page 314).\n\nThe directors further considered the Group's Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP), which considers the Group's liquidity position, its framework and whether sufficient liquidity resources are being maintained to meet liabilities as they fall due. Funding and liquidity was considered in the context of the risk appetite metrics, including the ADR and LCR ratios.\n\nThe Board Risk Committee (BRC) exercises oversight on behalf of the Board of the key risks of the Group and reviews the Group's Risk Appetite Statement and Enterprise Risk Management Framework, including reviewing the appropriateness and effectiveness of the Group's risk management systems, key controls and considering the implications of material regulatory change proposals, and reviewing reports on principal risks, including Climate Risk, to the Group's business.\n\nThe BRC receives regular reports reports on the Group's key risks, as well as updates on the macroeconomic environment, geo-political outlook, market developments, and relevant regulatory updates. In 2023, the BRC had deeper discussion covering: CCIB Risk deep dives with particular focus on change management and regulatory programmes; the CPBB portfolio, particularly credit cards, personal loans, partnerships, Financial Crime and ICS risks; the Group's approach to Liquidity and Funding Risk management; Country risk including Sovereign risk; credit portfolio management activities risk and progress made in balance sheet optimisation; Reputational and Sustainability Risk including the Group's approach to Environmental, Social and Governance Risk;, Climate Risk particularly climate risk integration and scenario analysis;, Safety and Security Risk;, Credit Risk review particularly large exposures, resources and scope of climate risk assessment and stress testing; and  Chief Risk Officer treasury report, including risk observations and recommendations around the current balance sheet; SC Ventures Risk and governance. The BRC also held a joint horizon scanning session with the Audit Committee on the forward looking geo-political agenda and emerging risks.\n\nBased on the information received, the directors' considered the principal uncertainties as well as the principal risks in their assessment of the Group' viability, how these impact the risk profile, performance and viability of the Group and any specific mitigating or remedial actions necessary.\n\nFor further details of information relevant to the directors, assessment can be found in the following sections of the annual report and accounts:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group's Business model (pages 20 to 23) and Strategy (pages 24 and 25)\n- \u00b7 The Group's current position and prospects including factors likely to affect future results and development, together with a description of financial and funding positions are described in the client segment reviews and regional reviews (pages 28 to 33)\n- \u00b7 An update on the key risk themes of the Group is discussed in the Group Chief Risk Officer's review, found in the Strategic Report (pages 44 to 51)\n- \u00b7 The BRC section of the Director's report (pages 168 to 173)\n- \u00b7 The Group's Topical and Emerging Risks, sets out the key external factors that could impact the Group in the coming year (pages 48 to 51).\n- \u00b7 The Group's Enterprise Risk Management Framework details how the Group identifies, manages and governs risk (pages 314 to 319)\n- \u00b7 The Group's Risk profile provides an analysis of our risk exposures across all major risk types (page 320 to 337)\n- \u00b7 The capital position of the Group, regulatory development and the approach to management and allocation of capital are set out in the Capital review (pages 338 to 343)\n\nHaving considered all the factors outlined above, the directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of the assessment up to 31 December 2026.\n\nOur Strategic report from pages 01 to 89 has been reviewed and approved by the Board.\n\n## Our Strategic report from pages 01 to 89 has been reviewed and approved by the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBill Winters\n\nGroup Chief Executive\n\n23 February 2024",

We apply our knowledge across our market footprint and the innovative mindset of our teams to create financial solutions that help to address challenges and support sustainable growth.\n\nThe work we do to accelerate the transition to net zero, lift participation in the economy and reset globalisation is fundamental to our business. These three areas of focus are known as our Stands and inform our overall strategy, including our approach to sustainability, our advocacy efforts on behalf of our markets and engagement with our employees and society.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Stands are described in more detail on\n\npage 26 of this Annual Report\n\n## Our approach to sustainability\n\nEmbedding sustainability across our business is a strategic priority for the Group. To accelerate our sustainability agenda, the Group's inaugural Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) was appointed in 2022. Since then, our dedicated CSO organisation - which houses our Sustainable Finance, Sustainability Strategy, Net Zero Delivery, Strategic Initiatives and Environmental and Social Risk Management teams acts as a centre of excellence and a catalyst for the execution of the Group-wide sustainability strategy, including the achievement of our net zero roadmap.\n\nWe focus on delivering both our long-term sustainability goals - our Sustainability Aspirations - as well as our short-term targets and immediate priorities - our Sustainability Strategic Pillars .\n\n## Our approach to sustainability reporting\n\nThe Group includes Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and sustainability information in this Annual Report, providing investors and stakeholders with an understanding of the implications of relevant sustainability-related risks and opportunities, and progress against our objectives. In line with our 'comply or explain' obligation under the UK Financial Conduct Authority's Listing Rules, we confirm that we have made disclosures consistent with the TCFD recommendations and recommended disclosures throughout this Annual Report. For our TCFD content table please refer to page 79 and for our TCFD Summary and Alignment Index see pages 511 to 516.\n\nIn preparing this report we have given consideration to (but do not align in full with) the guidance provided by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) in 2023: IFRS S1 and IFRS S2, noting that IFRS S2, although largely based on TCFD, requires a more granular level of disclosure. IFRS S1 and S2 are voluntary standards and compliance is not yet required in the Group's listing locations.\n\nMateriality is considered to be the threshold of significance for reporting sustainability-related risks and opportunities for users of financial statements: investors and wider stakeholders. We consider guidance provided by the IFRS Foundation, which focuses on meeting the sustainability data and information needs of our investors. Determining materiality for sustainability-related risks and opportunities should consider both quantitative and qualitative aspects related to sustainable social and economic development.\n\nOur approach to sustainability reporting will continue to evolve subject to regulatory and voluntary standards across our listing locations and footprint markets. Our disclosures are guided by international standards, frameworks and principles to the extent relevant to our business. We publish an ESG Reporting Index against the disclosures captured in the GRI Universal and select Topic Standards, relevant metrics from sector-specific SASB Standards and WEF's Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability Aspirations: our long-term goals\n\nThe Group's approach to sustainability is underpinned by our Stands and shaped by our Sustainability Aspirations. During 2023, we refreshed and consolidated our Sustainability Aspirations into four overarching long-term goals, each supported by key performance indicators. Together, these reflect our commitment to our brand promise, here for good, in support of sustainable social and economic development.\n\n## Aspiration 1: Mobilise $300 billion of Sustainable Finance\n\nAcross our markets, many clients are at the early phase of evaluating the risks and opportunities associated with their transition to a low-carbon economy. We leverage a full suite of Sustainable Finance solutions - including loans, bonds, trade finance and carbon trading - to support their transition. These are underpinned by our Sustainable Finance frameworks that outline how we apply the 'green', 'sustainable' or 'transition' labels across products and transactions. We also work with corporate, retail and wealth clients to mobilise diverse sources of capital in support of social outcomes.\n\nWe have mobilised $87.2 billion^ of Sustainable Finance from January 2021 through to September 2023 against our commitment to mobilise $300 billion by 2030. We made strong progress against this target in the year and we anticipate that our future progress will not be linear as our markets mature further, providing opportunities for us to support our clients in their transition.\n\n## Sustainable Finance Mobilised 1\n\n| Product                                              | Oct 2022 -   Sep 2023 $m   | Jan 2021 -   Sep 2022\u00b9\u2070 $m   | Jan 2021 -   Sep 2023 $m Cumulative  Progress   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Use of Proceeds 2,3                                  | 7, 678                     | 11,849                       | 19,527                                          |\n| Sustainability-Linked Loans (SLLs) 3,4               | 8,319                      | 19,781                       | 28,100                                          |\n| Transition Finance 3,5                               | 418                        | 344                          | 762                                             |\n| SME Lending 3,6                                      | 1,014                      | 1,839                        | 2,853                                           |\n| Microfinance 3,6                                     | 774                        | 1,166                        | 1,940                                           |\n| Green Mortgages 3,7                                  | 538                        | 4,284                        | 4,822                                           |\n| Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A)/Advisory 8              | 1,432                      | 4,354                        | 5,786                                           |\n| Green and Social Bonds facilitated 9                 | 9,617                      | 13,806                       | 23,423                                          |\n| Total Sustainable Finance Mobilised 11               | 29,790                     | 57,423                       | 87, 2 1 3^                                      |\n| Of the above                                         |                            |                              |                                                 |\n| Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking (CCIB) | 28,238                     | 51,300                       | 79,538                                          |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking (CPBB)          | 1,552                      | 6,123                        | 7, 67 5                                         |\n| Total Sustainable Finance Mobilised 11               | 29,790                     | 57,423                       | 87, 2 1 3^                                      |\n\n- 2 Amounts include transactions with restricted use of the proceeds of the financing that align to our Green and Sustainable Product Framework.\n- 3 Lending transactions are measured as per the loan commitment/underwritten amount provided to the counterparty.\n- 4  SLLs refer to any type of loan instrument for which the economic characteristics can vary depending on whether the counterparty achieves ambitious, material and quantifiable predetermined sustainability performance targets (SPTs). The counterparties' sustainability performance is measured by applying predefined SPTs to predefined KPIs. The use of proceeds in relation to an SLL is not a determinant in its categorisation and, in most instances, SLLs will be used for general corporate purposes. SLLs are not issued in line with the Group's Green and Sustainable Product Framework.\n- 5 Amount includes any financial service provided to clients to support them to align their business and/or operations with a 1.5-degree trajectory issued in line with our Transition finance framework.\n- 6  SME and Microfinance lending which is the provision of finance to Development Assistance Committee (DAC) lower- and middle- lower income countries as per the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The inclusion of business banking is linked to the 'Access to Finance' sub-theme within the Group's Green and Sustainable Product Framework incorporating employment generation, and programmes designed to prevent and/or alleviate unemployment, including through the potential effect of small and medium enterprise (SME) financing and micro-finance.\n- 7 Green Mortgages are loans from Consumer, Private & Business Banking (CPBB) where the underlying property meets a specific energy rating. Value mobilised in 2021 includes mortgages originated before 2021 but identified as Green in 2021.\n- 8  M&A/Advisory represents where the Group is the financial advisor to the transaction. The amount attributed to M&A/Advisory mobilisation is proportional and represents the total deal size divided by the number of financial advisors on the deal.\n- 9  Capital market bonds are measured by the proportional bookrunner share of facilitated activities as determined by third-party league table rankings based on the level of services provided.\n- 10 During 2023 additional deals that meet the definition of the Group's Green and Sustainable product framework were identified and approved as sustainable resulting in a restatement to cumulative mobilisation in the prior year. Use of proceed transactions have increased from $9,820mn to $11,849mn, Transition Finance transactions have increased from $144mn to $344mn and Mergers and Acquisitions have increased from $3,184mn to $4,354mn, Sustainability Linked Loans have increased from $13,745mn to $19,781mn and Green Mortgages have increased from $3,500mn to $4,354mn.\n- 11  Values noted with a caret symbol (^) are subject to independent limited assurance by EY, report available at sc.com/sustainabilityhub .",

This will require efforts from a wide range of stakeholders, governments and the private sector to accelerate the just transition to a low-carbon, nature positive and climate-resilient economy. We aim to reach net zero in our financed emissions by 2050 and in our operations by 2025.\n\nTo date, the Group has set and disclosed science-based interim 2030 financed emissions targets for 11 high-emitting sectors, in line with guidance from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). We are working across our businesses and functions, and alongside our clients to deliver these targets, notwithstanding the challenges presented by a material portion of our markets not having a commitment to achieve net zero by 2050.\n\nScientific\n\n| Sector                    | Emissions  approach                       | reference  scenario   | Drivers of sectoral decarbonisation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Our approach in 2023 7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| CCIB                      | CCIB                                      | CCIB                  | CCIB                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | CCIB                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Aluminium                 | Production  intensity                     | MPP\u00b9                  | Decarbonisation of the power supply into the  aluminium smelter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | We have set a production intensity baseline using  CO 2 e per tonne of aluminium produced.

We aim to foster collaboration with local partners to support young people and economic development across our markets.\n\n## Futuremakers\n\nEstablished in 2019, Futuremakers by Standard Chartered is our global youth economic empowerment initiative, which aims to help disadvantaged young people learn, earn and grow.\n\nIn 2023, we contributed $14.6 million to Futuremakers, including donations from the Group and fundraising of $1.7 million from our employees and partners. With our international and local partners, in 2023 alone we reached more than one million young people through Futuremakers, including providing financial education to 159,190 unbanked or young people.\n\nWe published the latest Futuremakers Impact Report to share progress and capture lessons learned through Futuremakers. In the past five years, we have reached more than 2.1 million young people, across 43 markets. We were able to exceed our initial $75 million fundraising target reaching $93.3 million by end of 2023.\n\nNearly 517,000 of the over 2.1 million young people reached participated in intensive Futuremakers activities.

With a primary focus on women-led, impactful start-ups, this project provides dedicated financial support for micro-businesses that are addressing local and global challenges. So far, 107 young women have signed up for the alumni network and expressed interest in financing. Five investments totalling $375,000 have been agreed, and at least another three investments are expected in early 2024.\n- \u00b7 For female entrepreneurs in Kenya, at an earlier stage in establishing their sustainable, environmentally focused ventures, there is financial support from our innovative revolving loan fund with Youth Business International and Somo. As of end of September 2023, the fund has supported 60 low-income, high-potential entrepreneurs aged 18-35 from marginalised communities and contributed directly to the creation of 188 jobs.\n- \u00b7 At COP28, we held a Futuremakers Youth Panel as part of the Business Fights Poverty Climate Justice Summit. We heard first-hand from our Women in Tech alumni about their green and social ambitions, the problems they are tackling and some of the financing solutions that are needed to scale for a sustainable and inclusive future.\n\nMore than\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nyoung people improved their business-related knowledge and skills\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting young people with disabilities\n\nFuturemakers partners with Sightsavers and Youth Business International, who worked with the African Disability Forum to develop a series of inclusion resources to build greater disability confidence for readers, and help partners understand how to include young people with disabilities in their Futuremakers programmes.\n\n## Futuremakers in 2024 and beyond\n\nBased on our successes and learning since 2019, we have set out a seven-year strategy for Futuremakers to maximise impact with a consistent approach to measurement, evaluation and impact analysis.\n\nBetween 2024 and 2030 we aim to provide $120 million to Futuremakers with the ambition to create and sustain 140,000 jobs, focusing on two target groups:\n\n- \u00b7 Helping 70,000 disadvantaged young women to gain skills and sustainable employment.\n- \u00b7 Supporting entrepreneurs to build thriving green and social micro-businesses and create 70,000 jobs.\n\nAll programmes target disability, gender and financial inclusion. During 2024 we plan to develop a methodology to measure the wider societal impacts of Futuremakers, which we will then apply to all future projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about Futuremakers by Standard Chartered at sc.com/futuremakers\n\n- 1 The nine original markets for Women in Tech as part of Futuremakers were US, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, UAE, Zambia, Bahrain, Pakistan, and Korea.\n\nMore than\n\n## 39,000\n\nyoung people secured employment\n\nMore than\n\n## 12,000\n\njobs created by entrepreneurs that were supported by Futuremakers activities",

We were able to exceed our target to reach one million girls through our global education programme by the end of 2023. Since its launch, Goal has become an internationally recognised global, sport and activity-based movement operating in more than 20 markets, equipping adolescent girls with the confidence, knowledge and skills they need to be economic leaders in their families and communities.\n\nIn 2023, we announced our sponsorship of the Women of the World Foundation as their Global Girls Champion. The programme of events concludes on International Women's Day in March 2024 and aims to promote the power and potential of girls and non-binary young people in the UK and globally.\n\n## Financial inclusion\n\nIn partnership with Primark, we worked with IDEO.org to design and test peer-led, financial health training for workers in factories in Vietnam. A successful pilot with approximately 170 workers tested a model supporting individuals to identify and understand their money personality, how to set financial goals, save and invest, improve their budgeting and understand available social protections. During 2024, we intend to explore how to scale this model across our broader Futuremakers portfolio.\n\n## Employee volunteering\n\nIn 2023, 61% of colleagues gave back to their communities by contributing over 76,000 days to support worthwhile causes.\n\nOur Employee Volunteering programme won several awards, including the prestigious Lord Mayor's Dragon Award in the Inclusive Employment category, for our UK-based Futuremakers RISE (Reach, Inspire, Support, Empower) programme which focuses on employability and mentorship delivered in partnership with the East London Business Alliance. In China, Standard Chartered became the only international bank to be recognised in the Top 10 of China's Employee Volunteering Enterprises in 2023.\n\n## Health and education\n\nIn some of our footprint markets, we support projects, which provide basic health and education services as preconditions to economic empowerment.\n\n- \u00b7 In Nepal and Bangladesh we support eye health and environmental projects.\n- \u00b7 In India, we have supported eye health since 2003 and supported the screening of more than 2,700 villages to ensure they are free from avoidable-blindness.\n\nSince 2017, our WASHE (water, sanitation and hygiene education) programme has reached more than 880,000 beneficiaries, including over 416,000 women. Tangible improvements include over 100 water ATMs installed and over 5,300 sanitation facilities constructed, creating 1.07 billion litres of annual freshwater capacity.\n\n61%\n\nof colleagues gave back to their communities through employee volunteering",

Selected sustainability-related measures continue to be included in the 2024-26 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards granted to senior executives and within the 2024 Group scorecard, which contains financial and strategic measures and is applicable for the majority of our employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details can be found in the Directors' remuneration report on pages 182-216\n\n## Pillar 1: Scale Sustainable Finance income\n\nWe are building a scalable Sustainable Finance franchise, supporting our clients on their transition journeys by developing customised solutions that speak to their needs and ambitions. Our Sustainable Finance franchise generated over $720 million between January and December 2023 against our longer-term target of at least $1 billion annual income by 2025. This represents over 6 per cent of our total CCIB income in 2023, a year-on-year growth rate of 42 per cent.\n\n## Sustainable Finance income 1\n\n| Product                         | 2023 $m   |   2022 $m | YOY $m   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| Transaction Banking             | 188       |        80 | 135%     |\n| Trade & Working capital         | 96        |        60 | 60%      |\n| Cash Management                 | 92        |        20 | 360%     |\n| Financial Markets               | 393       |       326 | 21%      |\n| Macro Trading                   | 76        |        54 | 41%      |\n| Credit Markets                  | 306       |       268 | 14%      |\n| Financing & Securities Services | 11        |         4 | 175%     |\n| Lending & Portfolio Management  | 139       |       102 | 36%      |\n| Total                           | 720^      |       508 | 42%      |\n\nAs a UK-headquartered international bank we work to deploy capital across our global markets. As can be seen on the following pages and in our 2023 Sustainable Finance Impact Report, we have raised $8.4 billion of sustainable liabilities in developed markets, while 85 per cent of our $17.6 billion sustainable finance asset base is located in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\n\nIn 2023, we continued to expand and develop our Sustainable Finance product suite, with 42 product variants as set out in our Green and Sustainable Product Framework. Co-authored with Morningstar Sustainalytics - a leading ESG data, research and ratings firm - our framework is reviewed annually to ensure that it reflects the latest markets trends and industry standards.\n\nOur pureplay clients are also key in advancing our progress to achieving our Sustainable Finance goals. These are companies that generate at least 90 per cent of their revenues from activities outlined in our Green and Sustainable Product Framework. Their significance lies in their ability to deliver credible and robust impact, driven by the inherent green and socially sustainable nature of their business models and operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more in our Sustainable Finance Impact Report at sc.com/sfimpactreport\n\n## Sustainable Finance assets and SustainabilityLinked assets\n\nOur Sustainable Finance income includes net income generated from our green, social and sustainable lending activity, as well as from clients recognised as green, social or sustainable pureplays.\n\nOur Sustainable Finance assets reflect the assets on our balance sheet generated as a result of this green, social and sustainable lending activity, and it is against these assets which we raise sustainable liabilities.\n\nThe Group's Sustainable Finance asset base increased by 31 per cent to $17.6 billion between September 2022 and September 2023. The majority of our Sustainable Finance asset base ($13.6 billion of the $17.6 billion) is made up of lending to green projects such as renewable energy projects, green commercial real estate and funding for the development of rail projects.\n\nOur social finance assets make up the remaining $3.5 billion of our total Sustainable Finance asset pool and encompasses categories such as healthcare, education and access to finance in low income countries.",

We foster collaboration internally to embed sustainability across our business operations and functions. We collaborate externally with clients and other stakeholders who are aligned with our mission to drive change. This is achieved by:\n\n- \u00b7 People - Rolling out an expanding curriculum of sustainability- and climate-related training across the Group.\n- \u00b7 Processes - Integrating our 2030 sectoral net zero targets into our credit risk appetite and capital allocation processes, allowing us to track, monitor and continually assess progress against our targets.\n- \u00b7 Technology - Investing to build a robust single-source data architecture to facilitate engagement with our clients, including automated or semi-automated tools that will support decision-making and analysis of the expected impact of a transaction on the Group's financed emissions.\n\nWe aim to create a self-reinforcing cycle, which is built on established processes, clear frameworks, engagement with our clients and collaboration across risk and business teams. We support our clients to deliver on their decarbonisation plans, deploying financing and advisory services to provide capital alongside the next wave of sustainability and technological solutions in which our clients are investing.\n\n## 1. Client-level Risk analysis\n\n## 2. Portfolio Steering\n\nEnvironmental, social and climate risk assessments are integrated into credit decision-making processes for existing and new-to-bank clients 1\n\n- \u00b7 We maintain a suite of public Position Statements that outline the Group's environmental and social expectations for providing financial services to clients.\u00b2\n- \u00b7 Relationship Managers carry out client and/or transaction level Environmental and Social Risk Assessments before we provide financial services. 3\n- \u00b7 Through client-level Climate Risk Assessments (CRAs), we assess the potential financial risks from climate change using quantitative and qualitative information and assign a Climate Risk grading. 4\n- \u00b7 As part of the CRA process, a Credible Transition Plan (CTP) score is assigned for each client in highemitting sectors. 4\n\nOur transition strategy also builds on the Group's financing experience by supporting the early adopters of these services in the US and Europe, and leveraging this knowledge in our core markets across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Our aim is to work with our clients to support their transition and decarbonisation journeys and where clients evidence transition, help to accelerate progress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.

The overarching objective of our upskilling programme is to establish foundational knowledge on sustainability across the Group, while tailoring in-depth, capability-based curricula to cater to the needs of practitioners and sustaining the momentum in continuous learning in line with industry best practices.\n\nThis objective is achieved by the continued development of our in-house sustainability curricula and partnerships with leading academic institutions, including Imperial College London and Kite Climate School, to ensure that we benefit from cutting-edge expertise in sustainability and remain at the forefront of industry development. A tiered curriculum has been rolled out leveraging both in-house and external expertise via this two-pronged approach.\n\n- \u00b7 Given the role that the Board plays in sustainability governance, the Group Board and subsidiary Boards received training on climate scenarios, with a focus on regulatory expectations, key features of industry-level climate scenarios, in-house base and tail risk scenarios and key second-order impacts from climate change.\n- \u00b7 In addition, 154 country and regional CEOs and Heads of Business joined targeted training covering the energy transition and related financing opportunities, clean technology, and sustainability-related risks and regulation.\n- \u00b7 Bespoke training has been provided to clusters of practitioners across all lines of defence, ranging from CCIB, CPBB, Risk, CFCC and Audit on a broad range of topics: from how physical and transition risks may manifest, to specialised topics around how climate stress tests are conducted and how we embed Climate Risk into Credit Risk processes.\n- \u00b7 At a foundational level, we encourage all employees across our global footprint to improve their understanding on how we embed sustainability into our business, operations and communities, and how they can actively play their part in this journey. 4,870 colleagues completed this programme in 2023, a total of 20,436 colleagues since the launch in 2022.\n- \u00b7 To further embed sustainability and continuous learning into the Group's day-to-day operations, 48 ad-hoc training courses were also held throughout the year that reached 3,369 employees, covering specific learning needs and topics, including the Group's progress related to sectoral net zero target setting, sector-specific voluntary carbon markets and Sustainable Finance products and related governance.\n\nIn 2024, we plan to further refine the programmes to target specific roles in the Group and further build knowledge and expertise in Sustainable Finance and Environmental and Social Risk Management.",

Prior year data was not available for fugitive emissions. For more information on the methodology and assumptions used to calculate GHG emissions, please refer to the Environmental Reporting Criteria at sc.com/sustainabilityhub.\n- 2 Scope 2 indirect emissions include indirect emissions from purchased electricity measured under the market-based approach as set out in the GHG protocol.\n- 3 Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions calculations for the most recent reporting year were independently assured by Global Documentation Ltd., the assurance scope excluded fugitive emissions. Market-based emissions have decreased from 2022 to 2023 due to footprint reduction, efficiency gains and the purchase of additional energy attribution certificates by the Group.\n- 4  The reporting period for GHG emissions is 1 October to 30 September. This only differs for Category 1: Purchased Goods (other); Category 2: Capital goods; Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution; Category 6: Business travel (miscellaneous other than air travel) and Category 15: Investments where a period of 1 January to 31 December is used. Emissions data for these categories is also on a one-year lag with emissions reported in 2023 based on 2022 emissions data.\n- 5 Purchased goods and services (data centres) have been restated from 706tCO 2 e to 7,060tCO 2 e due to an error in converting the unit of emissions.\n- 6  Waste emissions have been restated from 498tCO 2 e to 747tCO 2 e due to an out of date emissions factor being used in prior year.\n- 7 Category 15: Investments only includes financed emissions and are measured on a one-year lag, with emissions reported in 2023 being based on 2022 emissions and financial data. Financed emissions are included on page 110. A facilitated emissions baseline was measured for the first time during the year. Refer to page 112 for more details.\n- 8  2022 absolute emissions have been restated from 58.5MtCO 2 e to 49.5MtCO 2 e. This is due to (i) reduction in shipping absolute emissions as improved data has resulted in individual ship-level fair values being obtained; (ii) pausing of aviation emissions reporting due to the sale of the Group's aviation leasing and lending business; (iii) decreases in Automotive Manufacturers' emissions due to changes in the industry emissions reporting methodology referenced earlier on page 95; (iv) decreases in emissions from the 'Others' sector where improved data has been obtained to calculate emissions; and (v) the sectoral baselining of emissions reporting for Cement and Commercial Real Estate as separate high-emitting sectors.",

In line with the Group's operational net zero target, we set year-on-year improvement targets for our footprint markets.\n\n## Our goals and targets\n\n- \u00b7 We aim to achieve net zero in our operations by 2025. We have measured and reduced our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions since 2008 and have been targeting a 90 per cent reduction in these emissions since 2018.\n- \u00b7 The Group joined RE100 in 2022, a global corporate renewable energy initiative bringing together businesses that are committed to 100 per cent renewable electricity.\n- \u00b7 In terms of waste, we aim to achieve 90 per cent avoidance of landfill by 2030.\n\n## Operational emissions\n\nWe reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30 per cent to 34,734 tonnes during 2023. Our measured real estate decreased by 7 per cent during this time. 66 per cent of electricity came from renewable sources across our portfolio. We were able to achieve this by:\n\n- \u00b7 continuing to optimise our office and branch network by retiring unused or inefficient space and creating a working environment that matches office- and hybrid-working patterns of our workforce;\n- \u00b7 having a rolling asset replacement strategy for major plant and lighting in our offices. The Group installs LED and circadian lighting, and energy efficient materials throughout all new projects;\n- \u00b7 launching a large-scale initiative in 2023 to simplify our technology estate, decommissioning underutilised or inefficient systems and their servers;\n- \u00b7 actively seeking to increase the proportion of our electricity usage that comes from renewable sources. These can take the form of power purchase agreements, clean energy contracts, on-site solar installations and renewable energy certificates; and\n- \u00b7 purchasing and retiring carbon credits for our residual operational Scope 1 and 2 emissions.\n\n## Waste\n\nIn 2023, we reduced our overall waste by 37 per cent and achieved 52 per cent avoidance of landfill (up from 31 per cent). We were able to achieve this by:\n\n- \u00b7 commencing the externally verified True Zero Waste (TZW) programme and seeing the first results in India and Poland, both achieving TZW Platinum certification;\n- \u00b7 self-certifying 313 buildings across our portfolio being free of single-use plastic in 2023. We aim to continue this programme and promote more sustainable waste management practices; and\n- \u00b7 minimising electronic waste by prolonging the lifespan of our technology assets through partnerships with third parties.\n\n## Water\n\nWe retained a water efficiency metric of less than 0.5 kilolitre per square metre in 2023 despite an increase in the proportion of our employees returning to the office. While water availability is a growing challenge in many of our markets, we did not face any issues sourcing potable water in 2023. We continue to take a responsible approach to managing water use across the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor detailed environmental performance data see page 505 or our ESG data pack at sc.com/esg-data-pack\n\nRead the principles and methodology for measuring our environment data at sc.com/environmentcriteria\n\nRead the independent assurance statement related to Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions at sc.com/environmentalassurance",

In line with the Group's sustainability agenda, we set long-term targets to decrease emissions associated with our supply chain and increase spend with diverse suppliers across our footprint.\n\nWith 11,563 suppliers, we recognise our contribution to climate impacts through the goods and services we procure. Severe weather events could result in material disruptions to our supply chain that may potentially impact our ability to serve our clients. As such, we are working to gather site locations for our material suppliers to assess their physical risk exposures, such that suitable continuity plans can be developed.\n\n## Our goals and targets\n\n- \u00b7 We targeted a 28 per cent reduction in our emissions associated with air travel from our 2019 baseline of 94,000 tCO 2 e by the end of 2023 and managed to exceed this target.\n- \u00b7 We aim to increase the breadth of our climate-related engagement with our suppliers. By 2028 we plan to direct 70 per cent of our total spending to suppliers who have set or committed to setting science-based emission reduction targets.\n\n## Supply chain-related emissions\n\n- \u00b7 Overall, our emissions associated with the products, services and equipment that we purchase and those related to business travel - Scope 3 Categories 1, 2, 4 and 6 (miscellaneous other than air travel) - have shown an estimated 17 per cent year-on-year reduction.\n- \u00b7 We have reduced our air travel emissions from our 2019 baseline of 94,000 to 60,279 tCO 2 e. Due to increased travel post COVID-19 we have seen an increase in our emissions associated with air travel in 2023. Nonetheless, the Group was able to exceed our target and managed to reduce these emissions by 36 per cent from our baseline. To ensure a downward trajectory from our baseline, we are implementing demand and control measures including upgrading how we monitor our travel volumes. To help influence behaviours, we implemented a process to charge the price of carbon credits to departmental expense budgets, while also emphasising the need to reduce emissions and avoid any non-essential business trips.\n- \u00b7 We aim to engage and work with technology partners that are committed to reducing their emissions in line with their science-based targets.\n- \u00b7 Carbon credits were purchased and retired by the Group for select categories of our value chain emissions. In 2023, these included emissions associated with air travel and outsourced on-premise data centres.\n\n## Supplier engagement\n\nEmissions data reporting among our suppliers remains limited. Therefore, we continue to use a hybrid methodology for emissions calculations using supplier-specific spend and sector average emissions data. In 2023, we:\n\n- \u00b7 continued our outreach to suppliers to collect emissions data directly from them, thereby improving the accuracy of our Scope 3 Categories 1, 2, 4 and 6 (miscellaneous other than air travel) emissions calculations and reporting;\n- \u00b7 began measuring our spending with suppliers who have set a science-based emissions reduction target or committed to setting one in the future. In 2023, we held working sessions with our suppliers to discuss progress against their plans and further opportunities for emissions reduction; and\n- \u00b7 joined forces with our key logistics partner DHL to co-invest in sustainable aviation fuel for all consignments globally through DHL's GoGreen Plus programme, which is an example of how we work with suppliers to support the Group's emission reductions goals.\n\n## Supplier Charter\n\nThrough our Supplier Charter, we expect our suppliers to support and promote environmental protection, and to comply with local environmental laws and regulations. We expect our suppliers to promote the development and distribution of environmentally-friendly technologies and manage environmental concerns in their own supply chains.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Supplier Charter can be viewed at sc.com/suppliercharter\n\npages 58\n\n- For further information on how we engage with suppliers see and 59 and for supplier spend data see page 507",

        "page_content": "## Our clients - Reducing our financed emissions\n\nThe majority of our GHG emissions are linked to our lending activities, known as financed emissions. Therefore, we have prioritised our efforts in the highest-emitting and most carbon-intensive sectors of our portfolio, and where working with our clients can have the greatest impact.\n\nA brief summary of the movements in the eleven highemitting sectors is as follows:\n\nAluminium sector emissions have trended down as the power supply into the smelters has become less carbonintensive and the Group has funded clients with less emission intensive operations.\n\nThe physical intensity of the Automotive Manufacturers sector decreased slightly due to the Group having a larger exposure to zero tailpipe Electric Vehicle manufacturing within the Group's Automotive Manufacturers portfolio.\n\nThe physical intensity of the Cement sector has remained relatively consistent year-on-year. This will be a hard-to-abate sector in the medium-term until cleaner energy sources are utilised, especially in emerging markets.\n\nIn the Commercial Real Estate portfolio, building intensities have fallen due to investment in regions with lower emissions power supplies and certain markets' power suppliers decarbonising. We continue to work with technology providers on solutions for individual building emissions measurement and management.\n\nAbsolute Oil and Gas emissions remained relatively stable year-on-year and are significantly lower versus the baseline year. We continued to pursue overall portfolio decarbonisation, pivoting exposure to counterparties and technologies that are less carbon-intensive.\n\nThe Power sector's intensity decreased as some of our contractual obligations to coal-fired power plants have ended. We also actively pursued lower emissions technologies including new gas power plants, and expanded our renewables financing.\n\nThe emissions intensity of the Residential Mortgages sector has remained consistent year-on-year and will decrease over time in line with electricity grid decarbonisation.\n\nThe Shipping sector's alignment delta has worsened due to the impact from the container sector, which enjoyed very strong profits in 2022, encouraging owners to sail faster, leading to higher emissions. Looking ahead, tightening environmental regulations and mechanisms from both the IMO and EU are expected to lead to better alignment between shipowners' behaviours and the Group's 2030 targets.\n\nThe Steel sector is hard-to-abate and requires significant capital to decarbonise. Decarbonisation is reliant on the shift from blast to electric arc furnaces and many of our emerging markets are at early stages of their transition journeys. While the emissions intensity of our steel book remained relatively unchanged year-on-year, we are actively working with our clients in this sector to support their transition.\n\nOur Thermal Coal Mining exposure is decreasing in line with our coal revenue thresholds as detailed in our Position Statements and related contractual commitments. No new Thermal Coal Mining use of proceeds loans have been provided in line with our Position Statements.\n\nThe Group completed the sale of its global Aviation finance leasing business and the majority of its aviation lending book in August 2023. Noting the distortive effects that the sale of this business would create in our emissions profile, the progress against this target has been paused for year-end 2023. This will be re-assessed based on the size and materiality of the remaining portfolio in 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, please refer to the Group's 'Net zero methodological white paper - The journey continues' via sc.com/sustainabilityhub",

All targets have been informed by what the Group considers pre-eminent scientific forward-looking scenario providers. This includes the International Energy Agency (IEA) for energy sectors, the Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) for metals, International Maritime Organization (IMO) for shipping and Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) for the residential real estate sector.\n\nFor our Scope 3 Financed Emissions, we set science-based targets accounting for differing states of transition readiness across our markets. Due to our footprint - with many emerging markets reliant on carbon-intensive industries - our financed emissions may increase before they decrease. The upper end of our 2030 target may represent low-overshoot scenarios. However, our approach is to remain aligned to a science-based 1.5 degrees Celsius scientific pathway by 2050. Given our science-based approach, we will strive to update our targets both as the scientific community updates their reference scenarios and as data availability improves.\n\n- In 2023, the Group:\n- \u00b7 Strengthened our Oil and Gas emissions metric from a revenue-based intensity to an absolute financed emissions target and trajectory. This places an emissions budget on the sector and requires a reduction of 29 per cent by 2030 when calculated from a 2020 baseline, aligned with the IEA's NZE trajectory. Our approach ensures we maintain a direct link to absolute GHG emissions in the Oil and Gas sector and allows us to directly assess our progress with the IEA NZE scenario that we have set our target against. By moving away from a revenue-based intensity we remove an element of financial volatility and complexity from our calculations that could restrict transparency and accountability in measuring and disclosing our financed GHG emissions. Oil and Gas is the second sector for which the Group set an absolute financed emission target, in addition to our target for Thermal Coal Mining.\n- \u00b7 Updated our Power and Steel sector targets from a revenue-based intensity metric to a production-based intensity metric (i.e., emission intensity per unit of production). The progression from an economic-based intensity to a production/physical-based intensity reduces the financial volatility in the calculation and improves the connection to clients' actual GHG emissions by linking directly to units of production, or a physical activity.\n\nWe published the second edition of the Group's 'Net zero methodological white paper - The journey continues', which sets out the methodology, assumptions and scientific pathways for each high-emitting sector and is available via sc.com/sustainabilityhub .\n\n## Included in analysis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2024",

PCAF recognises that capital market facilitation is essential for the climate transition. Therefore, this year we are expanding our reporting to cover facilitated emissions associated with our debt capital markets services. In line with PCAF recommendations, we are reporting our facilitated emissions separately from financed emissions due to the inherent difference in the underlying nature of these activities. The Group is reporting its baseline facilitated emissions under the 33% weighting factor in line with PCAF guidance, noting that facilitated emissions relate to the provision of a service and not financing. PCAF recognises that facilitated emissions are distinct from financed emissions given that capital market transactions are rarely held on a financial institution's balance sheet and typically a financial institution's association with the transaction is temporary.  However, the Group is also disclosing facilitated emissions using a 100% weighting factor to reflect the maximum potential GHG emissions that theoretically could be associated with capital market activities.\n\n|                        | 2021                              | 2021                              | 2021       | 2021                                                                                              |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Scope of emissions 1,2 | 33%  weighting factor 4  MtCO 2 e | 100%  weighting factor 4 MtCO 2 e | PCAF Score | Emissions in scope 5                                                                              |\n| Scope 1 and 2          | 1.5                               | 4.5                               | 3.1        | Scope 1 and 2 emissions are covered for all sectors                                               |\n| Scope 3                | 1.2                               | 3.7                               | 5.0        | Scope 3 emissions are included for Oil and Gas, Thermal Coal  Mining and Automotive Manufacturing |\n| Total 3                | 2.7^                              | 8.2^                              |            |                                                                                                   |",

The sector is heavily reliant on electricity from the local grid with over 60% of the sector's CO 2 e emissions occurring from the electricity consumed during smelting.\n\n## Baseline target and portfolio progress 2021 to 2030 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Progress in the year\n\nDuring the year, the Group measured the Aluminium portfolio baseline using a production intensity (tCO 2 e/ tonne Aluminium). A baseline of 5.62tCO 2 e/tonne Aluminium has been measured with 2021 as the baseline year. This baseline is below the Mission Possible Partnership Aluminium Sector Transition Strategy (MPP STS) pathway 2030 target of 6.1tCO 2 e/tonne Aluminium, as the Group's current exposure is to clients with lower emissions-intensive energy sources.\n\nNonetheless, we have issued facilities which have not yet been drawn to counterparties with less efficient smelters and therefore the Group's target is to maintain below the MPP STS 1.5\u00b0C pathway. Note that our MPP STS pathway has been adjusted downwards to include recycled aluminium production.\n\nWhen calculating our emissions, we measure the aluminium producer's Scope 1 and 2 emissions. This is in line with the 'Fixed System Boundary' set out by the SAFF (Sustainable Aluminium Finance Framework).\n\nDuring the year the physical intensity of the portfolio decreased by 18% from 5.62tCO 2 e/tonne Aluminium to 4.59tCO 2 e/tonne Aluminium. This was due to year-on-year decreases in exposure to some of the Group's higherintensity primary aluminium producing clients.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransition alignment required\n\n- 1 Emissions contribution per the IEA's World Energy Outlook 2023.\n- 2 Graphs reflect 2022 balance sheet values reported during 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   Balance in  scope ($bn) | 2030  interim target                   | Cumulative  performance  versus baseline   |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n|                       2.8 | 66-100g CO 2 /V.km  (44-63% reduction) | -7%                                        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sector background\n\nThe automotive industry is a significant contributor to climate change through annual exhaust emissions, accounting for 8% 1 of global CO 2 emissions. Transitioning from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric vehicles (EVs) is crucial to reach net-zero by 2050 through decreasing the demand of Oil and Gas products.\n\n## Baseline target and portfolio progress 2021 to 2030 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Progress in the year\n\nDuring the year the Group re-baselined the emissions intensity reported for the 2021 baseline year from 160gCO 2 /V.km to 178gCO 2 /V.km. This was due to the industry's progress in adopting a test procedure that better reflects driving conditions in the real world. This change in assumption was completed by the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) through a Worldwide Harmonised Light Duty Driving Test Procedure, which has been globally adopted as the standard against which all global manufacturers are evaluated.\n\nThe Group's target aligns with two scenarios of the IEA, the IEA NZE and the IEA APS.\n\nWhen measuring the sector emissions, the boundary covers Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) of newly manufactured light duty vehicles. The Group includes Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (excluding well-to-tank emissions) in our financed emissions calculation. For Scope 3 we include the lifetime tailpipe emissions of the vehicles produced during the reporting cycle and a factor derived from supply chain emissions of the OEM.\n\nThe Group's sector intensity for 2022 is 165gCO 2 /V.km, a 7% decrease from 178gCO 2 /V.km. This emission decrease is due to a larger exposure to zero tailpipe EV manufacturing within the Group's Automotive Manufacturers portfolio.",

The primary source of carbon dioxide emitted is due to the chemical reaction that takes place between limestone and heat throughout the manufacturing procedure.\n\nBy increasing energy efficiency and utilising alternative fuels in the limestone heating process, the industry can reduce its carbon emissions.\n\n## Baseline target and portfolio progress 2021 to 2030 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Progress in the year\n\nDuring the year the Group measured its 2021 balance sheet baseline and current year emissions progress in addition to setting a target. Our target range has been set using the IEA NZE pathway.\n\nWhen calculating our portfolio emissions, the midstream processes are measured, including heating of limestone and combustion of the fuels used in the cement kiln and other plant processes.\n\nIn setting our emissions baseline and target, we have measured our cement sector portfolio emissions with a production-based emissions intensity metric of tonnes CO 2 per tonne of cementitious material (tCO 2 /tonne Cement). Our selection of a production-based emissions intensity metric for the cement industry is motivated by the need to balance the rising demand for cementitious materials in emerging economies with the pressing requirement to decarbonise the cementitious material production process.\n\nThe portfolio emissions have remained static during the year with new clients having carbon intensities that are consistent with our portfolio. We have started to work with cement counterparties on their transition plans and commitments where their decarbonisation ambition does not match our own.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransition alignment required\n\n- 1 Emissions contribution per the IEA's World Energy Outlook 2023.\n- 2 Graphs reflect 2022 balance sheet values reported during 2023.\n\n|   Balance in  scope ($bn) | interim target                         | Cumulative  performance  versus baseline   |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n|                       4.8 | 19-39 kgCO 2 /Sq.m  (47-74% reduction) | -15%                                       |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sector background\n\nThe building sector currently contributes 8% 1 of the global energy-related emissions in 2022 per the IEA WEO 2023. Key drivers of the emissions in the portfolio include the size and type of the building as well as the energy source powering the building.\n\nInsulation and ventilation, building energy management, electrification and cleaner electricity will be key drivers of decarbonisation in the portfolio.\n\n## Baseline target and portfolio progress 2021 to 2030 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Progress in the year\n\nDuring the year the Group measured our Commercial Real Estate (CRE) portfolio's 2021 balance sheet baseline and 2022 progress of GHG emissions. The Group has also set a target to reduce emissions in the portfolio by 47% to 74% by 2030 using the IEA APS and NZE scenarios to set the target.\n\nThe emissions measured cover CRE assets being leased to earn rental returns and include the Scope 1 and 2 emissions from these buildings. A physical intensity of kgCO 2 e/m\u00b2 is the metric used to measure the portfolio's progress to net zero. This is calculated by summing the portfolio's Scope 1 and 2 emissions and dividing this by the floor area of the portfolio.\n\nOur portfolio intensity moved from 73kgCO 2 e/Sq.m to 62kgCO 2 e/Sq.m, a reduction of 15% year-on-year. This was primarily due to our CRE regions' power supplies starting to decarbonise and macroeconomic changes resulting in geographical shifting of the portfolio from the east to the west, and less carbon-intensive energy supplies. We continue to work with technology providers on solutions for individual building carbon emissions measurement and management.",

As such, the decarbonisation of the Oil and Gas sector is crucial for achieving global net zero carbon emissions.\n\nThe transition requires the development of new technologies such as abating emissions at source through deployment of carbon capture and (underground) storage technologies, and the evolution of Oil and Gas companies to energy companies through investment in renewables.\n\n## Baseline target and portfolio progress 2020 to 2030 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Progress in the year\n\nDuring the year, the Group replaced its existing revenue intensity target with an absolute Oil and Gas target, which now requires a 29% reduction in absolute financed emissions by 2030 against our 2020 balance sheet baseline. This effectively sets a carbon budget for the Oil and Gas team which can only be achieved through Oil and Gas companies decarbonising or via the Group's exposure to this sector decreasing.\n\nThe emissions measured in our reporting include upstream (exploration, extraction and production), midstream (transportation and storage) and downstream (refinement and gas station operation) activities. An absolute emissions metric is used to manage the portfolio, recognising the importance of phasing out oil and gas through the transition but also recognising the importance of gas in the transition period.\n\nOil and Gas absolute emissions have remained relatively consistent year-on-year from 10.2MtCO 2 e as reported on the 2021 balance sheet to 10.3MtCO 2 e in 2022. This has been a result of greater exposure in scope offset by a decrease of production intensity of certain clients, in line with our expectations of reductions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransition alignment required\n\n- 1 IEA: The Oil and Gas Industry in Net Zero Transition.\n- 2 Emissions contribution per the IEA's World Energy Outlook 2023.\n- 3 Graphs reflect 2022 balance sheet values reported during 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   Balance in  scope ($bn) | 2030  interim target                     | Cumulative  performance  versus baseline   |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n|                       5.3 | 0.17-0.28 tCO 2 /MWh  (46-67% reduction) | -10%                                       |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sector background\n\nPower generation is a material source of CO 2 emissions globally, through the Scope 1 burning of fossil fuels.

We primarily measure the Scope 1 emissions associated with the generation of power through combustion of fossil fuels or biomass when calculating our emissions.\n\nFrom 2021 to 2022 the portfolios emissions intensity moved from 0.52tCO 2 /MWh to 0.47tCO 2 /MWh, a reduction of 10%.

It contributed 2% 1 of global emissions per the IEA WEO 2023.\n\nWith oil-based fuels historically meeting over 99% of shipping energy needs, transition to low emission fuels will be key in decarbonising the sector. The Group is a signatory of the Poseidon Principles, which determines the decarbonisation principles to follow when providing shipping finance.\n\n## Baseline target and portfolio progress 2021 to 2030 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Progress in the year\n\nIn 2022, the Group set a target to achieve a 0% alignment delta for its shipping portfolio by 2030. This alignment delta is measured using the Poseidon Principles framework based on a 50% CO 2 reduction pathway by 2050 using 2008 as a baseline. A positive alignment score means that the portfolio is misaligned (above the decarbonisation trajectory), whereas a negative or zero score means that the portfolio is aligned. In 2023, Poseidon Principles added two additional pathways: the revised minimum (the Group's base case) and striving trajectory. These new scenarios are more stringent and are net zero by 2050.\n\nDuring the year, the Group's revised minimum alignment delta increased from 7.3% to 11.8%, placing the Group in the top quarter on an efficiency basis of Poseidon Principle signatories, which collectively represents 70% of global shipping finance exposure. This increase of 4.5% in alignment delta is primarily due to new vessels financed, which were delivered late in the year and therefore were very inefficient, as they travelled very short distances in the start-up phase. These vessels are expected to improve their efficiency once annualised. Secondly, container shipping operators saw strong demand and profitability in 2022, which encouraged faster and more fuel-inefficient journeys. Next year, the Group will further observe the impact of the Carbon Intensity Indicator measurement of ships' efficiency which has come into effect in 2023, and incentivises shipowners to optimise their emissions impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransition alignment required\n\n1 Emissions contribution per the IEA's World Energy Outlook 2023. 2 Graphs reflect 2022 balance sheet values reported during 2023.\n\n2030\n\ninterim target\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   Balance in  scope ($bn) | 2030  interim target                           | Cumulative  performance  versus baseline   |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n|                       1.3 | 1.4-1.6 tCO 2 /tonne Steel  (22-32% reduction) | -4%                                        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sector background\n\nThe steel industry is the largest source of industrial CO 2 emissions and accounts for roughly 7% 1 of global CO 2 emissions. This is largely due to the sector's reliance on metallurgical coal as the primary fuel source.\n\nTechnological solutions to decarbonise this sector will include scrap-based electric arc furnaces, natural gas or hydrogen-based direct reduction plants with electric arc furnaces (all with clean power supplies) and the potential for CCUS.\n\n## Baseline target and portfolio progress 2021 to 2030 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Progress in the year\n\nDuring the year the Group updated its original revenuebased intensity baseline to a production-based intensity metric with a baseline year of 2021. We also measured our progress during the year.\n\nWe have set a target of 1.4-1.6tCO 2 /tonne Steel by 2030 using a production intensity metric, recognising the urgent need to decarbonise the steel production process, while balancing the growing demand of steel in emerging economies.\n\nWhen calculating our emissions, we measure the steelmaker's Scope 1 and 2 emissions. This is in line with the 'Fixed System Boundary' as set out by the Sustainable Steel Principles (SSP).\n\nFrom 2021 to 2022 the physical intensity of the portfolio moved from 2.06tCO 2 /tonne Steel to 1.97tCO 2 /tonne Steel, a decrease of 4%. This was due to a year-on-year decrease to the Group's higher-emitting clients and improvements in the energy performance of some clients in Asia.\n\nCumulative\n\nperformance\n\nversus baseline",

Emissions measured in our baseline and annual progress include Scope 1 and 2 emissions from the residential properties the Group lends against. A physical intensity of kgCO 2 e/Sq.m is the metric used to measure the portfolio's progress.\n\nStandard Chartered, as a UK headquartered Group with a large footprint in Asia, is one of the first banks to set a target on its mortgage portfolio across multiple countries. While we have set a single group-level target, the very nature of the residential real estate market means all decarbonisation actions will take place at the local level. Achieving our target is dependent on actions by local governments and power companies decarbonising power generation. The target range has been set at the more ambitious end of the public commitments made by governments and power companies in the countries where the Group operates. These targets have been benchmarked to, and currently sit above, the global CRREM pathway to 2030. We will review this over time based on changes to country commitments and ambition. The Group has set a target of 29-32kgCO 2 e/Sq.m being a 15% to 23% reduction by 2030 of the baseline portfolio intensity of 37.6kgCO 2 e/Sq.m.

This includes thermal coal upstream (exploration and extraction), midstream (transportation) and downstream (refinement) when measuring our absolute emissions.\n\nThe absolute emissions of the portfolio from 2021 to 2022 decreased from 2.3MtCO 2 e to 1.6MtCO 2 e a decrease of 30%.

Each hub is transversal, run by senior leaders in the CSO organisation, and aims to identify opportunities for future returns outside of our\n\n## 1. Adaptation Finance\n\nThe world is experiencing impacts from changes in average temperature, seasonal shifting, an increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and slow onset events.\n\nA significant proportion of our Group's footprint markets are coastal, which means that adaptation represents both a risk and an opportunity for us and our clients.\n\nThere is an urgent global need to unlock and scale public and private climate adaptation finance to build shared societal resilience. This need is applicable to all nations but is particularly acute in emerging and developing economies.\n\nAcknowledging our geographical footprint and the multiplier effect of investment in adaptation - where every dollar spent on adaptation this decade could generate up to $12 of economic benefit ( sc.com/ adaptation-economy ) - it is our ambition to act decisively and mobilise others on adaptation.\n\n## 2. Blended Finance 1\n\nThe Independent High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance estimate that by 2030 there will be a $2.5-3 trillion per year financing gap between current baselines and what is required to deliver the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in emerging markets and developing countries other than China.\n\nSuch sums cannot be delivered through public financing alone. They require the international private sector to step up, including in markets historically considered as too risky for high levels of investment. Blended finance - using concessional public funds to mobilise much larger volumes of private capital - can help to close this gap. The Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) are an example of such blended finance.\n\nOur hub brings together public and private expertise across the Group, including one of the architects of the South Africa and Vietnam JETPs, to help commercialise blended finance. Some of the objectives of the JETPs - e.g., financing the early retirement of coal-fired power plants - will require truly innovative approaches and collaboration.\n\ncore range of traditional products and services. By being deliberate in demonstrating leadership to advance the ecosystem in these emerging thematic areas, the Group will be well positioned to take advantage of the significant and differentiated revenue potential that will result from maturation of these thematic areas in the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information on collaborative initiatives the Group participates in, refer to page 96\n\n'The Adaptation Hub has drawn on our diverse experience from across the Group. Our first Adaptation Finance deal provided a test case to scaling our efforts internally and demonstrate how private sector finance can be deployed into Adaptation. The new Guide for Adaptation and Resilience Finance (GARF) is centred around bankable opportunities and we hope it will unlock significant private sector capital flow towards adaptation in emerging markets.'\n\n## Alex Kennedy\n\nHead of Sustainable Finance Solutions\n\n'Where money goes today shapes tomorrow's world' was the theory of change for the COP26 organisers. While the scale of the challenge remains significant - the Vietnam and Indonesian JETPs alone each require over $100bn of private finance - the opportunities also remain clear. Blended Finance offers us in Standard Chartered the chance to make use of donor financing to help the markets that we call home accelerate their journeys towards net zero.'\n\n## John Murton\n\nSenior Sustainability Advisor\n\n- 1 The hub developed an internal working definition in order to differentiate and build upon the Group's already long-established blended finance reputation in Export Credit Agency financing. We use 'Blended Finance' here to refer to the strategic use of catalytic public (and/or philanthropic) capital and regulatory reform to increase private sector investment that supports the SDGs. This can happen at a programme level or at a project level and may involve the creation and use of innovative financing instruments and structures to overcome barriers to investment.\n\n## In 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 Closed the Group's first Adaptation Finance transaction; an adaptation letter of credit with a parametric insurance provider for the renewable energy sector.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed our Group's portfolio to analyse data on past transactions related to adaptation.\n- \u00b7 Used data collected from our Climate Risk Assessments to design an 'adaptation readiness' test at the client level.\n- \u00b7 Collaborated externally with KPMG and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) to develop the market's first Guide to Adaptation and Resilience Finance (GARF), which was announced at COP28 and published in early 2024.\n\n## In 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 Worked through international fora and industry groups (e.g., GFANZ) to leverage the Group's expertise and support alongside other international banks blended finance projects and programmes, including the development of frameworks for early coal retirement.\n- \u00b7 Hosted both the Vietnamese and Indonesian governments as they launched their JETP events at COP28.\n- \u00b7 Standard Chartered became one of the founding partners of the Bangladesh Climate and Development Partnership, which aims to use blended finance to help Bangladesh adapt to climate change.",

Carbon Markets\n\nA high-integrity carbon market, combined with corporate commitments to cut emissions and high standards of reporting, can accelerate the global progress towards net zero by 2050. The use of high-quality carbon credits can play a part in a multi-faceted and urgent approach to decarbonisation, as it enables climate action in sectors and geographies that remain severely underfunded today.\n\nCarbon credits can be complementary to a credible corporate net zero transition plan and help bridge the gap between the emissions reductions that can be implemented now, and the longer lead time for technological solutions that are yet to scale.\n\nStandard Chartered has been at the forefront of several initiatives that are working to ensure that a high integrity, scalable market develops.

Nature Positive Solutions\n\nIt is estimated that over half of global GDP is moderately or highly dependent upon nature. Despite its importance, biodiversity is rapidly declining.\n\nHaving applied international environmental and social standards in our financing for more than 20 years, our presence in markets with some of the richest biodiversity in the world positions us to engage with a range of stakeholders.

In the frontline, our ESRM team within the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) organisation oversees the management of E&S Risks associated with our client relationships.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information please refer to our ESRM Framework at sc.com/esriskframework\n\nOur approach is embedded directly into our credit approval process and supports us to work with our stakeholders to identify, manage, mitigate and monitor the potential impacts that stem from our financing decisions.\n\nOur Position Statements, approved by the Group Responsibility and Reputational Risk Committee (GRRRC), outline the cross-sector and sector-specific criteria we apply to assess whether to provide financial services to our clients.\n\nWe use these statements - which draw on International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards, the Equator Principles (EP) and global best practice - to assess E&S risk related to our financing.\n\n## Position Statements\n\n| Cross-sector Position Statements    | Cross-sector Position Statements    | Cross-sector Position Statements    |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Climate Change                      | Human Rights                        | Nature                              |\n| Sector-specific Position Statements | Sector-specific Position Statements | Sector-specific Position Statements |\n| Agribusiness                        | Chemicals and   Manufacturing       | Extractive Industries               |\n| Infrastructure   and Transport      | Power Generation                    | Thermal Coal                        |\n\n## Prohibited Activities\n\nWe reviewed 1,341 clients and 708 transactions that presented potential for elevated E&S risk in 2023. If we find a material E&S issue, we take steps to proactively engage the client to mitigate identified risks and impacts, and support and guide our clients to improve their E&S performance over time. However, for clients who do not meet our Position Statement criteria, we may look to withdraw financial services and exit the relationship if we cannot work with them to align over time.\n\nIn 2023, we completed the review and update of our cross-sector Climate Change and sector-specific Position Statements covering all sensitive sectors, with the requirements to take effect in 2024. We also commenced the review of our cross-sector Human Rights Position Statement.\n\nDuring the year, we evolved our approach to nature risk assessment. This included a loan book analysis to identify impacts and dependencies from nature-related risks at sector, country and financial services levels. The Group's cross-sector Nature Position Statement provides a consolidated view of our approach to managing Nature Risk across our business, operations and supply chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our Position Statements\n\nat\n\nsc.com/positionstatements\n\nOur list of Prohibited Activities can be found\n\nat sc.com/prohibitedactivities\n\nOur reporting against the Equator Principles can be found on page 504 or at sc.com/equatorprinciples",

        "page_content": "## Managing Climate Risk\n\nWe have designed an approach that begins to embed Climate Risk with impacted Principal Risk Types (PRTs) within our central Enterprise Risk Management Framework based around two principles:\n\n- 1.  Treat Climate Risk like a traditional risk type. Climate Risk may lead to financial losses and non-financial detriments, much like Credit Risk, and should be managed as such to limit the Group's exposure to these detriments. This means embedding Climate Risk considerations into existing risk identification and management processes, governance, reporting, scenario analysis, strategy, and financial planning.\n- 2.  Recognise and build for where Climate Risk is different. Climate Risk is likely to crystallise over much longer time horizons and is inherently difficult to quantify. Its unique features and a need for granular forward-looking measurements require the use and development of new tools and methodologies to quantify and analyse the implications.\n\n## Our climate toolkit - Processes for identifying and assessing Climate Risks\n\nWe have invested in a number of toolkits and partnerships to quantitatively measure climate-related physical and transition risks and we have conducted scenario analysis across a range of plausible scenarios in 2023. We continue to engage with our clients to understand their climate adaptation, mitigation and transition plans. In 2024 and beyond, we aim to reduce reliance on third-party models with the development of our internal carbon elasticity and IFRS 9 expected credit loss models including climate-related impacts.\n\n| Toolkits and  Partnerships             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| In-house  Climate Risk  Questionnaires | Client-level Climate Risk Questionnaire (CRQ) to assess and gather information on client mitigation and  adaptation plans.

This is particularly true in emerging markets where Climate Risk-related disclosure and preparedness can be less advanced. We have seen limitations in coverage, granularity of information at client group and entity level and timeliness of data leading to the use of proxies such as regional and/or sector averages and sovereign heatmaps. Most tool outputs do not factor in\n\nexisting adaptation measures, governmental policies to protect and build for changing climate, and structural adaptation e.g., age and quality of construction or flood defences and dams protecting the property. Over time, sovereigns and policymakers are also expected to drive market trends such as investment in adaptation plans, technological advancements, innovative risk transfer and mitigation approaches to combat the potential impacts of climate change. Such assumptions are not factored into our analysis.",

Additionally, we are in the process of setting up a centralised data store which will capture all sustainabilityrelated data for our clients, including monitoring of the data quality, and reduce the usage of proxies over time.

As part of our ongoing academic partnership, we supported new climate research on the range of opportunities that exist for private investors in nature-related investments and cross-sectoral implications of electrification of transport in India. In 2023 we have cooperated with Imperial College London on three specific projects:\n\n## 1. Asset haircuts\n\nFor our key residential mortgage markets, we have collaborated with our academic partner to develop an internal model for revaluating property valuations under different climate scenarios using the forward-looking risk indices from Munich Re. These revaluations are then used to inform haircuts on the property prices and arrive at climate adjusted Expected Credit Loss values for the mortgage book.\n\n## 2. Country Risk\n\nThe cooperation involves the construction of a methodology used to project sovereign ratings along selected NGFS climate scenarios for 40 target countries. The model develops a term structure of sovereign Probability of Defaults (PDs) along each climate scenario and associated projected ratings and compares it with a term structure of sovereign PDs and ratings in a counterfactual (non-climate change) scenario.\n\n## 3. Cross-sectoral implications of transport electrification in India\n\nExploring the potential impact of introducing a legislative requirement for the switch to electric vehicles (EVs), including, but not limited to supply chain management, the strain on existing power supply (as some regions are already experiencing regular blackouts), and the need for expansion of the power grid to support the connection of the required number of chargers. The research has been completed and preparations for the publication have been made.",

In October 2023, we launched the refreshed Code to improve alignment with our Stands, strengthen the link between ethics, culture, conduct, and the Group's strategy. The Code is intended to be more than a guidance document: rather, it is a code to live by, designed to guide colleagues through how to live our valued behaviours on a day-to-day basis, whatever their business, function, region, or role. We have made the Code more user friendly, interactive and accessible to all colleagues. The Code also includes more content on ethical leadership, the way we use personal data, having a culture of inclusion and feeling safe to speak up.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDownload our Code of Conduct and Ethics at sc.com/codeofconductandethics and visit sc.com/speakingup to find more about how our Speaking Up programme works\n\nGood conduct is critical to delivering positive outcomes for our clients, markets and stakeholders. It is fundamental to achieving our brand promise, here for good. Conduct Risk may arise anywhere in the Group at any time. The Group therefore expects all employees to be responsible for managing Conduct Risk given it is a transversal risk, which means it impacts every aspect of the Group's operations.\n\nOur Conduct Risk management approach has been strengthened since 2022 through several initiatives, including launching the new Group Conduct Risk Management Standard, which sets minimum standards for the management of Conduct Risk across our operations. The Group employs a risk-based, three lines of defence approach to Conduct Risk management, where oversight, governance and controls applied are proportionate to our assessment of the risk. We set target Conduct Outcomes that the Group aspires to deliver for clients, external stakeholders, employees, and the environment.\n\nTo reinforce our shared commitment to the highest possible standards of conduct, each year we ask our colleagues to reconsider what the Code means to them through a refresher e-learning, and to reaffirm their commitment. In 2023, 99.8 per cent of our colleagues completed the mandatory training and affirmation. Colleagues who are overdue without a valid reason are subject to a 25 per cent reduction in their annual variable compensation for the year they failed to attest.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 99.8 %\n\nof employees affirmed recommitment to our Code annually",

        "page_content": "## Speaking Up\n\nOur Speaking Up programme provides a safe, independent and confidential way to report concerns. It helps build and maintain a strong ethical culture, with integrity, trust, and transparency. The early disclosure of concerns reduces the risk of financial and reputational loss caused by misconduct. We encourage colleagues, contractors, clients, suppliers and members of the public to use our Speaking Up programme without fear of retaliation. When a concern is raised, our Shared Investigative Services team will determine whether the matter is a Speaking Up disclosure or if it is an out-of-scope disclosure. Examples of Speaking Up concerns may include breaches of regulatory requirements or breaches of Group policy or standards. Out-of-scope disclosures will be referred to the appropriate internal teams. If a matter is considered a Speaking Up Disclosure, relevant Shared Investigative Services and/or Employee Relations colleagues will conduct factfinding into the matter, with any follow-up action taken as required following the fact-finding process.\n\nThroughout 2023, we hosted a series of awareness campaigns to ensure that our colleagues understand the importance of upholding our conduct standards and know how, and when, to Speak Up. To recognise Whistleblowers' Day on 23 June, the Global Head of Conduct, Financial Crime and Compliance issued a Group-wide communication underlining the importance of Speaking Up. A World Whistleblowers' Day panel discussion was held, covering Speaking Up and ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) topics, with Group Independent Non-Executive Director and Whistleblowing Champion Phil Rivett as a panellist.\n\nAccess to the financial system helps transform lives around the world, helping to reduce poverty and spur economic development. But the financial system is also used by those involved in some of today's most damaging crimes - from human trafficking to terrorism, corruption and the drug trade. Our ambition is to help tackle these crimes by making the financial system a hostile environment for criminals and terrorists. We have no appetite for breaches in laws and regulations related to financial crime.\n\nOur Conduct, Financial Crime & Compliance (CFCC) team sets our financial crime risk management framework. We seek to protect our clients and communities against money laundering (AML), terrorist financing, sanctions, fraud and other risks, applying core controls such as client due-diligence, screening and monitoring, and strengthening our people's understanding as to how to identify, manage and mitigate such risks. In addition, anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) controls aim to prevent colleagues, or third parties working on our behalf, from engaging in bribery or corruption.\n\nA particular focus of our financial crime investigatory teams is the use of data analytics to identify those clients and cases which generate the greatest financial crime risk. This has strengthened the second line of defence in support of colleagues in business lines and country teams across the Group.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of financial crime, particularly laundering the proceeds of corruption, in the lead-up to, during and after major political elections in footprint markets, the Group conducts enhanced monitoring designed to identify and investigate transactions of potential concern. In 2023, enhanced monitoring was conducted during major elections and times of political transition or conflict, for example in Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe.\n\nThis event was part of the wider Global Conduct Week from 19 to 23 June, themed 'Be the Change', which encouraged colleagues to think about how their individual actions on a daily basis can aggregate to a much wider impact on outcomes for our clients, customers and other stakeholders. In addition, in October 2023, a Group-wide panel discussion was held to celebrate Global Ethics Day, with the theme 'Ethics Empowered'. All campaigns included interactive messages from our senior leaders and live panel discussions designed to both set the tone from the top and nurture it from within.\n\nThe Speaking Up programme continues to be utilised across all countries, businesses and functions, and our 2023 MyVoice survey found that 88 per cent of employees (no change from 2022) felt comfortable raising concerns through these channels. The Board reviews a Speaking Up report annually. For the period July 2022 to June 2023 a three per cent (34 cases) decrease was noted in the volume of total disclosures via Speaking Up channels compared with the previous period (i.e. July 2021 to June 2022).\n\n## 88 %\n\nof employees in our MyVoice survey felt comfortable raising concerns through Speaking Up channels\n\nFighting financial crime\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVisit our  Speaking Up programme's website https://secure.ethicspoint. eu/domain/media/en/gui/108379/index.html\n\nSince the beginning of the war in Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the authorities of the European Union, United Kingdom, United States, and several other nations have imposed multiple rounds of sanctions against Russia by targeting a wide range of Russian entities (state-owned and private) and a large number of Russian elites, oligarchs, political leaders and officials. While the pace of change and the complexity of these sanctions against Russia are unprecedented and had the potential to create areas of uncertainty as to the scope of some of the regulatory prohibitions, we have sought to comply with these requirements fully and promptly. This work remains a significant area of focus for teams across the first and second line of defence.\n\nWe have invested significantly to ensure our employees are properly equipped to combat financial crime. In 2023, 99.9 per cent of colleagues and governance body members completed financial crime mandatory e-learnings which cover topics such as ABC, AML including terrorist financing, sanctions, tax evasion and fraud topics (Asia: 99.9 per cent, AME: 99.8 per cent, EA: 99.8 per cent, Governance body members: 100 per cent).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof colleagues and governance members completed financial crime mandatory e-learnings",

We also delivered new training modules on financial crime risks in fintech and digital assets. In addition, masterclasses and forums were held to deepen understanding. We shared our Supplier Charter, which sets out our principles and expectations, and provides guidance related to ABC, with 11,563 suppliers and third parties across 48 markets.\n\nThis was supported by our Group-wide financial crime awareness campaign, 'The Whole Story', which aimed to raise employee awareness of the real-life impact of financial crime and highlight the work we are doing individually and collectively to build a robust risk culture and lead in the fight against financial crime. The Whole Story 2023 theme of 'Let's get #fightingfit' focused on how we can reboot and recharge the fight against financial crime and play a part in driving the right outcomes for our clients, through the right conduct and culture, vigilance and risk management.\n\n## Collaborative initiatives\n\nOur public-private partnerships are aimed at producing new insights about various criminal typologies and advances in how we collectively combat financial crime in an increasing number of jurisdictions, including Singapore, Hong Kong, South Africa, India, the UK and UAE.\n\nThroughout 2023, we also engaged with peers in contributing to the ongoing dialogue to advance effectiveness in combating financial crime through our active participation in several of the leading industry groups, including the Wolfsberg Group of global banks, Madison Group and UK Finance.\n\nWe also participated in discussions and forums with many external thought leaders including participation with the World Economic Forum's Partnering Against Corruption Initiative and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, in addition to hosting events with clients designed to foster dialogue on the tackling of financial crime.\n\nFighting financial crime continued\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more, visit sc.com/fightingfinancialcrime\n\n## Responsible lending and fair treatment of our customers in our CPBB segment\n\nThe Group's Board of Directors provides oversight of the Group's treatment of customers through its reporting and committee structures. The relevant governance forum or Risk Committee is required to challenge the business for any new or material product proposals prior to the commencement of the product approval process.\n\nEscalations may be taken to the CPBB Risk Committee chaired by the CPBB Chief Risk Officer or the Group Risk Committee chaired by the Group Chief Risk Officer, and ultimately to the Group's Board and Board Risk Committee. Oversight and governance of Collections is performed by the CPBB Risk function with regular reviews of performance metrics and complaints-handling data.\n\n## Complaints management\n\nFormal avenues are established for CPBB customers to lodge complaints. A complaints-handling process has been put in place to enable the proper receipt, acknowledgement and independent and effective handling of complaints, which are to be resolved and notified to customers within a reasonable turnaround time without compromising the quality of the review.\n\nAt the global level, key complaints insights, trends and root causes are provided to the CPBB Risk Committee every month. Examples of key metrics that are used to track and manage complaints across CPBB markets include: total number of complaints received in the month split by type and root cause, including sub-categories such as potential inappropriate sales, proven mis-selling or fraud, and percentage of complaints resolved within the predetermined turnaround time.\n\n## Loan modifications\n\nWhere possible, practical support programmes may be offered to customers experiencing financial difficulty. Loan modification options that may be offered to our customers take into account the most recently available information on the customer's income, expenditures and circumstances. Collections staff managing these arrangements are trained to discuss options thoroughly with customers in order that any restructured payments, if agreed, are kept affordable.\n\n## Collections\n\nAcross the Group, while the approach may vary across markets in line with local regulations, programmes to assist retail banking borrowers in financial distress are handled by Collections teams.\n\nThe expectation on the Bank's Collections teams include meeting the following requirements:\n\n- \u00b7 Providing a fair and reasonable treatment regarding any late fees\n- \u00b7 Aligning calling and visitation hours to local regulations and practices\n- \u00b7 Updating the financial status of customers on a timely basis in our systems to support fair treatment\n- \u00b7 Having all customer interactions with the Collections teams, complaints and feedback monitored and regularly reviewed\n\nAll Collections staff responsible for dealing with customers in financial distress are trained prior to commencement of collection activities, and in particular, are required to be familiar with the Bank's Code of Conduct and Ethics. Where external collections agencies are utilised, these agencies undergo assessment and due diligence in accordance with Group sourcing standards and their staff must undertake the same training as the Group's internal Collections teams.",

These require our close attention given their ability to impact our various businesses in quite different ways. The Board has monitored these developments carefully and proactively, devoting agenda time at the Board and across our committees and also considering them at the Group's International Advisory Council (IAC), which includes representatives from our Management Team.\n\nThe Board also received a series of briefings from internal and external experts who provided valuable insights from their diplomatic, central banking, economic, regional and political vantage points to help us prepare for events which may occur in the future. In the same vein, the Board Risk Committee (BRC) and Audit Committee (AC) jointly held a Blue Sky Thinking session on forward-looking geopolitics and their impact on the work of those committees. The session was facilitated by Robert Zoellick, the Chair of our IAC.\n\nIn times of uncertainty, a robust corporate governance framework is especially important, and this report sets out how the Board and our committees work to ensure that risks are addressed, opportunities are taken, and the Group continues to deliver sustainable value.\n\nThe Board was disappointed with the market reaction to the Group's third-quarter results. We considered carefully the reasons for that with our advisers and also at our December Board meeting, from which we drew a number of lessons.\n\nThe Board's priorities for 2023 were guided by our business objectives, the environment in which we operate and suggestions from last year's externally facilitated Board evaluation. These were woven into agendas at the beginning of the year and reviewed regularly.\n\nIn February 2023, the banking sector faced volatility caused by the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank which was followed by that of Credit Suisse. The BRC monitored the situation carefully, receiving regular updates from management on our own financial position and actions to address issues arising in the markets. These were also shared with the Board which also received updates at meetings.\n\nInformation and cybersecurity (ICS) risk was also a key area of focus for both the Board and the BRC in 2023. The BRC devoted significant time to reviewing and discussing ICS matters, including a new ICS Risk Appetite Statement that was also brought to the Board. The AC had a very busy year, reviewing internal controls and assurance around the Group's activities. It paid close attention to the carrying value of loans and investments in certain industries, locations and subsidiaries, especially China.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee continues to work hard to implement the remuneration strategy approved in 2022. Our Directors' Remuneration Report, which details the key activities of the Remuneration Committee in 2023, can be found on page 182.\n\nIn January, we appointed Linda Yueh as an independent NonExecutive Director (INED). Linda then succeeded Jasmine Whitbread as chair of the Sustainability and Culture Committee (CSC) following Jasmine's retirement from the Board in May. Jasmine has been an excellent contributor to the Board across her eight years and has led the CSC with distinction. We are also very sorry to see the departure of Andy Halford, who stepped down from his Group Chief Financial Officer (GCFO) role in January 2024, after a tenure of over nine years, marked by his very significant contributions to the Group.\n\nWe welcomed Diego De Giorgi to the Group in September 2023 as GCFO Designate, following a thorough external talent mapping and selection process overseen by the Governance and Nomination Committee (GNC). Following regulatory approval, Diego began his role in January 2024 following a thorough induction programme and handover from Andy. Further detail regarding the changes made to our Board appears in the GNC report starting on page 177.\n\nWe have been following the proposals for UK Audit and Corporate Governance (ACG) reforms, both at Board level and across our committees. Following the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) publication of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2024, we are considering the changes in readiness for the application of the new UK Code in 2025, and additional internal control reporting provisions coming into force in the following year.\n\nWe travelled to a number of markets as a Board during 2023, with visits to Hong Kong, Jakarta and Seoul; in addition, onward market visits were made by a number of directors to obtain an on-the-ground perspective of the business, opportunities and challenges faced. In each market we visited as a Board, employee engagement sessions were held where directors met and listened to colleagues from across our footprint, either face-to-face or through hybrid mechanisms. We welcomed the opportunity to engage with so many of our valued colleagues, both long-standing employees and newer recruits. These market visits provided an opportunity to test enhancements made to the Board's workforce engagement model, which facilitate more faceto-face contact following our emergence from the COVID pandemic. Details of the changes to our workforce engagement model are set out in the CSC report on page 174. Apart from allowing us to connect with colleagues from across our footprint, overseas board visits also provide opportunities for the Board to strengthen the links with subsidiary boards. The Board is planning to visit several countries across our footprint in 2024. Further detail regarding Board engagement with stakeholders appears on page 157.\n\nEngagement with all stakeholders, including, of course, our investors is key to our decision-making. I hosted a stewardship event in November alongside the chairs of the Audit and Remuneration Committees to provide an update regarding the Group's strategy, including with respect to sustainability, and on the work of our Board committees. Close engagement has continued between the Board and our subsidiary boards, through regular exchanges among the chairs, committee chairs and other INEDs.\n\nThe Corporate Plan is an important part of the Board's agenda each year. In June, we held a deep and productive two-day strategy discussion, which considered any impact from the economic and political headwinds emerging in 2023. The session concluded with the Board's firm belief that it remains the right strategy for the Group. Throughout the year, the Board considered a number of strategic opportunities for growth in the context of our Corporate Plan and Risk Appetite.\n\nFinally, the Board remains confident for the Group's future and is committed to our strategy and our purpose, and is laser focused on developing sustained and sustainable returns within our Risk Appetite.\n\nDr Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als Group Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

for the effective day-to-day running and management of the business. The Board holds the Group Chief Executive accountable in discharging his delegated responsibilities.\n\nThe Management Team comprises the Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Financial Officer, regional CEOs, client segment CEOs, and our global function heads. It has responsibility for executing the strategy. Details of the Group's Management Team can be found on pages 142 to 144 .\n\nTerms of Reference for the Board and each committee are in place to provide clarity over where responsibility for decisionmaking lies. These are reviewed annually against industry best practice and corporate governance provisions and guidance, including the PRA Supervisory Statement on Board Responsibilities (as amended).\n\nWith the exception of the Governance and Nomination Committee (where the Group Chairman is its Chair) all of the Board committees are composed of INEDs who bring a diversity of skills, experience and knowledge to the discussion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWritten Terms of Reference for the Board and its committees can be viewed at sc.com/termsofreference",

Flexibility in the programme is important and permits key items to be added to any agenda so that the Board can focus on evolving and important matters at the most appropriate time.\n\nPerformance against delivery of the agreed key financial priorities is reviewed at every scheduled meeting, with particular reference to the detailed Group management accounts. The Group Chief Executive and Group Chief Financial Officer comment on current trading, business performance, the market, colleagues, relevant stakeholders, and regulatory and external developments at each scheduled meeting, and present comparative data and client insight.\n\nIn addition, the Group Chief Risk Officer periodically attends meetings to update the Board on key risks.\n\nThe Group Chairman holds INED-only meetings ahead of each scheduled Board meeting, which provides the opportunity for discussion on key agenda items and other matters without the executive directors and management present.\n\nSir Iain Lobban and Paul Khoo, as independent advisers to the Board and its committees on cyber security and cyber threat management and financial crime respectively, attended a combination of Board and committee meetings to provide an independent and current view on the Group's progress in this area.\n\n## Board activities during 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Board committees\n\nThe Board places significant reliance on its committees by delegating a broad range of responsibilities and issues to them. It therefore remains crucial that effective linkages are in place between the committees and the Board as a whole, not least as it is impracticable for all INEDs to be members of all of the committees. Mechanisms are in place to facilitate these linkages, including ensuring that there are no gaps or unnecessary duplications between the remit of each committee and overlapping membership between Board committees where necessary. Alongside interconnected committee membership, the Board regularly receives a written summary of each of the committee's meetings, and verbal updates at the Board, where appropriate.\n\nFurther details on each committee, including their oversight and focus during 2023, can be found in the Board committee reports starting on page 162.",

        "page_content": "## Director induction\n\nLinda Yueh joined the Board on 1 January 2023. Her experience can be found in her biography on page 139. Along with Shirish Apte, Robin Lawther and Jackie Hunt, who were all appointed in 2022, the new directors were given a comprehensive induction programme, tailored to meet each director's individual level of experience and expertise.\n\nDiego De Giorgi was appointed as Group Chief Financial Officer on 3 January 2024, following the retirement of Andy Halford on 2 January 2024. Diego received in-depth handovers from Andy, which included a period of shadowing from September 2023 to January 2024. As well as numerous tailored, individual training sessions, Diego also attended formal training sessions on topics including Directors' Duties (on 20 September 2023), Climate Risk (on 28 September 2023), Trading Activity Wind-Down Governance (on 28 September 2023), Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) litigation (on 30 November 2023), ICS Horizon Scanning (on 5 December 2023) and Directors' Duties applicable to directors of Hong Kong-listed companies (on 14 December 2023). Following his relevant training provided by a firm of solicitors on 14 December 2023, Diego confirmed his understanding of the obligations as a director of a listed issuer pursuant to Rule 3.09D of the Hong Kong Listing Rules.\n\nThe Group Company Secretary supports new directors as they undertake their induction programmes, which are typically completed within the first six to twelve months of their appointment. The induction programmes are regularly reviewed and take into account directors' feedback to ensure continuous development and improvement.\n\n## Progress against induction programmes\n\nThe Governance and Nomination Committee is responsible for periodically reviewing the induction programme of all new INEDs, to understand the level of progress made and to consider where any areas of additional focus might be required. The Committee is satisfied that all new INEDs have made good progress completing induction work, both in London and as part of overseas Board visits to our markets.\n\n## Ongoing development plans\n\nContinuous training and development beyond a director's induction plan is essential for maintaining a highly engaged, effective and well-informed Board. Ongoing development plans also help ensure directors lead with integrity and promote the Group's culture, purpose and values.\n\nMandatory learning and training are important elements of directors' fitness and propriety assessments as required under the UK Senior Managers and Certification Regime. During the year, all directors received a combination of mandatory learning and training, internal and external briefings, presentations from guest speakers, and papers on a wide range of topics to ensure the directors are well informed and that the Board remains highly effective. The table below gives further detail on who received these briefings.\n\nIn 2023, Board members received briefings from and engaged with leading diplomats, former national security advisers, former leaders of international organisations and economists on topics including China's emergence from the COVID pandemic, the evolving geopolitical landscape in the Middle East, and the global macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe Board committee members also received specific training relevant to the work of their respective committees. In 2023, the Board Risk Committee received training on topics including: Threat Scenario-led Risk Assessment, Trading Activity Wind-Down Governance, Operational Risk and the implications of Basel 3.1.\n\nThe Group Chairman reviews with each director their training and development needs both in real time and as part of the annual performance cycle. Where it is recognised that the Board or individual directors need further training or development in key areas, additional sessions are arranged with subject matter experts.\n\n## 2023 director training overview\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                      | Induction 1   | Directors' duties  and regulatory  updates   | Digital   assets   | Climate Risk   | ICS Horizon  Scanning  Emerging Risks   |\n|----------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als          | N/A           |                                              |                    |                |                                         |\n| Bill Winters         | N/A           |                                              |                    |                |                                         |\n| Andy Halford         | N/A           |                                              |                    |                |                                         |\n| Shirish Apte 2       |               |                                              |                    |                |                                         |\n| David Conner         | N/A           |                                              |                    |                |                                         |\n| Gay Huey Evans, CBE  | N/A           |                                              |                    |                |                                         |\n| Jackie Hunt 2        |               |                                              |                    |                |                                         |\n| Robin Lawther, CBE 2 |               |                                              |                    |                |                                         |\n| Maria Ramos          | N/A           |                                              |                    |                |                                         |\n| Phil Rivett          | N/A           |                                              |                    |                |                                         |\n| David Tang           | N/A           |                                              |                    |                |                                         |\n| Carlson Tong         | N/A           |                                              |                    |                |                                         |\n| Jasmine Whitbread 3  | N/A           | N/A                                          |                    | N/A            | N/A                                     |\n| Linda Yueh, CBE 2    |               |                                              |                    |                |                                         |\n\n- 1 Applicable to directors who received induction training during 2023\n- 2 Shirish Apte, Robin Lawther, Jackie Hunt and Linda Yueh joined the Board on 4 May 2022, 1 July 2022, 1 October 2022 and 1 January 2023 respectively\n- 3   Jasmine Whitbread stepped down from the Board on 3 May 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Director attended the session\n\nDirector was unable to attend the session but received any accompanying material and had opportunities to raise questions and observations with the Group Chairman and Group Company Secretary",

These one-to-one sessions considered:\n\n- \u00b7 their performance against core competencies and their individual effectiveness\n- \u00b7 their time commitment to the Group, including (where relevant) the potential impact of any outside interests\n- \u00b7 their ongoing development and training needs\n- \u00b7 the Board's composition, taking into account when each INED envisaged stepping down from the Board\n- \u00b7 the current and future committee membership and structure\n- \u00b7 their engagement across the Group.\n\nThese performance reviews are used as the basis for recommending the re-election of directors by shareholders at the 2024 AGM and to assist the Group Chairman with his assessment of the INEDs' competencies. In addition, the Group Chairman has responsibility for assessing annually the fitness and propriety of the Company's INEDs and the Group Chief Executive Officer under the Senior Managers Regime. These assessments were carried out in respect of each INED and the Group Chief Executive and no issues in relation to fitness and propriety were identified.\n\n## Group Chairman's performance\n\nMaria Ramos, as Senior Independent Director, reviewed Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als' performance as Group Chairman, meeting with each director separately to take their feedback. Consolidated feedback was shared with him.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nOur INEDs commit sufficient time in discharging their responsibilities as directors of Standard Chartered. In general, we estimate that each INED spent approximately 40 to 90 days on Board-related duties.",

        "page_content": "## Spotlight\n\n## Interview with Dr Linda Yueh\n\nAn insight into one of our new INEDs\n\nDr Linda Yueh\n\nIndependent Non-Executive Director\n\n## Q. What drew you to Standard Chartered and have your initial impressions aligned with your experiences as an INED one year on?\n\nA. One of the key things that attracted me to Standard Chartered was the Group's culture and its people. Prior to my appointment, I had a number of discussions with several directors, including the Group Chairman, who offered insights into serving on the Board of a global financial institution. I was particularly impressed with their willingness to listen and engage collaboratively in constructive discourse over issues of importance to the Group. One year on, I'm pleased to say that I am working with a great group of people from a variety of backgrounds, who possess strong skills and industry-leading experience in their respective fields. In my role as Chair of the Culture and Sustainability Committee (CSC), I am able to actively engage with the issues around culture that are central to a people business. This has been particularly rewarding.\n\n## Q. How effective have you found your induction programme in preparing you as an INED and for the Standard Chartered Board and committee discussions?\n\nA. The induction programme, designed to be undertaken over several months, is extensive and well-designed. As my knowledge of the Group grew, my induction meetings became a mixture of introductions and substantive discussions, which worked well. I met with various employees and stakeholders around the Group, which provided a great opportunity to listen to, and understand, a number of different aspects of the bank. The induction programme also included joint sessions with other INEDs who joined the Board in 2022. These joint induction sessions were extremely helpful, as we learned from each other's perspectives and got to know each other better through the process. In addition, I joined part of the BRC meetings as an observer, on discussions covering topics such as reputation and sustainability risks, which dovetail into the work of the CSC. I also travelled with the Board to Hong Kong, Seoul and Singapore and undertook part of my induction in these overseas locations. Market visits are a helpful part of the induction programme and provide important commercial and regulatory context, which helped me to better understand the global nature of Standard Chartered's business.\n\n## Q. As the new chair of the Culture and Sustainability Committee, what do you see as its key priorities over the next five years?\n\nA. It is a privilege to chair the CSC and to help define the priorities of the Group in areas which lie at the heart of our organisation and inform everything that we do.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn terms of culture, our priorities include embedding a highperformance culture, whereby our people can excel and do so in prudent ways. Diversity and inclusion are essential building blocks which will go a long way in ensuring that our employees can succeed and thrive. Another key component to driving a healthy culture is through embedding valued behaviours, such as risk awareness, into the Group's culture.\n\nIn terms of sustainability, our key priorities include achieving the Group's net zero transition pathway, with particular focus being placed on ensuring that the milestones are clearly defined, measured and delivered. In addition, biodiversity and other emerging issues around safeguarding our planet will also be in focus in the coming years.\n\n## Q. How important is a company's culture to you and what are your views on the culture at Standard Chartered?\n\nA. Standard Chartered is a people business, so culture is central to its success and ability to contribute positively to our stakeholders, including clients, investors, employees and wider society. The Group is a global institution with footprints in over 52 markets, so it is particularly important that INEDs and executive directors continually engage with our stakeholders and always remain sensitive to the cultural and business context in which particular issues arise in individual markets. In the year I've been on the Board, I have been impressed by the focus on culture and the thoughtfulness of the Group in this area that is not straightforward to manage.\n\n## Q. As an INED, how do you build connections and maintain relationships with our key stakeholders?\n\nA. Delivering for our stakeholders is an area I have placed great focus on. I am pleased that the CSC has been refocused on supporting the Board's engagement notably with our employees, communities, suppliers and shareholders. For instance, our relationship with our colleagues has been strengthened by honing our Board workforce engagement sessions this year. During our workforce engagement sessions, which regularly take place as part of the Board's overseas market visits as well as in the Group's London headquarters, INEDs will spend time with colleagues to understand the areas in which the business excels, and also the areas where the My Voice survey scores are below average. With those insights, the CSC and the Board can have informed follow-up discussions, where we can reflect and act upon what we have heard to continually improve the Group's operations.",

        "page_content": "## 2023 Board effectiveness review\n\nThis year's review took the form of a questionnaire-based evaluation for the Board and its committees which was completed by every Board member. These questionnaires explored some of the themes for the previous year's review as well as probing the Board's and committees' performance through the year.\n\nThe results were compiled into a detailed report and conclusions were discussed with the Group Chairman and by the Governance and Nomination Committee ahead of a Board discussion. At the Board meeting, the key findings and recommendations were presented along with an Action Plan for 2024, which was then approved. Details of the key observations from this year's review and the agreed Action Plan are set out on page 155.\n\nThe Board's five committees were also included as part of the effectiveness review. The observations and key themes arising from the review were shared with the relevant committee Chairs before being circulated to each of the committees and action plans for 2024 agreed. Details of the key observations and action plans for each of the committees can be found within each of the committees' reports.\n\n## Director independence\n\nThe GNC reviews the independence of each of the nonexecutive directors, taking into account any circumstances likely to impair, or which could impair, their independence. Recommendations are then made to the Board for further consideration.\n\nIn determining the independence of a non-executive director, the Board considers each individual against the criteria set out in the UK Code and the Hong Kong Listing Rules and also considers their contribution and conduct at Board meetings, including how they demonstrate objective judgement and independent thinking.\n\nThe Board considers all of the non-executive directors to be independent of Standard Chartered, concluding that there are no relationships or circumstances likely to impair any INED's judgement.\n\n## External directorships and other business interests\n\nBoard members hold external directorships and other outside business interests. We recognise the significant benefits that broader boardroom exposure provides for our directors. However, we closely monitor the nature and quantity of external directorships our directors hold, in order to satisfy ourselves that any additional appointments will not adversely impact their time commitment to their role at Standard Chartered, and to ensure that all of our Board members remain compliant with the PRA directorship requirements, as well as the shareholder advisory groups' individual guidance on 'overboarding'. These requirements impose a limit on the number of directorships both executive and INEDs are permitted to hold.\n\nDetails of the directors' external directorships can be found in their biographies on pages 137 to 141. Before committing to an additional appointment, directors confirm the existence of any potential or actual conflicts, that the role will not breach their limit as set out by the PRA, and provide the necessary assurance that the appointment will not adversely impact their ability to continue to fulfil their role as a director of the Company. All directors continue to hold no more than four non-executive directorships (or one executive directorship alongside two non-executive directorships) permitted under the General Organisational Requirements Part of the PRA Rulebook.\n\nOur established internal processes ensure that directors do not undertake any new external appointments without first receiving formal approval of the Board. The Board has delegated authority to make such approvals to the Group Chairman, with the exception of his own appointments. Of those INEDs who took on new external directorships during the year, two were regarded as significant directorships (appointed to the board of a listed company) and as such were announced to the market in line with our listing obligations. Further detail on the specific appointments are provided below:\n\n- \u00b7 Carlson Tong was appointed to the board of Hong Kong Stock Exchange as a Board member on 23 April 2023.\n- \u00b7 Jackie Hunt was appointed to the Board of Willis Towers Watson plc as an independent non-executive director on 1 April 2023.\n\nThe two directors discussed their respective appointments with the Group Chairman in advance of accepting the positions. Each director confirmed the existence of any potential or actual conflicts; provided assurance that the respective roles would not breach their limits as set out by the PRA; and confirmed that their appointments would not impact their abilities to devote sufficient time and focus to both their Board and committee responsibilities.",

It forms a crucial part of Board decisions and discussions, as well as the review of our purpose, values and strategy.\n\nBoard activities led to a number of invaluable opportunities to engage with stakeholders across the Group's diverse network, including those identified on the following pages. Directors did not just engage collectively with stakeholders, but also individually. The Remuneration, Culture and Sustainability, Board Risk and Audit Committees also engaged directly with employees. Informal and formal sessions with stakeholders across our footprint help provide INEDs and independent adviser members with a comprehensive understanding of the Group's market operations, implementation of strategy, and the external and internal impact of the Group's activities.\n\nFurther detail regarding the Board's engagement with our stakeholders can be found on the following pages. Detail regarding how Board committees and their members engaged with stakeholders can be found in the committee report sections starting from page 162.",

We continuously reflect on how the Board engages with our investors, openly seeking feedback and reviewing previous activities. We believe this strengthens engagements and helps support the Board's focus on developing open and trusted relationships with investors.\n\nDuring the year, we maintained a comprehensive programme of engagement, including with investor advisory bodies and credit rating agencies, and provided updates on progress made to transform our business for improved returns.\n\nThe Group Chairman and other Board directors had direct contact with investors and advisory voting bodies during the year, and received regular updates from the Investor Relations team, including reports on market developments. The Group Chairman, as part of his role, leads engagement with shareholders and hosted the 2023 AGM alongside fellow Board members. The Group Chairman and certain Board members also held an investor stewardship event.\n\nMaria Ramos, our Senior Independent Director, was available as an alternative point of contact for shareholders.\n\nBill Winters and Andy Halford were the primary spokespeople for the Group in 2023. Throughout the year they engaged extensively with existing shareholders and potential new investors during individual or group meetings and conferences, either in person or virtually. Diego De Giorgi has replaced Andy, following his retirement, in this regard from January 2024. In addition, Ben Hung, CEO Asia hosted investors and analysts in Asia aimed at promoting greater awareness of our strategy and progress in that region. Various members of the Group's Management Team also participated in investor conferences throughout the year.\n\n## Institutional shareholders\n\nThe Group maintains a diverse, high-quality and predominantly institutional shareholder base. The Investor Relations team has primary responsibility for managing day-to-day communications with these shareholders and provides support to the Group Chairman, Group Chief Executive, Group Chief Financial Officer, other Board members and senior management in conducting a comprehensive engagement programme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPresentation material and webcast transcripts are made available on the Group's website and can be viewed at sc.com/investors\n\n## Investor stewardship event\n\nThe Group Chairman hosted a stewardship event in November 2023 alongside the chairs of the Board Audit and Remuneration committees. The Group Chairman provided an update regarding the Group's strategy, including with respect to sustainability, which was supplemented by opening remarks from the Remuneration Committee Chair. The Audit Committee Chair also provided updates on both the Audit and Risk committees and their activities during the year. This was followed by a Q&A session. Questions could be submitted in advance of the event, asked live in person or via a web-based platform for those who joined electronically.\n\n## Debt investors and credit rating agencies\n\nOur Debt Investor Relations team has primary responsibility for managing the Group's relationships with debt investors and the three major rating agencies, with local market chief executives and chief financial officers leading on smaller subsidiary ratings. In 2023, management met with debt investors across the regions, and maintained a regular dialogue with the rating agencies.\n\nIt is important that the Group, as an active issuer of senior unsecured and non-equity capital, maintains regular contact with debt investors to ensure continued appetite for the Group's credit. The Group's credit ratings are a key part of the external perception of our financial strength and creditworthiness.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information can be viewed at sc.com/investors\n\n<!-- image -->",

Within this portal, shareholders were able to view a live video feed of the AGM, submit voting instructions and questions in writing or ask them through an audio line. Shareholders who attended the meeting in person were able to submit voting instructions and ask questions directly.\n\nThe AGM is a key date in the Board's calendar and the hybrid format ensured that shareholders could engage with them regarding the Company's recent performance and strategic priorities. Questions received from shareholders covered a diverse range of topics, including climate and the Group's net zero pathway; diversity; the Group's strategy; director remuneration; shareholder engagement; share price and regulatory developments.\n\nAll Board-proposed resolutions were passed, with shareholder support for each ranging from 94.70 per cent to 100 per cent. We remain very grateful for the support of our shareholders.\n\nDetail regarding the directors' remuneration report resolution can be found in the Directors' Remuneration Report starting on page 182. Further detail on how the Group engaged with investors more generally can be found on page 57.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Board's engagement with clients and suppliers\n\nClients are central to everything we do and promoting productive, sustainable relationships with them is a key priority. In 2023, Board members, either collectively or individually, met clients face-to-face or virtually to keep abreast of developing client trends, experiences and needs. As part of our overseas Board programme, members of the Board also travelled within our footprint for meetings with clients and hosted client dinners throughout the year. In addition, updates on clients' insights form part of deep dives into product segment strategy at Board meetings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSuppliers provide efficient and sustainable goods and services for our business and certain members of the Board also met with them during the year. Detail on how the Group engaged more generally with clients and suppliers can be found on pages 55, 56, 58 and 59 of the Strategic report.\n\n## The Board's engagement with regulators and governments\n\nThe Board, either collectively or individually, engaged with relevant authorities and regulators including in the UK, Hong Kong and South Korea to discuss key items and developments. Topics of discussion varied, including change management, Execution Risk, information and cybersecurity, Data Risk, Model Risk management, Climate\n\nRisk, Credit Risk and macroeconomic developments, resolvability, and risk-free rate transition. Further detail on how the Group engaged with regulators and governments more generally can be found on page 57 of the Strategic report.\n\n## The Board's engagement with society\n\nThe Board receives regular updates from management concerning the communities and environment in which we operate.\n\nEither collectively or individually, directors were able to visit some of the Group's markets this year. Directors participated in a volunteering day in Jakarta, where they taught four modules from our financial education programme to children aged 15-16. In Seoul, directors took part in a community engagement session where they facilitated a mock investment and solution challenge with three female start-up CEOs from our Women in Entrepreneurship programme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, external and internal speakers provided input to the Board's discussions, which covered key societal issues such as China's emergence from the COVID pandemic, the evolving geopolitical landscape in the Middle East, and the global macroeconomic environment. Further detail on how the Group engaged with society more generally can be found on page 59.\n\nVoting results from the 2023 AGM can be viewed at sc.com/investors\n\nA summary of responses to questions on key themes raised by shareholders was made available on our website after the meeting and can be found at sc.com/agm",

        "page_content": "## The Board's engagement and linkages with the Group's subsidiaries\n\nThe Board and its committees recognise the importance of creating, maintaining and building upon appropriate linkages with the Group's subsidiaries. In 2023, the Group Chairman and INEDs engaged with the Group's subsidiaries through a number of forums. This included a video-enabled chair and committee chair engagement session, as well as other forms of interaction.\n\nThe Group Chairman hosted a virtual subsidiary chair engagement session during 2023. The event opened with an update from Bill Winters on the third-quarter results, progress against our strategic priorities, and areas of focus for the remainder of the year and going into 2024. The subsidiary chairs asked questions, both on the Group's performance and questions specific to their markets. Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als then updated the subsidiary chairs on Board changes, areas of focus for the year so far at the PLC Board, and Board diversity. The Chairman finished his thoughts on the macro outlook and challenges for the Group into 2024.\n\n## Committee chair engagement\n\nThe Audit Committee held its annual videoconference during the year, followed by a Q&A session.

        "page_content": "## The Board's engagement with employees\n\nThe Board places great importance on workforce engagement and values its interactions at all levels of the Group. Two-way dialogue through a variety of forums helps build the Board's understanding of key issues and developments around its markets, as well as providing an insight into the hands-on experiences of colleagues.\n\nThe role of the Board is distinct from management, and the directors are aware of the importance of overseeing, supporting and, where necessary, challenging management in implementing its people strategy and ensuring that the voice of colleagues is heard and reflected in decisionmaking.\n\nFollowing a review of the existing Board workforce engagement model by the CSC, an enhanced model involving more face-to-face colleague interaction was approved and implemented during the year. This enhances the model that was put in place immediately preceding the COVID pandemic and was reliant on virtual touchpoints. As part of these changes, the Board continues to adopt an alternative workforce engagement method as set out in the UK Code.\n\nThe enhanced model is designed to improve how Board members gather and share feedback obtained from colleagues, while paying special attention to expanding participation in engagement sessions to a more diverse set of voices. In 2023, the Board met colleagues in various markets, including Hong Kong, Jakarta, Seoul and London, with the enhanced model being trialled successfully in London, where the Board conducted informal listening sessions in September, and again as part of the Board's trip to Seoul in November. Ahead of these informal listening sessions, directors were briefed on the individual market,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nincluding local trends provided by the annual employee engagement survey (My Voice) and other relevant data points offered by local and regional management teams. Following the listening sessions, feedback was subsequently shared with the CSC and other stakeholders, where appropriate. Through these sessions directors were able to appreciate the challenges, successes and concerns shared by colleagues in each of the markets. The Board will continue to implement our enhanced model of engagement in London and in three overseas markets which the Board plans to visit in 2024.\n\nIn addition to this enhanced model, the Group has a comprehensive employee listening programme, through which the Board has an opportunity to understand diverse employee perspectives. These tools include the annual employee engagement survey, a continuous listening programme, lifecycle surveys and diagnostic research on specific areas of focus, such as flexible working and performance management. Details on all of our employee engagement can be found on page 60.\n\nThe Board is also informed about the operation of the Speaking Up programme, including on the themes of employee concerns raised through Speaking Up, employee confidence level in Speaking Up and the programme's usage volume. For more details on Speaking Up, please refer to page 131. Our Brand and Culture Dashboard has been in place since 2018 and provides a comprehensive overview of cultural change by reporting on several key metrics that allow us to monitor progress of our culture journey.\n\nFurther detail regarding employee engagement this year can be found within the Culture and Sustainability Committee report starting on page 174.\n\nINTERNAL\\Internal Recipient\n\nINED Kenya Visit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This report sets out the areas of significant focus for the Committee and its activities over the course of the year. Throughout the year, the Committee has carefully scrutinised and challenged credit impairments, key accounting issues, significant accounting estimates and judgements made by management to ensure that they are appropriate and clearly communicated in the Group's public disclosures. In light of the challenging external environment, the Group's investment in China Bohai Bank (Bohai), and the Group's exposures to China Commercial Real Estate (CRE) in particular, was an area of significant focus. The Committee reviewed carrying values for larger investments and management overlays.\n\nSovereign ratings and credit impairments have also been reviewed and discussed, including Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nigeria and Ghana. The Committee is mindful of the work of the BRC on emerging sovereign and country risks. The Audit Committee's work during the year complemented the wider review undertaken by the BRC on sovereign and country risks.\n\nThe Committee has been focused on the Group's implementation plan addressing UK ACG reforms, including the FRC's consultation on the UK Code and legislation published, and later withdrawn, by the UK government. In readiness for those proposals, work has been done on controls, process improvement and examining work already undertaken on stress testing, going concern and viability statements. Following its consultation, the FRC decided not to take forward a number of proposals. The Committee is considering which of the proposals the Group may decide to take forward on a voluntary basis. The updated UK Code was published in January 2024 and management is reviewing the implications and timings, with reporting being provided to the Committee regularly throughout the year. As the Board-appointed Consumer Duty Champion, I am fully engaged on the progress of Standard Chartered Bank's implementation plans, through regular briefings with the Consumer Duty Accountable Executive. The Committee also receives updates on Consumer Duty, including progress on agreed commitments and actions to ensure that Consumer Duty is fully embedded in our customer experience.\n\n## What are the main responsibilities of the Committee?\n\nThe Committee is responsible for oversight and advice to the Board on matters relating to financial, non-financial and narrative reporting. The Committee's role is to review, on behalf of the Board, the Group's internal controls, including internal financial controls. The Committee has exercised oversight of the work undertaken by the internal Conduct, Financial Crime & Compliance (CFCC) and Group Internal Audit (GIA) functions and EY. The Committee Chair reports to the Board on the Committee's key areas of focus following each meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee has written Terms of Reference that can be viewed at sc.com/termsofreference\n\n## Who else attended 2023 Committee meetings?\n\nThe Group Chairman; Group Chief Executive; Group Chief Financial Officer; Group Chief Financial Officer Designate (from 2 September); Group Chief Risk Officer; Group General Counsel; Group Head, Internal Audit; Group Head of CFCC; Group Head, Central Finance; representatives from Group Finance; Group Statutory Auditor; and the Group Company Secretary. Paul Khoo, independent adviser to the Board, attended a discussion on Financial Crime Compliance-related matters.\n\nAs part of, and in addition to most scheduled Committee meetings, the Committee held private members-only meetings. The Committee also met with the Group's Statutory Auditor, EY and the Group Head, Internal Audit, without management being present. The Committee members have detailed and relevant experience and bring an independent mindset to their role.\n\nThe Board is satisfied that Phil Rivett has recent and relevant financial experience. Phil is a chartered accountant with over 40 years' experience of professional accountancy and audit focused on banks and insurance companies. He led the audits of a number of leading banks during his career as senior audit partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers. He is also chair of the audit committee for Nationwide Building Society.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBiographical details of the Committee members can be viewed on pages 137 to 141\n\nThe Committee reviewed and discussed the refresh of the Group Code of Conduct and Ethics, and recommended this to the Board for endorsement. This was a substantial refresh, designed to provide a guide for colleague behaviour in a fast-changing world with new technologies including artificial intelligence, customer expectations and the shifting geopolitical landscape. We were keen to understand the roll-out and training that would be provided to fully embed this within the Group.\n\nThe Committee is cognisant of the benefits of engaging with broader stakeholders and updating them on the Committee's priorities and activities. As Audit Committee Chair, I participated in the Group's stewardship event in November 2023, where the work of the Audit Committee was discussed. Details on the stewardship event may be found on page 158.\n\nThe Committee has exercised its authority delegated by the Board for ensuring the integrity of the Group's published financial information by discussing and challenging the judgements and disclosures made by management, and the assumptions and estimates on which they are based. The Committee has exercised judgement in deciding which of the issues it considered to be significant in the financial statements, and this report sets out the material matters that it has considered in these deliberations.\n\nAs a result of the Committee's work in 2023, assurance has been provided to the Board on the quality and appropriateness of the Group's financial reporting, and on internal audit, compliance and regulatory matters, to continue to safeguard the interests of the Group's broader stakeholders. The following pages provide insight and context into the Committee's work and activities during the year.\n\nPhil Rivett Chair of the Audit Committee\n\n<!-- image -->",

Updates from management were also provided.\n- \u00b7 Received reports from EY and management regarding EY's FCA Client Assets (CASS) audit of Standard Chartered Bank.\n\nThe Committee met privately with EY at the end of certain Committee meetings, without management being present.\n\nPhil Rivett met regularly with the EY partners leading the Group's audit during the course of the year.\n\nThe Company complies with the Statutory Audit services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Process and Audit Committee responsibilities) Order 2014, which relates to the frequency and governance of tenders for the appointment of the external auditor. As a UK public interest entity, the Group is required to tender the audit every 10 years and rotate the auditor every 20 years. As long as the Committee remains satisfied with EY's performance, the Group has no current intention of tendering for an alternative external auditor to commence before the end of the current required 10 year period. Any tender would be in respect of 2030 onwards and would likely occur in 2027, in order to allow sufficient time to plan for a transition.\n\nEY has been the Group's Statutory Auditor for four years. In accordance with the Audit Practices Board's requirements, the lead audit engagement partner will have held the role for five years following the completion of the audit for the year-ending 31 December 2025. The lead engagement partner, David Canning-Jones, has a background of auditing banks and understands the markets in which the Group operates. Following completion of the audit for the year-ending 31 December 2024, Micha Missakian, an EY senior audit partner who is also experienced in auditing global banking institutions, will assume the role of the lead audit engagement partner.\n\nFollowing the 2017 audit tender, EY was appointed as the Group's Statutory Auditor for the financial year ended 31 December 2020. EY has been re-appointed as the Group's Statutory Auditor for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 at the 2023 AGM.",

In particular, a severe liquidity stress test was performed, in light of banking sector events, and the Committee also reviewed and challenged the Group's Annual Cyclical Scenario (ACS) stress test results for submission to the Bank of England (BoE).\n\nCredit Risk has been reviewed and discussed at most Committee meetings, given the uncertain external environment, with China CRE and global CRE being key areas of focus. Sovereign Risk remained a priority, with global trends throughout the year being closely monitored.\n\nThe Group's hedging strategies were robustly challenged, with specific deep dives on Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book, Foreign Exchange, Treasury Portfolios and Financial Markets.\n\nThe Committee is aware of its critical role in overseeing and assessing robust ICS defence strategies. A key focus of 2023 was ICS Risk management, with representation from the three lines of defence and our Cyber Advisor to the Board, Sir Iain Lobban. In particular, we scrutinised the Group's ICS Risk Appetite and Strategic Plan. The Committee has dedicated significant time to ICS Risk this year, including scheduling an ad hoc meeting and completing ICS training. ICS Risk will remain a key priority given the evolving and dynamic landscape in which we operate.\n\nThe Committee has had oversight of Operational Risk during the year, with particular focus on the Group's data centre migration programme.\n\nResolvability was discussed regularly throughout the year, and we reviewed and approved the Group's Resolvability Assessment Report, ahead of submission to the PRA in October 2023. Assurance was\n\n## What are the main responsibilities of the Committee?\n\nThe Committee is responsible for exercising oversight, on behalf of the Board, of the key risks of the Group. It reviews the Group's Risk Appetite Statement and Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) and makes recommendations to the Board. Its responsibilities also include reviewing the appropriateness and effectiveness of the Group's risk management systems, key controls and considering the implications of material regulatory change proposals, reviewing reports on principal risks, including Climate Risk, to the Group's business, providing oversight and challenge to the design and execution of stress testing, and ensuring effective due diligence on material acquisitions and disposals. The Committee Chair reports to the Board on the Committee's key areas of focus following each meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee has written Terms of Reference that can be viewed at sc.com/termsofreference\n\n## Who else attended Committee meetings in 2023?\n\nThe Group Chairman; Group Chief Executive; Group Chief Financial Officer; Group Chief Financial Officer Designate (from 2 September); Group Chief Risk Officer (GCRO); Group Head of Enterprise Risk Management; Group General Counsel; Group Treasurer; Group Head, Conduct, Financial Crime & Compliance; Group Head, Internal Audit; the Group's Statutory Auditor; and the Group Company Secretary.\n\nSir Iain Lobban, independent adviser to the Board, regularly attended discussions on Information and Cyber Security Risk and technology. Paul Khoo, an independent adviser to the Board, attended discussions on Financial Crime Risk (FCR) related matters. EY attended all Committee meetings in 2023. As part of, and in addition to scheduled Committee meetings, the Committee held private members-only meetings. The Committee's membership comprises INEDs who have a deep and broad experience of banking and the risk factors affecting the Group, including geopolitical, economic, IT, Financial Crime (FC) and general business risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBiographical details of the Committee members can be viewed on pages 137 to 141\n\ntaken from the extensive work performed by the second and third lines of defence to review and challenge Resolvability documentation prepared by the first line.\n\nOperational Resilience remained a key topic in 2023, with the Committee challenging the embedding of Important Business Services (IBS) and Impact Tolerance Statements (ITS) within the Group. The Committee reviewed and recommended to the Board for approval the Group's Operational Resilience Self-Assessment. Furthermore, we considered and approved material changes to the Group's IBS and ITS arising from the annual review, in accordance with authority delegated by the Board. Progress to meet the 2025 regulatory deadline continues to be carefully monitored to ensure compliance.\n\nFinancial Crime Risk has been a key feature of the Committee's work during the year. The CCIB and CPBB Risk reviews both covered FCR matters, and we received dedicated papers on client due diligence and surveillance and Russian sanctions. Towards the end of the year, we considered emerging FC threats faced by the Group and risk mitigation; and we reviewed and discussed the coverage of FCR by the Committee, Audit Committee and the Board, to ensure that the balance is appropriate. This discussion provided useful suggestions for enhancement, which will be taken forward in 2024.\n\nIn December 2023, we welcomed the board risk committee chairs from the Group's Hong Kong and Singapore banking subsidiaries as observers. I hosted a call with subsidiary board risk committee chairs from across the Group in July 2023, designed to strengthen subsidiary governance linkages and engagement.\n\nThe following pages provide insight and context into the Committee's work and activities during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Maria Ramos\n\nChair of the Board Risk Committee",

        "page_content": "## Risk information provided to the Committee\n\nThe Committee is authorised to seek any information that it requires in connection with its purpose consistent with the requirements of BCBS 239 (a set of principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting to enable enhanced risk management and decision-making) that will allow the Committee to fulfil its governance mandate relating to risks to which the Group is exposed, and alert senior management when risk reports do not meet its requirements. The Committee will receive an update on the level of compliance with the requirements of BCBS 239 (as at 31 December 2023), once the outcome of the self-assessment is available on 29 February 2024.\n\nThe Committee receives regular reports on risk management and tracks a wide range of risk metrics through a Board Risk Information report. This report provides an overview of the Group's risk profile against the Group's Risk Appetite Statement. The GCRO's report covers the macroeconomic environment, geopolitical outlook, material events and disclosures and ongoing risks. Coverage of Principal Risk Types and regulatory matters are also included in this report. Regular updates on Country Risk and geopolitical tensions have been reported on and discussed throughout the year.\n\n## Risk management disclosures\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the risk disclosures in the Annual Report and the Half Year Report, and has also reviewed the disclosures regarding the work of the Committee.\n\n## Interaction with the Group Chief Risk Officer\n\nThe Committee Chair meets individually with the GCRO regularly in between formal Committee meetings. These meetings allow open discussion of any matters relating to issues arising from the Committee's formal discussions and inform the forward-looking agenda.\n\n## Interaction with management\n\nThe Committee is mindful of the need to hold management directly accountable when issues have arisen and have been reported by the GCRO. Senior management has attended Committee meetings for deeper discussions in such instances. The Committee Chair also meets individually with senior leaders of the Risk function.\n\n## Interaction with regulators\n\nMaria Ramos attended meetings with the PRA and the BoE over the course of 2023 and in early 2024.\n\n## Interaction between Board committees on risk-related issues\n\nIn the few instances where it does not have primary oversight for a given type of risk, the Committee interacts closely with other Board committees where the remit of these other Committees clearly covers risk-related matters. For example, the Audit Committee reviews the Group's internal financial controls and has oversight of regulatory compliance and the Culture and Sustainability Committee has oversight of culture and sustainability-related matters. The interaction assists the Committee in ensuring that it is well informed on discussions held, and the close collaboration of the Committee Chairs helps to ensure that there are no gaps and any potential for unnecessary duplication is avoided.\n\n## Risk function resourcing\n\nThe Committee has sought and received assurance that the Risk function is adequately resourced to perform its remit effectively. The Committee reviewed and discussed a paper setting out an overview of the changes to the Risk function in 2023, management's assessment of the adequacy of people resources within the function and the forward-looking view of the Risk function.\n\n## Linkages with subsidiary board risk committees\n\nIn 2023, Maria Ramos attended a risk committee meeting of SCBHK. The risk committee chairs of SCBHK and SCBSL attended one Board Risk Committee meeting. This practice will continue in 2024 to reinforce these important linkages.\n\nMaria Ramos hosted an annual video-conference with the chairs of subsidiary board risk committees and INEDs in July 2023.\n\nPlease refer to page 160 on linkages between the Committee and chairs of subsidiary board risk committees.",

I have reviewed the operation and scope of the Committee, including how it enhances the scrutiny of the Board in key areas, how it interacts with the Board and other committees, and how it discharges its responsibilities. Building on a strong foundation, the Committee has been refocused on the development of our Sustainability, Climate and Culture initiatives and the Stands.\n\nSustainability is a strategic priority for the Group, helping people to thrive long term. Following the Board's approval of our refreshed Sustainability Strategy, the Committee has been overseeing the implementation of this plan, which includes delivering on our net zero commitments, scaling up Sustainable Finance, leveraging our Innovation Hubs to drive ecosystem development and future income, and further embedding sustainability across the Group. At every meeting, the Committee has been monitoring the fast-moving global sustainability landscape to ensure the Group continues to strengthen its support for clients on their transition journeys.\n\nThe Committee has overseen the rationalisation of the Group's approach to sustainability, underpinned by both long-term goals our Sustainability Aspirations - and short-term targets and priorities - our Strategic Pillars. These objectives are explicitly linked to performance metrics, to assist the Group in narrowing its focus to deliver greater relevance and impact for our stakeholders.\n\nLast year, Jasmine spoke about the work that was in progress to enhance our Board workforce engagement programme. I'm pleased to report that the Board has revamped its approach and it is being monitored by the Committee. Under this framework, all INEDs will participate in engagement sessions with targeted groups of colleagues as part of our programme of Board visits and in our London headquarters. These sessions will provide directors with a better sense of our colleagues' challenges, successes and concerns, and add to the information received from employee surveys and other engagements.\n\nThe Group's Stands are particularly important as they represent not only for what the Group stands but also how we can deliver concrete impact over a multi-year time horizon. During the year, the Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What are the main responsibilities of the Committee?\n\nThe Committee was formed by the Board to oversee the Group's culture and sustainability priorities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee has written Terms of Reference that can be viewed at sc.com/termsofreference\n\n## Who else attended Committee meetings in 2023?\n\nThe Group Chairman; Group Chief Executive; Group Head, Human Resources; Group Head Corporate Affairs, Brand & Marketing; Chief Sustainability Officer, Group General Counsel and Group Company Secretary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBiographical details of Committee members can be found on pages 137 to 141\n\nreceived a progress update on how the Stands were being 'lived' in practice and the ongoing initiatives framed around three key areas: financial inclusion through lifting participation, initiatives in supporting SMEs, and the contributions of ESG Products/ Sustainable Finance. The Committee is also overseeing a review of the metrics underpinning each of the Stands to ensure that we can measure progress and look to incorporate relevant aspects within our annual and longer-term remuneration incentives.\n\nThis year, the Committee endorsed phase 2 of Futuremakers - the Group's global initiative to tackle inequality and promote economic inclusion. The Committee applauded the achievement of phase 1 which raised USD93.3 million from 2019 to 2023 and reached more than 2.1 million young people across 43 countries to empower the next generation to learn, earn and grow. Building on the successes of phase 1, we have refined our focus to create greater impact in our communities in the next seven years (2024 to 2030). With a select group of value-adding programme partners, we will lift the economic participation of disadvantaged young women and micro businesses.\n\nThe Group's culture of excellence has been defined as 'a one Bank culture of ambition, action and accountability that puts our clients at the heart of all we do'. The Committee has been overseeing the ongoing work to deliver on this aspiration, and it is pleasing to see the effect of this with the most recent My Voice survey showing that the employee experience is improving across the Group.\n\nFocus on diversity and inclusion (D&I) initiatives continued, and the Committee was supportive of the attention and focus on 'inclusion sentiment', measured through an index of eight indicators in the My Voice survey. The Committee has overseen the Group's progress on advancing its D&I maturity and performance culture.\n\nThe following report provides further insight into the Committee's work over the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dr Linda Yueh\n\nChair of the Culture and Sustainability Committee",

We welcomed Linda Yueh to the Board as an INED on 1 January 2023, Christine Hodgson retired on 31 January 2023 after nine years on the Board, and Jasmine Whitbread retired after eight years, at the Annual General Meeting. Following Jasmine's retirement, Linda was appointed Chair of the Culture and Sustainability Committee and a member of the Governance and Nomination Committee. This year, we are sorry to say goodbye to Gay Huey Evans and Carlson Tong. As announced on 16 February 2024, Gay will step down from the Board with effect from 29 February 2024. Carlson will step down on 9 May 2024, ahead of the AGM. We thank Gay for her dedication and significant contribution, particularly as chair of the Board Financial Crime Risk Committee, and Carlson for his dedication and contribution as a member of the Audit and Board Risk Committees. We also thank Paul Khoo, who steps down this year as Financial Crime Advisor to the Board. Paul's wise counsel has been invaluable in our financial crime compliance journey over the past nine years.\n\nAfter nine years as GCFO, Andy Halford decided to retire from the Group. The Committee spent considerable time overseeing the search for his replacement. A robust search and assessment process was undertaken, both internally, through the succession plans which were in place, and mapped externally, in conjunction with executive search firm Russell Reynolds. A number of exceptional candidates were identified, both internal and external, and Committee members met with a range of shortlisted candidates, of which Diego De Giorgi emerged as the preferred successor. The Committee was impressed by Diego's profound commercial acumen and strong business experience, including deep investor and entrepreneurial experience, which he has developed over more than three decades in the global financial services sector. Diego joined the Group in September 2023 as GCFO Designate and began a comprehensive induction into the Group. After receiving regulatory approval he was appointed to the Board as GCFO in January 2024. Andy will remain with the Group as a senior adviser until the end of August 2024.\n\nOn 16 February 2024 we announced that we are welcoming Diane Jurgens to the Board from 1 March 2024. Diane is a highly experienced and respected technologist who will bring significant technology and transformation expertise and insight to the Board having operated across a variety of sectors and the Group's key markets.\n\nThe Committee spends a great deal of its time considering INED succession planning and the wider composition of the Board, ensuring that the Board has, and will continue to have, the necessary mix of skills, knowledge, expertise and diversity, in the broadest sense, to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What are the main responsibilities of the Committee?\n\nThe Committee has responsibility for assisting and advising the Board in relation to the composition of, and appointments to, the Company's Board and its committees, and the development of a diverse pipeline for succession.\n\nThe Committee is also responsible for considering the impact of material changes to corporate governance regulation and legislation affecting the Group, and has oversight of the Group's approach to subsidiary corporate governance.\n\nThe Committee reports to the Board on its key areas of focus following each Committee meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee has written Terms of Reference that can be viewed at sc.com/termsofreference\n\n## Who else attended Committee meetings in 2023?\n\nThe Group Chief Executive; Group Head, HR; and Group Company Secretary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBiographical details of the Committee members can be viewed on pages 137 to 141\n\nenable the Group's long-term success. This year, the Committee has been focused on the recruitment of high-quality candidates with a diversity of skills and backgrounds including technology, sustainability, consumer focus, and improving gender diversity and representation. Throughout we remain committed to the importance of maintaining gender diversity on the Board. The Committee also provided oversight of the detailed executive and senior management succession plans.\n\nWhile, as a result of the departure of Christine and Jasmine, we were disappointed to end the year just below both our own gender diversity target of at least 40 per cent female representation and that set out in the UK Listing Rules, following the composition changes to the Board announced on 16 February 2024, by the 2024 AGM female representation on the Board will be 42 per cent.\n\nAs part of the Committee's governance oversight role, it considered proposals from the FRC and the UK Government for ACG reforms. The new UK Code was published in January 2024. The Committee will consider the changes to the UK Code as part of its Committee agenda in 2024, ahead of the UK Code 2024 becoming applicable to the Company in 2025, and additional internal control reporting provisions becoming applicable the following year. It also received updates from the three regional CEOs who each have responsibility for the subsidiary governance processes across their regions and provide a holistic view of the governance framework and challenges faced across the Group's footprint.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the progress of our induction programme for Linda Yueh, Robin Lawther and Jackie Hunt, and found that the programme had been well received and that good progress had been made. The Committee also paid significant attention to enhancing the effectiveness of the Board and its committees. In the autumn of 2023, a Board effectiveness review was undertaken, internally facilitated by the Group Company Secretary, which concluded that the Board continues to operate effectively while also signalling several areas for improvement, details of which can be found on page 155.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dr Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als\n\nChair of the Governance and Nomination Committee",

This report provides an overview of the Remuneration Committee's work on remuneration for the executive directors and the wider workforce. The directors' remuneration policy has operated as intended, incentivising performance linked to the Group's strategy and aligning with shareholder interests.\n\nThe Group continues to make significant progress and has delivered strong performance in 2023, achieving our ambition of a double-digit return on tangible equity (RoTE) for the full year. The decisions taken by the Committee were based on careful consideration of a broad range of factors including the economic environment in our markets, performance across the Group, and the need for appropriate and fair reward for our workforce.\n\n## Our performance in 2023\n\nUnderlying profit before tax is up 27 per cent at ccy on 2022, reflecting significant progress in our high-growth markets despite an uncertain picture for the global economy. RoTE has continued to grow above prepandemic levels and is up 240 basis points to 10.1 per cent.\n\n## RoTE performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group remains well capitalised with Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio at 14.1 per cent.\n\nThe formulaic outcome for Group performance, based on the balanced scorecard, was 80 per cent. Of this, 38 per cent (out of a possible 50 per cent) related to financial performance including income up 13 per cent and the increase in RoTE. The remaining 42 per cent related to the achievement of non-financial goals, including strong client satisfaction performance, improved growth across target markets and achievements against our sustainability targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee pages 196 and 197 for more information\n\n## Financial KPIs\n\nProfit before taxation\n\n$5,678\n\nm\n\n27%\n\nReturn on tangible equity\n\n10.1%\n\n240bps (underlying basis)\n\nTotal shareholder return\n\n9.4%\n\n2022: 41.4%\n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 ratio\n\n14.1%\n\n10bps\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group-wide remuneration\n\n## 2023 discretionary annual incentives\n\nThe Group scorecard formulaic assessment of 80 per cent is the starting point for determining discretionary incentives.",

The Committee also considers risk, control and conduct matters, including ongoing investigations and matters raised by regulators.\n\nFollowing its review of these factors, the Committee determined that a reduction of 15 percentage points from the initial scorecard outcome was appropriate. In making this decision, while noting that 2023 performance was very positive, the Committee was conscious to maintain an appropriate balance between rewarding our employees and delivering appropriate value to shareholders.\n\n## Calculating the Group scorecard outcome for discretionary incentives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 65% Group scorecard outcome\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee pages 196 and 197 for further details\n\n## Discretionary incentive pool\n\n| Incentive pool   ($m)   | % change   (reported)   | % change   (same store basis)   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 1,574                   | (1%)                    | (2%)                            |\n\n## 2024 salaries\n\nWe have increased salaries in 2024 by 2.2 per cent on average globally. This is lower than last year, reflecting falling inflation in a number of our locations. We have focused the increases on junior employees, and on markets that continue to experience high rates of inflation.\n\nAdditionally, we have provided targeted support through off-cycle salary increases to colleagues facing economic hardships in countries such as Angola, Argentina, Egypt, Ghana, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Turkey and Zimbabwe.\n\n## Executive director remuneration in 2023\n\n## Annual incentives for executive directors\n\nAnnual incentives for Bill and Andy are based predominantly on the Group scorecard with an additional element for personal performance, as below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Financials   | Strategic   | Individual performance   |\n|--------------|-------------|--------------------------|\n| 50% 40%      | 50% 40%     | 50% 40%                  |\n\nFor 2023, the Committee approved the following annual incentive outcomes, including individual performance assessments, for Bill and Andy.

As usual, the final relative TSR outcome will be assessed three years from the date of award, in March 2024.

Based on the review, the Committee determined that the price difference was not significant and, therefore, there was no windfall gain and no adjustment to the award was required.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee pages 200 and 201 for further details\n\n## Single total figure of remuneration for 2023\n\nThe 2023 annual incentive and projected 2021-23 LTIP performance outcome results in a 2023 single figure for Bill of GBP7,836,987 and for Andy of GBP4,921,095. This represents year-on-year increases of 22 and 23 per cent respectively, largely due to the projected performance outcome of the 2021-23 LTIP award.\n\n## 2023 single total figure of remuneration (\u00a3000)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSalary, pension, benefits\n\nAnnual incentive\n\nLTIP\n\n## Bill Winters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Andy Halford\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA significant portion of both Bill's and Andy's total remuneration is share-based with delivery and release over an eight-year period.

He has been succeeded by Diego De Giorgi who joined on 1 September 2023. Diego was appointed as GCFO and joined the Board as an executive director on 3 January 2024, after receiving regulatory approval.\n\n## Andy\n\nAndy remained as GCFO and an executive director until 2 January 2024, helping to ensure a smooth transition. After stepping down as GCFO, he is continuing as a Senior Adviser, working on strategic projects for the Group. He will continue to receive his salary and benefits until he retires on 31 August 2024.\n\nAndy will be considered an eligible leaver and, in accordance with the directors' remuneration policy, was eligible for a 2023 annual incentive award, determined by the Committee based on Group and individual performance during 2023.\n\nAs an eligible leaver, Andy will retain all existing LTIP awards subject to the achievement of performance measures. He will receive the full value of his 2021-23 LTIP award given the performance period will complete during his employment. His other awards will be pro-rated for the period until he retires. All outstanding awards will vest and release as scheduled and remain subject to malus and clawback arrangements. Andy is not eligible for any further LTIP awards and will not receive an award in March 2024.\n\nAndy will be eligible to be considered for a pro-rated 2024 annual incentive award for time served as a Senior Advisor, based on contribution.\n\nIn line with the approved directors' remuneration policy, the Committee considers annual salary increases for executive directors taking account of any increase in scope or responsibility, market competitiveness, and any salary increases across the Group. Taking these factors into account, and in line with the approach of focusing increases on junior employees, fixed pay for Bill and Diego will not be increased in 2024 with their salaries being GBP2,517,000 and GBP1,650,000 respectively.\n\n## 2024-26 LTIP awards to be granted in March 2024\n\nHaving considered 2023 performance, the Committee has approved the following LTIP awards for the period of 2024-26.\n\n|                 | 2024-26 LTIP  award (\u00a3)   | % of salary   |\n|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------|\n| Bill Winters    | 3,322,440                 | 132%          |\n| Diego De Giorgi | 2,178,000                 | 132%          |\n\nThe LTIP awards are performance-linked and outcomes will depend upon achieving specified targets by the end of the three-year performance period.\n\nFollowing the assessment of performance, resulting shares will vest pro-rata from years three to seven, with an additional retention period of 12 months after vesting.\n\n## Diego\n\nDiego's remuneration arrangements have been set in accordance with the directors' remuneration policy.\n\n|         | Value (\u00a3)   | Delivery method                                                                |\n|---------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Salary  | 1,650,000   | 67% cash 33% delivered in shares  - released in equal  amounts over five years |\n| Pension | 110,000     | 10% of the cash element  of salary                                             |\n\nDiego also receives core benefits in line with the approach for all UK employees with additional role-specific benefits appropriate to his responsibilities.\n\nDiego was eligible for a 2023 annual incentive which has been pro-rated to reflect the period for which he was employed during the year.

These are now combined with the existing sustainability measures, with a weighting of 25 per cent for this category. The overall scorecard continues to be split 60 per cent financial and 40 per cent non-financial.\n\nDiscussions with shareholders were held in December 2023 and January 2024 on the development of these performance measures and targets and the input received was incorporated into the final decisions by the Committee.\n\nNon-financial\n\n100",

This should support the Group in generating sustained and sustainable returns in the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders. The removal of the cap does not change this.\n\nWe are considering our pay structures and how they might evolve now that the cap has been removed. For our executive directors, remuneration will continue to be set in line with relevant regulations and guidance and our approved directors' remuneration policy which includes maximums in respect of variable pay. These maximums do not change as a result of the cap being removed and the current structure will continue until a new policy is proposed and approved by shareholders, scheduled to be at the 2025 Annual General Meeting (AGM).\n\n## How to use this report\n\nWithin the directors' remuneration report we have used colour coding to denote different elements of remuneration, as follows:\n\nIn January 2024 the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) published a revised UK Corporate Governance Code which will apply from 1 January 2025. Following a consultation on potential changes during 2023, many of the proposed changes were not included in the revised Code. We will reflect the updates that have been made in our 2025 report.\n\nIn the rest of this report we present the disclosures required by regulations, as well as additional information to explain how remuneration for our executives aligns with our strategy, shareholder interests and wider workforce pay. In making remuneration decisions for 2023 and beyond, we have also been mindful of the experience of our wider stakeholder group.\n\nI would like to thank my fellow Committee members for the work they have put into the Committee, and our shareholders for their ongoing support and engagement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shirish Apte\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee\n\n(All disclosures in the directors' remuneration report are unaudited unless otherwise stated.

We review executive director fixed and variable remuneration opportunity against a peer group of international banks to ensure that it remains appropriately competitive. This peer group reflects both our global footprint and where we compete for talent. Market data used in benchmarking is based on the latest published report and accounts. In addition, we consider executive director remuneration against FTSE30 companies, with data sourced from an external provider.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe current bank peer group comprises: ANZ, Bank of America, Bank of Nova Scotia, Barclays, BBVA, BNP Paribas, CIBC, Citigroup, DBS, Deutsche Bank, FirstRand, HSBC, ICICI, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Lloyds Banking Group, National Australia Bank, NatWest, OCBC, Santander, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, UBS, United Overseas Bank 1 GCFO total compensation is based on Diego De Giorgi's target opportunity\n\n## Executive director remuneration compared with wider workforce\n\nThe balance between fixed and variable remuneration is geared to provide a greater proportion of fixed remuneration for more junior employees to give more financial security.

If necessary, a deep dive will be commissioned to understand risk, control and conduct issues in a particular location or business area. The most severe MREs are escalated for oversight by the Remuneration Committee. At year end, a summary of risk and control matters will be reviewed and discussed to determine any impact to Group incentives.

It supports our focus on being a great place to work and the achievement of our strategic goals.\n\nTogether with broader human resources initiatives supporting diversity and inclusion, organisational and individual development, and the recognition of high performance, we are building a culture of excellence where, through innovation and continuous improvement, every one of our colleagues can fulfil their potential.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFull details of the Charter can be found in our Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Impact Report here: sc.com/diversityfairpayreport\n\n## Other key 2023 highlights\n\n## myPerformance\n\nWe have continued to embed our new approach to performance management which is designed to motivate outperformance and deliver a culture of excellence. With this new approach, we are creating a more transparent, realtime feedback culture underpinned by continuous feedback, coaching, and open two-way performance and development conversations with people leaders. Data gathered through sentiment surveys and metrics on goal setting, as well as feedback and year-end review decisions have shown positive signs on achieving our aim to embed the behaviours of a high performance culture across the Bank. For example, more than 70 per cent of employees feel that myPerformance has had a positive impact on their ability to perform at their best.\n\n## Revising our Fair Pay Charter\n\nSince the introduction of the Charter in 2017, our Group priorities and the external environment have shifted.\n\nWe have made significant progress in areas such as living wage and have laid a foundation for a more consistent and transparent approach to remuneration, supporting equal pay and greater flexibility.\n\nBuilding on this progress, our focus has now shifted to better aligning our proposition to our values and evolving employee needs, while supporting the culture of excellence needed to drive long-term success and maintaining the progress made to date.\n\nThe revised Charter serves to reiterate our commitment to fair and equitable reward and hold ourselves accountable. It reflects our latest priorities, focusing on four priority areas, each critical to driving the Bank forward:\n\n- \u00b7 Equal pay - we commit to offering equal pay for equal work by market and do not tolerate unlawful discrimination.\n- \u00b7 Purpose-led - we provide a holistic set of reward and benefits that align with our valued behaviours and Stands.\n- \u00b7 Competitive opportunities - we aim to pay colleagues competitively.\n- \u00b7 Performance driven - we are committed to motivating, recognising and rewarding sustainable high performance.\n\n## Group-wide variable remuneration\n\nTo support our objective of embedding a high performance culture in the organisation, during 2023 the Committee reviewed the effectiveness of our existing Target Total Variable Compensation plan which c. 75 per cent of our colleagues participate in.\n\nFor the 2023 performance year, to strengthen the link between performance and pay, we allocated a greater proportion of our incentive pool for individual differentiation. Further changes will be communicated and implemented for the 2024 performance year.\n\nWe will continue to work on areas such as further encouraging upward feedback, upskilling people leaders and ensuring the new approach is well understood Bank wide.\n\n## [[ New recognition platform]]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of our drive to reinforce a high performance culture, in 2024 we have launched a new recognition platform, Appreciate, enabling colleagues to recognise one another's outstanding achievements, further promoting the habit of recognising and celebrating excellence.",

Our positive financial and strategic results have been significantly influenced by his leadership and focus on delivery. In particular, Bill has had an extensive influence on our sustainability achievements, where we have exceeded many of our targets and continued to enhance, update and implement our sustainability strategy (see more details on pages 66 to 79). Our achievement of RoTE of 10.1 per cent has followed a cultural embedding of the need to deliver sustainable improvement of the metric into the Group's psyche, making it an understandable and focused

The group is reviewed annually, prior to new LTIP awards being made and following the 2023 review the group for the 2024-26 LTIP awards has been updated. Bank of China, ICBC and State Bank of India are no longer considered to be comparable peers as they are state-owned banks which have significantly different purpose, strategies and performance profiles.

Total remuneration is calculated in line with the single figure methodology and insured benefits data is based on notional premiums. No other adjustments or assumptions have been made.\n- \u00b7 CEO pay is the single figure of remuneration for 2023 and restated for 2022 to reflect the final LTIP performance outcome assessed in March 2023. The 2023 ratio will be restated in the 2024 report to reflect the final LTIP performance outcome for eligible employees and the CEO.\n- \u00b7 The Committee considered the data for three individuals identified at the quartiles for 2023 and believes it fairly reflects UK employee pay. They were full-time employees and received remuneration in line with policy, without exceptional pay.\n- \u00b7 Our LTIP links remuneration to the achievement of long-term strategy and reinforces alignment with shareholder interests. Participation is typically senior employees who directly influence the award's performance targets. The identified quartile employees are not LTIP participants.",

        "page_content": "## Events after the balance sheet date\n\nFor details on post balance sheet events, see Note 35 to the financial statements.\n\n## Code for Financial Reporting Disclosure\n\nThe Group's 2023 financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the principles of the UK Finance Disclosure Code for Financial Reporting Disclosure.\n\n## Viability and going concern\n\nHaving made appropriate enquiries, the Board is satisfied that the Company and the Group as a whole has adequate resources to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from 23 February 2024 and therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\n\nThe directors' viability statement in respect to the Group can be found in the Strategic report on pages 88 and 89, while the directors' going concern considerations for the Group can be found on page 369.\n\n## Sufficiency of public float\n\nAs at the date of this report, the Company has maintained the prescribed public float under the rules governing the listing of securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the Hong Kong Listing Rules), based on the information publicly available to the Company and within the knowledge of the directors.\n\n## Research and development\n\nDuring the year, the Group invested $2.01 billion (2022: $1.98 billion) in research and development, of which $0.99 billion (2022: $0.94 billion) was recognised as an expense. The research and development investment primarily related to the planning, analysis, design, development, testing, integration, deployment and initial support of technology systems.\n\n## Political donations\n\nThe Group has a policy in place which prohibits donations being made that would: (i) improperly influence legislation or regulation, (ii) promote political views or ideologies, and (iii) fund political causes. In alignment to this, no political donations were made in the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\n## Directors and their interests\n\nThe membership of the Board, together with the Directors' biographical details, are given on pages 137 to 141. Details of the directors' beneficial and non-beneficial interests in the ordinary shares of the Company as at 31 December 2023 are shown in the Directors' remuneration report on pages 204 and 213. As at 16 February 2024, there had been no changes to those interests in relation to directors remaining in office at that date. The Group operates a number of share-based arrangements for its directors and employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails of these arrangements are included in the Directors' remuneration report and in Note 29 to the financial statements\n\nThe Company has received from each of the INEDs an annual confirmation of independence pursuant to Rule 3.13 of the Hong Kong Listing Rules and still considers all of the non- executive directors to be independent.\n\nAt no time during the year did any director hold a material interest in any contracts of significance with the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings.\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006, we have established a process requiring directors to disclose proposed outside business interests before any are entered into. This enables prior assessment of any conflict or potential conflict of interest and any impact on time commitment. On behalf of the Board, the GNC reviews existing conflicts of interest annually to consider if they continue to be conflicts of interest, and also to revisit the terms upon which they were authorised. The Board is satisfied that our processes in this respect continue to operate effectively.\n\nSubject to company law, the Articles of Association and the authority granted to directors in general meeting, the directors may exercise all the powers of the Company and may delegate authorities to committees. The Articles of Association contain provisions relating to the appointment, re-election and removal of directors. Newly appointed directors retire at the AGM following appointment and are eligible for election. All directors are nominated for annual re-election by shareholders subject to continued satisfactory performance based upon their annual assessment.\n\nNon-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of one year and subject to (re)election by shareholders at AGMs, in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018.\n\nThe Company has granted indemnities to all of its directors on terms consistent with the applicable statutory provisions. Qualifying third-party indemnity provisions for the purposes of section 234 of the Companies Act 2006 were accordingly in force during the course of the financial year ended 31 December 2023 and remain in force at the date of this report.",

The Company does not have agreements with any director or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of the Company's share schemes and plans may cause awards granted to employees under such schemes and plans to vest on a takeover, subject to any regulatory or tax considerations that may prevent this.\n\n## Future developments in the business of the Group\n\nAn indication of likely future developments in the business of the Group is provided in the Strategic report.\n\n## Results and dividends\n\n| 2023: paid interim dividend of 6 cents per ordinary share                                                |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| (2022: paid interim dividend of 4 cents per ordinary share)                                              |\n| 2023: proposed final dividend of 21 cents per ordinary share                                             |\n| (2022: paid final dividend of 14 cents per ordinary share)                                               |\n| 2023: total dividend of 27 cents per ordinary share  (2022: total dividend, 18 cents per ordinary share) |\n\n## Share capital\n\nThe issued ordinary share capital of the Company was reduced by a total of 229, 693, 294 over the course of 2023.\n\nThis was due to the cancellation of ordinary shares as part of the Company's two share buy-back programmes. No ordinary shares were issued during the year. The Company has one class of ordinary shares, which carries no rights to fixed income. On a show of hands, each member present has the right to one vote at our general meetings. On a poll, each member is entitled to one vote for every $2 nominal value of share capital held.\n\nThe issued nominal value of the ordinary shares represents 84.3 per cent of the total issued nominal value of all share capital. The remaining 15.7 per cent comprises preference shares, which have preferential rights to income and capital but which, in general, do not confer a right to attend and vote at our general meetings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details of the Group's share capital can be found in Note 28 to the financial statements\n\nThere are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. There are no specific restrictions on voting rights and the directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company's shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. No person has any special rights of control over the Company's share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.\n\n## Articles of Association\n\nThe Articles of Association may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. They were last amended at the 2023 AGM. The amendments primarily related to compliance with regulatory requirements in Hong Kong, but we also took the opportunity to amend them to reflect developments in market practice.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA copy of the Company's Articles of Association can be found on our website here sc.com/investors\n\n## Authority to purchase own shares\n\nAt the AGM held on 3 May 2023, our shareholders renewed the Company's authority to make market purchases of up to 284,703,272 ordinary shares, equivalent to approximately 10 per cent of issued ordinary shares as at 20 March 2023, and up to all of the issued preference share capital.\n\nThe authority to make market purchases up to 10 per cent of issued ordinary share capital was used during the year through two buy-back programmes announced in February and August 2023. These were utilised to reduce the number of ordinary shares in issue and as part of the Group's approach to dividend growth and capital returns. The first share buy-back programme commenced on 20 February 2023 and ended on 29 September 2023. The second share buy-back programme commenced on 1 August 2023 and ended on 6 November 2023. A total of 229,693,294 ordinary shares with a nominal value of $0.50 were re-purchased for an approximate aggregate consideration paid of $2 billion.\n\nA monthly breakdown of the shares purchased during the period including the lowest and highest price paid per share is set out in Note 28 to the financial statements. All ordinary shares which were bought back were cancelled.\n\nIn accordance with the terms of a waiver granted by The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (HKSE) as subsequently modified, the Company will comply with the applicable law and regulation in the UK in relation to holding of any shares in treasury and with the conditions of granting the waiver by the HKSE. No treasury shares were held during the year.\n\nFurther details can be found in Note 28 to the financial statements",

        "page_content": "The Rules are intended to ensure that there is no favourable treatment to Temasek or its associates to the detriment of other shareholders in the Company. Unless transactions between the Group and Temasek or its associates are specifically exempt under the Rules or are subject to a specific waiver, they may require a combination of announcements, reporting and independent shareholders' approval.\n\nOn 12 November 2021, the HKEx extended a waiver (the 'Waiver') it previously granted to the Company for the revenue banking transactions with Temasek which do not fall under the passive investor exemption ('the Passive Investor Exemption') under Rules 14A.99 and 14A.100 of the HK Listing Rules. Under the Waiver, the HKEx agreed to waive the announcement requirement, the requirements to enter into written agreements and to set annual caps, and the annual report disclosure (including annual review) requirements under Chapter 14A of the HK Listing Rules for the three-year period ending 31 December 2024 on the conditions that:\n\n- a)  The Company will disclose details of the Waiver (including nature of the revenue banking transactions with Temasek and reasons for the Waiver) in subsequent annual reports; and\n- b)  The Company will continue to monitor the revenue banking transactions with Temasek during the three years ending 31 December 2024 to ensure that the 5 per cent threshold for the revenue ratio will not be exceeded.\n\nThe main reasons for seeking the Waiver were:\n\n- \u00b7 The nature and terms of revenue banking transactions may vary and evolve over time; having fixed-term written agreements would not be suitable to accommodate the various banking needs of the Company's customers (including Temasek) and would be impractical and unduly burdensome.\n- \u00b7 It would be impracticable to estimate and determine an annual cap on the revenue banking transactions with Temasek as the volume and aggregate value of each transaction are uncertain and unknown to the Company as a banking group due to multiple factors including market driven factors.\n- \u00b7 The revenues generated from revenue banking transactions were insignificant. Without a waiver from the HKEx or an applicable exemption, these transactions would be subject to various percentage ratio tests which cater for different types of connected transactions and as such may produce anomalous results.\n\nAs a result of the Passive Investor Exemption and the Waiver, the vast majority of the Company's transactions with Temasek and its associates fall outside of the connected transactions regime. However, non-revenue transactions with Temasek or any of its associates continue to be subject to monitoring for connected transaction issues.\n\nThe Company confirms that:\n\n- \u00b7 The revenue banking transactions entered into with Temasek and its associates in 2023 were below the 5 per cent threshold for the revenue ratio test under the HK Listing Rules; and\n- \u00b7 It will continue to monitor revenue banking transactions with Temasek during the three years ending 31 December 2024 to ensure that the 5 per cent threshold for the revenue ratio will not be exceeded.\n\nThe Company therefore satisfied the conditions of the Waiver.\n\n## Fixed assets\n\nDetails of additions to fixed assets are presented in Note 18 to the financial statements.\n\n## Loan capital\n\nDetails of the loan capital of the Company and its subsidiaries are set out in Notes 22 and 27 to the financial statements.\n\n## Debenture issues and equity-linked agreements\n\nDuring the financial year ended 31 December 2023, the Company made no issuance of debentures. Further details of the equity-linked agreements the Group entered into can be found in Note 28 to financial statements.\n\n## Risk management 1\n\nThe Board is responsible for maintaining and reviewing the effectiveness of the risk management system. An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks that we face is in place. The Board is satisfied that this process constitutes a robust assessment of all of the principal risks, topical and emerging risks and integrated risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.\n\n- 1 The Group's Risk Management Framework and System of Internal Control applies only to wholly controlled subsidiaries of the Group, and not to Associates, Joint Ventures or Structured Entities of the Group.\n\nKey areas of risk on financial instruments for the directors included the impairment of loans and advances and valuation of financial instruments held at fair value. This risk assessment and management is explained further in the Audit Committee Key areas and Action taken on pages 163 and 164.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Risk review and Capital review on pages 44 to 51, and 314 to 337 sets out the principal risks, topical and emerging risks and integrated risks, our approach to risk management, including our risk management principles, an overview of our Enterprise Risk Management Framework and the risk management and governance practices for each principal risk type. The Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement can be found on pages 47, and 314 to 337\n\nIn accordance with Article 435(1)(e) of the Disclosure (CRR) Part of the PRA Rulebook, the Board Risk Committee, on behalf of the Board, has considered the adequacy of the risk management arrangements of the Group and has sought and received assurance that the risk management systems in place are adequate with regard to the Group's profile and strategy.",

        "page_content": "## Internal control 2\n\nThe Board is responsible for maintaining and reviewing the effectiveness of the internal control system. Its effectiveness is reviewed regularly by the Board, its committees, the Management Team and Group Internal Audit.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023, the Board Risk Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's system of internal control and discussed a report on the 2024 annual risk and control self-assessment. Group Internal Audit represents the third line of defence and provides independent assurance of the effectiveness of management's control of business activities (the first line) and of the control processes maintained by the Risk Framework Owners and Policy Owners (the second line). The audit programme includes obtaining an understanding of the processes and systems under audit review, evaluating the design of controls, and testing the operating effectiveness and outcomes of key controls. The work of Group Internal Audit is focused on the areas of greatest risk as determined by a risk-based assessment methodology. The Board considers the internal control systems of the Company to be effective and adequate.\n\n- 2   The Group's Risk Management Framework and System of Internal Control applies only to wholly controlled subsidiaries of the Group, and not to Associates, Joint Ventures or Structured Entities of the Group.\n\nGroup Internal Audit reports regularly to the Audit Committee, the Group Chairman and the Group Chief Executive; and the Group Head, Internal Audit reports directly to the Chair of the Audit Committee and administratively to the Group Chief Executive. The findings of all adverse audits are reported to the Audit Committee, the Group Chairman and the Group Chief Executive where immediate corrective action is required.\n\nThe Board Risk Committee is responsible for exercising oversight, on behalf of the Board, of the key risks of the Group. It reviews the Group's Risk Appetite Statement and Enterprise Risk Management Framework and makes recommendations to the Board. The Audit Committee is responsible for oversight and advice to the Board on matters relating to financial, non-financial and narrative reporting. The Committee's role is to review, on behalf of the Board, the Group's internal controls including internal financial controls. The Audit Committee receives and discusses a paper on the internal controls for financial books and records.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe risk management approach starting on page 314 describes the Group's risk management oversight committee structure.\n\nOur business is conducted within a developed control framework, underpinned by policy statements and standards. There are written policies and standards designed to ensure the identification and management of risk, including Credit Risk, Traded Risk, Treasury Risk, Operational and Technology Risk, Information and Cyber Security Risk, Compliance Risk, Financial Crime Risk, Model Risk and Reputational and Sustainability Risk. This framework incorporates the Group's internal controls on financial reporting. The Board has established a management structure that clearly defines roles, responsibilities and reporting lines.\n\nDelegated authorities are documented and communicated. Executive risk committees regularly review the Group's risk profile. The performance of the Group's businesses is reported regularly to senior management and the Board. Performance trends and forecasts, as well as actual performance against budgets and prior periods, are monitored closely. Group financial information is prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and financial reporting is subject to the Group's control framework for reconciliation processes.\n\nOperational procedures and controls have been established to facilitate complete, accurate and timely processing of transactions and the safeguarding of assets. These controls include appropriate segregation of duties, the regular reconciliation of accounts and the valuation of assets and positions. In respect of handling inside information, we have applied controls to help ensure only those explicitly required receive inside information as well as controls regarding the onward dissemination of inside information. Controls are also in place to approve and review dealings in the Company's shares. Such systems and controls are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\n## Employee policies and engagement\n\nWe work hard to ensure that our employees are kept informed about matters affecting or of interest to them, and more importantly that they have opportunities to provide feedback and engage in a dialogue.\n\nWe strive to listen and act on feedback from colleagues to ensure internal communications are timely, informative, meaningful, and in support of the Group's strategy and transformation. In November 2023, we launched our new employee communications platform - Pulse. Pulse will become our primary internal communications channel that will allow colleagues to receive key dynamic updates that are personalised by role and location, sign up for events, provide feedback, and navigate to other internal platforms. In addition to targeted digital communications, we also deploy audio and video calls, virtual and face-to-face townhalls, and other staff engagement and recognition events. To continue to improve the way we communicate and ensure our employee communications remain relevant, we also periodically analyse and measure the impact of our communications through a range of survey and feedback tools.\n\nOur senior leaders and people leaders play a critical role in engaging our teams across the network, ensuring that they are kept up to date on key business developments related to our performance and strategy. We offer additional support to our people leaders with specific calls and communications packs to help them provide context and guidance to their team members to better understand their role in executing and delivering the Group's strategy.",

        "page_content": "Across the organisation, regular team meetings with people leaders, one-to-one conversations and various management meetings provide an important platform for colleagues to discuss and clarify key issues. Regular performance conversations provide the opportunity to discuss how individuals, the team and the business area have contributed to our overall performance and how any recognition and reward relate to this. The Group's senior leadership also regularly shares global, business, function, region and market updates on performance, strategy, structural changes, HR programmes, community involvement and other campaigns. The Board also engages with and listens to the views of the workforce through several sources, including through interactive engagement sessions. More information can be found on page 161 in the Directors' report.\n\nEmployees past, present and future can follow our progress through the Group's LinkedIn network and Facebook page, as well as other social network channels including Instagram, which collectively have over 2.7 million followers.\n\nThe diverse range of internal and external communication tools and channels we have put in place aim to ensure that all colleagues receive timely and relevant information to support their effectiveness.\n\nThe wellbeing of our employees is central to our thinking about benefits and support, so that they can thrive at work and in their personal lives. Our Group minimum standards provide employees with a range of flexible working options, in relation to both location and working patterns. In terms of leave, employees are provided with at least 30 days' leave (through annual leave and public holidays), and new parents are provided a minimum of 20 calendar weeks' fully paid leave irrespective of gender, relationship status or how a child comes to permanently join a family. These are above the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) minimum standards.\n\nWe seek to build productive and enduring partnerships with various employee representative bodies (including unions and work councils). In our recognition and interactions, we are heavily influenced by the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), and several ILO conventions including the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98) and the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87). 12.6 per cent of employees, across 20 markets, have collective representation through unions or employee representative bodies. The working conditions and terms of employment of other employees are based on our Group and country policies, and in accordance with individual employment contracts issued by the Group.\n\nThe Group Grievance Standard provides a formal framework for dealing with concerns that employees have in relation to their employment or another colleague, which affect them directly, and cannot be resolved through informal mechanisms, such as counselling, coaching or mediation. This can include concerns related to bullying, harassment, discrimination and victimisation, as well as concerns regarding conditions of employment (for example, working practices or the working environment).\n\nEmployees can raise grievances to their People Leader or a Human Resources (HR) Representative. The global process for addressing grievances involves an HR representative and a member of the business reviewing the grievance, conducting fact finding into the grievance and providing a written outcome to the aggrieved employee. Where employees raise concerns regarding alleged wrongdoing which does not pertain to those employees themselves, or in circumstances where the alleged wrongdoing does pertain to the employees themselves but they do not wish to raise a grievance, such concerns are investigated in accordance with the Group Investigations Standard.\n\nIf a grievance or investigation is upheld, the next steps might include remedying a policy or process, or initiating a disciplinary review of the conduct of the colleague who is the subject of the concern. The Group Grievance Standard and accompanying process is reviewed on a periodic basis in consultation with stakeholders across HR, Legal, Compliance and Shared Investigative Services. Grievance trends are reviewed on a quarterly basis and action is taken to address any concerning trends.\n\nThere is a distinct Group Speaking Up Policy and Standard which covers instances where an employee wishes to 'blow the whistle' on actual, planned or potential wrongdoing by another employee or the Group.\n\nThe Group is committed to creating a fair, consistent and transparent approach to making decisions in a disciplinary context. This commitment is codified in our Fair Accountability Principles, which underpin our Group Disciplinary Standard. Dismissals due to misconduct issues and/or performance (where required by law to follow a disciplinary process) are governed by the Group Disciplinary Standard. Where local law or regulation requires a different process with regards to dismissals and other disciplinary outcomes, we have country variances in place.",

        "page_content": "Our Group Diversity and Inclusion Standard has been developed to ensure a respectful workplace, with fair and equal treatment, diversity and inclusion, and the provision of opportunities for employees to participate fully and reach their full potential in an appropriate working environment. The Group aims to provide equality of opportunity for all, protect the dignity of employees and promote respect at work. All individuals are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect, and to be free from harassment, bullying, discrimination and victimisation. This helps to support productive working conditions, decreased staff attrition, positive employee morale and engagement, maintains employee wellbeing, and reduces people-related risk. All colleagues are responsible for fostering an inclusive culture where individuality and differing skills, capabilities and experience are understood, respected and valued. All colleagues, consultants, contractors, volunteers, interns, casual workers and agency workers are required to comply with the Standard, including conducting themselves in a manner that demonstrates appropriate, non-discriminatory behaviours.\n\nWe do not accept unlawful discrimination in our recruitment or employment practices on any grounds including but not limited to: sex, race, colour, nationality, ethnicity, national or indigenous origin, disability, age, marital or civil partner status, pregnancy or maternity, sexual orientation, gender identity, expression or reassignment, HIV or AIDS status, parental status, military and veterans status, flexibility of working arrangements, religion or belief. We are committed to provide equal opportunities and fair treatment in recruitment, appraisals, pay and conditions, training, development, succession planning, promotion, grievance/disciplinary procedures and employment termination practices, that are inclusive and accessible; and that do not directly or indirectly discriminate. Recruitment, employment, training, development and promotion decisions are based on the skills, knowledge and behaviour required to perform the role to the Group's standards. Implied in all employment terms is the commitment to equal pay for equal work. We also endeavour to make reasonable workplace adjustments (including during the hiring process) to ensure all individuals feel supported and are able to participate fully and reach their potential. If employees become disabled, we will aim to support them with appropriate training and workplace adjustments where possible and to support their continued employment.\n\n## Health, Safety and Wellbeing\n\nOur Health, Safety and Wellbeing (HSW) vision is to support employee productivity through a healthy and resilient workforce, and our mission is for employees to deliver every day in a safe, secure and resilient way. Our corporate HSW programme covers both mental and physical health and wellbeing. The Group complies with both external regulatory requirements and internal policy and standards for HSW in all markets. It is Group policy to ensure that the more stringent of the two requirements is always met, ensuring our HSW practices meet or exceed the regulatory minimum. Compliance rates are reported at least biannually to each country's Management Team.\n\nWe follow the International Labour Organisation (ILO) code of practice on recording and notification of occupational accidents and diseases, and guidance published by the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE), and ensure that we meet all local Health and Safety (H&S) regulatory reporting requirements. We record and report all workrelated illness and injuries, including from sub-contractors, visitors and clients.\n\nHSW performance and risks are reported annually to the Group Risk Committee and Board Risk Committee. We use an H&S management system and local regulatory compliance tracker across all countries to ensure a consistently high level of H&S reporting and compliance for all our colleagues and clients.\n\nThe Group sponsors medical and healthcare services for all employees, except in markets where cover is provided through State-mandated healthcare, which represent less than 0.6 per cent of the Group's employees.\n\nAcross the Group, support for employee mental wellbeing is available. All employees have access to professional counselling via our Employee Assistance Programme, as well as to more proactive mental health support through our holistic wellbeing app and wellbeing platform. Our global Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) programme offers help to anyone developing a mental health problem, experiencing a worsening of an existing mental illness or a mental health crisis. The mental health support is given until appropriate professional help is received, or the crisis resolved. To date we have trained more than 600 mental health first aiders in 51 markets, covering over 99 per cent of colleagues.\n\nIn 2023, we recorded two work-related fatalities. A contractor was tragically and fatally injured while crossing a road on her way to work in Nigeria. An employee was tragically and fatally injured in a road accident in India. Major injuries (per the UK HSE definition) decreased from 20 in 2022 to 16, with fractures the most common type of major injury (75 per cent). Overall, reported injuries increased by 28 per cent, with 'slips/trips/falls' and 'transport/commuting' remaining the most common causes of injury. The overall increase in reported injuries was a post COVID result, with all markets moving into the new normal in 2023. Our injury rates remain aligned to, or better than industry benchmarks. Hazards and near-miss reports decreased 4 per cent between 2022 and 2023.\n\nIn 2023, we ran a back-to-basics programme to re-establish commitment and responsibility in safety and security at all levels, and address post pandemic and new normal practices. All premises are inspected at least annually to identify any hazards, risks and incidences of non-compliance. HSW communication is provided through mandatory training for all new joiners, along with annual refreshers. In 2023, we also created a pathway in the Group's learning platform using engaging bite-sized video content to help educate colleagues on their responsibilities to keep the Group safe.

Of this, 74 per cent of the total spend was spent in the Asia region, with 18 per cent in Europe and the Americas, and 8 per cent in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nFurthermore, 80 per cent of total spend in 2023 was with 474 suppliers. In addition, 80 per cent of carbon emissions were with 481 suppliers (excluding air travel suppliers). In 2023, our five largest suppliers together accounted for 14.8 per cent of total spend, with the largest ten amounting to 23 per cent of total spend.\n\n## Supply chain management\n\nTo support the operation of our businesses we source a variety of goods and services governed through a third-party risk management framework through which we aim to follow the highest standards in terms of supplier selection, due diligence and contract management.\n\nFor information about how the Group engages with suppliers on environmental and social matters, please see our Supplier Charter and Supplier Diversity and Inclusion Standard.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Supplier Charter and Supplier Diversity and Inclusion standard can be viewed at sc.com/suppliercharter and sc.com/supplierdiversity\n\n- Details of how we create value for our suppliers and other stakeholder groups can be found on pages 58 and 59\n\n## Product responsibility\n\nWe aim to design and offer products based on client needs to ensure fair treatment and outcomes for clients.\n\nThe Group has in place a risk framework, comprising policies, standards and controls to support these objectives in alignment with our Conduct Risk Framework. This framework covers sales practices, client communications, appropriateness and suitability, and post-sales practices. There are controls across all activities above and the controls are tested on a regular basis to provide assurance on the framework. As part of this, we ensure products sold are suitable for clients and comply with relevant laws and regulations. We also review our products on a periodic basis and refine them to keep them relevant to the changing needs of clients and to meet regulatory obligations.\n\nWe have processes and guidelines specific to each of our client industries, to promptly resolve client complaints and understand and respond to client issues. Conduct considerations are given significant weighting in frontline incentive structures to drive the right behaviours.\n\nFor more information on our approach to product design, product pricing, treating customers fairly and protecting customers, and incentivising our frontline employees, see pages 55 and 56.

With respect to the key performance indicators (KPIs) noted in Part C: 'Comply or explain' provisions, the Group does not report on KPI A1.3 and KPI A1.6 related to the production and handling of hazardous waste; KPI A2.5 related to packaging materials used for finished products; KPI B2.2 related lost days due to work injury; KPI B6.1 total products recalled due to safety and health reasons, and KPI B6.4 product recall procedures. As an office-based financial services provider these issues were not deemed material. For further information related to Aspect B4 Labour Standards and B5 Supply Chain Management, please also refer to the Group's annual Modern Slavery Statement.\n\n## Compliance with Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\nIn line with our 'comply or explain' obligation under the UK's Financial Conduct Authority's Listing Rules, we can confirm that we have made disclosures consistent with the TCFD recommendations and recommended disclosures in this Annual Report.\n\nOur TCFD disclosures also meet the new climate-related financial disclosure requirements contained in section 414CB of the Companies Act 2006. We have also taken into account the implementation guidance included in the TCFD 2021 Annex. Further information on net zero progress and financed emissions is available on pages 104 to 117. For a detailed TCFD summary and alignment index referencing relevant disclosures see page 511 to 516.\n\n## Modern Slavery Act\n\nThe Group publishes a Modern Slavery Statement annually. This document gives further detail on the actions the Group has taken as it seeks to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in its operations (workforce), financing and supply chain. The Group publishes a Statement under the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 for the financial year ending 31 December 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee more via sc.com/modernslavery\n\n## Sustainable finance taxonomies\n\nStandard Chartered continues to assess the applicability of sustainable finance taxonomies across the Group's footprint. Reporting has commenced in several markets in Asia in accordance with local sustainable finance taxonomy regulatory requirements. An assessment on the applicability and implementation timeline of the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) for Standard Chartered Bank AG and Standard Chartered PLC has also been undertaken. Preparatory work has commenced to embed EU Taxonomy classifications and metrics. We will continue to monitor expected policy developments from the UK and the European Commission concerning guidance on taxonomy alignment and technical screening criteria to incrementally enhance our assessment and support reporting as required.\n\nThe Group is developing scalable digital capability to facilitate reporting against taxonomies being developed across the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The solution adopts a rules-based approach to assess whether a client and any client activity with the Group is in-scope and eligible for taxonomy reporting and will facilitate broader implementation of taxonomy compliance by relevant Group entities as and when compliance implementation will be required. Taxonomy data availability and quality will continue to evolve via client engagement, data vendors and partnerships.\n\nThe Group will consider applicable taxonomy alignment in our business decisions, including at a client and transaction level, as well as more broadly at a sector strategy level. Given our footprint across Europe and the UK, Asia, Africa and the Middle East, we need to continually assess taxonomyalignment requirements based on information available from clients and through our due diligence processes.\n\n## Environmental impact of our operations\n\nWe aim to minimise the environmental impact of our operations as part of our commitment to be a responsible company. We report on the actions we take to reduce energy and water usage and non-hazardous waste generated in our operations in the Sustainability Review on page 106 and in the Supplementary sustainability information section on pages 505 and 506.\n\nOur reporting methodology is based on the 'The Greenhouse Gas Protocol - A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition)'. We have adopted the operational control approach to define our reporting boundary for GHG Scope 1 and 2 emissions. For Scope 3 financed emissions, boundaries are noted for each high-emitting sector in the 'Our approach to measuring financed emissions' table in the Sustainability Review.\n\nInformation on the principles and methodologies used to calculate the GHG emissions of the Group can be found in our Environmental Reporting Criteria document at sc.com/environmentcriteria.\n\n## Reporting period, boundary and scope\n\nWe report on Sustainability and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters throughout this Annual Report, in particular in the following sections: (i) Strategic report, Sustainability overview on pages 66 to 79; (ii) Sustainability review on pages 92 to 133; (iii) Risk review on pages 298 to 313; and (iv) in the Supplementary sustainability information section on pages 504 to 516.\n\nThe Sustainability and ESG information in this Annual report was compiled for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2023, unless otherwise specified.\n\nThe reporting period of operational environmental performance indicators is from 1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023. This allows sufficient time for independent third-party assurance to be completed prior to the publication of the Group's Annual Report. Accordingly, the operating income used for associated environmental intensity metrics corresponds to the same time period, rather than the calendar year used in financial reporting.\n\nThere was no significant change in the boundary and scope of this Annual Report from that of Standard Chartered PLC Annual Report 2022, published on 16 February 2023.",

        "page_content": "## Non-audit services\n\nThe Group's non-audit services policy (the Policy) was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee on 23 October 2023. The Policy is based on an overriding principle that, to avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest, the Group's auditor should only be used when there is evidence that there is no alternative in terms of quality and when there is no conflict with their duties as auditor. EY can be used where the work is required by a regulator or competent authority.\n\nThe Policy clearly sets out the criteria for when the Audit Committee's prior written approval is required. The Policy requires a conservative approach to be taken to the assessment of requests for EY to provide non-audit services. Subject to the overriding principle, the Audit Committee's view is that EY can be of value in a range of non-audit service activities and should be allowed to tender subject to the terms of the Policy. The Group is required to take a conservative approach to interpreting the potential threats to auditor independence and requires commensurately robust safeguards against them.\n\nUK legislation and guidance from the FRC sets out threats to audit independence, including self-interest, self-review, familiarity, taking of a management role or conducting advocacy. In particular, maintaining EY's independence from the Group requires EY to avoid taking decisions on the Group's behalf. It is also recognised as essential that management retains the decision-making capability as to whether to act on advice given by EY as part of a non-audit service. This means not just the ability to action the advice given, but to have sufficient knowledge of the subject matter to be able to make a reasoned and independent judgement as to its validity.\n\nAll of this is contained within the Policy.\n\nBy way of (non-exhaustive) illustration of the application of the principles set out in the Policy, the following types of non-audit services are likely to be permissible under the Policy:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviews of interim financial information and verification of interim profits - the Group would also extend this to work on investor circulars in most foreseeable circumstances\n- \u00b7 Extended audit or assurance work on financial information and/or financial or operational controls, where this work is closely linked to the audit engagement\n- \u00b7 Agreed-upon procedures on materials within or referenced in the Annual Report of the Group or an entity within the Group\n- \u00b7 Internal control review services\n\nStrictly prohibited under the Policy:\n\n- \u00b7 Bookkeeping, information technology and internal audit services\n- \u00b7 Corporate finance services, valuation services or litigation support\n- \u00b7 Tax or regulatory structuring proposals\n- \u00b7 Services where fees are paid on a contingent basis (in whole or in part)\n- \u00b7 Consulting services that actively assist in running the business in place of management as opposed to providing or validating information, which management then utilises in the operation of the business\n\nThe Policy is not a prescribed list of non-audit services that EY is permitted to provide. Rather, each request for EY to provide non-audit services will be assessed on its own merits. The Audit Committee believes that such a case-by-case approach best accommodates (i) the need for the appropriate rigour and challenge to be applied to each request for EY to provide non-audit services while (ii) preserving sufficient flexibility for the Group to engage EY to provide non-audit services where they are able to deliver particular value to the Group and where the proposed services can be provided without compromising EY's objectivity and independence. To ensure that the Group will comply with a cap that limits fees on non-audit services provided by EY to under 70 per cent of the average Group audit fee from the previous three consecutive financial years (which will apply from EY's fourth year of being the Group's external auditor), the Policy requires that annual non-audit service fees are lower than 70 per cent of the average annual Group audit fee up to this time. The caps exclude audit related non-audit services and services carried out pursuant to law or regulation. For 2023, without deducting non-audit service fees which were required by law or regulation and performed by EY, the ratio was 0.3:1. Details relating to EY's remuneration as the Group statutory auditor and a description of the broad categories of the types of non-audit services provided by EY are given in Note 38 to the financial statements.\n\n## Auditor\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the appointment of the Group's statutory auditor, its effectiveness and its relationship with the Group, which includes monitoring our use of the auditors for non-audit services and the balance of audit and non-audit fees paid.\n\nFollowing an annual performance and effectiveness review of EY, it was felt that EY is considered to be effective, objective and independent in its role as Group statutory auditor.\n\nEach director believes that there is no relevant information of which our Group statutory auditor is unaware. Each has taken all steps necessary as a director to be aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group statutory auditor is made aware of any pertinent information.\n\nEY will be in attendance at the 2024 AGM. A resolution to re-appoint EY as auditor was proposed at the Company's 2023 AGM and was successfully passed.\n\nEY is a Public Interest Entity Auditor recognised in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Council Ordinance.\n\nBy order of the Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Adrian de Souza\n\nGroup Company Secretary 23 February 2024\n\nStandard Chartered PLC Registered No. 966425",

This is principally the location from which a client relationship is managed, which may differ from where it is financially booked and may be shared between businesses and/or regions. This view reflects how the client segments and regions are managed internally.\n\nLoans and advances to customers and banks held at amortised cost in this Risk profile section include reverse repurchase agreement balances held at amortised cost, per Note 16 Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar secured lending and borrowing.\n\n## Credit Risk overview\n\nCredit Risk is the potential for loss due to the failure of a counterparty to meet its contractual obligations to pay the Group. Credit exposures arise from both the banking and trading books.\n\n## Stage 1\n\n- \u00b7 12-month ECL\n- \u00b7 Performing\n\n## Stage 2\n\n## Impairment model\n\nIFRS 9 mandates an impairment model that requires the recognition of expected credit losses (ECL) on all financial debt instruments held at amortised cost, Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI), undrawn loan commitments and financial guarantees.\n\n## Staging of financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments that are not already credit-impaired are originated into stage 1 and a 12-month expected credit loss provision is recognised.\n\nInstruments will remain in stage 1 until they are repaid, unless they experience significant credit deterioration (stage 2) or they become credit-impaired (stage 3).\n\nInstruments will transfer to stage 2 and a lifetime expected credit loss provision is recognised when there has been a significant change in the Credit Risk compared to what was expected at origination.\n\nThe framework used to determine a significant increase in credit risk is set out below.\n\n## Stage 3\n\n- \u00b7 Lifetime expected credit loss\n- \u00b7 Performing but has exhibited significant increase in Credit Risk (SICR)\n- \u00b7 Credit-impaired\n- \u00b7 Non-performing\n\n## IFRS 9 expected credit loss principles and approaches\n\nThe main methodology principles and approach adopted by the Group are set out in the following table.\n\n| Title                                                                                        | Supplementary Information                                                                                                  |   Page |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Approach for determining expected credit losses                                              | IFRS 9 methodology                                                                                                         |    273 |\n|                                                                                              | Determining lifetime expected credit loss for revolving  products                                                          |    273 |\n|                                                                                              | Post model adjustments                                                                                                     |    280 |\n| Incorporation of forward-looking information                                                 | Incorporation of forward-looking information                                                                               |    275 |\n|                                                                                              | Forecast of key macroeconomic variables underlying   the expected credit loss calculation and the impact of  non-linearity |    275 |\n|                                                                                              | Judgemental adjustments and sensitivity to macroeconomic  variables                                                        |    279 |\n| Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)                                                   | Quantitative and qualitative criteria                                                                                      |    282 |\n| Assessment of credit-impaired financial assets                                               | Consumer and Business Banking clients                                                                                      |    284 |\n|                                                                                              | CCIB and Private Banking clients                                                                                           |    284 |\n|                                                                                              | Write-offs                                                                                                                 |    284 |\n| Transfers between stages                                                                     | Movement in loan exposures and expected credit losses                                                                      |    248 |\n| Modified financial assets                                                                    | Forbearance and other modified loans                                                                                       |    257 |\n| Governance and application of expert credit judgement   in respect of expected credit losses |                                                                                                                            |    284 |",

        "page_content": "## Summary of performance in 2023\n\n## Loans and Advances\n\n94 per cent (31 December 2022: 93 per cent) of the Group's gross loans and advances to customers remain in stage 1 at $273.7 billion (31 December 2022: $295.2 billion), reflecting our continued focus on high-quality origination.\n\nStage 1 loans decreased by $21.5 billion to $274 billion (31 December 2022: $295 billion). For Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking (CCIB), stage 1 balances increased to 90 per cent of the gross loans and advances to customers (31 December 2022: 88 per cent), while there was an overall decrease due to reductions in the financing, insurance and non-banking sectors. Stage 1 balances for Consumer, Private and Business Banking (CPBB) decreased by $5.6 billion, mainly driven by a slowdown in mortgages sales in Korea and Hong Kong, which was partly offset by new Credit Cards and Personal Loans businesses in Asia. Stage 1 balances for Central and other items decreased by $10.8 billion due to exposure reductions to a Central Bank in the Asia region. Stage 1 cover ratio remained stable at 0.2 per cent (31 December 2022: 0.2 per cent).\n\nStage 2 gross loans and advances to customers decreased by $1.8 billion to $11.2 billion (31 December 2022: $13 billion). This was due to CCIB exposure reductions and transfers to stage 3 in the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) sector, and exposure reductions in the Transport sector. This was partially offset by an increase in CPBB Korea and Hong Kong Mortgage portfolio and Singapore Private Banking. Higher risk exposure net increase of $1 billion from Central and other items, was due to a short-term exposure to a Central Bank in the Africa and Middle East region, which was partly offset by exposure reductions and transfers to stage 3 in CCIB. Stage 2 cover ratio increased by 0.3 per cent to 3.7 per cent (31 December 2022: 3.4 per cent). The increase was driven by Ventures due to increased delinquencies and portfolio growth mainly in Mox Bank. The increase in CCIB cover ratio was due to a decrease in expected credit losses from exposure reductions and transfers to Stage 3. The decrease in CPBB stage 2 cover ratio was mainly due to an increase in secured portfolio exposures with relatively lower Loss Given Default.\n\nStage 3 loans decreased by $0.6 billion to $7.2 billion (31 December 2022: $7.8 billion) as a result of repayments, debt sales and write-offs in CCIB. Although the portfolio reduced year on year, China CRE clients were the major inflows this year. The CCIB stage 3 cover ratio increased by 4.5 per cent to 64 per cent as a result of repayments and incremental provisions taken (31 December 2022: 60 per cent). The CPBB stage 3 cover ratio reduced by 2.2 per cent to 51 per cent (31 December 2022: 53 per cent), due to a small exposure increase mainly in Secured wealth products. Ventures stage 3 exposures increased by $11 million to $12 million (31 December 2022: $1 million). The cover ratio after collateral remained stable at 76 per cent (31 December 2022: 76 per cent)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details can be found in the 'Analysis of financial instruments by stage' section in pages 238 and 239 ; 'Credit quality by client segment' section in pages 240 to 247 ; 'Credit quality by industry' section in pages 263 and 264 . Stage 3 cover ratio is also disclosed in the 'Stage 3 cover ratio' and 'Credit-impaired (stage 3) loans and advances by geographic region' sections in page 258 .\n\n## Maximum exposure\n\nThe Group's on-balance sheet maximum exposure to Credit Risk increased by $8.6 billion to $798 billion (31 December 2022: $790 billion). Cash at Central bank increased by $11.6 billion to $70 billion (31 December 2022: $58 billion) due to deposits placed with the US Federal Reserve. Loans to banks also increased by $5 billion to $45 billion (31 December 2022: $40 billion). Fair Value through profit and loss increased by $42 billion to $144 billion (31 December 2022: $103 billion), largely due to an increase in Debt Securities and Reverse Repos. This was partly offset by a $13 billion decrease in Derivative financial instruments, and a $23.7 billion decrease in loans and advances to customers to $287 billion (31 December 2022: $311 billion). Out of the $23.7 billion decrease in loans and advances to customers, a $10.5 billion reduction relates to reverse repos, and a $11 billion reduction relates to Amortised Cost Debt Securities, as part of the Group's liquidity management actions. Off-balance sheet instruments increased by $28 billion to $257 billion (31 December 2022: $229 billion), which was driven by new businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details can be found in the 'Maximum exposure to Credit Risk' section in page 237 .\n\n## Analysis of stage 2\n\nThe key SICR driver that caused exposures to be classified as stage 2 remains increase in probability of default. The proportion of exposures in CCIB in stage 2 due to increased PD has decreased partly due to an increase in clients placed on non-purely precautionary early alert that have not breached PD thresholds. In CPBB, the proportion of loans in stage 2 loans from 30 days past due trigger decreased by 2 per cent to 6 per cent (31 December 2022: 8 per cent). 'Others' category includes exposures where origination data is incomplete and the exposures are getting allocated into stage 2.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details can be found in the 'Analysis of stage 2 balances' section in page 256 .\n\n## Credit impairment charges\n\nThe Group's ongoing credit impairment was a net charge of $508 million (31 December 2022: $836 million).\n\nFor CCIB, stage 1 and 2 impairment charges decreased by $137 million to $11 million (31 December 2022: $148 million), as 2022 included Pakistan Sovereign downgrades and China CRE overlays, which was partly offset by a $102 million full release of COVID-19 overlay. In 2023, $11 million impairment charges were due to portfolio movements, including impairments on Pakistan Sovereign clients, and China CRE overlays, which was partly offset by a $13 million net release from model and methodology updates.\n\nCCIB stage 3 impairment charges decreased by $165 million to $112 million (31 December 2022: $277 million) largely due to higher releases and lower impairments on China CRE clients. In 2023, $112 million impairment charges were largely driven by impairments on China CRE clients, and releases across multiple clients.",

        "page_content": "For CPBB, stage 1 and 2 impairment charges decreased by $22 million to $129 million (31 December 2022: $151 million). In 2023, $129 million impairment charges were from normal flows, largely from unsecured portfolios in China, Hong Kong, India and Singapore. This was partially offset by $21 million of COVID-19 overlay releases, including the full release of $16 million remaining COVID-19 overlays in Bahrain.\n\nCPBB stage 3 impairment charges increased by $114 million to $225 million (31 December 2022: $111 million). The increase has been driven mainly by the unsecured business due to a mix of higher bankruptcies in Singapore, Hong Kong and Korea, and portfolio growth in digital partnerships.\n\nFor Ventures, stage 1 and 2 impairment charges increased by $29 million to $42 million (31 December 2022: $13 million), mainly due to portfolio growth in Mox Bank.\n\nVentures stage 3 impairment charges increased by $40 million to $43 million (31 December 2022: $3 million), mainly due to portfolio growth in Mox Bank, and higher bankruptcies. Mitigating actions have been taken to address these.\n\nFor Central and other items, stage 1 and 2 impairment charges decreased by $139 million due to a net release of $44 million (31 December 2022: $95 million) as 2022 included Pakistan Sovereign CG12 downgrades. In 2023, $44 million net release of impairment charges were driven by exposure reductions and shortening tenors of balances to the Pakistan Government. This was partly offset by a $8 million charge due to Kenya Sovereign downgrade.\n\nCentral and other items stage 3 impairment charges decreased by $28 million to $10 million (31 December 2022: $38 million) as Sri Lanka and Ghana exposures were downgraded to Stage 3 in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details can be found in the 'Credit impairment charge' section in page 257 .\n\n## Vulnerable and Cyclical Sectors\n\nTotal net on-balance sheet exposure to vulnerable and cyclical sectors decreased by $3 billion to $29 billion (31 December 2022: $32 billion) largely due to the exit of the Aviation business and lower drawn balances particularly in the CRE sector, where on-balance sheet exposure decreased by $1.8 billion to $14.5 billion (31 December 2022: $16.3 billion). Stage 2 vulnerable and cyclical sector loans decreased by $2.3 billion to $3.3 billion (31 December 2022: $5.6 billion), primarily driven by a $1.4 billion exposure reduction in the CRE sector and transfers to Stage 3. Stage 3 vulnerable and cyclical sector loans decreased by $0.5 billion to $3.6 billion (31 December 2022: $4 billion), mainly due to the Oil and Gas, and Commodity sectors, which was partly offset by new inflows into the CRE sector.\n\nThe Group provides loans to CRE counterparties of which $9.6 billion is to counterparties in the CCIB segment where the source of repayment is substantially derived from rental or sale of real estate and is secured by real estate collateral. The remaining CRE loans comprise working capital loans to real estate corporates, loans with non-property collateral, unsecured loans and loans to real estate entities of diversified conglomerates. The average LTV ratio of the performing book CRE portfolio has increased to 52 per cent (31 December 2022: 49 per cent). The proportion of loans with an LTV greater than 80 per cent has increased to 3 per cent (31 December 2022: 1 per cent).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details can be found in the 'Vulnerable, cyclical and high carbon sectors' section in pages 265 to 270 .\n\n## China commercial real estate\n\nTotal exposure to China CRE decreased by $0.8 billion to $2.6 billion (31 December 2022: $3.4 billion) mainly from exposure reductions. The proportion of credit impaired exposures increased to 58 per cent (31 December 2022: 33 per cent) as market conditions continued to deteriorate during the period, and provision coverage increased to 72 per cent (31 December 2022: 56 per cent) reflecting increased provision charges during the period. The proportion of the loan book rated as Higher Risk decreased by 8 per cent to 0.3 per cent (31 December 2022: 8.4 per cent) primarily due to downgrades in the period.\n\nThe Group continues to hold a judgemental management overlay, which decreased by $32 million to $141 million (31 December 2022: $173 million), reflecting changes in the portfolio and downgrades to Stage 3.\n\nThe Group is further indirectly exposed to China CRE through its associate investment in China Bohai Bank.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details can be found in the 'China commercial real estate' section in page 271 .\n\n## Management adjustments\n\nGiven the evolving nature of the risks in the China CRE sector, a management overlay of $141 million (31 December 2022: $173 million) has been taken by estimating the impact of further deterioration to exposures in this sector. Overlays of $5 million (31 December 2022: $16 million) have been applied in CPBB to capture macroeconomic environment challenges caused by sovereign defaults or heightened sovereign risk and an overlay of $17 million (31 December 2022: nil) was applied in Central and other items, due to a temporary market dislocation in the Africa and Middle East.\n\nThe remaining COVID-19 overlay in CPBB of $21 million that was held at 31 December 2022 has been fully released in 2023. The stage 3 overlay in CCIB of $9 million that was held at 31 December 2022, following the Sri Lanka Sovereign default was also fully released in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details can be found in the 'Judgemental management overlays' section in page 280 . Model performance and judgemental post model adjustments are also disclosed in the 'Model performance post model adjustments' section in page 275 .",

The ECL provision in respect of debt securities measured at FVOCI is held within the OCI reserve\n- 3   These are off-balance sheet instruments. Only the ECL is recorded on-balance sheet as a financial liability and therefore there is no 'net carrying amount'. ECL allowances on off-balance sheet instruments are held as liability provisions to the extent that the drawn and undrawn components of loan exposures can be separately identified. Otherwise they will be reported against the drawn component\n- 4   Stage 1 ECL is not material\n- 5   Stage 3 gross includes $80 million (31 December 2022: $28 million) originated credit-impaired debt securities with impairment of $14 million (31 December 2022: $13 million)",

All loans are assigned a CG, which is reviewed periodically and amended in light of changes in the borrower's circumstances or behaviour. CGs 1 to 12 are assigned to stage 1 and stage 2 (performing) clients or accounts, while CGs 13 and 14 are assigned to stage 3 (credit-impaired) clients. Consumer and Business Banking portfolios are analysed by days past due and Private Banking by the type of collateral held.\n\n## Mapping of credit quality\n\nThe Group uses the following internal risk mapping to determine the credit quality for loans.\n\n|                             | Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking   | Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking   | Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking   | Private Banking 1                    | Consumer & Business  Banking 5             |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Credit quality  description | Internal grade mapping                          | S&P external ratings  equivalent                | Regulatory   PD range (%)                       | Internal ratings                     | Internal grade mapping                     |\n| Strong                      | 1A to 5B                                        | AAA/AA+ to BBB-/ BB+\u00b2                           | 0 to 0.425                                      | Class I and Class IV                 | Current loans (no past  dues nor impaired) |\n| Satisfactory                | 6A to 11C                                       | BB+/BB to B-/CCC+\u00b3                              | 0.426 to 15.75                                  | Class II and Class III               | Loans past due till  29 days               |\n| Higher risk                 | Grade 12                                        | CCC+ to C\u2074                                      | 15.751 to 99.999                                | Stressed Assets Group  (SAG) managed | Past due loans  30 days and over           |\n\nThe table below sets out the gross loans and advances held at amortised cost, expected credit loss provisions and expected credit loss coverage by business segment and stage.

The tables are presented for the Group, debt securities and other eligible bills.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe movement lines within the tables are an aggregation of monthly movements over the year and will therefore reflect the accumulation of multiple trades during the year. The credit impairment charge in the income statement comprises the amounts within the boxes in the table below, less recoveries of amounts previously written off. Discount unwind is reported in net interest income and related to stage 3 financial instruments only.\n\nThe approach for determining the key line items in the tables is set out below.\n\n- \u00b7 Transfers - transfers between stages are deemed to occur at the beginning of a month based on prior month closing balances.\n- \u00b7 Net remeasurement from stage changes - the remeasurement of credit impairment provisions arising from a change in stage is reported within the stage that the assets are transferred to. For example, assets transferred into stage 2 are remeasured from a 12-month to a lifetime expected credit loss, with the effect of remeasurement reported in stage 2. For stage 3, this represents the initial remeasurement from specific provisions recognised on individual assets transferred into stage 3 in the year.\n- \u00b7 Net changes in exposures - new business written less repayments in the year. Within stage 1, new business written will attract up to 12 months of expected credit loss charges. Repayments of non-amortising loans (primarily within CCIB) will have low amounts of expected credit loss provisions attributed to them, due to the release of provisions over the term to maturity. In stages 2 and 3, the net change in exposures reflect repayments although stage 2 may include new facilities where clients are on non-purely precautionary early alert, are CG 12, or when non-investment grade debt securities are acquired.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Changes in risk parameters - for stages 1 and 2, this reflects changes in the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) of assets during the year, which includes the impact of releasing provisions over the term to maturity. It also includes the effect of changes in forecasts of macroeconomic variables during the year. In stage 3, this line represents additional specific provisions recognised on exposures held within stage 3.\n- \u00b7 Interest due but not paid - change in contractual amount of interest due in stage 3 financial instruments but not paid, being the net of accruals, repayments and write-offs, together with the corresponding change in credit impairment.\n\nChanges to ECL models, which incorporate changes to model approaches and methodologies, are not reported as a separate line item as these have an impact over a number of lines and stages.\n\n## Movements during the year\n\nStage 1 gross exposures increased by $3.8 billion to $724 billion (31 December 2022: $720 billion). CCIB exposure increased by $21.8 billion to $337 billion (31 December 2022: $315 billion) due to off-balance sheet exposures, which was partly offset by a decrease in loans and advances to customers. CPBB decreased by $2.2 billion to $191 billion (31 December 2022: $193 billion) which was largely driven by the mortgage portfolio in Korea and Hong Kong. Stage 1 debt securities decreased by $7.8 billion to $158 billion (31 December 2022: $166 billion) due to liquidity management and maturities.\n\nTotal stage 1 provisions decreased by $119 million to $526 million (31 December 2022: $645 million). CCIB provisions decreased by $43 million to $151 million (31 December 2022: $194 million), primarily due to new originations, which was partly offset by model updates. Debt securities provisions was stable at $26 million (31 December 2022: $25 million). CPBB decreased by $88 million to $325 million (31 December 2022: $413 million), mainly driven by the release of the judgemental non-linearity post model adjustment and overlay releases, both of which are reported in 'Changes in risk parameters'.\n\nStage 2 gross exposures decreased by $5.2 billion to $22 billion (31 December 2022: $27 billion), primarily driven by a net reduction in exposures in CCIB, particularly in the CRE and Transport sectors. CPBB exposures increased by $0.7 billion to $2.5 billion (31 December 2022: $1.8 billion), of which $0.4 billion was from the Secured portfolio. Debt securities decreased by $3.6 billion to $1.9 billion (31 December 2022: $5.5 billion).\n\nStage 2 provisions decreased by $101 million to $517 million (31 December 2022: $618 million). CCIB provisions decreased by $93 million to $318 million (31 December 2022: $411 million) from releases due to exposure reductions, transfers to stage 3 for China CRE exposures and model updates. This was partly offset by a further downgrade of Pakistan sovereign clients within stage 2. CPBB provisions increased by $22 million to $140 million (31 December 2022: $118 million) due to higher delinquencies. This was partly offset by the release of judgemental non-linearity post model adjustment and overlay releases which are reported within 'Changes in risk parameters' due to underlying factors not being valid any more. Debt Securities decreased by $56 million to $34 million (31 December 2022: $90 million) largely due to exposure reductions and shortening of tenors, particularly in Pakistan.\n\nThe impact of model and methodology updates in 2023 reduced stage 1 and 2 provisions by $15 million, of which $10 million was in CCIB and Central and other items, while $5 million was in CPBB.\n\nStage 3 gross loans for CCIB decreased by $0.7 billion to $6.3 billion (31 December 2022: $7 billion) as repayments and write-offs were partly offset by the downgrade of China CRE clients. CCIB provisions decreased by $171 million to $3.7 billion (31 December 2022: $3.8 billion) as charges from new downgrades were offset by releases due to repayments and write-offs. CPBB stage 3 loans was stable at $1.5 billion (31 December 2022: $1.5 billion) but provisions decreased by $17 million to $0.8 billion (31 December 2022: $0.8 billion). Debt security gross assets increased by $20 million to $164 million (31 December 2022: $144 million).",

For example, a loan may have breached the PD thresholds and could also be on non-purely precautionary early alert; in this instance, the exposure is reported under 'Increase in PD'.\n\nFurther details can be found in the 'Summary of Performance in 2023' in pages 235 and 236 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                       | 2023                                           | 2023                                           | 2023                                           | 2023                                  | 2023                                  | 2023                                  | 2023            | 2023          | 2023        | 2023                    | 2023                    | 2023                    | 2023            | 2023          | 2023        |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|\n|                                       | Corporate, Commercial &  Institutional Banking | Corporate, Commercial &  Institutional Banking | Corporate, Commercial &  Institutional Banking | Consumer, Private & Business  Banking | Consumer, Private & Business  Banking | Consumer, Private & Business  Banking | Ventures        | Ventures      | Ventures    | Central & other items 1 | Central & other items 1 | Central & other items 1 | Total           | Total         | Total       |\n|                                       | Gross  $million                                | ECL  $million                                  | Coverage  %                                    | Gross  $million                       | ECL  $million                         | Coverage  %                           | Gross  $million | ECL  $million | Coverage  % | Gross  $million         | ECL  $million           | Coverage  %             | Gross  $million | ECL  $million | Coverage  % |\n| Increase in PD                        | 8,262                                          | 75                                             | 0.9%                                           | 1,962                                 | 109                                   | 5.6%                                  | 96              |               | 23 24.0%    | 599                     | 13                      | 2.2%                    | 10,919          | 220           | 2.0%        |\n| Non-purely  precautionary early alert | 5,136                                          | 26                                             | 0.5%                                           | 37                                    | -

This metric does not allow for variations in the composition of stage 3 loans and should be used in conjunction with other Credit Risk information provided, including the level of collateral cover.\n\nThe balance of stage 3 loans not covered by stage 3 impairment provisions represents the adjusted value of collateral held and the net outcome of any workout or recovery strategies. Collateral provides risk mitigation to some degree in all client segments and supports the credit quality and cover ratio assessments post impairment provisions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Further information on collateral is provided in the 'Credit Risk mitigation' section in pages 258 to 260 .\n- Further details on stage 3 loans and advances and cover ratio can be found in the 'Summary of performance in 2023' in pages 235 and 236 .\n\n|                                | 2023                                                        | 2023                                              | 2023               | 2023                        | 2023            | 2022                                                        | 2022                                              | 2022               | 2022                        | 2022            |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|\n| Amortised cost                 | Corporate,  Commercial  &  Institutional  Banking  $million | Consumer,  Private &  Business  Banking  $million | Ventures  $million | Central &  Others  $million | Total  $million | Corporate,  Commercial  &  Institutional  Banking  $million | Consumer,  Private &  Business  Banking  $million | Ventures  $million | Central &  Others  $million | Total  $million |\n| Gross credit-impaired          | 5,508                                                       | 1,484                                             | 12                 | 224                         | 7, 2 2 8        | 6,143                                                       | 1,453                                             | 1                  | 248                         | 7, 8 4 5        |\n| Credit impairment provisions   | (3,533)                                                     | (760)                                             | (12)               | (15)                        | (4,320)         | (3,662)                                                     | (776)                                             | (1)                | (18)                        | (4,457)         |\n| Net credit-impaired            | 1,975                                                       | 724                                               | -                  | 209                         | 2,908           | 2,481                                                       | 677                                               | -                  | 230                         | 3,388           |\n| Cover ratio                    | 64%                                                         | 51%                                               | 100%               | 7%                          | 60%             | 60%                                                         | 53%                                               | 100%               | 7%                          | 57%             |\n| Collateral ($ million)         | 623                                                         | 554                                               | -                  | -                           | 1,177           | 956                                                         | 543                                               | -                  | -                           | 1,499           |\n| Cover ratio (after collateral) | 75%                                                         | 89%                                               | 100%               | 7%                          | 76%             | 75%                                                         | 91%                                               | 100%               | 7%                          | 76%             |\n\n## Credit-impaired (stage 3) loans and advances by geographic region\n\nStage 3 gross loans decreased by $0.6 billion to $7.2 billion (31 December 2022: $7.8 billion).

The extent of over-collateralisation has been determined with reference to both the drawn and undrawn components of exposure as this best reflects the effect of collateral and other credit enhancements on the amounts arising from expected credit losses. The value of collateral reflects management's best estimate and is backtested against our prior experience. On average, across all types of non-cash collateral, the value ascribed is approximately half of its current market value.\n\nCCIB collateral decreased by $1.7 billion to $36.5 billion (31 December 2022: $38.2 billion) and CPBB collateral decreased by $5.5 billion to $86.8 billion (31 December 2022: $92.4 billion) due to exposure reductions from the mortgage portfolio. Total collateral for Central and other items decreased by $8.7 billion to $2.5 billion (31 December 2022: $11.2 billion) due to a decrease in stage 1 reverse repos. However, collateral for stage 2 Central and other items increased by $1 billion (31 December 2022: Nil) due to short-term reverse repo with a Central Bank in the Africa and Middle East region.\n\n## Collateral held on loans and advances\n\nThe table below details collateral held against exposures, separately disclosing stage 2 and stage 3 exposure and corresponding collateral.\n\n|                                                  | 2023                   | 2023                                 | 2023                                               | 2023             | 2023                                 | 2023                                               | 2023            | 2023                                 | 2023                                               |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                  | Net amount outstanding | Net amount outstanding               | Net amount outstanding                             | Collateral       | Collateral                           | Collateral                                         | Net exposure    | Net exposure                         | Net exposure                                       |\n| Amortised cost                                   | Total  $million        | Stage 2  financial  assets  $million | Credit- impaired  financial  assets (S3)  $million | Total 2 $million | Stage 2  financial  assets  $million | Credit- impaired  financial  assets (S3)  $million | Total  $million | Stage 2  financial  assets  $million | Credit- impaired  financial  assets (S3)  $million |\n| Corporate, Commercial &  Institutional Banking 1 | 175,382                | 8,175                                | 2,046                                              | 36,458           | 2,972                                | 623                                                | 138,924         | 5,203                                | 1,423                                              |\n| Consumer, Private &  Business Banking            | 126,059                | 2,163                                | 724                                                | 86,827           | 1,136                                | 554                                                | 39,232          | 1,027                                | 170                                                |\n| Ventures                                         | 1,033                  | 33                                   | -

Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking (audited)\n\nCollateral taken for longer-term and sub-investment grade corporate loans reduced to 41 per cent (31 December 2022: 53 per cent) primarily due to the exit of the Aviation business.\n\nOur underwriting standards encourage taking specific charges on assets and we consistently seek high-quality, investmentgrade collateral.\n\n83 per cent (31 December 2022: 85 per cent) of tangible collateral excluding reverse repurchase agreements and financial guarantees held comprises physical assets or is property based, with the remainder held in cash. Overall collateral decreased by $2 billion to $36 billion (31 December 2022: $38 billion) mainly due to a decrease in property collateral.\n\nNon-tangible collateral, such as guarantees and standby letters of credit, is also held against corporate exposures, although the financial effect of this type of collateral is less significant in terms of recoveries. However, this is considered when determining the probability of default and other credit-related factors. Collateral is also held against off balance sheet exposures, including undrawn commitments and trade-related instruments.",

The average LTV of the overall mortgage portfolio increased to 47.1 per cent (31 December 2022: 44.7 per cent) driven by property prices decrease in a few key markets, including Hong Kong, Korea and China. Hong Kong, which represents 39.9 per cent of the residential mortgage portfolio, has an average LTV of 55.9 per cent (31 December 2022: 52.6 per cent). The increase of Hong Kong residential mortgage LTV is due to a decrease of the Property Price Index. All of our other key markets continue to have low portfolio LTVs (Korea, Singapore and Taiwan at 40.5 per cent, 43.0 per cent and 47.0 per cent respectively). Korea average LTV increase is due to government relaxations whereby highly regulated areas have eased up to accommodate customers with higher LTV.\n\nAn analysis of LTV ratios by geography for the mortgage portfolio is presented in the table below.\n\n|                                             | 2023           | 2023                             | 2023                          | 2023            |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Amortised cost                              | Asia  %  Gross | Africa &   Middle East  %  Gross | Europe &  Americas   %  Gross | Total  %  Gross |\n| Less than 50 per cent                       | 55.5           | 51.1                             | 31.0                          | 54.8            |\n| 50 per cent to 59 per cent                  | 1 7.1          | 14.7                             | 1 7. 4                        | 1 7.1           |\n| 60 per cent to 69 per cent                  | 11.4           | 13.7                             | 33.9                          | 12.0            |\n| 70 per cent to 79 per cent                  | 7. 7           | 12.8                             | 14.4                          | 7.9             |\n| 80 per cent to 89 per cent                  | 3.3            | 3.9                              | 2.5                           | 3.3             |\n| 90 per cent to 99 per cent                  | 2.6            | 2.1                              | 0.6                           | 2.5             |\n| 100 per cent and greater                    | 2.5            | 1.7                              | 0.3                           | 2.4             |\n| Average portfolio loan-to-value             | 46.9           | 51.1                             | 56.0                          | 47.1            |\n| Loans to individuals - mortgages ($million) | 79,517         | 1,183                            | 2,243                         | 82,943          |\n\n|                                             | 2022            | 2022                             | 2022                          | 2022            |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Amortised cost                              | Asia 1 %  Gross | Africa &   Middle East  %  Gross | Europe &  Americas   %  Gross | Total  %  Gross |\n| Less than 50 per cent                       | 60.9            | 43.0                             | 32.2                          | 60.1            |\n| 50 per cent to 59 per cent                  | 15.5            | 18.2                             | 19.2                          | 15.6            |\n| 60 per cent to 69 per cent                  | 9.8             | 16.8                             | 31.3                          | 10.2            |\n| 70 per cent to 79 per cent                  | 6.5             | 12.8                             | 14.8                          | 6.7             |\n| 80 per cent to 89 per cent                  | 3.6             | 5.1                              | 1.1                           | 3.6             |\n| 90 per cent to 99 per cent                  | 2.5             | 2.0                              | -                             | 2.4             |\n| 100 per cent and greater                    | 1.4             | 2.2                              | 1.3                           | 1.4             |\n| Average portfolio loan-to-value             | 44.4            | 54.3                             | 56.6                          | 44.7            |\n| Loans to individuals - mortgages ($million) | 83,954          | 1,388                            | 1,870                         | 87, 2 1 2       |\n\n## Collateral and other credit enhancements possessed or called upon (audited)\n\nThe Group obtains assets by taking possession of collateral or calling upon other credit enhancements (such as guarantees).

        "page_content": "## Other Credit risk mitigation (audited)\n\nOther forms of credit risk mitigation are set out below.\n\n## Credit default swaps\n\nThe Group has entered into credit default swaps for portfolio management purposes, referencing loan assets with a notional value of $3.5 billion (31 December 2022: $5.1 billion). These credit default swaps are accounted for as financial guarantees as per IFRS 9 as they will only reimburse the holder for an incurred loss on an underlying debt instrument. The Group continues to hold the underlying assets referenced in the credit default swaps and it continues to be exposed to related Credit Risk and Foreign Exchange Rate Risk on these assets.\n\n## Credit linked notes\n\nThe Group has issued credit linked notes for portfolio management purposes, referencing loan assets with a notional value of $22.5 billion (31 December 2022: $13.5 billion). The Group continues to hold the underlying assets for which the credit linked notes provide mitigation. The credit linked notes are recognised as a financial liability at amortised cost on the balance sheet.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group enters into master netting agreements, which in the event of default result in a single amount owed by or to the counterparty through netting the sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values of applicable derivative transactions. Credit Risk mitigation for derivative financial instruments is set out below.\n\n## Off-balance sheet exposures\n\nFor certain types of exposures, such as letters of credit and guarantees, the Group obtains collateral such as cash depending on internal Credit Risk assessments, as well as in the case of letters of credit holding legal title to the underlying assets should a default take place.\n\n## Other portfolio analysis\n\nThis section provides maturity analysis by credit quality by industry and industry and retail products analysis by region.\n\n## Maturity analysis of loans and advances by client segment\n\nLoans and advances to the CCIB segment remain predominantly short-term, with $91 billion (31 December 2022: $98 billion) maturing in less than one year. 98 per cent (31 December 2022: 96 per cent) of loans to banks mature in less than one year, an increase compared with 2022 as net exposures increased by $5.5 billion to $45 billion (31 December 2022: $39.5 billion). Shorter maturities give us the flexibility to respond promptly to events and rebalance or reduce our exposure to clients or sectors that are facing increased pressure or uncertainty.\n\nThe CPBB short-term book of one year or less and long-term book of over five years is stable at 26 per cent (31 December 2022: 25 per cent) and 63 per cent (31 December 2022: 64 per cent) of the total portfolio respectively.\n\n|                                               | 2023                       | 2023                        | 2023                      | 2023              |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|\n| Amortised cost                                | One year or less  $million | One to five years  $million | Over five years  $million | Total  | $million |\n| Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking | 90,728                     | 30,746                      | 12,822                    | 134,296           |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking          | 33,397                     | 13,711                      | 80,166                    | 127,274           |\n| Ventures                                      | 747                        | 334                         | -                         | 1,081             |\n| Central & other items                         | 29,448                     | 43                          | 3                         | 29,494            |\n| Gross loans and advances to customers         | 154,320                    | 44,834                      | 92,991                    | 292,145           |\n| Impairment provisions                         | (4,872)                    | (185)                       | (113)                     | (5,170)           |\n| Net loans and advances to customers           | 149,448                    | 44,649                      | 92,878                    | 286,975           |\n| Net loans and advances to banks               | 43,955                     | 1,021                       | 1                         | 44,977            |\n\n|                                               | 2022                       | 2022                        | 2022                      | 2022            |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|\n| Amortised cost                                | One year or less  $million | One to five years  $million | Over five years  $million | Total  $million |\n| Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking | 98,335                     | 34,635                      | 10,789                    | 143,759         |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking          | 33,365                     | 14,161                      | 84,731                    | 132,257         |\n| Ventures                                      | 548                        | 162                         | -                         | 710             |\n| Central & other items                         | 39,373                     | -                           | 8                         | 39,381          |\n| Gross loans and advances to customers         | 171,621                    | 48,958                      | 95,528                    | 316,107         |\n| Impairment provisions                         | (4,767)                    | (574)                       | (119)                     | (5,460)         |\n| Net loans and advances to customers           | 166,854                    | 48,384                      | 95,409                    | 310,647         |\n| Net loans and advances to banks               | 38,105                     | 1,211                       | 203                       | 39,519          |",

region\n\nThis section provides an analysis of the Group's amortised cost loan portfolio, net of provisions, by industry and region.\n\nIn the CCIB and Central and other items segment, our largest industry exposures are to Government, Financing, insurance and non-banking and Manufacturing with each constituting at least 8 per cent of CCIB and Central and other items loans and advances to customers.\n\nFinancing, insurance and non-banking industry clients are mostly investment-grade institutions and this lending forms part of the liquidity management of the Group. The Manufacturing sector group is spread across a diverse range of industries, including automobiles and components, capital goods, pharmaceuticals, biotech and life sciences, technology hardware and equipment, chemicals, paper products and packaging, with lending spread over 3,255 clients.\n\nThe Mortgage portfolio continues to be the largest portion of the CPBB portfolio at $83.1 billion (31 December 2022: $87.4 billion), of which 96 per cent continues to be in Asia. Credit cards, personal loans and other unsecured lending increased to 15 per cent (31 December 2022: 14 per cent) of the CPBB portfolio, mainly in Asia due to the growth from Mox Bank and digital partnerships.\n\nIn Asia, the Financing, insurance and non-banking industry decreased by $1.9 billion to $22.8 billion (31 December 2022: $24.7 billion) while the CRE sector decreased by $2 billion to $11.2 billion (31 December 2022: $13.2 billion) due to exposure reductions. The Government sector decreased by $9.2 billion to $30.5 billion (31 December 2022: $39.7 billion) due to decreased lending to Korea.",

The PD estimates will fluctuate in line with the economic cycle. The lifetime (or term structure)                                                                                                        |\n| Loss given default (LGD)    | forward-looking economic assumptions. The loss that is expected to arise on default, incorporating the impact of forward-looking  economic assumptions where relevant, which represents the difference between the  contractual cashflows due and those that the bank expects to receive. The Group estimates LGD based on the history of recovery rates and considers the recovery of  any collateral that is integral to the financial asset, taking into account forward-looking  economic assumptions where relevant. |\n| Exposure at default (EAD)   | The expected balance sheet exposure at the time of default, taking into account expected  changes over the lifetime of the exposure. This incorporates the impact of drawdowns of  facilities with limits, repayments of principal and interest, and amortisation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n\nTo determine the expected credit loss, these components are multiplied together: PD for the reference period (up to 12 months or lifetime) x LGD x EAD and discounted to the balance sheet date using the effective interest rate as the discount rate.\n\nIFRS 9 expected credit loss models have been developed for the Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking (CCIB) businesses on a global basis, in line with their respective portfolios. However, for some of the key countries, countryspecific models have also been developed.\n\nThe calibration of forward-looking information is assessed at a country or region level to take into account local macroeconomic conditions.\n\nRetail expected credit loss models are country and product specific given the local nature of the CPBB business.\n\nFor less material retail portfolios, the Group has adopted less sophisticated approaches based on historical roll rates or loss rates:\n\n- \u00b7 For medium-sized retail portfolios, a roll rate model is applied, which uses a matrix that gives the average loan migration rate between delinquency states from period to period. A matrix multiplication is then performed to generate the final PDs by delinquency bucket over different time horizons.\n- \u00b7 For smaller retail portfolios, loss rate models are applied. These use an adjusted gross charge-off rate, developed using monthly write-off and recoveries over the preceding 12 months and total outstanding balances.\n- \u00b7 While the loss rate models do not incorporate forwardlooking information, to the extent that there are significant changes in the macroeconomic forecasts an assessment will be completed on whether an adjustment to the modelled output is required.\n\nFor a limited number of exposures, proxy parameters or approaches are used where the data is not available to calculate the origination PDs for the purpose of applying the SICR criteria; or for some retail portfolios where a full history of LGD data is not available, estimates based on the loss experience from similar portfolios are used. The use of proxies is monitored and will reduce over time.\n\nThe following processes are in place to assess the ongoing performance of the models:\n\n- \u00b7 Quarterly model monitoring that uses recent data to compare the differences between model predictions and actual outcomes against approved thresholds.\n- \u00b7 Annual independent validations of the performance of material models by Group Model Valuation (GMV); an abridged validation is completed for non-material models.\n\n## Application of lifetime\n\nExpected credit loss is estimated based on the period over which the Group is exposed to Credit Risk. For the majority of exposures this equates to the maximum contractual period. For retail credit cards and corporate overdraft facilities, however, the Group does not typically enforce the contractual period, which can be as short as one day. As a result, the period over which the Group is exposed to Credit Risk for these instruments reflects their behavioural life, which incorporates expectations of customer behaviour and the extent to which Credit Risk management actions curtail the period of that exposure. The average behavioural life for retail credit cards is between 3 and 6 years across our footprint markets.\n\nThe behavioural life for corporate overdraft facilities is 24 months.",

Model performance post model adjustments are approved by the Group Credit Model Assessment Committee and will be removed when the models are updated to correct for the identified model issue or the estimates return to being within the monitoring thresholds.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, model performance post model adjustments have been applied for 5 models out of the total of 172 models. In aggregate, these post model adjustments reduce the Group's impairment provisions by $31 million (2 per cent of modelled provisions) compared with a $60 million decrease at 31 December 2022. The most significant of these relates to an adjustment to decrease ECL for Korea Personal Loans as the IFRS 9 PD model is sensitive to the higher range of interest rates.\n\nIn addition to these model performance post model adjustments, separate judgemental post model and management adjustments have also been applied as set out on pages 279 and 280.\n\n|                                               | 2023   $ million   | 2022   $ million   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Model performance PMAs                        |                    |                    |\n| Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking | (3)                | (22)               |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking          | (28)               | (38)               |\n| Total model performance PMAs                  | (31)               | (60)               |\n\n## Key assumptions and judgements in determining expected credit loss\n\n## Incorporation of forward-looking information\n\nThe evolving economic environment is a key determinant of the ability of a bank's clients to meet their obligations as they fall due. It is a fundamental principle of IFRS 9 that the provisions banks hold against potential future Credit Risk losses should depend, not just on the health of the economy today, but should also take into account potential changes to the economic environment. For example, if a bank were to anticipate a sharp slowdown in the world economy over the coming year, it should hold more provisions today to absorb the credit losses likely to occur in the near future.\n\nTo capture the effect of changes to the economic environment, the PDs and LGDs used to calculate ECL incorporate forward-looking information in the form of forecasts of the values of economic variables and asset prices that are likely to have an effect on the repayment ability of the Group's clients.\n\nThe 'base forecast' of the economic variables and asset prices is based on management's view of the five-year outlook, supported by projections from the Group's in-house research team and outputs from a third-party model that project specific economic variables and asset prices. The research team takes consensus views into consideration, and senior management review projections for some core country variables against consensus when forming their view of the outlook. For the period beyond five years, management utilises the in-house research view and third-party model outputs, which allow for a reversion to long-term growth rates or norms. All projections are updated on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Forecast of key macroeconomic variables underlying the expected credit loss calculation and the impact on non-linearity\n\nIn the Base Forecast - management's view of the most likely outcome -the pace of growth of the world economy is expected to slow marginally in the near term. Global GDP is forecast to grow by just below 3 per cent in 2024. World GDP growth averaged 3.7 per cent for the 10 years prior to COVID-19 (between 2010 and 2019). The world economy should be able to achieve a soft landing after the most aggressive monetary tightening cycle in years, although risks abound. The lagged impact of aggressive central bank tightening is likely to be felt most acutely in developed economies.\n\nLingering inflation and geopolitical developments are risks to the global soft-landing scenario. The ongoing war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, ongoing US-China tensions, and the November 2024 US election are key sources of geopolitical and political risk; they come against a backdrop of increasing global fragmentation. On the inflation front, it is unclear whether it can slow on a sustained basis. Core inflation has remained sticky in some markets, signalling persistent underlying pressures. Structural factors - including higher fiscal deficits, the cost of the climate transition and recent under-investment in fossil fuels - could keep inflation higher than during the pre-COVID period. Oil prices and geopolitical conflict are also sources of upside inflation risk.\n\nWhile the quarterly Base Forecasts inform the Group's strategic plan, one key requirement of IFRS 9 is that the assessment of provisions should consider multiple future economic environments. For example, the global economy may grow more quickly or more slowly than the Base Forecast, and these variations would have different implications for the provisions that the Group should hold today. As the negative impact of an economic downturn on credit losses tends to be greater than the positive impact of an economic upturn, if the Group sets provisions only on the ECL under the Base Forecast it might maintain a level of provisions that does not appropriately capture the range of potential outcomes. To address the inherent uncertainty in economic forecast, and the property of skewness (or non-linearity), IFRS 9 requires reported ECL to be a probability-weighted ECL, calculated over a range of possible outcomes.",

These scenarios are generated by a Monte Carlo simulation, which addresses the challenges of crafting many realistic alternative scenarios in the many countries in which the Group operates by means of a model, which produces these alternative scenarios while considering the degree of historical uncertainty (or volatility) observed from Q1 1990 to Q3 2023 around economic outcomes, the trends in each macroeconomic variable modelled and the correlation in the unexplained movements around these trends. This naturally means that each of the 50 scenarios do not have a specific narrative, although collectively they explore a range of hypothetical alternative outcomes for the global economy, including scenarios that turn out better than expected and scenarios that amplify anticipated stresses.\n\nThe GDP graphs below illustrate the shape of the Base Forecast for key footprint markets in relation to prior periods' actuals. The long-term growth rates are based on the pace of economic expansion expected for 2030. The tables below provide a summary of the Group's Base Forecast for these markets. The peak/trough amounts show the highest and lowest points within the Base Forecast.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Singapore GDP YoY%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChina's GDP growth is expected to ease to 4.8 per cent in 2024 from over 5 per cent in 2023. This reflects a continued contraction in the property sector, a negative contribution from foreign trade, and low consumer and business confidence. Similarly, Hong Kong is also facing several headwinds with its GDP growth expected to ease to 2.9 per cent from 3.3 per cent in 2023. These headwinds include a weak property sector and elevated interest rates which will weigh on investment appetite for Hong Kong assets. Limited external demand from key markets will also weigh on exports. Growth in the US is expected to slow on the impact of tighter financial and credit conditions and as the impact of previous interest rate increases by the central bank feed through to the economy. For similar reasons, Eurozone growth is expected to remain weak in 2024. The uncertainty over the ongoing war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East has hit global investor and business confidence. Growth in India is expected to ease to 6 per cent from 6.7 per cent in 2023 due to impact from pre-election uncertainties, tighter lending conditions and global recession concerns.\n\nIn contrast, GDP growth for Singapore is expected to accelerate to just over 2.5 per cent in 2024 from 0.8 per cent last year. Favourable base effects may boost exports, despite the soft global growth outlook. The global electronics and semiconductor industry is showing signs of bottoming out. Although a strong rebound is not expected, inventory restocking may provide a small boost to Singapore's electronics sector. Korea's economic growth will also benefit from the turnaround in this key sector. GDP growth there is expected to reach 2.3 per cent in 2024 from 1.3 per cent last year.",

        "page_content": "## Impact of multiple economic scenarios\n\nThe final probability-weighted ECL reported by the Group is a simple average of the ECL for each of the 50 scenarios simulated using a Monte Carlo model. The Monte Carlo approach has the advantage that it generates many alternative scenarios that cover our global footprint.\n\nThe total amount of non-linearity, calculated as the difference between the probability-weighted ECL calculated by the Monte Carlo model and the unweighted base forecast ECL, is $44 million (31 December 2022: $50 million). The CCIB and Central and other items portfolios accounted for $26 million (31 December 2022: $44 million) of the calculated non-linearity with the remaining $18 million (31 December 2022: $6 million) attributable to CPBB portfolios. As the non-linearity calculated for the CPBB portfolios at 31 December 2022 was relatively low, a judgemental post model adjustment of $34 million was applied. Subsequent stand-back analysis was completed during the first half of 2023 to benchmark the ECL non-linearity calculated using the Monte Carlo model, which confirmed that the calculated non-linearity for CPBB portfolios was appropriate and the judgemental post model adjustment was released.\n\nThe impact of multiple economic scenarios on stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 modelled ECL is set out in the table below, together with the management overlay and other judgemental adjustments.\n\n|                                                | Base forecast  $million   |   Multiple  economic  scenarios 1 $million |   Management  overlays and  other  judgemental  adjustments  $million | Total   modelled   ECL 2 $million   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Total expected credit loss at 31 December 2023 | 1,071                     |                                         44 |                                                                   165 | 1.280                               |\n| Total expected credit loss at 31 December 2022 | 1,267                     |                                         84 |                                                                   229 | 1,580                               |\n\nThe average expected credit loss under multiple scenarios is 4 per cent (2022: 7 per cent) higher than the expected credit loss calculated using only the most likely scenario (the Base Forecast). Portfolios that are more sensitive to non-linearity include those with greater leverage and/or a longer tenor, such as Project and Shipping Finance portfolios. Other portfolios display minimal non-linearity owing to limited responsiveness to macroeconomic impacts for structural reasons, such as significant collateralisation as with the CPBB mortgage portfolios.\n\n## Judgemental adjustments\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group held judgemental adjustments for ECL as set out in the table below. All of the judgemental adjustments have been determined after taking account of the model performance post model adjustments reported on page 275. They are reassessed quarterly and are reviewed and approved by the IFRS 9 Impairment Committee and will be released when no longer relevant.\n\n|                                    | Corporate,  Commercial &  Institutional   | Consumer, Private & Business Banking   | Consumer, Private & Business Banking   | Consumer, Private & Business Banking   | Consumer, Private & Business Banking   | Central &         |                   |\n|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| 31 December 2023                   | Banking   $ million                       | Mortgages   $ million                  | Credit Cards   $ million               | Other   $ million                      | Total   $ million                      | other   $ million | Total   $ million |\n| Judgemental post model adjustments | -

        "page_content": "## Judgemental post model adjustments\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, judgemental post model adjustments to increase ECL by a net $2 million (31 December 2022: $44 million increase) have been applied to certain CPBB models, primarily to adjust for temporary factors impacting modelled outputs. These will be released when these factors normalise. At 31 December 2022, $34 million of the increase in ECL related to multiple economic scenarios, which was fully released in the first half of 2023 (see 'Impact of multiple economic scenarios').\n\n## Judgemental management overlays\n\n## China CRE\n\nThe real estate market in China has now been in a downturn since late 2021 as evidenced by continued decline in sales, and investments in the sector. Liquidity issues experienced by Chinese property developers continued into 2023 with more developers defaulting on their obligations both offshore and onshore. During 2023, authorities on the mainland have introduced a slew of policies to help revive the sector and restore buying sentiments. This has helped stabilise the market to an extent in some cities, but demand and home prices remain muted overall. Continued policy relaxations, including those related to house purchase restrictions, completion support for eligible projects from onshore financial institutions, relaxation in mortgage rates, and further support for affordable housing, are key for reversing the continued decline in sales and investments and ensuring a stable outlook for 2024.\n\nThe Group's loans and advances to China CRE clients was $2.4 billion at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: $3.2 billion). Client level analysis continues to be done, with clients being placed on purely precautionary or non-purely precautionary early alert, where appropriate, for closer monitoring. Given the evolving nature of the risks in the China CRE sector, a management overlay of $141 million (31 December 2022: $173 million) has been taken by estimating the impact of further deterioration to exposures in this sector. The decrease from 31 December 2022 was primarily driven by repayments and movement of some of the exposures to Stage 3.\n\n## Other\n\nOverlays of $5 million (31 December 2022: $16 million) have also been applied in CPBB to capture macroeconomic environment challenges caused by sovereign defaults or heightened sovereign risk, the impact of which is not fully captured in the modelled outcomes. An overlay of $17 million (2022: nil) was applied in Central & Other due to a temporary market dislocation in the Africa and Middle East region.\n\nThe remaining COVID-19 overlay in CPBB of $21 million that was held as at 31 December 2022 has been fully released in 2023. The stage 3 overlay in CCIB of $9 million that was held as at 31 December 2022 following the Sri Lanka Sovereign default was also fully released in 2023.\n\n## Stage 3 assets\n\nCredit-impaired assets managed by Stressed Asset Group (SAG) incorporate forward-looking economic assumptions in respect of the recovery outcomes identified and are assigned individual probability weightings per IFRS 9. These assumptions are not based on a Monte Carlo simulation but are informed by the Base Forecast.\n\n## Sensitivity of expected credit loss calculation to macroeconomic variables\n\nThe ECL calculation relies on multiple variables and is inherently non-linear and portfolio-dependent, which implies that no single analysis can fully demonstrate the sensitivity of the ECL to changes in the macroeconomic variables. The Group has conducted a series of analyses with the aim of identifying the macroeconomic variables which might have the greatest impact on the overall ECL. These encompassed single variable and multi-variable exercises, using simple up/ down variation and extracts from actual calculation data, as well as bespoke scenario design assessments.\n\nThe primary conclusion of these exercises is that no individual macroeconomic variable is materially influential. The Group believes this is plausible as the number of variables used in the ECL calculation is large. This does not mean that macroeconomic variables are uninfluential; rather, that the Group believes that consideration of macroeconomics should involve whole scenarios, as this aligns with the multi-variable nature of the calculation.\n\nThe Group faces downside risks in the operating environment related to the uncertainties surrounding the macroeconomic outlook. To explore this, a sensitivity analysis of ECL was undertaken to explore the effect of slower economic recoveries across the Group's footprint markets. Two downside scenarios were considered in particular to explore the current uncertainties over commodity prices. The first scenario, Global Stagflation, explores a temporary spike (relative to base) in commodity prices, inflation and interest rates in the near term from the ongoing war in Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East. The second more severe scenario is based on the Bank of England's most recent Annual Cyclical Scenario (ACS), which explores a persistent rise in commodity prices, inflation and interest rates.",

For example 2024 is from Q1 2024 to Q4 2024\n\nThe total modelled stage 1 and 2 ECL provisions (including both on and off-balance sheet instruments) would be approximately $153 million higher under the Global Stagflation scenario, and $489 million higher under the ACS scenario than the baseline ECL provisions (which excluded the impact of multiple economic scenarios and management overlays which may already capture some of the risks in these scenarios). Stage 2 exposures as a proportion of stage 1 and 2 exposures would increase from 3.7 per cent in the base case to 4.1 per cent and 6.5 per cent respectively under the Global Stagflation and ACS scenarios. This includes the impact of exposures transferring to stage 2 from stage 1 but does not consider an increase in stage 3 defaults.\n\nUnder both scenarios, the majority of the increase in ECL in CCIB came from the main corporate and CRE portfolios. For the main corporate portfolios, ECL would increase by $20 million and $79 million for the Global stagflation and ACS scenarios respectively and the proportion of stage 2 exposures would increase from 5.5 per cent in the base case to 5.9 per cent and 8.2 per cent respectively.\n\nFor the CPBB portfolios, most of the increase in ECL came from the unsecured retail portfolios, with the Taiwan and Korea Personal Loans impacted. Under the Global Stagflation and ACS scenarios, Credit card ECL would increase by $28 million and $66 million respectively, largely in the Singapore and Hong Kong portfolios and the proportion of stage 2 credit card exposures would increase from 1.5 per cent in the base case to 2.1 per cent and 3.3 per cent for each scenario respectively, with the Singapore portfolio most impacted. Mortgages ECL would increase by $1 million and $45 million for each scenario respectively, with portfolios in Hong Kong and Korea most impacted and the proportion of stage 2 mortgages would increase from 1.2 per cent in the base case to 1.7 per cent and 14 per cent respectively, with the Hong Kong and Singapore portfolios most impacted.\n\nThere was no material change in modelled stage 3 provisions as these primarily relate to unsecured CPBB exposures for which the LGD is not sensitive to changes in the macroeconomic forecasts. There is also no material change for non-modelled stage 3 exposures as these are more sensitive to client specific factors than to alternative macroeconomic scenarios.\n\nThe actual outcome of any scenario may be materially different due to, among other factors, the effect of management actions to mitigate potential increases in risk and changes in the underlying portfolio.",

Whether a change in the risk of default is significant or not is assessed using quantitative and qualitative criteria. These criteria have been separately defined for each business and where meaningful are consistently applied across business lines.\n\nAssets are considered to have experienced SICR if they have breached both relative and absolute thresholds for the change in the average annualised IFRS 9 lifetime probability of default (IFRS 9 PD) over the residual term of the exposure.\n\nThe absolute measure of increase in credit risk is used to capture instances where the IFRS 9 PDs on exposures are relatively low at initial recognition as these may increase by several multiples without representing a significant increase in credit risk. Where IFRS 9 PDs are relatively high at initial recognition, a relative measure is more appropriate in assessing whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, as the IFRS 9 PDs increase more quickly.\n\nThe SICR thresholds have been calibrated based on the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 Stability - The thresholds are set to achieve a stable stage 2 population at a portfolio level, trying to minimise the number of accounts moving back and forth between stage 1 and stage 2 in a short period of time\n\n- \u00b7 Accuracy - The thresholds are set such that there is a materially higher propensity for stage 2 exposures to eventually default than is the case for stage 1 exposures\n- \u00b7 Dependency from backstops - The thresholds are stringent enough such that a high proportion of accounts transfer to stage 2 due to movements in forward-looking IFRS 9 PDs rather than relying on backward-looking backstops such as arrears\n- \u00b7 Relationship with business and product risk profiles - the thresholds reflect the relative risk differences between different products, and are aligned to business processes\n\nFor CCIB clients the quantitative thresholds are a relative 100 per cent increase in IFRS 9 PD and an absolute change in IFRS 9 PD of between 50 and 100 bps.\n\nFor Consumer and Business Banking clients, portfolio specific quantitative thresholds in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, UAE and Taiwan are applied for credit cards and one personal loan portfolio. The thresholds include relative and absolute increases in IFRS 9 PD with average lifetime IFRS 9 PD cut-offs for those exposures that are within a range of customer utilisation limits (for credit cards) and remaining tenor (for personal loans) and differentiate between exposures that are current and those that are 1 to 29 days past due.",

Certain countries have a higher absolute threshold reflecting the lower default rate within their personal loan portfolios compared with the Group's other personal loan portfolios.\n\nPrivate Banking clients are assessed qualitatively, based on a delinquency measure relating to collateral top-ups or sell-downs.\n\n## Qualitative criteria\n\nQualitative factors that indicate that there has been a significant increase in credit risk include processes linked to current risk management, such as placing loans on non-purely precautionary early alert.\n\n## Backstop\n\nAcross all portfolios, accounts that are 30 or more days past due (DPD) on contractual payments of principal and/or interest that have not been captured by the criteria above are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nExpert credit judgement may be applied in assessing SICR to the extent that certain risks may not have been captured by the models or through the above criteria. Such instances are expected to be rare, for example due to events and material uncertainties arising close to the reporting date.\n\n## CCIB clients\n\n## Quantitative criteria\n\nExposures are assessed based on both the absolute and the relative movement in the IFRS 9 PD from origination to the reporting date as described above.\n\nTo account for the fact that the mapping between internal credit grades (used in the origination process) and IFRS 9 PDs is non-linear (e.g. a one-notch downgrade in the investment grade universe results in a much smaller IFRS 9 PD increase than in the sub-investment grade universe), the absolute thresholds have been differentiated by credit quality at origination, as measured by internal credit grades being investment grade or sub-investment grade.\n\n## Qualitative criteria\n\nAll assets of clients that have been placed on early alert (for non-purely precautionary reasons) are deemed to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nAn account is placed on non-purely precautionary early alert if it exhibits risk or potential weaknesses of a material nature requiring closer monitoring, supervision or attention by management. Weaknesses in such a borrower's account, if left uncorrected, could result in deterioration of repayment prospects and the likelihood of being downgraded. Indicators could include a rapid erosion of position within the industry, concerns over management's ability to manage operations, weak/deteriorating operating results, liquidity strain and overdue balances, among other factors.\n\nAll client assets that have been assigned a CG12 rating, equivalent to 'Higher risk', are deemed to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk. Accounts rated CG12 are primarily managed by relationship managers in the CCIB unit with support from SAG for certain accounts. All CCIB clients are placed in CG12 when they are 30 DPD unless they are granted a waiver through a strict governance process.\n\n## Consumer and Business Banking clients\n\n## Quantitative criteria\n\nMaterial portfolios (defined as a combination of country and product, for example Hong Kong mortgages, Singapore credit cards, Taiwan personal loans) for which a statistical model has been built, are assessed based on both the absolute and relative movement in the IFRS 9 PD from origination to the reporting date as described previously in page 273. For these portfolios, the original lifetime IFRS 9 PD term structure is determined based on the original Application Score or Risk Segment of the client.\n\n## Qualitative and backstop criteria\n\nAccounts that are 30 DPD that have not been captured by the quantitative criteria are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk. For less material portfolios, which are modelled based on a roll-rate or loss-rate approach, SICR is primarily assessed through the 30 DPD trigger. In addition, SICR is also assessed for where specific risk elevation events have occurred in a market that are not yet reflected in modelled outcomes or in other metrics. This is applied collectively either to impacted specific products/customer cohorts or across the overall consumer banking portfolio in the affected market.",

        "page_content": "## Private Banking clients\n\nFor Private Banking clients, SICR is assessed by referencing the nature and the level of collateral against which credit is extended (known as 'Classes of Risk').\n\n## Qualitative criteria\n\nFor all Private Banking classes, in line with risk management practice, an increase in credit risk is deemed to have occurred where margining or loan-to-value covenants have been breached.\n\nFor Class I assets (lending against diversified liquid collateral), if these margining requirements have not been met within 30 days of a trigger, a significant increase in credit risk is assumed to have occurred.\n\nFor Class I and Class III assets (real-estate lending), a significant increase in credit risk is assumed to have occurred where the bank is unable to 'sell down' the applicable assets to meet revised collateral requirements within five days of a trigger.\n\nClass II assets are typically unsecured or partially secured, or secured against illiquid collateral such as shares in private companies. Significant credit deterioration of these assets is deemed to have occurred when any early alert trigger has been breached.\n\n## Debt securities\n\n## Quantitative criteria\n\nFor debt securities originated before 1 January 2018, the bank is utilising the low Credit Risk simplified approach, where debt securities with an internal credit rating mapped to an investment grade equivalent are allocated to stage 1 and all other debt securities are allocated to stage 2. Debt securities originated after 1 January 2018 are assessed based on the absolute and relative movements in IFRS 9 PD from origination to the reporting date using the same thresholds as for Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking clients.\n\n## Qualitative criteria\n\nDebt securities utilise the same qualitative criteria as the Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking client segments, including being placed on non-purely precautionary early alert or being classified as CG12.\n\n## Assessment of credit-impaired financial assets\n\n## Consumer and Business Banking clients\n\nThe core components in determining credit-impaired expected credit loss provisions are the value of gross chargeoff and recoveries. Gross charge-off and/or loss provisions are recognised when it is established that the account is unlikely to pay through the normal process. Recovery of unsecured debt post credit impairment is recognised based on actual cash collected, either directly from clients or through the sale of defaulted loans to third-party institutions. Release of credit impairment provisions for secured loans is recognised if the loan outstanding is paid in full (release of full provision), or the provision is higher than the loan outstanding (release of the excess provision).\n\n## CCIB and Private Banking clients\n\nCredit-impaired accounts are managed by the Group's specialist recovery unit, Stressed Asset Group (SAG), which is independent from its main businesses. Where a portion of exposure is considered not recoverable, a stage 3 credit impairment provision is raised. This stage 3 provision is the difference between the loan-carrying amount and the probability-weighted present value of estimated future cash flows, reflecting a range of scenarios (typically the Upside, Downside and Likely recovery outcomes). Where the exposure is secured by collateral, the values used will incorporate the impact of forward-looking economic information on the value recoverable collateral and time to realise the same.\n\nThe individual circumstances of each client are considered when SAR estimates future cashflows and the timing of future recoveries which involves significant judgement. All available sources, such as cashflow arising from operations, selling assets or subsidiaries, realising collateral or payments under guarantees, are considered. In any decision relating to the raising of provisions, the Group attempts to balance economic conditions, local knowledge and experience, and the results of independent asset reviews.\n\n## Write-offs\n\nWhere it is considered that there is no realistic prospect of recovering a portion of an exposure against which an impairment provision has been raised, that amount will be written off.\n\n## Governance and application of expert credit judgement in respect of expected credit losses\n\nThe Group's Credit Policy and Standards framework details the requirements for continuous monitoring to identify any changes in credit quality and resultant ratings, as well as ensuring a consistent approach to monitoring, managing and mitigating credit risks. The framework aligns with the governance of ECL estimation through the early recognition of significant deteriorations in ratings which drive stage 2 and 3 ECL.\n\nThe models used in determining expected credit losses are reviewed and approved by the Group Credit Model Assessment Committee (CMAC), which is appointed by the Model Risk Committee. CMAC has the responsibility to assess and approve the use of models and to review all IFRS 9 interpretations related to models. CMAC also provides oversight on operational matters related to model development, performance monitoring and model validation activities, including standards and regulatory matters.\n\nPrior to submission to CMAC for approval, the models are validated by GMV, a function which is independent of the business and the model developers. GMV's analysis comprises review of model documentation, model design and methodology, data validation, review of the model development and calibration process, out-of-sample performance testing, and assessment of compliance review against IFRS 9 rules and internal standards.",

Where a model's performance breaches the monitoring thresholds, an assessment of whether a PMA is required to correct for the identified model issue is completed.\n\nKey inputs into the calculation and resulting expected credit loss provisions are subject to review and approval by the IFRS 9 Impairment Committee (IIC) which is appointed by the Group Risk Committee. The IIC consists of senior representatives from Risk, Finance, and Group Economic Research. It meets at least twice every quarter; once before the models are run to approve key inputs into the calculation, and once after the models are run to approve the expected credit loss provisions and any judgemental overrides that may be necessary.\n\nThe IFRS 9 Impairment Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 Oversees the appropriateness of all Business Model Assessment and Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) tests\n- \u00b7 Reviews and approves expected credit loss for financial assets classified as stages 1, 2 and 3 for each financial reporting period\n- \u00b7 Reviews and approves stage allocation rules and thresholds\n- \u00b7 Approves material adjustments in relation to expected credit loss for fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and amortised cost financial assets\n- \u00b7 Reviews, challenges and approves base macroeconomic forecasts and the multiple macroeconomic scenarios approach that are utilised in the forward-looking expected credit loss calculations\n\nThe IFRS 9 Impairment Committee is supported by an Expert Panel which also reviews and challenges the base case projections and multiple macroeconomic scenarios. The Expert Panel consists of members of Enterprise Risk Management (which includes the Scenario Design team), Finance, Group Economic Research and country representatives of major jurisdictions.\n\nPMAs may be applied to account for identified weaknesses in model estimates. The processes for identifying the need for, calculating the level of, and approving PMAs are prescribed in the Credit Risk IFRS 9 ECL Model Family Standards, which are approved by the Global Head, Model Risk Management. PMA calculation methodologies are reviewed by GMV and submitted to CMAC as the model approver or the IIC. All PMAs have a remediation plan to fix the identified model weakness, and these plans are reported to and tracked at CMAC.\n\nIn addition, Risk Event Overlays account for events that are sudden and therefore not captured in the Base Case Forecast or the resulting ECL calculated by the models. All Risk Event Overlays must be approved by the IIC having considered the nature of the event, why the risk is not captured in the model, and the basis on which the quantum of the overlay has been calculated. Risk Event Overlays are subject to quarterly review and re-approval by the IIC and will be released when the risks are no longer relevant.",

The Group's exposure to Market Risk arises predominantly from the following sources:\n\n- \u00b7 Trading book:\n- -  The Group provides clients with access to financial markets, facilitation of which entails the Group taking moderate Market Risk positions. All trading teams support client activity. There are no proprietary trading teams. Hence, income earned from Market Risk-related activities is primarily driven by the volume of client activity rather than risk-taking\n- \u00b7 Non-trading book:\n- -  The Treasury Markets desk is required to hold a liquid assets buffer, much of which is held in high-quality marketable debt securities\n- -  The Group has capital invested and related income streams denominated in currencies other than US dollars. To the extent that these income streams are not hedged, the Group is subject to Structural Foreign Exchange Risk which is reflected in reserves\n\nA summary of our current policies and practices regarding Market Risk management is provided in the Principal Risks section (page 323).\n\n## Daily value at risk (VaR at 97.5%, one day) (audited)\n\n|                              | 2023              | 2023           | 2023          | 2023               | 2022              | 2022           | 2022          | 2022               |\n|------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| Trading 1  and non-trading 2 | Average  $million | High  $million | Low  $million | Year End  $million | Average  $million | High  $million | Low  $million | Year End  $million |\n| Interest Rate Risk           | 39.5              | 54.1           | 23.2          | 30.5               | 27. 8             | 42.1           | 21.0          | 24.7               |\n| Credit Spread Risk           | 33.8              | 48.0           | 25.0          | 31.7               | 34.2              | 47.1           | 20.3          | 32.9               |\n| Foreign Exchange Risk        | 7.0               | 12.2           | 4.2           | 7. 4               | 6.5               | 10.3           | 4.8           | 6.8                |\n| Commodity Risk               | 5.8               | 9.7            | 3.7           | 4.3                | 7. 0              | 11.9           | 3.5           | 8.3                |\n| Equity Risk                  | 0.1               | 0.4            | -             | -                  | 0.1               | 0.2            | -             | 0.1                |\n| Diversification effect       | (32.9)            | N/A            | N/A           | (29.4)             | (23.1)            | N/A            | N/A           | ( 1 7. 0)          |\n| Total                        | 53.3              | 65.5           | 44.2          | 44.5               | 52.5              | 64.1           | 40.3          | 55.8               |\n\n|                        | 2023              | 2023           | 2023          | 2023               | 2022              | 2022           | 2022          | 2022               |\n|------------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| Trading 1              | Average  $million | High  $million | Low  $million | Year End  $million | Average  $million | High  $million | Low  $million | Year End  $million |\n| Interest Rate Risk     | 13.1              | 20.4           | 7. 7          | 11.6               | 8.1               | 11.7           | 5.3           | 9.0                |\n| Credit Spread Risk     | 9.4               | 12.4           | 7. 4          | 9.4                | 9.5               | 14.9           | 5.0           | 8.7                |\n| Foreign Exchange Risk  | 7.0               | 12.2           | 4.2           | 7. 4               | 6.5               | 10.3           | 4.8           | 6.8                |\n| Commodity Risk         | 5.8               | 9.7            | 3.7           | 4.4                | 7. 0              | 11.9           | 3.5           | 8.3                |\n| Equity Risk            | -                 | -              | -             | -                  | -                 | -              | -             | -                  |\n| Diversification effect | (13.8)            | N/A            | N/A           | (11.5)             | (13.1)            | N/A            | N/A           | (11.0)             |\n| Total                  | 21.5              | 30.6           | 14.7          | 21.3               | 18.0              | 24.4           | 12.6          | 21.8               |\n\nThe primary categories of Market Risk for the Group are:\n\n- \u00b7 Interest Rate Risk: arising from changes in yield curves and implied volatilities on interest rate options\n- \u00b7 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk: arising from changes in currency exchange rates and implied volatilities on foreign exchange options\n- \u00b7 Commodity Risk: arising from changes in commodity prices and implied volatilities on commodity options; covering energy, precious metals, base metals and agriculture\n- \u00b7 Credit Spread Risk: arising from changes in the price of debt instruments and credit-linked derivatives, driven by factors other than the level of risk-free interest rates\n- \u00b7 Equity Risk: arising from changes in the prices of equities, equity indices, equity baskets and implied volatilities on related options\n\n## Market risk movements (audited)\n\nValue at Risk (VaR) allows the Group to manage Market Risk across the trading book and most of the fair valued nontrading books.\n\nThe average level of total trading and non-trading VaR in 2023 was $53.3 million, 1.5 per cent higher than 2022 ($52.5 million). The year end level of total trading and nontrading VaR in 2023 was $44.5 million, 20.2 per cent lower than 2022 ($55.8 million), due to a reduction in non-trading positions.\n\nFor the trading book, the average level of VaR in 2023 was $21.5 million, 19.4 per cent higher than 2022 ($18.0 million). Trading activities have remained relatively unchanged, and client driven.",

        "page_content": "## Backtesting\n\nIn 2023, there were five regulatory backtesting negative exceptions at Group level (in 2022 there were eight regulatory backtesting negative exceptions at Group level). Group exceptions occurred on:\n\n- \u00b7 16 March: After the US authorities put Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank into administration there were strong market reactions, including notable interest rate yield rises on 16 March\n- \u00b7 1 June: After announcement of planned potential economic reforms in Nigeria, there were sharp movements in the offshore Naira FX market in anticipation of Naira devaluation\n- \u00b7 12 June: After the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria was removed there were further sharp movements in the offshore Naira FX market\n- \u00b7 1 November and 3 November: After the Nigerian government announced on 30 October that it plans to target an exchange rate of 750 Naira per dollar, the onshore spot market became more volatile on low volumes.\n\nThe VaR model is currently being enhanced to increase its responsiveness to abrupt upturns in market volatility.\n\nThere have been five Group exceptions in the previous 250 business days. This is within the 'amber zone' applied internationally to internal models by bank supervisors (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Supervisory framework for the use of backtesting in conjunction with the internal models approach to market risk capital requirements, January 1996).\n\nThe graph below illustrates the performance of the VaR model used in capital calculations. It compares the 99 percentile profit and loss confidence level given by the VaR model with the hypothetical profit and loss of each day given the actual market movement without taking into account any intra-day trading activity.\n\n## 2023 Backtesting chart\n\n## Internal model approach regulatory trading book at Group level Hypothetical profit and loss (P&L) versus VaR (99 per cent, one day)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Trading loss days\n\n|                                                                                        |   2023 |   2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Number of loss days reported for Financial Markets trading book total product income 1 |     16 |     15 |\n\n- 1 Includes credit valuation adjustment (CVA) and funding valuation adjustment (FVA), and excludes Treasury Markets business (non-trading), periodic valuation changes for Capital Markets, expected loss provisions, overnight indexed swap (OIS) discounting and accounting adjustments such as debit valuation adjustments\n\n## Average daily income earned from Market Risk-related activities 1 (audited)\n\nThe average level of total trading daily income in 2023 was $12 million, 14 per cent lower than 2022 ($14 million). The decrease is largely attributable to lower income in Commodities in 2023 on the back of lower volatility and falling crude oil prices. Additionally, the decrease in FX business was on the back of lower cross-border flows and muted FX volatility.\n\nThe average level of total non-trading daily income in 2023 was -$0.7 million, 217 per cent lower than 2022 ($0.6 million). The decrease is primarily attributable to lower income from the Credit Solutions business.\n\n| Trading               | 2023  $million   | 2022  $million   |\n|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Interest Rate Risk    | 4.5              | 5.0              |\n| Credit Spread Risk    | 1.2              | 1.4              |\n| Foreign Exchange Risk | 5.5              | 6.3              |\n| Commodity Risk        | 0.8              | 1.3              |\n| Equity Risk           | -                | -                |\n| Total                 | 12.0             | 14.0             |",

An analysis has been performed on these exposures to assess the impact of a 1 per cent fall in the US dollar exchange rates, adjusted to incorporate the impacts of correlations of these currencies to the US dollar. The impact on the positions above would be an increase of $260 million (31 December 2022: $421 million). Changes in the valuation of these positions are taken to reserves. For analysis of the Group's capital position and requirements, refer to the Capital Review (page 338).\n\n## Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCounterparty Credit Risk is the potential for loss in the event of the default of a derivative counterparty, after taking into account the value of eligible collaterals and risk mitigation techniques. The Group's counterparty credit exposures are included in the Credit Risk section.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments Credit Risk mitigation\n\nThe Group enters into master netting agreements, which in the event of default result in a single amount owed by or to the counterparty through netting the sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values of applicable derivative transactions.\n\nIn addition, the Group enters into credit support annexes (CSAs) with counterparties where collateral is deemed a necessary or desirable mitigant to the exposure. Cash collateral includes collateral called under a variation margin process from counterparties if total uncollateralised mark-tomarket exposure exceeds the threshold and minimum transfer amount specified in the CSA. With certain counterparties, the CSA is reciprocal and requires us to post collateral if the overall mark-to-market values of positions are in the counterparty's favour and exceed an agreed threshold.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity and Funding Risk\n\nLiquidity and Funding Risk is the risk that the Group may not have sufficient stable or diverse sources of funding to meet its obligations as they fall due.\n\nThe Group's Liquidity and Funding Risk framework requires each country to ensure that it operates within predefined liquidity limits and remains in compliance with Group liquidity policies and practices, as well as local regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Group achieves this through a combination of setting Risk Appetite and associated limits, policy formation, risk measurement and monitoring, prudential and internal stress testing, governance and review.\n\nDespite the challenging macroeconomic environment, the Group has maintained resilience and retained a robust liquidity position. The Group continues to focus on improving the quality and diversification of its funding mix and remains committed to supporting its clients.\n\n## Primary sources of funding (audited)\n\nThe Group's funding strategy is largely driven by its policy to maintain adequate liquidity at all times, in all geographic locations and for all currencies. This is done to ensure the Group can meet all of its obligations as they fall due. The Group's funding profile is therefore well diversified across different sources, maturities and currencies.\n\nThe Group's assets are funded predominantly by customer deposits, supplemented with wholesale funding, which is diversified by type and maturity.\n\nThe Group maintains access to wholesale funding markets in all major financial centres in which it operates. This seeks to ensure that the Group has market intelligence, maintains stable funding lines and can obtain optimal pricing when performing cashflow management activities.\n\nIn 2023, the Group issued approximately $8.1 billion of securities, all in the form of senior debt, from its holding company (HoldCo) Standard Chartered PLC (2022 $5.2 billion of senior debt securities, $0.75 billion of subordinated debt securities and $1.25 billion of Additional Tier 1 securities). In the next 12 months, approximately $8.5 billion of the Group's senior debt, subordinated debt and Additional Tier 1 securities in total are either falling due for repayment contractually or callable by the Group.\n\n## Group's composition of liabilities and equity 31 December 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Liquidity and Funding Risk metrics\n\nThe Group continually monitors key liquidity metrics, both on a country basis and consolidated across the Group.\n\nThe following liquidity and funding Board Risk Appetite metrics define the maximum amount and type of risk that the Group is willing to assume in pursuit of its strategy: liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), liquidity stress survival horizons, recovery capacity and net stable funding ratio (NSFR). In addition to the Board Risk Appetite, there are further limits that apply at Group and country level such as, external wholesale borrowing (WBE) and cross currency limits.\n\n## Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)\n\nThe LCR is a regulatory requirement set to ensure the Group has sufficient unencumbered high-quality liquid assets to meet its liquidity needs in a 30-calendar-day liquidity stress scenario.\n\nThe Group monitors and reports its liquidity positions under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio per PRA rulebook and has maintained its LCR above the prudential requirement. The Group maintained strong liquidity ratios despite a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.\n\nAt the reporting date, the Group LCR was 145 per cent (31 December 2022: 147 per cent), with a surplus to both Board-approved Risk Appetite and regulatory requirements.\n\nAdequate liquidity was held across our footprint to meet all local prudential LCR requirements where applicable.\n\n|                          | 2023   $million   | 2022   $million   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Liquidity buffer         | 185,643           | 177,037           |\n| Total net cash outflows  | 128,111           | 120,720           |\n| Liquidity coverage ratio | 145%              | 147%              |",

        "page_content": "## Stress coverage\n\nThe Group intends to maintain a prudent and sustainable funding and liquidity position, in all countries and currencies, such that it can withstand a severe but plausible liquidity stress.\n\nOur approach to managing liquidity and funding is reflected in the Board-level Risk Appetite Statement which includes the following:\n\n'The Group should have sufficient stable and diverse sources of funding to meet its contractual and contingent obligations as they fall due.'\n\nThe Group's internal liquidity stress testing framework covers the following stress scenarios:\n\n- \u00b7 Standard Chartered-specific - Captures the liquidity impact from an idiosyncratic event affecting Standard Chartered only with the rest of the market assumed to be operating normally.\n- \u00b7 Market wide - Captures the liquidity impact from a market-wide crisis affecting all participants in a country, region or globally.\n- \u00b7 Combined - Assumes both Standard Chartered-specific and market-wide events affect the Group simultaneously and hence is the most severe scenario.\n\nAll scenarios include, but are not limited to, modelled outflows for retail and wholesale funding, off-balance sheet funding risk, cross-currency funding risk, intraday risk, franchise risk and risks associated with a deterioration of a firm's credit rating. Concentration risk approach has been enhanced to capture single name and industry concentration.\n\nStress testing results show that a positive surplus was maintained under all scenarios at 31 December 2023, and respective countries were able to survive for a period of time as defined under each scenario. The results take into account currency convertibility and portability constraints while calculating the liquidity surplus at Group level.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank's credit ratings as at 31 December 2023 were A+ with stable outlook (Fitch), A+ with stable outlook (S&P) and A1 with stable outlook (Moody's). As of 31 December 2023, the estimated contractual outflow of a three-notch long-term ratings downgrade is $1.1 billion.\n\n## External wholesale borrowing\n\nA risk limit is set to prevent excessive reliance on wholesale borrowing. Within the definition of wholesale borrowing, limits are applied to all branches and operating subsidiaries in the Group and as at the reporting date, the Group remained within the Risk Appetite.\n\n## Advances-to-deposits ratio\n\nThis is defined as the ratio of total loans and advances to customers relative to total customer deposits. An advancesto-deposits ratio below 100 per cent demonstrates that customer deposits exceed customer loans as a result of the emphasis placed on generating a high level of funding from customers.\n\nThe Group's advances-to-deposits ratio has decreased by 4.1 per cent to 53.3 per cent, driven by an increase in customer deposits of 3 per cent and with a reduction of 5 per cent in customer loans and advances. Deposits from customers as at 31 December 2023 are $486,666 million (31 December 2022: $473,383 million).\n\n|                                           | 2023  $million   | 2022  $million   |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Total loans and advances to customers 1,2 | 259,481          | 271,897          |\n| Total customer accounts 3                 | 486,666          | 473,383          |\n| Advances-to-deposits ratio                | 53.3%            | 57.4%            |\n\n## Net stable funding ratio (NSFR)\n\nThe NSFR is a PRA regulatory requirement that stipulates institutions to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to an assumed duration of their assets and off-balance sheet activities over a one-year horizon. It is the ratio between the amount of available stable funding (ASF) and the amount of required stable funding (RSF). ASF factors are applied to balance sheet liabilities and capital, based on their perceived stability and the amount of stable funding they provide. Likewise, RSF factors are applied to assets and off-balance sheet exposures according to the amount of stable funding they require. The regulatory requirements for NSFR are to maintain a ratio of at least 100 per cent. The average ratio for the past four quarters is 136 per cent.",

billion\n- 4   Customer accounts include repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing of $46.8 billion\n- 5   Senior debt maturity profiles are based upon contractual maturity, which may be later than call options over the debt held by the Group\n\n## Behavioural maturity of financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe cashflows presented in the previous section reflect the cashflows that will be contractually payable over the residual maturity of the instruments. However, contractual maturities do not necessarily reflect the timing of actual repayments or cashflow. In practice, certain assets and liabilities behave differently from their contractual terms, especially for short-term customer accounts, credit card balances and overdrafts, which extend to a longer period than their contractual maturity. On the other hand, mortgage balances tend to have a shorter repayment period than their contractual maturity date. Expected customer behaviour is assessed and managed on a country basis using qualitative and quantitative techniques, including analysis of observed customer behaviour over time.",

The financial liability balances in the table below will not agree with the balances reported in the consolidated balance sheet as the table incorporates all contractual cashflows, on an undiscounted basis, relating to both principal and interest payments. Derivatives not treated as hedging derivatives are included in the 'On demand' time bucket and not by contractual maturity.\n\nWithin the 'More than five years and undated' maturity band are undated financial liabilities, the majority of which relate to subordinated debt, on which interest payments are not included as this information would not be meaningful, given the instruments are undated. Interest payments on these instruments are included within the relevant maturities up to five years.\n\n|                                                    | 2023                         | 2023

        "page_content": "## Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book\n\nThe following table provides the estimated impact to a hypothetical base case projection of the Group's earnings under the following scenarios:\n\n- \u00b7 A 50 basis point parallel interest rate shock (up and down) to the current market-implied path of rates, across all yield curves\n- \u00b7 A 100 basis point parallel interest rate shock (up and down) to the current market-implied path of rates, across all yield curves\n\nThese interest rate shock scenarios assume all other economic variables remain constant. The sensitivities shown represent the estimated change to a hypothetical base case projected net interest income (NII), plus the change in interest rate implied income and expense from FX swaps used to manage banking book currency positions, under the different interest rate shock scenarios.\n\nThe base case projected NII is based on the current marketimplied path of rates and forward rate expectations. The NII sensitivities below stress this base case by a further 50 or 100bps. Actual observed interest rate changes will lag behind market expectation. Accordingly, the shocked NII sensitivity does not represent a forecast of the Group's net interest income.\n\nThe interest rate sensitivities are indicative stress tests and based on simplified scenarios, estimating the aggregate impact of an unanticipated, instantaneous parallel shock across all yield curves over a one-year horizon, including the time taken to implement changes to pricing before becoming effective. The assessment assumes that the size and mix of the balance sheet remain constant and that there are no specific management actions in response to the change in rates. No assumptions are made in relation to the impact on credit spreads in a changing rate environment.\n\nSignificant modelling and behavioural assumptions are made regarding scenario simplification, market competition, pass-through rates, asset and liability re-pricing tenors, and price flooring. In particular, the assumption that interest rates of all currencies and maturities shift by the same amount concurrently, and that no actions are taken to mitigate the impacts arising from this are considered unlikely. Reported sensitivities will vary over time due to a number of factors including changes in balance sheet composition, market conditions, customer behaviour and risk management strategy. Therefore, while the NII sensitivities are a relevant measure of the Group's interest rate exposure, they should not be considered an income or profit forecast.\n\n|                                                                                                                    | 2023               | 2023               | 2023               | 2023               | 2023               | 2023                            | 2023            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Estimated one-year impact to earnings from   a parallel shift in yield curves at the beginning   of the period of: | USD bloc  $million | HKD bloc  $million | SGD bloc  $million | KRW bloc  $million | CNY bloc  $million | Other  currency  bloc  $million | Total  $million |\n| + 50 basis points                                                                                                  | 90                 | 10                 | 50                 | 10                 | 30                 | 160                             | 350             |\n| - 50 basis points                                                                                                  | (150)              | (30)               | (50)               | (20)               | (40)               | (180)                           | (470)           |\n| + 100 basis points                                                                                                 | 180                | 10                 | 100                | 20                 | 60                 | 320                             | 690             |\n| - 100 basis points                                                                                                 | (280)              | (40)               | (100)              | (40)               | (80)               | (350)                           | (890)           |\n\n2022\n\n| Estimated one-year impact to earnings from   a parallel shift in yield curves at the beginning   of the period of:   | USD bloc  $million   | HKD bloc  $million   | SGD bloc  $million   | KRW bloc  $million   | CNY bloc  $million   | Other  currency  bloc  $million   | Total  $million   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|\n| + 50 basis points                                                                                                    | 80                   | 20                   | 40                   | 50                   | 30                   | 150                               | 370               |\n| - 50 basis points                                                                                                    | (80)                 | (20)                 | (40)                 | (60)                 | (30)                 | (140)                             | (370)             |\n| + 100 basis points                                                                                                   | 160                  | 40                   | 90                   | 100                  | 50                   | 300                               | 740               |\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group estimates the one-year impact of an instantaneous, parallel increase across all yield curves of 50 basis points to increase projected NII by $350 million. The equivalent impact from a parallel decrease of 50 basis points would result in a reduction in projected NII of $470 million. The Group estimates the one-year impact of an instantaneous, parallel increase across all yield curves of 100 basis points to increase projected NII by $690 million. The equivalent impact from a parallel decrease of 100 basis points would result in a reduction in projected NII of $890 million.\n\nThe benefit from rising interest rates is primarily from reinvesting at higher yields and from assets re-pricing faster and to a greater extent than deposits. NII sensitivity in falling rate scenarios has increased versus 31 December 2022, due to changes in modelling assumptions to reflect expected re-pricing activity on Retail and Transaction Banking current accounts and savings accounts in the current interest rate environment.\n\nOver the course of 2023 the size of the interest rate swaps and HTC-accounted bond portfolios used to programmatically hedge the behavioural lives of structural equity and CASA balances increased from $31 billion to $47 billion. The portfolios had a weighted average maturity of 2.9 years, which reflects the behaviouralised lives of the rate-insensitive deposit and equity balances that they hedge, and a yield of 3.1%, as at 31 December 2023.",

        "page_content": "## Operational and Technology Risk\n\nThe Group defines Operational and Technology risk as the potential for loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, technology events, human error, or from the impact of external events (including legal risks). Operational and Technology risk may occur anywhere in the Group, including third-party processes.\n\n## Operational and Technology risk profile\n\nRisk management practices help the business grow safely and ensure governance and management of Operational and Technology risk through the delivery and embedding of effective frameworks and policies, together with continuous oversight and assurance. Managing Operational and Technology risk makes the Group more efficient and enables it to offer better, sustainable service to its customers. The Group's Operational and Technology Risk Type Framework ('O&T RTF') is designed to enable the Group to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage and report on its Operational and Technology risks. The Group continues to ensure the O&T RTF supports the business and the functions in effectively managing risk and controls within risk appetite to meet their strategic objectives.\n\nThe Group has demonstrated progress on ensuring visibility of risks and risk management through implementation of a standardised risk taxonomy. Standardising the risk taxonomy enables improved risk aggregation and reporting as well as providing opportunities for simplifying the process of risk identification and assessment. A revised process universe along with taxonomies for causes and controls have been designed and will be implemented in 2024, with control categories supporting the streamlining and removal of duplicate controls, reducing complexity, and improving\n\nrisk and control management. Macro processes will provide a client-centric view and enable clearer accountability for delivery as well as management of risks in line with business objectives.\n\nOperational and Technology risk is elevated in areas such as Information and Cyber Security, Data Management and Transaction Processing. Other key areas of focus are Change, Systems Health/Technology risk, Third Party risk, Resilience and Regulatory Compliance. Management has focused on addressing these areas, improving the sustainable operating environment and has initiated a number of programmes to enhance the control environment. The Group continues to monitor and manage Operational and Technology risks associated with the external environment such as geopolitical factors and the increasing risk of cyber-attacks. Digitalisation and inappropriate use of Artificial Intelligence, various regulatory expectations across our footprint and the changing technology landscape remain key emerging areas to manage, allowing the Group to keep pace with new business developments, whilst ensuring that risk and control frameworks evolve accordingly. The Group continues to strengthen its risk management to understand the full spectrum of risks in the operating environment, enhance its defences and improve resilience.\n\n## Operational and Technology risk events and losses\n\nOperational losses are one indicator of the effectiveness and robustness of the non-financial risk control environment.\n\nThe Group's profile of operational loss events in 2023 and 2022 is summarised in the table below, which shows the distribution of gross operational losses by Basel business line.\n\n|                                                           | % Loss   | % Loss   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Distribution of Operational Losses by Basel business line | 2023     | 2022\u00b9    |\n| Agency Services                                           | 1.8%     | 3.0%     |\n| Asset Management                                          | 0.1%     | 0.8%     |\n| Commercial Banking                                        | 8.4%     | 8.9%     |\n| Corporate Finance                                         | 7. 6%    | 1.1%     |\n| Corporate Items                                           | 35.5%    | 2.5%     |\n| Payment and Settlements                                   | 1 7. 6%  | 42.9%    |\n| Retail Banking                                            | 20.3%    | 25.5%    |\n| Retail Brokerage                                          | 0.0%     | 0.0%     |\n| Trading and Sales                                         | 8.5%     | 15.2%    |\n\nThe Group's profile of operational loss events in 2023 and 2022 is also summarised by Basel event type in the table below.

During 2023, the physical risk profile across products and markets has remained stable, apart from slight variations in exposure to high flood risk levels due to enhancements in Munich Re's flood risk model.\n\nAssessment of Acute and Chronic Physical Risk for Top 10 Markets' Exposures backed by Property Collateral, indicating Exposure Concentration Subjected to Very High Gross Risk (as of September 2023)\n\n|                                      |        |               |        | Korea 23%     | Korea 23%     | Korea 23%   | Hong Kong 38%   | Hong Kong 38%   | Hong Kong 38%   | Taiwan 7%   | Taiwan 7%     | Taiwan 7%   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|---------------|--------|---------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Physical risk event                  | Q3-22  | Q3-23         | Trend  | Q3-22         | Q3-23         | Trend       | Q3-22           | Q3-23           | Trend           | Q3-22       | Q3-23         | Trend       |\n| Flood Risk                           |        | 24.80% 24.20% |        |               | 14.00% 12.30% |             |                 | 44.60% 44.90%   |                 | 11.90%      | 11.00%        |             |\n| Sea-level rise  (Year 2100, RCP 8.5) | 2.10%  | 2.20%         |        | 0.01%         | 0.60%         |             | 3.40%           | 3.60%           |                 | 0.04%       | 0.03%         |             |\n|                                      | India  | India         | India  |               |               |             | Malaysia        | Malaysia        | Malaysia        | UAE         | UAE           | UAE         |\n|                                      | 5%     | 5%            | 5%     | 18%           | 18%           | 18%         | 4%              | 4%              | 4%              | 1%          | 1%            | 1%          |\n| Physical risk event                  | Q3-22  | Q3-23         | Trend  | Q3-22         | Q3-23         | Trend       | Q3-22           | Q3-23           | Trend           | Q3-22       | Q3-23         | Trend       |\n| Flood Risk                           |        | 30.20% 22.30% |        | 3.50%         | 3.40%         |             | 6.50%           | 5.30%           |                 |             | 29.50% 26.50% |             |\n| Sea-level rise  (Year 2100, RCP 8.5) | 1.10%  | 0.90%         |        | 0.08%         | 0.06%         |             | 0.20%           | 0.30%           |                 | 36.80%      | 36.10%        |             |\n|                                      | Jersey | Jersey        | Jersey | Vietham       | Vietham       | Vietham     | China           | China           | China           |             |               |             |\n|                                      | 2%     | 2%            | 2%     | 1%            | 1%            | 1%          | 2%              | 2%              | 2%              |             |               |             |\n| Physical risk event                  | Q3-22  | Q3-23         | Trend  | Q3-22         | Q3-23         | Trend       | Q3-22           | Q3-23           | Trend           |             |               |             |\n| Flood Risk                           | 1.90%  | 1.60%         |        | 63.90% 60.40% |               |             | 67. 70%         | 67.1 0%         |                 |             |               |             |\n| Sea-level rise  (Year 2100, RCP 8.5) | -      | -             | -      | 1.80%         | 1.00%         |             | 8.30%           | 8.30%           |                 |             |               |             |\n\nNote: Movements are called out for markets showing a change of >5 per cent year-on-year change in flood risk exposure concentration.",

        "page_content": "## Transition risk - Gross Risk and Transition Plan levels for key sectors\n\nFor four key sectors that have high transition risk i.e. Commercial Real Estate (CRE), O&G Producers, Metals and Mining Producers and Utilities, we have assessed the risk against the level of transition plans and how it varies across our key markets.\n\nCRE: Companies across our key markets are close together with respect to their transition scores, reflecting the policy environment in the building sector, which is broadly similar across major markets. Key factors which determine the transition risk grading for a building are its location, which helps ascertain the intensity of the power grid supplying electricity to the asset, the property type, and its energy efficiency.\n\nPower: Clients in the UAE are slightly behind some of their global peers, although this is driven in part by a lower level of disclosures and higher transition risk as a result of fossil fuel intensive business models.\n\n## CRE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## O&G Producer\n\nO&G : This sector has been gradually preparing for the transition to lower carbon intensive fuels over the last few years. While there is a lot more to do in terms of transitioning, the improved transition risk understanding and associated disclosures lead to on average better mitigation scores in this sector.\n\nMining: Almost 50 per cent of the Metals and Mining clients in our portfolio, ranging from Steel to Cement to Aluminium producers are based in China and India. Effective decarbonisation in this sector is reliant on the power grid decarbonising, improved energy efficiency in overall operations, including heating, as well as managing process level emissions.\n\n## Utilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Metals & Mining Producers\n\n<!-- image -->",

Analysing the climate risk grading\n\nEach client is assigned a climate risk grading (BRAG) computed based on the gross transition risk and transition risk mitigation. Owing to physical risk data being less robust, we have to date focused only on transition risk drivers to compute the climate risk grading. However, as highlighted in the section above, we have seen a steady improvement in the coverage of physical risk data in the last two years. During 2024, we plan to develop a methodology to incorporate both physical and transition risk drivers in the computation of BRAG which will holistically represent the extent of climate risk faced by a client.\n\nThere are currently four types of BRAG ratings assigned to clients - black, red, amber, green.\n\n| Black                                                                           | Clients are deemed to have very high  exposure to Transition Risk with little or  no mitigation plans       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Red  Clients are deemed to have very high  exposure to Transition Risk but with |                                                                                                             |\n| Amber                                                                           | Clients are deemed to have high  exposure to Transition Risk but with  acceptable or good mitigation plans. |\n| Green                                                                           | Clients are deemed to have low or  limited exposure to Transition Risk                                      |\n\n## 3. Evaluating the risk (linkage to credit process)\n\nOnce a climate risk grading is assigned to a client, the impacts from climate-related risks are integrated into the existing credit approval process qualitatively and/or quantitatively through inclusion within the business risk analysis and financial modelling. If the risks are deemed material and not adequately represented via the existing credit rating of the client, subjective warning signals may be added to influence the credit rating. Additionally, risk triggers are added to monitor risks that are not adequately mitigated and to seek additional information from the client where applicable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4. Portfolio management and monitoring\n\nConcentration of black and red graded clients remains within proposed Risk Appetite levels at 6 per cent within our key markets; some of the more developed markets have the highest proportion of green clients, which reflects the higher level of climate risk disclosures and governance established by companies in this region. Amongst our key markets, the UAE currently has the highest proportion of red and black clients, driven by a combination of clients that had fewer disclosures and high transition risk, particularly fossil fuel led utility providers.\n\nDuring 2023 we have embedded qualitative and quantitative climate considerations into the Group's credit underwriting principles for O&G, Mining, Shipping and CRE sectors for which we have industry specific origination teams. This included introducing portfolio level caps for black and red rated clients and lower preference for emission intensive transactions. It is important to note that underlying principles vary depending on the sector, to help steer the portfolio in the desired direction over the medium term, and also consider the Group's 2030 financed emission targets. We have also initiated work to assess risks to underlying collateral from physical and transition risk specifically for our CRE and Shipping portfolios.\n\nA key strategic focus area going forward is to embed climate risk and net zero targets into business and credit decisions. To enable this, we have established a Net Zero Climate Risk Working Forum where discussions on account plans on high climate risk and net zero divergent clients are held.\n\n## Portfolio distribution across key markets\n\n<!-- image -->",

Controls and assurance\n\nIndependent control checks by first line of defence and assurance reviews by second line of defence on integrating climate risk within the credit process are carried out quarterly to improve the quality and effectiveness of assessing climate risk. The results of the assurance testing and steps to address gaps are periodically shared with impacted stakeholders and as part of governance updates to risk committees.\n\n## Credibility of transition plans\n\nWe aim to actively manage our exposure by shifting to lower emissions-intensive clients and working closely with our existing clients to develop credible transition plans that are consistent with our net zero commitments. To help us identity such clients, we draw on our existing CRQ framework to finalise a methodology to assess the Credibility of Transition Plan (CTP) by analysing client commitments to transition their business to a low carbon economy. We leverage the data captured in the CRQ and assign a credibility rating to the clients' transition plan based on an in-house scoring methodology that draws on the UK Transition Planning Taskforce and Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero guidance on net zero transition plans.\n\nThe current methodology will be periodically reviewed as the level of client climate-related disclosure steps up across our footprint, to ensure it remains fit for purpose and in line with industry best practices, stakeholder expectations and regulatory requirements. The CTP has been embedded into the Version 3 CRQ that was implemented in January 2024.\n\n## Reputational and Sustainability Risk\n\nClimate risk is considered within the Reputational and Sustainability Risk framework, for our corporate clients, through an assessment of a client's ability to meet their own climate-related commitments, as well as meet the Group's aim to reach net zero GHG emissions by 2050.\n\nWe have continued to perform additional client level due diligence for (i) clients covered by the Group's net zero targets for high carbon sectors (O&G, Power, Steel, Aluminium, Cement, Automobiles, Shipping, Aviation and CRE), (ii) clients with a coal nexus 2 as well as (iii) those that have been assessed at client level as high climate risk. The assessment focuses on three pillars at covering both client and transaction level aspects:\n\nOf the case reviews completed, an increase in Reputational and Sustainability Risk rating was suggested for c.24 per cent of transactions compared to c.17 per cent in 2022. These consisted of companies in Coal Production, O&G, Mining, Steel and Cement sectors, primarily from the South East Asia region, looking to procure coal or other high carbon emitting products for manufacturing, production, or wholesale purposes. In addition, some entities with high temperature alignment scores and no clear transition plan were raised as having additional risk and rating increases recommended.\n\nThe above-mentioned due diligence is in addition to management of environmental and social risk arising from the Group's client relationships and transactions. Further information is available in the Sustainability overview on pages 76 to 78 and Sustainability review on pages 125 to 129.\n\nTemperature alignment is one way to consider a company's impact on climate change and an indicator of a client's progress towards a net zero economy. It is calculated based on historic emission intensities and volume of hydrocarbons produced to produce a forward-looking temperature alignment score. We assessed the weighted average temperature alignment (WATA) projected to 2030 of 3,661 corporate client entities (covering c.62 per cent of corporate client portfolio on a net nominal basis) by high carbon sector.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2   As defined by the Group's public Position Statement to only provide financial services to clients who by 2030, are less than 5 per cent dependent on thermal coal (based on percentage revenue).",

This has helped to reduce reliance on third party modelling capabilities.\n\nTemperature alignment is an emerging concept, and industry-wide standards on methodology are still evolving. We fully expect our approach to evolve in line with best practice. Client-level emissions are only available for c.55 per cent of corporate clients and sector average proxies are being used for the remainder. Improving such data gaps remains a key priority.\n\n## Country Risk\n\nThe Group uses a set of physical and transition risk rankings to identify the markets most vulnerable and least ready to adapt and mitigate climate-related physical and transition risks.\n\n- \u00b7 The physical risk rankings are based on a set of publicly available scores such as ND-Gain Country Index and GermanWatch Climate Risk Index, as well as S&P Global Ratings and Moody's Investors Service.\n- \u00b7 The transition risk rankings are based on an internally developed methodology which is a combination of climate and macroeconomic drivers.",

        "page_content": "## Insights\n\n- \u00b7 For both physical and transition risk, our exposure to high-risk countries (buckets 9 and 10) remains well below Risk Appetite.\n- \u00b7 The rankings are largely driven by the level of financial risk countries are exposed to and their ability to absorb these losses. As such, the rankings are largely dependent on countries' development stage, economy-wide diversification, in-country inequalities and gross exposure to physical and transition risk shocks.\n- \u00b7 Additionally, we keep close track of transition risk events such as the establishment of the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (EU CBAM) and its potential impact on our key portfolios. Other markets with internal carbon pricing mechanisms (such as Singapore, South Korea, South Africa, etc) are also being monitored as part of country risk annual reviews. From a physical risk standpoint, the rise of El Ni\u00f1o season (expected to peak at the beginning of 2024) is likely to exacerbate climate conditions throughout the Group's footprint regions and we continue to monitor these as part of our annual reviews.\n\n## Limitations\n\n- \u00b7 The computation inputs are based on latest available data which may be dated. Proxies have been used where data for the sovereign is not available.\n- \u00b7 The ranking uses equally spaced decile scores and provides the results in an ordinal manner. While the simplicity helps in adoption and provides the relative position of the sovereigns, other systems may provide more information.\n\n## Operational and Technology Risk\n\nClimate risk primarily impacts Operational and Technology risk as it manifests when physical risk disrupts our properties, data centres and third party arrangements. Thus far, our focus has been on physical risks, and we aim to explore transition risk elements in 2024. We continue exploring enhancements to our control framework across impacted areas. Whilst Continuity Plans for third party arrangements have been enhanced to include climate risk related considerations, we are targeting to gather our material vendors' operating site location data to assess their specific physical risk exposures, such that enhanced continuity plans can be developed.\n\nWe continue to assess the physical risk vulnerabilities of our own operating locations on a regular basis. Furthermore, we have expanded the assessment of physical risk exposure at onboarding to include data centres.\n\n## Assessment of gross Physical Risk at our own operating locations (as of September 2023)\n\n| Physical Risk event           | Time horizon   | Scenario   | Asia   | AME   | E&A   | Global   |\n|-------------------------------|----------------|------------|--------|-------|-------|----------|\n| Flood (Acute)                 | 2023           | N/A        | 24%    | 8%    | 17%   | 20%      |\n| Wildfire (Acute)              |                |            | 0%     | 0%    | 0%    | 0%       |\n| Storm (Acute)                 |                |            | 18%    | 1%    | 6%    | 14%      |\n| Sea-level rise (Chronic)      | 2100           | RCP 8.5    | 1%     | 5%    | 0%    | 2%       |\n| Heat Stress (Chronic)         | 2050           | RCP 8.5    | 24%    | 35%   | 0%    | 26%      |\n| Number of operating locations |                |            | 714    | 239   | 35    | 988      |\n\n## Insights\n\n- \u00b7 From an acute risk perspective, 20 per cent of the Group's locations globally are subjected to flood risk, 14 per cent with storm risk and none at risk from wildfire. Given our footprint, a higher proportion (24 per cent for flood, 18 per cent for storm) of the Group's locations in Asia are subject to acute risks and 17 per cent of locations in Europe and Americas are subjected to flood risks.\n- \u00b7 In the locations where weather events such as storms or cyclones are frequent, the buildings are built in consideration of these risks in line with regional standards.\n- \u00b7 From a chronic risk perspective, under RCP 8.5 for heat stress is at 26 per cent (35 per cent for AME, 24 per cent for Asia). Exposure to sea level rise remains below 5 per cent.\n- \u00b7 A broad range of mitigation options are considered, such as property insurance, operating a diversified location strategy, splitting delivery and therefore reducing concentration risk.\n\n## Traded Risk\n\nWe manage the climate risk of traded risk exposures through the stress-testing framework. Climate risks are incorporated in the scenarios monitored against the traded risk stress Risk Appetite, covering all fair value exposures in the trading and banking books.\n\nClimate-related stress scenarios are designed to include transition risk effects from climate change policies and shocks to markets due to supply and demand disruption from physical climate events. Three scenarios are currently in place: two physical and one transitional. The assumptions and results are subject to internal governance.\n\nOur climate risk management for traded risk exposures is evolving and we are working closely with industry bodies and academics to better assess and monitor climate-related risks and opportunities.",

        "page_content": "## Treasury Risk\n\nFrom a capital perspective, climate risk considerations have been part of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process submissions since 2019. Our approach for assessing climate risk impact on capital adequacy has improved from qualitative judgements to quantitative simulations with the availability of tools and greater understanding of our portfolio.\n\nAs understanding of climate risk management and potential forward-looking scenarios develop, our approach and assessment will evolve, including using a wide range of scenario outcomes to determine any potential capital-related impact in the future.\n\nFrom a liquidity risk perspective, we have started monitoring climate risk-related vulnerabilities and readiness of the top corporate client liquidity portfolios, leveraging the client outreach and data gathering exercise being undertaken on the asset side. The most recent exposure concentration in the 'high transition risk and low readiness' bucket is broadly comparable to what we see for our top corporate client exposures on the asset side. Liquidity providers with high transition risk and low readiness are from commodity traders and utilities sectors. The results of the analysis have been considered as part of our internal liquidity adequacy assessment process and we continue to monitor the profile.\n\n## Model Risk\n\nThroughout 2023, we have been building our internal climate risk modelling capabilities to assess impacts from climate risk, through collaboration with various external vendors. These models have been independently validated by the second line of defence and approved by the Credit Model Assessment Committee, and were used to estimate climate impact on ECL for IFRS9. The amount of incremental ECL as a result of climate risk was below the Group's materiality threshold and as such was not included as a quantitative post model adjustment. In future, the models will also be used for stress testing. The development of internal climate risk models has helped us to reduce reliance on external vendor models, and we will continue to enhance our internal capabilities by extending model coverage (e.g. to develop models to cover more portfolios, or to develop more granular sectorspecific models) and incorporating model enhancements recommended by internal and external stakeholders.\n\nFor the corporate portfolios, we developed transition risk models that adopt the microeconomic theory of demand and supply to determine price changes based on sustainability transition costs in different sectors of the economy. The model accounts for several key market dynamics, such as sensitivities with respect to price, revenue, cost, and profit due to changes in carbon prices. The model is calibrated at portfolio level, covering priority sectors that are carbon-intensive and a generic model that covers non-priority sectors.\n\nFor retail mortgages, an asset haircut model was developed to assess physical climate risk impact by estimating the devaluation of property values along different climate pathways. The model takes input from the current and prospective risk profile of a property, which captures the evolution of various hazard types, including river floods and storms.\n\nFor sovereigns, the climate adjusted Probability of Defaults is derived by considering benchmarks from the Cambridge Paper (Klusak et al., 2021) and incorporating the country risk rankings currently used by the Group, which covers both physical and transition risks.\n\nApart from models that are used to estimate ECL, we have also developed temperature alignment models that assess implied temperature rise scores for corporate counterparties. The model methodology is forward-looking and compares the forecasted emissions of a counterparty to relevant benchmark scenarios. The cumulative difference in emissions between the counterparty's forecast and the benchmark scenarios is converted into a temperature score. The output from temperature alignment models will support internal climate risk management processes. We have also partnered with external vendors for a scenario expansion model which has been used to for NGFS Version 3 scenarios.\n\n## Assessing the resilience of our strategy using scenario analysis\n\nTo assess climate-related risks and opportunities in the short, medium, and long-term we use scenario analysis to consider how risks and opportunities may evolve under different situations. Over two years, we have progressively strengthened our scenario analysis capabilities and developed our infrastructure and capabilities to incorporate climate risk into data, modelling, and analysis. We have expanded our portfolio coverage, built bespoke scenarios, and participated in several regulatory climate stress tests in 2023, including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Central Bank United Arab Emirates stress tests.\n\n## Scenarios used at Standard Chartered\n\nThe table below summarises the climate risk scenarios used internally by the Group across risk types:\n\n| Risk Types                                                            | Scenario Family                                                                                              |   Number of  Scenarios | Risk Measure                                                                                 |   Refer   Page no |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Credit Risk - Corporate, Commercial  and Institutional Banking (CCIB) | Network for Greening the Financial  System (NGFS) Version 3                                                  |                      3 | ECL, RWA                                                                                     |               311 |\n| Credit Risk - CCIB                                                    | Bespoke (Tail and Base)                                                                                      |                      3 | ECL, RWA                                                                                     |               311 |\n| Credit Risk - Consumer, Private and  Business Banking (CPBB)          | Intergovernmental Panel on   Climate Change's (IPCC)  Representative concentration  pathways (RCP) scenarios |                      3 | Exposure Concentration to   sea level rise risk                                              |               298 |\n| Operational and Technology Risk                                       | IPCC's RCP 8.5 scenario                                                                                      |                      1 | Physical Risk Concentration   for sea level rise risk and heat  stress to our own operations |               308 |\n| Reputational and   Sustainability Risk                                | NGFS Version 3                                                                                               |                      2 | Weighted Average  Temperature Alignment                                                      |               305 |\n| Traded Risk                                                           | Bespoke (two Physical scenarios   and one Transition scenario)                                               |                      3 | Stressed Loss                                                                                |               308 |",

This assessment, across the NGFS and bespoke scenarios, covered approximately 95 per cent of our CCIB portfolio for these clients, primarily reflective of the gross transition risks. While client-level transition plans were not factored into the modelling, they were referenced to draw additional insights for priority sectors.\n\n## Scenarios used in Standard Chartered Scenario Analysis\u00b9:\n\nLoan impairment for corporate portfolio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhysical Risk\n\nThe loan impairment (LI) intensity which measures the level of gross ECL against the exposure at default (EAD) enables us to assess the relative size of our exposure subject to potential losses from climate risks. As the graph below illustrates, LI intensities do not go beyond 3 per cent during the forecast horizon for the climate scenarios considered in our scenario analysis. We expect our LI intensity to rise the most in the NGFS Net Zero 2050 scenario. This is reflective of the high transition risks noted by higher carbon prices, coupled with the needs for greater investment to move to a low carbon economy. The NGFS Delayed Transition scenario also projects high LI intensity reflecting that such delayed transition will be equally disruptive due to lower levels of innovations that limits the ability to decarbonise effectively, and rising carbon prices that squeeze profit margins. Relatively lower LI intensity observed in the NGFS Current Policies scenario reflects the nascent modelling capabilities on assessing the physical risk impact to client asset locations and second-order impacts, such as that on the supply chain.\n\n- 1 The size of the bubble is indicative of the gross expected losses assessed for 94% of our corporate portfolio",

This is reflective of the potential risks to the global economy and subsequent increase in credit losses that may manifest due to the climate subsidy competition and introduction of carbon border adjustment mechanism. Overall, we believe that the level of potential credit losses can be mitigated by continuing to take necessary actions which the Group is already doing across sectors, engaging with our clients on this topic and supporting them in enhancing their climate transition plans.\n\n## Loan Impairment intensities for the NGFS and bespoke scenarios (December 2022 snapshot)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLI Intensity is calculated as gross ECL over EAD\n\nFor corporate clients, we focused on the below sectors that have been identified as more vulnerable to potential climate impacts.

Higher carbon prices, decrease in O&G demand characterised in the NGFS Net Zero 2050 and NGFS Delayed Transition scenario are the main drivers for higher LI levels for these sectors. The extreme phsycial and transition risk events occurring in the short term and their longer term second order impacts on the global economy result in the higher LI Intensity levels for these sectors in 2050.",

The results also form part of our Climate Risk Assessments (CRAs). Whilst further enhancements are required to improve our modelling capabilities, the results of scenario analysis have provided further validation to the actions we are taking as a Group in terms of our net zero ambitions and strategy and qualitative management actions in terms of improving the data quality and building in-house modelling expertise. The results have been subject to internal governance, including review and challenge by an expert panel and discussion at the Climate Risk Management Committee and Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Scenario analysis results for CPBB\n\nAs part of our internal climate scenario analysis for CPBB, we carried out physical risk assessments for rising sea levels for our top 10 retail mortgage markets. The concentration of the Group's portfolio exposure exposed to extreme rising sea levels risk has been observed to remain stable at 2 per cent in the most extreme RCP 8.5 scenario.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on the metrics used in the climate scenario\n\nanalysis for CPBB can be found in pages 298 and 299\n\nWe measured the impact of physical risk on ECL to the retail mortgage portfolio for four key markets (Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Korea) as part of the HKMA stress test exercise. For our key residential mortgage markets, we have collaborated with our academic partner (Imperial College London) to develop an internal model for revaluating property valuations under different climate scenarios using the forward-looking risk indices from Munich Re. These revaluations are then used to inform haircuts on the property prices and arrive at climate adjusted ECL values for the mortgage book.\n\n## Limitations and next steps\n\nDespite the efforts in gathering transition risk data relating to our CPBB credit portfolios, gaps still exist across our footprint markets, and we have not been able to run a forward-looking transition risk scenario for CPBB. We have a plan to address these data gaps by working with third parties, engaging clients to gather more information, and using appropriate proxies for remaining data gaps.\n\nMany of the assumptions and methodologies that underpin the scenario analysis continue to rely significantly on nascent methodologies as well as a dependence on first generation models and data challenges. Many of these limitations are shared across the industry. Given the complexities of climate modelling, it should also be noted that the results do not include the real-world aspects such as the non-linear shifts and complex feedback loops. However, they are intended to provide a strategic direction of the sense of portfolio concentrations subject to potential climate losses.\n\nAs more solution providers become available and banks start extensively using them to build internal understanding and capabilities, the transparency and sophistication of modelling methodologies and assumptions will increase. Despite these limitations, our intention is to focus on how climate risk management can inform portfolio management and support opportunity identification with clients on their transition and adaptation pathways. Work is under way to build capability from a people, process, and technology perspective to support stress tests at country level, including in-house training and a plan to implement the in-house models in the Group infrastructure.",

Managing risk effectively is how we drive commerce and prosperity for our clients and our communities, and it is how we grow sustainably and profitably as an organisation.\n\nEffective risk management is essential in delivering consistent and sustainable performance for all our stakeholders and is a central part of the financial and operational management of the Group. The Group adds value to clients and the communities in which they operate by balancing risk and reward to generate returns for shareholders.\n\nThe Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) enables the Group to manage enterprise-wide risks, with the objective of maximising risk-adjusted returns while remaining within our Risk Appetite (RA). The ERMF is embedded across the Group, including its branches and subsidiaries 1 , and is reviewed annually. The latest version is effective from January 2024.\n\n## Annual review\n\nIn the 2023 review, the concepts of Integrated Risk Types (IRTs) and IRT Owner roles were discontinued. Oversight on IRTs, i.e. Climate Risk, Digital Assets and Third Party Risk, is provided through the Risk Type Frameworks (RTFs) and relevant dedicated policies. The subject matter experts as policy owners for these risks provide overall governance and a holistic view of how risks are monitored and managed across the Principal Risk Types (PRTs).\n\n## Risk culture\n\nRisk culture encompasses our general awareness, attitudes, and behaviours towards risk, as well as how risk is managed at enterprise level.\n\nA healthy risk culture is one in which everyone takes personal responsibility to identify and assess, openly discuss, and take prompt action to address existing and emerging risks. We expect those in our control functions to provide oversight and challenge constructively, collaboratively, and in a timely manner. This effort is reflected in our valued behaviours, underpinned by our Code of Conduct and Ethics, and reinforced by how we hire, develop, reward our people, serve our clients, and contribute to communities around the world.\n\n## Strategic risk management\n\nThe Group's approach to strategic risk management includes the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk identification: impact analyses of risks that arise from the Group's growth plans, strategic initiatives, and business model vulnerabilities are reviewed. This assesses how existing risks have evolved in terms of relative importance or whether new risks have emerged.\n- \u00b7 Risk Appetite: impact analysis is performed to assess if strategic initiatives can be achieved within RA and highlight areas where additional RA should be considered.\n- \u00b7 Stress testing: the risks highlighted during the strategy review and other risk identification processes are used to develop scenarios for enterprise stress tests. In order to ensure that the Group's Strategy remains within the approved RA, the Group Chief Risk Officer (GCRO) and Group Chief Financial Officer (GCFO) recommend strategic actions based on the stress test results.\n\n## Roles and responsibilities\n\n## Senior Managers Regime 2\n\nRoles and responsibilities under the ERMF are aligned to the objectives of the Senior Managers Regime (SMR). The GCRO is responsible for the overall development and maintenance of the Group's ERMF and for identifying material risks which the Group may be exposed to. The GCRO delegates effective implementation of the RTFs to Risk Framework Owners (RFO) who provide second line of defence oversight for their respective PRTs.\n\nIn addition, the GCRO is the senior manager responsible for the development of the Group's Digital Assets Risk Assessment Approach, and management of Climate Risk.\n\nThe risks we face constantly evolve, and we must always look for ways to manage them as effectively as possible. While unfavourable outcomes will occur from time to time, a healthy risk culture means that we react quickly and transparently. We can then take the opportunity to learn from our experience and improve our framework and processes.",

        "page_content": "## The Risk function\n\nThe Risk function provides oversight and challenge on the Group's risk management, ensuring that business is conducted in line with regulatory expectations. The GCRO directly manages the Risk function, which is independent from the origination, trading, and sales functions of the businesses. The Risk function is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 Determining the RA for approval by Group's Management Team (GMT) and the Board.\n- \u00b7 Maintaining the ERMF, ensuring that it remains relevant and appropriate to the Group's business activities, and is effectively communicated and implemented across the Group.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring that risks are properly assessed, risk and return decisions are transparent and risks are controlled in accordance with the Group's standards and RA.\n- \u00b7 Overseeing and challenging the management of PRTs under the ERMF.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring that the necessary balance in making risk and return decisions is not compromised by short-term pressures to generate revenues through the independence of the Risk function.\n\nIn addition, the Risk function provides specialist capabilities relevant to risk management processes in the broader organisation.\n\nThe Risk function supports the Group's strategy by building a sustainable ERMF that places regulatory and compliance standards, together with culture of appropriate conduct, at the forefront of the Group's agenda.\n\nOur Conduct, Financial Crime and Compliance (CFCC) function works alongside the Risk function within the ERMF to deliver a unified second line of defence.\n\n## Three lines of defence model\n\nThe Group applies a three line of defence model to its day-to-day activities for effective risk management, and to reinforce a strong governance and control environment. Typically:\n\n- \u00b7 The businesses and functions engaged in or supporting revenue generating activities that own and manage the risks constitute the first line of defence.\n- \u00b7 The control functions, independent of the first line of defence, that provide oversight and challenge of risk management activities act as the second line of defence.\n- \u00b7 Internal Audit acts as the third line of defence providing independent assurance on the effectiveness of controls supporting the activities of the first and second line of defence functions.\n\n## Risk Appetite and profile\n\nThe Group recognises the following constraints which determine the risks that we are willing to take in pursuit of our strategy and the development of a sustainable business:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk capacity is the maximum level of risk the Group can assume, given its current capabilities and resources, before breaching constraints determined by capital and liquidity requirements or the internal operational environment, or otherwise failing to meet the expectations of regulator and law enforcement agencies.\n- \u00b7 RA is defined by the Group and approved by the Board. It is the boundary for the risk that the Group is willing to undertake to achieve its strategic objectives and Corporate Plan.\n\nThe Board is responsible for approving the RA Statements, which are underpinned by a set of financial and operational control parameters known as RA metrics and their associated thresholds. These directly constrain the aggregate risk exposures that can be taken across the Group.\n\nThe Group RA is reviewed at least annually to ensure that it is fit for purpose and aligned with strategy, with focus given to new or emerging risks.\n\n## Risk Appetite Framework\n\nThe Group RA is defined in accordance with risk management principles that inform our overall approach to risk management and our risk culture. We set RA to enable us to grow sustainably whilst managing our risks, giving confidence to our stakeholders.\n\nThe Group RA is supplemented by risk control tools such as granular-level limits, policies, standards, and other operational control parameters that are used to maintain the Group's risk profile within approved RA.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group will not compromise compliance with its Risk Appetite in order to pursue revenue growth or higher returns.\n\nSee Table 1 for the set of RA statements.\n\n## Risk identification and assessment\n\nIdentification and assessment of potentially adverse risk events is an essential first step in managing the risks of any business or activity. To ensure consistency in communication, we use PRTs to classify our risk exposures.\n\nWe also recognise the need to maintain a holistic perspective since:\n\n- \u00b7 a single transaction or activity may give rise to multiple types of risk exposure;\n- \u00b7 risk concentrations may arise from multiple exposures that are closely correlated; and\n- \u00b7 a given risk exposure may change its form from one risk type to another.",

        "page_content": "There are also sources of risk that arise beyond our own operations, such as the Group's dependency on suppliers for the provision of services and technology.\n\nAs the Group remains accountable for risks arising from the actions of such third parties, failure to adequately monitor and manage these relationships could materially impact the Group's ability to operate.\n\nThe Group maintains a dynamic risk-scanning process with inputs on the internal and external risk environment, as well as potential threats and opportunities from the business and client perspectives. The Group maintains a taxonomy of the PRTs, and risk sub-types; as well as the Topical and Emerging Risks (TERs) inventory that includes near-term as well as longer-term uncertainties. Risk assessments of planned growth and strategic initiatives against the Group's RA is undertaken annually.\n\nThe GCRO and the Group Risk Committee (GRC) regularly review reports on the risk profile for the PRTs, adherence to Group RA and the Group risk inventory, including TERs. They use this information to escalate material developments and make recommendations to the Board annually on any potential changes to our Corporate Plan.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nThe objective of stress testing is to support the Group in assessing that it:\n\n- \u00b7 does not have a portfolio with excessive risk concentration that could produce unacceptably high losses under severe but plausible scenarios;\n- \u00b7 has sufficient financial resources to withstand severe but plausible scenarios;\n- \u00b7 has the financial flexibility to respond to extreme but plausible scenarios;\n- \u00b7 understands key business model risks and considers what kind of event might crystallise those risks - even if extreme and with a low likelihood of occurring;\n- \u00b7 Identify, as required, actions to mitigate the likelihood or impact of those events;\n- \u00b7 considers how the outcome of plausible stress events, including TERs, may impact availability of liquidity and regulatory capital; and\n- \u00b7 has set RA metrics at appropriate levels.\n\nEnterprise stress tests incorporate Capital and Liquidity Adequacy Stress Tests, including recovery and resolution, as well as reverse stress tests.\n\nStress tests are performed at the Group, country, business, and portfolio level under a wide range of risks and at varying degrees of severity. Unless specifically set by the regulator, scenario design is a bespoke process that aims to explore risks that can adversely impact the Group.\n\nThe Board delegates approval of the Bank of England (BoE) stress test submissions to the Board Risk Committee (BRC), which reviews the recommendations from the GRC. Based on the stress test results, the GCFO and GCRO can recommend strategic actions to the Board to ensure that the Group's strategy remains within RA.\n\nIn addition, analysis is run at PRT level to assess specific risks and concentrations that the Group may be exposed to. These include qualitative assessments such as stressing of credit sectors or portfolios, measures such as Value at Risk (VaR) and multi-factor scenarios in Traded Risk and internal stressed liquidity metrics. Non-financial risk types are also stressed to assess the necessary capital requirements under the Operational & Technology RTF.\n\nThe Group has also undertaken a number of Climate Risk stress tests, both those mandated by regulators as well as management scenarios.",

In addition, they ensure that credit risks are properly assessed and transparent; and that credit decisions are controlled in accordance with the Group's RA, credit policies and standards.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nSegment-specific policies for CCIB and CPBB are in place for the management of Credit Risk. The Credit Policy for CCIB Client Coverage sets the principles that must be followed for the end-to-end credit process, including credit initiation, credit grading, credit assessment, product structuring, credit risk mitigation, monitoring and control, and documentation.\n\nThe CPBB Credit Risk Management Policy sets the principles for the management of CPBB segments, for end-to-end credit process including credit initiation, credit assessment, documentation and monitoring for lending to these segments.\n\nThe Group also sets out standards for the eligibility, enforceability, and effectiveness of Credit Risk mitigation arrangements. Potential credit losses from a given account, client or portfolio are mitigated using a range of tools, such as collateral, netting agreements, credit insurance, credit derivatives and guarantees.\n\nRisk mitigants are also carefully assessed for their market value, legal enforceability, correlation, and counterparty risk of the protection provider.\n\nCollateral is valued prior to drawdown and regularly thereafter as required, to reflect current market conditions, the probability of recovery and the period of time to realise the collateral in the event of liquidation. The Group also seeks to diversify its collateral holdings across asset classes and markets.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group manages its credit exposures following the principle of diversification across products, geographies, client segments and industry sectors.\n\nWhere guarantees, credit insurance, standby letters of credit or credit derivatives are used as Credit Risk mitigation, the creditworthiness of the protection provider is assessed and monitored using the same credit approval process applied to the obligor.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt Board level, the BRC oversees the effective management of Credit Risk. At the executive level, the GRC oversees and appoints sub-committees for the management of all risk types including Credit Risk - in particular the CCIB Risk Committee, CPBB Risk Committee, Asia Risk Committee, and Africa and Middle East Risk Committee. The GRC also receives reports from other key Group Committees such as the Standard Chartered Bank Executive Risk Committee (in relation to Credit Risk).\n\nThese committees are responsible for overseeing all risk profiles including Credit Risk of the Group within the respective business areas and regions. Meetings are held regularly, and the committees monitor all material Credit Risk exposures, as well as key internal developments and external trends, ensuring that appropriate action is taken where necessary.\n\n## Decision-making authorities and delegation\n\nThe Credit RTF is the formal mechanism of delegating Credit Risk authorities cascading from the GCRO, as the Senior Manager of the Credit Risk PRT. The delegation is to individuals such as the business segments' CROs. Further delegation of credit authorities to individual credit officers may be undertaken based on risk-adjusted scales by customer type or portfolio.\n\nCredit Risk authorities are reviewed at least annually to ensure that they remain appropriate. In CCIB Client Coverage, the individuals delegating the Credit Risk authorities perform oversight by reviewing a sample of the limit applications approved by the delegated credit officers periodically. In CPBB, where credit decision systems and tools (e.g. application scorecards) are used for credit decisioning, such risk models are subject to performance monitoring and periodic validation. Where manual or discretionary credit decisions are applied, the individuals delegating the Credit Risk authorities perform periodic quality control assessments and assurance checks.",

        "page_content": "## Monitoring\n\nThe Group regularly monitors credit exposures, portfolio performance, external trends and emerging risks that may impact risk management outcomes. Internal risk management reports that are presented to risk committees contain information on key political and economic trends across major portfolios and countries, portfolio delinquency and loan impairment performance.\n\nIn CCIB Client Coverage, clients and portfolios are subject to additional review when they display signs of actual or potential weakness; for example, where there is a decline in the client's position within the industry, financial deterioration, a breach of covenants, or non-performance of an obligation within the stipulated period. Such accounts are subject to a dedicated process overseen by the Credit Issues Committee in the relevant countries where client account strategies and credit grades are re-evaluated. In addition, remedial actions, including placing accounts on early alert for increased scrutiny, exposure reduction, security enhancement or exiting the account could be undertaken. Certain accounts could also be transferred into the control management of the SAG, which is our specialist recovery unit for CCIB Client Coverage that operates independently from our main business.\n\nOn an annual basis, senior members from Business and Risk participate in a more extensive portfolio review for certain corporate industry groups. In addition to a review of the portfolio information, this enhanced review (known as the industry portfolio review) incorporates industry outlook, key elements of business strategy, RA, credit profile and emerging/horizon risks. A condensed version of these industry portfolio reviews will also be shared with the CCIB Risk Committee.\n\nAny material in-country developments that may impact sovereign ratings are monitored closely by the Country Risk Team. The Country Risk Early Warning system, a triage-based risk identification system, categorises countries based on a forward-looking view of possible downgrades and the potential incremental risk-weighted assets (RWA) impact.\n\nFor CPBB, exposures and collateral monitoring are performed at the counterparty and/or portfolio level across different client segments to ensure transactions and portfolio exposures remain within RA. Portfolio delinquency trends are also monitored. Accounts that are past due (or perceived as high risk but not yet past due) are subject to collections or recovery processes managed by a specialist independent function. In some countries, aspects of collections and recovery activities are outsourced. For discretionary lending portfolios, similar processes to those of CCIB client coverage are followed.\n\nIn addition, an independent Credit Risk Review team (part of ERM function), performs judgement-based assessments of the Credit Risk profiles at various portfolio levels. They focus on selected countries and segments through deep dives, comparative analysis, and review and challenge of the basis of credit approvals. The review ensures that the evolving Credit Risk profiles of CCIB and CPBB are well managed within RA and policies, through forward-looking mitigating actions where necessary.\n\n## Credit rating and measurement\n\nAll credit proposals are subject to a robust credit risk assessment. It includes a comprehensive evaluation of the client's credit quality, including willingness, ability, and capacity to repay. The primary lending consideration is based on the client's credit quality and the repayment capacity from operating cashflows for counterparties, and personal income or wealth for individual borrowers. The risk assessment gives due consideration to the client's liquidity and leverage position.\n\nWhere applicable, the assessment includes a detailed analysis of the Credit Risk mitigation arrangements to determine the level of reliance on such arrangements as the secondary source of repayment in the event of a significant deterioration in a client's credit quality leading to default. Client income, net worth, and the liquidity of asset by class are considered for overall risk assessment for wealth lending. The availability of Wealth Lending credit limits is subject to the availability of qualified collateral.\n\nRisk measurement plays a central role, along with judgement and experience, in informing risk-taking and portfolio management decisions. We adopt the Advanced Internal Ratings Based (AIRB) approach under the Basel regulatory framework to calculate Credit Risk capital requirements. The Group has also established a global programme to assess capital requirements necessary to be implemented to meet the latest revised Basel III finalisation (referred to as Basel 3.1 or Basel IV) regulations.\n\nA standard alphanumeric Credit Risk grade system is used for CCIB Client Coverage. The numeric grades run from 1 to 14 and some of the grades are further sub-classified. Lower numeric credit grades are indicative of a lower likelihood of default. Credit grades 1 to 12 are assigned to performing customers, while credit grades 13 and 14 are assigned to non-performing or defaulted customers.\n\nCPBB internal ratings-based portfolios use application and behavioural credit scores that are calibrated to generate a probability of default. The Risk Decision Framework uses a credit rating system to define the portfolio/new booking segmentation, shape and decision criteria for the unsecured consumer business segment.\n\nAIRB models cover a substantial majority of our exposures and are used in assessing risks at a customer and portfolio level, setting strategy, and optimising our risk-return decisions. The Model Risk Committee approves material internal ratings-based risk measurement models. Prior to review and approval, all internal ratings based models are validated in detail by an independent model validation team. Reviews are also triggered if the performance of a model deteriorates materially against predetermined thresholds during the ongoing model performance monitoring process, which takes place between the annual validations.",

        "page_content": "## Credit Concentration Risk\n\nCredit Concentration Risk may arise from a single large exposure to a counterparty or a group of connected counterparties, or from multiple exposures across the portfolio that are closely correlated. Large exposure Concentration Risk is managed through concentration limits set for a counterparty or a group of connected counterparties based on control and economic dependence criteria. RA metrics are set at portfolio level and monitored to control concentrations, where appropriate, by industry, products, tenor, collateralisation level, top clients, and exposure to holding companies. Single name credit concentration thresholds are set by client group depending on credit grade, and by customer segment. For concentrations that are material at a Group level, breaches and potential breaches are monitored by the respective governance committees and reported to the GRC and BRC.\n\n## Credit impairment\n\nECL is determined for all financial assets that are classified as amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. ECL is computed as an unbiased, probabilityweighted provision determined by evaluating a range of plausible outcomes, the time value of money, and forwardlooking information such as critical global or country-specific macroeconomic variables. For more detailed information on macroeconomic data feeding into IFRS 9 ECL calculations, please refer to the Risk profile section (pages 273 to 285).\n\nAt the time of origination or purchase of a non-credit impaired financial asset (Stage 1), ECL represents cash shortfalls arising from possible default events up to 12 months into the future from the balance sheet date. ECL continues to be determined on this basis until there is a significant increase in the Credit Risk of the asset (Stage 2), in which case ECL is recognised for default events that may occur over the lifetime of the asset. If there is observed objective evidence of credit impairment or default (Stage 3), ECL continues to be measured on a lifetime basis. To provide the Board with oversight and assurance that the quality of assets originated are aligned to the Group's strategy, there is a RA metric to monitor Stage 1 and Stage 2 ECL from assets originated in the past 12 months.\n\nFor CCIB, in line with the regulatory guidelines, Stage 3 ECL is considered when an obligor is more than 90 days past due on any amount payable to the Group, or the obligor(s) has symptoms of unlikeliness to pay its credit obligations in full as they fall due. These credit-impaired accounts are managed by SAG.\n\nIn CPBB, loans to individuals and small businesses are considered credit-impaired as soon as any payment of interest or principal is 90 days overdue or they meet other objective evidence of impairment, such as bankruptcy, debt restructuring, fraud, or death. Financial assets are written off, in the amount that is determined to be irrecoverable, when they meet conditions set such that empirical evidence suggests the client is unlikely to meet their contractual obligations, or a loss of principal is reasonably expected.\n\nEstimating the amount and timing of future recoveries involves significant judgement and considers the assessment of matters such as future economic conditions and the value of collateral, for which there may not be a readily accessible market. The total amount of the Group's impairment provision is inherently uncertain, being sensitive to changes in economic and credit conditions across the regions in which the Group operates. For further details on sensitivity analysis of ECL under IFRS 9, please refer to the Risk profile section (pages 273 to 285).",

The business, acting as first line of defence, is responsible for the effective management of risks within the scope of its direct organisational responsibilities set by the Board.\n\nTRM is the second line control function that performs independent challenge, monitoring and oversight of the Traded Risk management practices of the first line of defence, predominantly Financial Markets and Treasury Markets.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Traded RTF requires that Traded Risk limits be defined at a level appropriate to ensure that the Group remains within RA. All businesses incurring Traded Risk must comply with the Traded RTF. The Traded Risk Policy sets the principles that must be followed for the end-to-end traded risk management process, including limit setting, risk capture and measurement, limit monitoring and escalation, risk mitigation and stress testing. Policies and standards ensure that these Traded Risk limits are implemented. Policies are reviewed and approved by the Global Head, TRM periodically to ensure their ongoing effectiveness.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt Board level, the BRC oversees the effective management of Traded Risk. At the executive level, the GRC delegates responsibilities to the CCIB Risk Committee to oversee the Traded Risk profile of the Group. For subsidiaries, the authority for setting Traded Risk limits is delegated from the local board to the local risk committee, Country CRO and Traded Risk managers. Meetings are held regularly, and the committees monitor all material Traded Risk exposures, as well as key internal developments and external trends, and ensure that appropriate action is taken.\n\n## Decision-making authorities and delegation\n\nThe Traded RTF is the formal mechanism which delegates Traded Risk authorities cascading from the GCRO, as the Senior Manager of the Traded Risk Type, to the Global Head, TRM who further delegates authorities to named individuals.\n\nTraded Risk authorities are reviewed at least annually to ensure that they remain appropriate and to assess the quality of decisions taken by the authorised person. Key risk-taking decisions are made only by certain individuals with the skills, judgement, and perspective to ensure that the Group's control standards and risk-return objectives are met.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group should control its financial markets and activities to ensure that market and counterparty credit risk losses do not cause material damage to the Group's franchise.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nThe Group uses a VaR model to measure the risk of losses arising from future potential adverse movements in market rates, prices, and volatilities. VaR is a quantitative measure of Market Risk that applies recent historical market conditions to estimate the potential future loss in market value that will not be exceeded in a set time period at a set statistical confidence level. VaR provides a consistent measure that can be applied across trading businesses and products over time and can be set against actual daily trading profit and loss outcomes.\n\nFor day-to-day risk management, VaR is calculated as at the close of business, generally at UK time for expected market movements over one business day and to a confidence level of 97.5 per cent. Intra-day risk levels may vary from those reported at the end of the day.\n\nThe Group applies two VaR methodologies:\n\n- \u00b7 Historical simulation: this involves the revaluation of all existing positions to reflect the effect of historically observed changes in Market Risk factors on the valuation of the current portfolio. This approach is applied for general Market Risk factors and the majority of specific (credit spread) risk VaRs.\n- \u00b7 Monte Carlo simulation: this methodology is similar to historical simulation but with considerably more input risk factor observations. These are generated by random sampling techniques, but the results retain the essential variability and correlations of historically observed risk factor changes. This approach is applied for some of the specific (credit spread) risk VaRs in relation to idiosyncratic exposures in credit markets.\n\nA one-year historical observation period is applied in both methods.\n\nAs an input to regulatory capital, trading book VaR is calculated for expected movements over 10 business days and to a confidence level of 99 per cent. Some types of Market Risk are not captured in the regulatory VaR measure, and these Risks not in VaR are subject to capital add-ons.\n\nAn analysis of VaR results in 2023 is available in the Risk profile section (pages 286 to 289).",

PFE is a quantitative measure of Counterparty Credit Risk that applies recent historical market conditions to estimate the potential future credit exposure that will not be exceeded in a set time period at a confidence level of 97.5 per cent. PFE is calculated for expected market movements over different time horizons based on the tenor of the transactions.\n\nThe Group applies two PFE methodologies: simulation based, which is predominantly used, and an add-on based PFE methodology.\n\n## Underwriting\n\nThe underwriting of securities and loans is in scope of the RA set by the Group for Traded Risk. Additional limits approved by the GCRO are set on the sectoral concentration, and the maximum holding period. The Underwriting Committee, under the authority of the GCRO, approves individual proposals to underwrite new security issues and loans for our clients.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nTRM monitors the overall portfolio risk and ensures that it is within specified limits and therefore RA. Limits are typically reviewed twice a year. Most of the Traded Risk exposures are monitored daily against approved limits. Traded Risk limits apply at all times unless separate intra-day limits have been set. Limit excess approval decisions are based on an assessment of the circumstances driving the excess and of the proposed remediation plan. Limits and excesses can only be approved by a Traded Risk manager with the appropriate delegated authority.",

        "page_content": "## Treasury Risk\n\nThe Group defines Treasury Risk as the potential for insufficient capital, liquidity, or funding to support our operations, the risk of reductions in earnings or value from movements in interest rates impacting banking book items and the potential for losses from a shortfall in the Group's pension plans.\n\n## Roles and responsibilities\n\nThe Global Head, ERM is responsible for the RTF for Treasury Risk under the ERMF.\n\nThe Group Treasurer is supported by teams in Treasury and Finance to implement the Treasury RTF as the first line of defence and is responsible for managing Treasury Risk.\n\nAt Regional and Country level, Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) supported by Regional and Country level Finance and Treasury teams are responsible for managing Treasury Risk as the first line of defence. Regional Treasury CROs and Country CROs for Treasury Risk (except Pension Risk) and Head of Pensions (for Pension Risk) are responsible for overseeing and challenging the first line of defence.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group develops policies to address material Treasury Risks and aims to maintain its risk profile within RA. In order to do this, metrics are set against Capital Risk, Liquidity and Funding Risk and IRRBB. Where appropriate, RA metrics are cascaded down to regions and countries in the form of Limits and Management Action Triggers.\n\n## Capital Risk\n\nIn order to manage Capital Risk, strategic business, and capital plans (Corporate Plan) are drawn up covering a five-year horizon which are approved by the Board annually. The plan ensures that adequate levels of capital, including loss absorbing capacity, and an efficient mix of the different components of capital are maintained to support our strategy and business plans.\n\nTreasury is responsible for the ongoing assessment of the demand for capital and the updating of the Group's capital plan.\n\nRA metrics including capital, leverage, Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liability (MREL) and double leverage are assessed within the Corporate Plan to ensure that the strategy can be achieved within risk tolerances.\n\n## Structural Foreign Exchange (FX) Risk\n\nThe Group's structural FX position results from the Group's non-US dollar investment in the share capital and reserves of subsidiaries and branches. The FX translation gains, or losses, are recorded in the Group's translation reserves with a direct impact on the Group's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio.\n\nThe Group contracts hedges to manage its structural FX position in accordance with the RA, and as a result the Group has taken net investment hedges to partially cover its exposure to certain non-US dollar currencies to mitigate the FX impact of such positions on its capital ratios.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group should maintain sufficient capital, liquidity and funding to support its operations, and an interest rate profile ensuring that the reductions in earnings or value from movements in interest rates impacting banking book items does not cause material damage to the Group's franchise. In addition, the Group should ensure its pension plans are adequately funded.\n\n## Liquidity and Funding Risk\n\nAt Group, regional and country level we implement various business-as-usual and stress risk metrics to monitor and manage liquidity and funding risk. This ensures that the Group maintains an adequate and well-diversified liquidity buffer, as well as a stable funding base, and that it meets its liquidity and funding regulatory requirements. The approach to managing risks and the RA is assessed annually through the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process. A funding plan is also developed for efficient liquidity projections to ensure that the Group is adequately funded in the required currencies, to meet its obligations and client funding needs. The funding plan is part of the overall Corporate Plan process aligning to the capital requirements.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book\n\nThis risk arises from differences in the repricing profile, interest rate basis, and optionality of banking book assets liabilities and off-balance sheet items. IRRBB represents an economic and commercial risk to the Group and its capital adequacy. The Group monitors IRRBB against the RA.\n\n## Pension Risk\n\nPension Risk is the potential for loss due to having to meet an actuarially assessed shortfall in the Group's pension plans. Pension obligation risk to a firm arises from its contractual or other liabilities to or with respect to an occupational pension plan or other long-term benefit obligation. For a funded plan it represents the risk that additional contributions will need to be made because of a future shortfall in the funding of the plan. Or, for unfunded obligations, it represents the risk that the cost of meeting future benefit payments is greater than currently anticipated. The Pension Risk position against RA metric is reported to the GRC. This metric is calculated as the total capital requirement (including both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A capital) in respect of Pension Risk, expressed as a number of basis points of RWA.\n\n## Recovery and Resolution Planning\n\nIn line with PRA requirements, the Group maintains a Recovery Plan which is a live document to be used by management in the event of stress in order to restore the Group to a stable and sustainable position. The Recovery Plan includes a set of recovery indicators, an escalation framework, and a set of management actions capable of being implemented during a stress. A Recovery Plan is also maintained within each major entity, and all recovery plans are subject to periodic fire-drill testing.",

They ensure that key risk decisions are only taken by individuals with the requisite skills, judgement, and perspective to ensure that the Group's risk-return objectives are met.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Operational and Technology RTF sets out the Group's overall approach to the management of Operational and Technology risk in line with the Group's Operational and Technology RA. This is supported by the Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) which defines roles and responsibilities for the identification, control, and monitoring of risks (applicable to all PRTs, risk sub-types and IRTs).\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group aims to control operational and technology risks to ensure that operational losses (financial or reputational), including any related to conduct of business matters, do not cause material damage to the Group's franchise.\n\nThe RCSA is used to determine the design strength and reliability of each process, and requires:\n\n- \u00b7 the recording of processes run by client segments, products, and functions into a process universe;\n- \u00b7 the identification of potential failures in these processes and the related risks of such failures;\n- \u00b7 an assessment of the impact of the identified risks based on a consistent scale;\n- \u00b7 the design and monitoring of controls to mitigate prioritised risks; and\n- \u00b7 assessments of residual risk and timely actions for elevated risks.\n\nRisks that exceed the Group's Operational and Technology RA require treatment plans to address underlying causes.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt Board level, the BRC oversees the effective management of Operational and Technology risk. At the executive level, the GRC is responsible for the governance and oversight of Operational and Technology risk for the Group. The GRC, supported by the GNFRC, monitors the Group's Operational and Technology RA and relies on other key committees for the management of Operational and Technology risk.\n\nRegional business segments and functional committees also provide governance oversight of their respective processes and related Operational and Technology risk. In addition, Country Non-Financial Risk Committees (CNFRCs) oversee the management of Operational and Technology Risk at the country (or entity) level. In smaller countries, the responsibilities of the CNFRC may be exercised directly by the Country Risk Committee (for branches) or Executive Risk Committee (for subsidiaries).\n\n## Decision-making authorities and delegation\n\nThe GCRO has delegated the RFO responsibilities associated with the Operational and Technology RTF to the Global Head of Risk, Functions and Operational Risk (GHRFOR).\n\nThe Operational and Technology RTF is the formal mechanism through which the delegation of Operational and Technology Risk authorities is made. The GHRFOR places reliance on the respective SMEs for second line of defence oversight of the relevant Operational and Technology risk sub-types through the Operational and Technology RTF.",

The CFCC function provides second line of defence oversight and challenge of the first line of defence risk management activities that relate to Compliance Risk. Where Compliance Risk arises, or could arise, from failure to manage another PRT or sub-type, the Compliance RTF outlines that the responsibility rests with the respective RFO or control function to ensure that effective oversight and challenge of the first line of defence can be provided by the appropriate second line of defence function.\n\nEach of the assigned second line of defence functions have responsibilities, including monitoring relevant regulatory developments from Non-Financial Services regulators at both Group and country levels, policy development, implementation, and validation as well as oversight and challenge of first line of defence processes and controls. In addition, the remit of CFCC has been further clarified in 2023 in relation to Compliance risk and the boundary of responsibilities with other PRTs.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe CFCC function is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of policies, standards and controls to ensure continued legal and regulatory compliance, and the mitigation of Compliance Risk. In this, the requirements of the Operational and Technology RTF are followed to ensure a consistent approach to the management of processes and controls.\n\nThe deployment of technological solutions to improve efficiencies and simplify processes has continued in 2023. These include launch of a new Regulatory Change Management System for Group regulatory obligations management, and further enhancement of the Ask Compliance platform.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group has no appetite for breaches in laws and regulations related to regulatory noncompliance; recognising that whilst incidents are unwanted, they cannot be entirely avoided.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nBoth Compliance Risk and the risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations resulting from failed processes and controls are reported at the respective country, business, product, function, Risk and CFCC Non-Financial Risk Committees.

It emphasises business ownership and individual accountability.\n\nThe Group Chief Transformation, Technology & Operations Officer (CTTO) has the first line of defence responsibility for ICS Risk and is accountable for the Group's ICS strategy. The Group Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) leads the development and execution of the ICS strategy. The first line of defence also manages all key ICS Risks, breaches and risk treatment plans. ICS Risk profile, RA breaches and remediation status are reported at Board and Executive committees, alongside business, function and country governance committees.\n\nThe Group Chief Information Security Risk Officer (CISRO) function within Group Risk is the second line of defence and sets the framework, policy, standards, and methodology for assessing, scoring, and prioritising ICS Risks across the Group. The ICS Policy and standards are aligned to industry best practice models including the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework and ISO 27001. This function has the responsibility for governance, oversight, and independent challenge of first line of defence's pursuit of the ICS strategy. Group ICS Risk Framework Strategy remains the responsibility of the ICS RFO (RFO), delegated from the GCRO to the Group CISRO.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nICS Risk is managed through the ICS RTF, comprising a risk assessment methodology and supporting policy, standards, and methodologies. These are aligned to industry recommended practice. We undertake an annual ICS Effectiveness Review to evaluate ICS Risk management practices in alignment with the ERMF.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nThe BRC oversees the effective management of ICS Risk. The GRC has delegated authority to the GNFRC to ensure effective implementation of the ICS RTF. The GRC and GNFRC are responsible for oversight of ICS Risk profile and RA breaches. Sub-committees of the GNFRC have oversight of ICS Risk management arising from the businesses, countries and functions.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group aims to mitigate and control ICS risks to ensure that incidents do not cause the Bank material harm, business disruption, financial loss or reputational damage - recognising that whilst incidents are unwanted, they cannot be entirely avoided.\n\n## Decision-making authorities and delegation\n\nThe ICS RTF defines how the Group manages ICS Risk. The Group CISRO delegates authority to designated individuals through the ICS RTF, including at a business, function, region and country level.\n\nThe Group CISO is responsible for implementing ICS Risk Management within the Group, and to cascade ICS risk management into the businesses, functions and countries to comply with the ICS RTF, policy, and standards.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nGroup CISO performs a threat-led risk assessment to identify key threats, in-scope applications and key controls required to ensure the Group remains within RA.\n\nThe ICS Risk profiles of all businesses, functions and countries are consolidated to present a holistic Group-level ICS Risk profile for ongoing monitoring. Mandatory ICS learning, phishing exercises and role-specific training support colleagues to monitor and manage this risk.\n\nDuring these reviews, the status of each risk is assessed against the Group's controls to identify any changes to impact and likelihood, which affects the overall risk rating.\n\nGroup CISO and Group CISRO monitor the ICS Risk profile and ensure that breaches of RA are escalated to the appropriate governance committee or authority levels for remediation and tracking. A dedicated Group CISRO team supports this work by executing offensive security testing exercises, including vulnerability assessments and penetration tests, which show a wider picture of the Group's risk profile, leading to better visibility on potential 'in flight' risks. The Group also tracks remediation of security matters identified by external reviews such as the  BoE CBEST Threat Intelligence-Led Assessment and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) Intelligence-led Cyber Attack Simulation Testing (iCAST).",

A dedicated Sustainable Finance solutions team is responsible for sustainable finance products and frameworks to help identify green and sustainable finance, and transition finance opportunities to aid our clients on their sustainability journey. The CSO team works with businesses to launch various sustainable finance products. Furthermore, the Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) team provides dedicated advisory and challenge to businesses on the management of environmental and social risks and impacts arising from the Group's client relationships and transactions.\n\nIn the second line of defence, the responsibility for Reputational and Sustainability Risk management is delegated to the Group Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) and Reputational Risk team, as well as CROs at region, country and client-business levels. They constitute the second line responsible to oversee and challenge the first line, which resides with the CEOs, business heads, product heads and function heads. The Group ESG and Reputational Risk team is responsible for establishing RA, framework and policies for managing Reputational and Sustainability risk, in line with emerging regulatory expectations across our markets.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nIn line with the principles of Responsible Business Conduct and Do No Significant Harm, the Group deems Reputational and Sustainability Risk to be driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 negative shifts in stakeholder perceptions, including shifts as a result of greenwashing claims, due to decisions related to clients, products, transactions, third parties and strategic coverage;\n- \u00b7 potential material harm or degradation to the natural environment (environmental) through actions/inactions of the Group; and\n- \u00b7 potential material harm to individuals or communities (social) risks through actions/inactions of the Group.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group aims to protect the franchise from material damage to its reputation by ensuring that any business activity is satisfactorily assessed and managed with the appropriate level of management and governance oversight. This includes a potential failure to uphold responsible business conduct in striving to do no significant environmental and social harm.\n\nThe Group's Reputational Risk policy sets out the principal sources of Reputational Risk driven by negative shifts in stakeholder perceptions as well as responsibilities, control and oversight standards for identifying, assessing, escalating and effectively managing Reputational Risk. The assessment of risks associated with how individual client, transaction, product and strategic coverage decisions may affect perceptions of the organisation and its activities is based on explicit principles including, but not limited to, human rights and climate change. The assessment of stakeholder perception risk considers a variety of factors. Whenever potential for stakeholder concerns is identified, issues are subject to review and decision by both first and second lines of defence.\n\nThe Group's Sustainability Risk policy sets out the requirements and responsibilities for managing environmental and social risks for the Group's clients, third parties and in our own operations. This includes management of greenwashing risks through the ongoing monitoring of Sustainable Finance products and transactions and clients throughout their lifecycle, from labelling to disclosures in line with emerging local and international regulatory obligations.\n\n- \u00b7 Clients are expected to adhere to the minimum regulatory and compliance requirements, including criteria from the Group's Position Statements to sensitive sectors where environmental and social risks are heightened. The Group also defines the approach to certain specialist sectors where there are conflicting stakeholder views.\n- \u00b7 Third parties such as suppliers must comply with the Group's Supplier Charter, which sets out the Group's expectations on ethics, anti-bribery and corruption, human rights, environmental, health and safety standards, labour and protection of the environment. The Group is committed to respecting universal human rights, and we assess our clients and suppliers against various international principles, as well as through our social safeguards.\n- \u00b7 Within our operations, the Group seeks to minimise its impact on the environment and have targets to reduce energy, water and waste. We are committed to becoming Net Zero in our own operations by 2025.\n- \u00b7 We rely on our frameworks to help the labelling of Sustainable Finance Use of Proceeds products and transactions as well as the classification of pureplay clients.\n\nReputational and Sustainability Risk policies and standards are applicable to all Group entities. However, where local regulators impose additional requirements, these are complied with in addition to existing Group requirements.",

These frameworks set out the guidelines for approval of products and transactions which carry the sustainable finance and/or transition finance label;\n- \u00b7 Decision-making authority on the eligibility of a sustainable asset for any RWA relief;\n- \u00b7 Approving sustainable finance and transition finance labels for products in addition to regular product management and governance;\n- \u00b7 Reviewing the reputational risks arising from greenwashing claims related to Sustainable Finance products and services.\n\nThe GNFRC has oversight of the control environment and effective management of Reputational Risk incurred when there are negative shifts in stakeholder perceptions of the Group due to failure of other PRTs. The regional and client-business risk committees provide oversight on the Reputational and Sustainability Risk profile within their remit. The CNFRC provides oversight of the Reputational and Sustainability Risk profile at a country level.\n\n## Decision-making authorities and delegation\n\nThe Global Head, ERM delegates risk acceptance authorities for stakeholder perception risks to designated individuals in the first line and second line or to committees such as the GRRRC via risk authority matrices.\n\nThese risk authority matrices are tiered at country, regional, business segment or Group levels and are established for risks incurred in strategic coverage, clients, products, or transactions. For environmental and social risks, the ESRM team reviews and supports the risk assessments for clients and transactions and escalates to the Group ESG and Reputational Risk team as required.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nExposure to stakeholder perception risks arising from transactions, clients, products and strategic coverage is monitored through established triggers to prompt the right levels of appropriate risk-based consideration and assessment by the first line and escalations to the second line where necessary. Risk acceptance decisions and thematic trends are also reviewed on a periodic basis.\n\nExposure to Sustainability Risk is monitored through triggers embedded within the first line of defence processes. The Environmental and Social Risks are considered for clients and transactions via the environmental and social risk assessments and for vendors in our supply chain through the Modern Slavery questionnaires.\n\nFurthermore, monitoring and reporting on the RA metrics ensures that there is appropriate oversight by the MT and Board over performance and breaches of thresholds across key metrics.",

Responsibility for the oversight and implementation of the Model RTF is delegated to the Global Head, Model Risk Management.\n\nThe Model RTF sets out clear accountability and roles for Model Risk management through the three lines of defence model. First line of defence ownership of Model Risk resides with Model Sponsors, who are business or function heads and assign a Model Owner and provide oversight of Model Owner activities. Model Owners are accountable for the model development process, represent model users, are responsible for the overall model design process, coordinate the submission of models for validation and approval, and ensure appropriate implementation and use. Model Developers are responsible for the development of models and are responsible for documenting and testing the model in accordance with Policy requirements, and for engaging with Model Users.\n\nSecond line of defence oversight is provided by Model Risk Management, which comprises Group Model Validation (GMV) to independently review and grade models, and the Model Risk Policy and Governance team, which provides oversight of model risk activities and reports to senior management via respective committees.\n\nThe Group adopts an industry standard model definition as specified in the Group Model Risk Policy, together with a scope of applicability represented by defined model family types as detailed within the Model Risk Framework. Model Owners are accountable for ensuring that all models under their purview have been independently validated by GMV. Models are validated before use and then on an ongoing basis, with schedule determined by the perceived level of model risk associated with the model, or more frequently if there are specific regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Model Risk Framework is cascaded to in-scope countries by way of local addendum or local framework documentation, along with specific responsibilities of the Country Model RFO. In-scope countries are selected with reference to regulatory capital requirements with credit risk (AIRB), counterparty credit risk Internal Model Method (IMM), or market risk Internal Model Approach (IMA) permissions for use of models for regulatory capital calculations; and countries where regulators have stipulated specific model risk requirements. Additional criteria, including financial materiality, regulatory importance, presence of important business services or critical economic functions are also considered.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group has no appetite for material adverse implications arising from misuse of models or errors in the development or implementation of models; whilst accepting some model uncertainty.\n\nThe main responsibilities of Country Model RFO are to ensure model usage is correctly identified, a suitable local governance process is established, and fundamental model risk training is provided for respective country stakeholders.\n\nBased on respective levels of regulatory expectations regarding Model Risk, a tiering approach is adopted to provide appropriate risk-based levels of depth and rigour of the associated requirements.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Model Risk policy and standards define requirements for model development and validation activities, including regular model performance monitoring. Any model issues or deficiencies identified through the validation process are mitigated through model monitoring, model overlays and/or a model redevelopment plan, which undergoes robust review, challenge, and approval. Operational controls govern all Model Risk-related processes, with regular risk assessments performed to assess appropriateness and effectiveness of those controls, in line with the Operational and Technology RTF, with remediation plans implemented where necessary.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt Board level, the BRC exercises oversight of Model Risk within the Group. At the executive level, the GRC has appointed the Model Risk Committee to ensure effective measurement and management of Model Risk. Sub-committees such as the Credit Model Assessment Committee, Traded Risk Model Assessment Committee and Financial Crime Compliance Model Assessment Committee oversee their respective in-scope models and escalate material Model Risks to the Model Risk Committee. In parallel, business and function-level risk committees provide governance oversight of the models used in their respective processes.\n\n## Decision-making authorities and delegation\n\nThe Model RTF is the formal mechanism through which the delegation of Model Risk authorities is made.\n\nThe Global Head, ERM delegates authorities to designated individuals or Policy Owners through the Model RTF. The second line of defence ownership for Model Risk at country level is delegated to Country CROs at the applicable branches and subsidiaries.\n\nThe Model Risk Committee is responsible for approving models for use.

Climate Risk is defined as the potential for financial loss and non-financial detriments arising from climate change and society's response to it. We are developing methodologies to identify, measure and manage the physical and transition risks that we are exposed to through our own operations, our suppliers, our clients, and the markets we operate in.\n\n## Roles and responsibilities\n\nThe GCRO has the ultimate second line of defence and responsibility for Climate Risk, with support by the Global Head, ERM who has day-today oversight and central responsibility for second line of defence Climate Risk activities. As Climate Risk is embedded into the relevant PRTs, second line of defence responsibilities lie with those RFOs (at Group, regional and country level), with SME support from the central Climate Risk team.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe have completed c.4,100 Climate Risk Assessments (CRAs) in 2023 (c.85 - 90 per cent of the CCIB corporate portfolio limits), which measures transition risk of our clients. Concentration of Black and Red rated clients remain within proposed RA levels at 6 per cent. Linkages to Credit Underwriting Principles have been finalised for four sectors (Oil and Gas (O&G), Shipping, Commercial Real Estate (CRE) and Mining), including improved climate-related analysis, portfolio-level caps and additional data gathering measures. A key focus area going forward is to embed Climate Risk and net zero targets into business and credit decisions. To enable this, we have established a Net Zero Climate Risk Working Forum to facilitate discussions on account plans for high Climate Risk and net zero divergent clients. As of September 2023, we have assessed physical risk for 79 per cent and transition risk for 54 per cent of our CPBB book.\n\nThe focus for Operational and Technology Risk has been to assess physical risks for our properties and data centres, as well as third parties. Concentration of top corporate liquidity providers to high transition risk and low levels of mitigation is being monitored.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nBoard level oversight is exercised through the BRC, with regular updates on Climate Risk. At an executive level, the GRC has appointed the Climate Risk Management Committee (CRMC), which meets at least six times a year to oversee the implementation of Climate Risk workplans and monitoring the Group's Climate Risk profile.\n\nIn 2023, we have strengthened country and regional governance oversight for the Climate Risk profile across our key markets by cascading identified RA metrics, and rolling out climate risk management information.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group aims to measure and manage financial and non-financial risks arising from climate change, and reduce emissions related to our own activities and those related to the financing of clients in alignment with the Paris Agreement.\n\n## Decision-making authorities and delegation\n\nThe Global Head, ERM is supported by a Climate Risk team within the ERM function. The Global Head, ESG and Reputational Risk is responsible for executing the delivery of the Climate Risk workplan which will define decisionmaking authorities and delegations across the Group.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe Climate RA Statement is approved and reviewed annually by the Board, following the recommendation of the BRC.\n\nThe Group has developed its first-generation Climate Risk reporting and Board/MT Level RA metrics and these will continue to be enhanced in 2024. Management information and RA metrics are also being progressively rolled out at the regional and country level. Management information is reviewed at a quarterly frequency and any breaches in RA are reported to the GRC and BRC.",

        "page_content": "## Digital Assets Risk\n\nWith effect from January 2024, the Group has removed the IRT classification. The Group recognises Digital Assets (DA) as an asset class which is managed under the ERMF. DA Risk is defined as the potential for regulatory penalties, financial loss and/or reputational damage to the Group resulting from DA-related activities arising from the Group's businesses across clients, products, investments and projects.\n\n## Roles and responsibilities\n\nSenior managers within the first line of defence are responsible for the overall management of DA risks, initiatives and exposures that may arise within their business segments.\n\nThe GCRO has the second line of defence responsibility for defining the Group's framework for managing DA-related risks, through the Digital Assets Risk Management Approach (DARMA). The GCRO is supported by the Global Head, ERM and the Global Head, DA Risk Management, who have day-to-day responsibility for second line of defence oversight of the DARMA. As DA Risk management is embedded into the relevant PRTs, RFOs and dedicated SMEs across the PRTs have second line of defence responsibilities of DA Risks for their respective PRTs.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group deploys a DA Risk management policy (DA Policy) to define the incremental risk management requirements for DA-related activities under the DARMA. The respective PRTs then include specific risk mitigation requirements within the relevant processes, policies and standards for their PRTs. DA Risk Assessments are conducted on certain higher-risk DA-related projects and products. These risk assessments detail the specific inherent risks, residual risks, controls and mitigants across the PRTs, and are reviewed and supported by the respective businesses, RFOs and DA SMEs.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nBoard level oversight is exercised through the BRC, and DA Risk updates are provided to the Board and BRC, as requested. At the executive level, the GRC oversees the risk management of DA. The GCRO has also appointed a dedicated DA Risk Committee (DRC) consisting of senior business representatives, RFOs and DA SMEs across the Group. The DRC meets a minimum of four times per year to review and assess the risk assessments related to DA Projects and Products, discuss development and implementation of the DARMA, and to provide structured governance around DA Risk.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nAs DA Risk manifests through the various PRTs, the individual RA statements for each PRT take account of the risks specific to DAs.\n\n## Decision-making authorities and delegation\n\nThe Global Head, ERM is supported by a centralised DA Risk team within the ERM Function and is responsible for the design and maintenance of the DARMA. Decisionmaking authorities and delegation are defined in the DA Policy, outlining the incremental responsibilities and the embedding of risk management within associated policies and risk artefacts.\n\nThe businesses are responsible for implementation of the DARMA and respective business governance forums, PRT RFOs and DA SMEs utilise decision-making authorities granted to them by their respective businesses, PRTs or in individual capacities to assess and approve DA activities and exposures that may give rise to risk.\n\nDA Risk follows prescribed robust risk management practices across the PRTs, with specific expertise applied from DA experts. Risk management practices are informed by the 'Dear CEO' letters published by the PRA and the FCA in June 2018, with updated notices in June 2022. Further guidance from the recent publication of the BCBS d545 on the prudential treatment of crypto assets, which will be in effect from January 2025, has refined the risk management approach. DA is a developing area which will continue to mature and stabilise over time as the technology, together with its use in financial services and associated research, become more established.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nDA Risks are monitored through the existing Group RA metrics across the PRTs. In addition, specific DA Risk Management Monitoring level metrics are reviewed and monitored by the relevant individual PRTs. DA risk decisions relating to other PRTs are taken within the authorities for the respective PRT.",

The Group is well capitalised with low leverage and high levels of loss-absorbing capacity.\n\n|                                     | 2023    | 2022    |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| CET1 capital                        | 14.1%   | 14.0%   |\n| Tier 1 capital                      | 16.3%   | 16.6%   |\n| Total capital                       | 21.2%   | 21.7%   |\n| Leverage ratio                      | 4.7%    | 4.8%    |\n| MREL ratio                          | 33.3%   | 32.1%   |\n| Risk-weighted assets (RWA) $million | 244,151 | 244,711 |\n\nThe Group's capital, leverage and MREL positions were all above current requirements and Board-approved risk appetite. For further detail see the Capital section in the Standard Chartered PLC Pillar 3 Disclosures for FY 2023. The Group's CET1 capital increased 10 basis points to 14.1 percent of RWA since FY2022. Profits, gains from the aviation leasing sale, movements in FVOCI and RWA optimisations were partly offset by distributions (including ordinary share buybacks of $2.0 billion during the year), impairments of the Group's investment in Bohai, lower FX translation reserves and an increase in regulatory deductions.\n\nThe PRA updated the Group's Pillar 2A requirement during Q4 2023. As at 31 December 2023 the Group's Pillar 2A was 3.8 percent of RWA, of which at least 2.1 per cent must be held in CET1 capital. The Group's minimum CET1 capital requirement was 10.5 per cent at 31 December 2023. The UK countercyclical buffer increased to 2.0 per cent which impacts Group CET1 minimum requirement by approximately 8 basis points from July 2023.\n\nThe Group CET1 capital ratio at 31 December 2023 reflects the share buy-backs of $2 billion completed during the year. The CET1 capital ratio also includes an accrual for the FY 2023 dividend. The Board has recommended a final dividend for FY 2023 of $560 million or 21 cents per share resulting in a full year 2023 dividend of 27 cents per share, a 50 percent increase on the 2022 dividend. In addition, the Board has announced a further share buy-back of $1 billion, the impact of this will reduce the Group's CET1 capital by around 40 basis points in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe Group expects to manage CET1 capital dynamically within our 13-14 per cent target range, in support of our aim of delivering future sustainable shareholder distributions.\n\nThe Group's MREL requirement as at 31 December 2023 was 27.4 per cent of RWA. This is composed of a minimum requirement of 23.5 per cent of RWA and the Group's combined buffer (comprising the capital conservation buffer, the G-SII buffer and the countercyclical buffer). The Group's MREL ratio was 33.3 per cent of RWA and 9.6 per cent of leverage exposure at 31 December 2023.\n\nDuring 2023, the Group successfully raised $8.1 billion of MREL eligible securities from its holding company, Standard Chartered PLC. Issuance was entirely in callable senior debt.\n\nThe Group is a G-SII, with a 1.0 per cent G-SII CET1 capital buffer. The Standard Chartered PLC G-SII disclosure is published at: sc.com/en/investors/financial-results.",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the Group and the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nThe non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Company and we remain independent of the Group and the Company in conducting the audit.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u00b7 Performing a risk assessment to identify factors that could impact the going concern basis of accounting, including the impact of external risks such as geopolitical risk.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the directors' going concern assessment including the Group's forecast capital, liquidity, and leverage ratios over the period of twelve months from 23 February 2024 to evaluate the headroom against the minimum regulatory requirements and the risk appetite set by the directors.\n- \u00b7 Engaging internal valuation and economic specialists to assess and challenge the reasonableness of assumptions used to develop the forecasts in the Corporate Plan and evaluating the accuracy of historical forecasting.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the Group's funding plan and repayment plan for funding instruments maturing over the period of twelve months from 23 February 2024.\n- \u00b7 Understanding and evaluating credit rating agency ratings and actions.\n- \u00b7 Engaging internal prudential regulatory specialists to assess the results of management's stress testing, including consideration of principal and emerging risks, on funding, liquidity, and regulatory capital.\n- \u00b7 Reviewing correspondence with prudential regulators and authorities for matters that may impact the going concern assessment; and\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the going concern disclosure included in note 1 to the financial statements in order to assess that the disclosures were appropriate and in conformity with the reporting standards.",

Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We took into account the size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of control environment, changes in the business environment and other factors such as the level of issues and misstatements noted in prior period when assessing the level of work to be performed at each component.\n\nIn assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 346 reporting units of the Group, we selected 66 reporting units which represent 27 components in 21 countries: Bahrain, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Jersey, Kenya, Mainland China, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Republic of Ireland, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States of America, and Zambia.\n\nThe definition of a component is aligned with the structure of the Group's consolidation system, typically these are either a branch, group of branches, group of subsidiaries (or associates), or a subsidiary.\n\nWe took a centralised approach to auditing certain processes and controls, as well as the substantive testing of specific balances. This included audit work over Group's Global Business Services shared services centre (SSC), Commercial, Corporate and Institutional Banking SSC, Credit Impairment SSC and Technology, as well as certain other matters audited centrally by the Primary Audit Team.\n\nOf the 27 components selected in 21 countries, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of 10 components ('full scope components') which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For 14 components ('specific scope components') we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the Group financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile. We also instructed 3 locations to perform specified procedures over certain aspects of credit impairment risk.\n\n|                           | Group's Absoulute PBT   | Group's Absoulute PBT   | Group's Total assets   | Group's Total assets   | Group's Absolute Operating Income   | Group's Absolute Operating Income   |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                           | 2023                    | 2022                    | 2023                   | 2022                   | 2023                                | 2022                                |\n| Full scope components     | 62%                     | 72%                     | 87%                    | 87%                    | 72%                                 | 79%                                 |\n| Specific scope components | 15%                     | 10%                     | 7%                     | 8%                     | 14%                                 | 10%                                 |\n| Specified procedures      | 1%                      | 0%                      | 0.10%                  | 0%                     | 1%                                  | 0%                                  |\n| Total                     | 78%                     | 82%                     | 94%                    | 95%                    | 87%                                 | 89%                                 |\n\nOf the remaining reporting units that together represent 22% of the Group's absolute PBT, none are individually greater than 2.3% of the Group's absolute PBT. For the components represented by these reporting units, we performed other procedures at the Group level which included: performing analytical reviews at the Group financial statement line item level, evaluating entity level controls, performing audit procedures on the centralised shared service centres, testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations, inquiring with selected overseas EY teams on the outcome of prior year local statutory audits (where audited by EY) to identify any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.\n\nF",

We also kept our audit scope under review throughout the year.\n\nThree components in Cameroon, Republic of Ireland, and South Africa, which were included in prior year audit scope and assigned specific scope, were excluded from the Group audit scope in the current year based on our updated risk assessment. These components represent individually no more than 0.1% of Group absolute PBT, 0.4% of the Group's absolute operating income and 0.3% of the Group's Total assets respectively in the current year. No component which was full scope in the prior year, has been excluded from Group audit scope for the 2023 audit.\n\nFor Germany, Australia, Ghana and Cameroon, the Primary Audit Team performed certain procedures centrally over the cash balances as at 31 December 2023. Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan and Kenya were full scope components in the prior year but were designated as specific scope components in the current year based on our updated risk assessment.\n\nIn 2023, we assigned a specific scope to Bahrain and United Kingdom (Jersey) components that are significant based on risk, and specified procedures to Taiwan (Taipei Branch). These components were not in-scope in the prior year.\n\n## Involvement with component teams\n\nIn establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team (the 'Primary Audit Team'), or by component auditors from other firms operating under our instruction. All of the direct components of the Group (full, specific or specified procedures) were audited by EY global network firms. There were two non-EY component teams auditing a single component in a single location, which were instructed by a direct component of the Group.\n\nOf the 10 full scope components, audit procedures were performed on 3 of these (including the audit of the Company) directly by the Primary Audit Team (EY London) in the United Kingdom. For 1 specific scope component, the audit procedures were performed by the Primary Audit Team. Where components were audited by the Primary Audit Team, this was under the direction and supervision of the Senior Statutory Auditor. For the 23 remaining components, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.\n\nIn addition to the above, the Primary Audit Team also performed full-scope audit procedures on components related to the Group consolidation process.\n\nIn addition, the Group has centralised processes and controls over key areas in its shared service centres. Members of the Primary Audit Team undertook direct oversight, review and coordination of our shared service centre audits.\n\nThe Primary Audit Team continued to follow a programme of planned visits to component teams and shared service centres. During the current year's audit cycle, visits were undertaken by the Primary Audit Team to the component teams in the following locations:\n\n- \u00b7 Bangladesh\n- \u00b7 Hong Kong\n- \u00b7 India (including the shared services centre)\n- \u00b7 Indonesia\n- \u00b7 Mainland China\n- \u00b7 Malaysia (including the shared services centre)\n- \u00b7 Pakistan\n- \u00b7 Republic of Korea\n- \u00b7 Singapore (including the shared services centre)\n- \u00b7 United Arab Emirates\n- \u00b7 United States of America\n\nThese visits typically involved oversight of work undertaken at those locations, discussion of the audit approach and any issues arising from their work, meeting with local management, and reviewing relevant audit working papers on key risk areas.",

These virtual meetings involved discussing the audit approach and any issues arising from their work, as well as performing remote reviews of key audit workpapers.\n\nThis, together with the procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group and Company financial statements.\n\n## Climate change\n\nStakeholders are increasingly interested in how climate change will impact the economy, including the banking sector, and further how this may consequently impact the valuation of assets and liabilities held on bank balance sheets. The Group manages climate risk according to the characteristics of the impacted risk types and is embedding climate-risk considerations into relevant frameworks, including principal risk type frameworks, and processes. The assessment of the risk by the Group is explained on pages 336 and 298-313 in the 'Risk review: Climate Risk' section, and on pages 90-133 in the 'Sustainability review' section of the Annual Report, where the Group has also explained their climate commitments.\n\nAll of these disclosures form part of the 'Other information,' rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated, in line with our responsibilities on 'Other information'.\n\nIn planning and performing our audit we assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the Group's business and any consequential material impact on its financial statements.\n\nThe Group has explained in the 'Sustainability review' section of the Annual Report how they have reflected the impact of climate change in their financial statements, including how this aligns with their commitment to the aspirations of the Paris Agreement to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Significant judgements and estimates relating to climate change are included in the section 'Climate impact on the Group's balance sheet' of note 1 to the financial statements. As stated in these disclosures, the Group has considered Climate to be an area of significant accounting estimate and judgement through the uncertainty of future events and the impact of that uncertainty on the Group's assets and liabilities. The Group has concluded that whilst it is not currently quantitatively material, it considers climate to be qualitatively material.\n\nOur audit effort in considering the impact of climate change on the financial statements was focused on evaluating whether management's assessment of the impact of climate risk, physical and transition, their climate commitments, and the significant judgements and estimates disclosed in note 1 have been appropriately reflected in the valuation of assets and liabilities, where these can be reliably measured, following the currently effective requirements of UK adopted IAS and EU IFRS. This was in the context of the Group's process being limited, given that this is an emerging area, as a result of limitations in the data available and the availability of sophisticated models, and as the Group considers how it further embeds its climate ambitions into the planning process.\n\nAs part of this evaluation, we performed our own risk assessment, supported by our climate change internal specialists, to determine the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements from climate change which needed to be considered in our audit.\n\nWe also challenged the Directors' considerations of climate change risks in their assessment of going concern and viability, and the associated disclosures. Where considerations of climate change were relevant to our assessment of going concern, these are covered by the procedures described above.\n\nBased on our work, we have considered the impact of climate change on the financial statements to impact certain key audit matters. Details of our procedures and findings are included in our explanation of key audit matters below.\n\nF",

These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nKey observations communicated\n\n| Risk  1.

        "page_content": "## Our application of materiality\n\nWe apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Group to be $274 million (2022: $234 million), which is 5% (2022: 5%) of adjusted PBT. This reflects actual PBT adjusted for non-recurring items relating to restructuring and the impairment of China Bohai Bank. We believe that adjusted PBT provides us with most appropriate measure for the users of the financial statements, given the Group is profit making, it is consistent with the wider industry, it is the standard for listed and regulated entities and we believe it reflects the most relevant measure for users of the financial statements. We also believe that the adjustments are appropriate as they relate to material non-recurring items.\n\nDuring our audit, we performed a reassessment of our initial materiality. This assessment resulted in higher final materiality calculated based on the actual financial performance of the Group for the year. There were no changes to the basis for materiality calculation from the planning stage.\n\n## Starting basis\n\n- \u00b7  Reported profit before tax - $5,093m\n\n## Adjustments\n\n- \u00b7  Add China Bohai Bank Impairment - $850m\n- \u00b7  Deduct Other restructuring - $460m\n\n## Materiality\n\n- \u00b7  Totals $5,483m Adjusted PBT\n- \u00b7  Materiality of $274m (5% of Adjusted PBT)\n\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be $247 million (2022: $210 million), which is 0.5% (2022: 0.4%) of the equity of the Parent Company. We believe that equity provides us with the most appropriate measure for the users of the Parent Company's financial statements, given that the Parent Company is primarily a holding company.\n\n## Performance materiality\n\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessment, together with our evaluation of the Group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 50% (2022: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely $137m (2022: $117m). We have set performance materiality at this percentage based on a variety of risk assessment factors such as the expectation of misstatements, internal control environment considerations and other factors such as the global complexity of the Group.\n\nAudit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was $11.4 million to $26.2 million (2022: $8.8 million to $34.1 million).\n\n## Reporting threshold\n\nAn amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of $14 million (2022: $11 million), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report and Accounts, including: the Strategic Report, Sustainability Review, Directors' Report (other than those sections of the Directors Remuneration Report marked as audited), Risk Review and Capital Review (other than those sections marked as audited) and Supplementary Information, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.",

        "page_content": "However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the Company and management.\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant are those that relate to the reporting framework (UK-adopted IAS and EU IFRS, the Companies Act 2006 and the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Listing Rules, the Main Board Listing Rules of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange), regulations and supervisory requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), FRC, FCA and other overseas regulatory requirements, including but not limited to regulations in its major markets such as Mainland China, Hong Kong, India, Republic of Korea, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, the United State of America, and the relevant tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. In addition, we concluded that there are certain significant laws and regulations that may have an effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and those laws and regulations relating to regulatory capital and liquidity, conduct, financial crime including anti-money laundering, sanctions and market abuse recognising the financial and regulated nature of the Group's activities.\n- \u00b7 We understood how the Group is complying with those frameworks by performing a combination of inquiries of senior management and those charged with governance as required by auditing standards, review of board and certain committee meeting minutes, gaining an understanding of the Group's approach to governance, inspection of regulatory correspondence in the year and engaging with internal and external legal counsel. We also engaged EY financial crime and forensics specialists to perform procedures on areas relating to anti-money laundering, whistleblowing, and sanctions compliance. Through these procedures, we became aware of actual or suspected non-compliance. The identified actual or suspected non-compliance was not sufficiently significant to our audit that it would have resulted in it being identified as a key audit matter.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the susceptibility of the Group's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by considering the controls that the Group has established to address risks identified by the entity, or that otherwise seek to prevent, deter or detect fraud. Our procedures to address the risks identified also included incorporation of unpredictability into the nature, timing and/or extent of our testing, challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates and journal entry testing.\n- \u00b7 Based on this understanding, we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved inquiries of the Group's internal and external legal counsel, money laundering reporting officer, internal audit, certain senior management executives and focused testing on a sample basis, including journal entry testing. We also performed inspection of key regulatory correspondence from the principal regulatory authorities as well as review of board and committee minutes.\n\n- \u00b7 For instances of actual or suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations, which have a material impact on the financial statements, these were communicated by management to the Group audit engagement team and component teams (where applicable) who performed audit procedures such as inquiries with management, sending confirmations to external legal counsel, substantive testing and meeting with regulators. Where appropriate, we involved specialists from our firm to support the audit team.\n- \u00b7 The Group is authorised to provide banking, insurance, mortgages and home finance, consumer credit, pensions, investments and other activities. The Group operates in the banking industry which is a highly regulated environment. As such, the Senior Statutory Auditor considered the experience and expertise of the Group audit engagement team, the component teams and the shared service centre teams to ensure that the team had the appropriate competence and capabilities, which included the use of specialists where appropriate.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/ auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Other matters we are required to address\n\n- \u00b7 Following the recommendation from the Audit Committee, we were re-appointed by the Company at the Annual General Meeting on 3 May 2023 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2023 and subsequent financial periods.\n- \u00b7 The period of total uninterrupted engagement is four years, covering the years ended 31 December 2020 to 31 December 2023.\n- \u00b7 The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## David Canning-Jones (Senior statutory auditor)\n\nfor and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP, Statutory Auditor\n\nLondon\n\n23 February 2024",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\n## 1. Accounting policies\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe Group financial statements consolidate Standard Chartered PLC (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) and equity account the Group's interests in associates and jointly controlled entities. The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity.\n\nThe Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU IFRS). The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards as applied in conformity with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThere are no significant differences between UK-adopted international accounting standards and EU IFRS.\n\nThe following parts of the Risk review and Capital review form part of these financial statements:\n\na) Risk review: Disclosures marked as 'audited' from the start of the Credit Risk section (page 234) to the end of Other principal risks in the same section (page 297).\n\nb) Capital review: Tables marked as 'audited' from the start of 'CRD Capital base' to the end of 'Movement in total capital', excluding 'Total risk-weighted assets' (page 339 to 340).\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of cash-settled share-based payments, fair value through other comprehensive income, and financial assets and liabilities (including derivatives) at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars ($), being the presentation currency of the Group and functional currency of the Company, and all values are rounded to the nearest million dollars, except when otherwise indicated.\n\n## Significant and other accounting estimates and judgement\n\nIn determining the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the Group makes assumptions of the effects of uncertain future events on those assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. The Group's estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and expectation of future events and are reviewed periodically. Further information about key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty and judgement, are set out in the relevant disclosure notes for the areas set out under the relevant headings below:\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and critical judgements\n\nSignificant accounting estimates and judgements represent those items which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next year. Significant accounting estimates and judgements are:\n\n- \u00b7 Expected credit loss calculations (Note 8)\n- \u00b7 Financial instruments measured at fair value (Note 13)\n- \u00b7 Investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates - China Bohai associate accounting and impairment analysis (Note 32)\n\n## Other areas of accounting estimate and judgement\n\nOther areas of accounting estimate and judgement do not meet the definition under IAS 1 of significant accounting estimates or critical accounting judgements, but the recognition of certain material assets and liabilities are based on assumptions and/or are subject to long-term uncertainties. The other areas of accounting estimate and judgement are:\n\n- \u00b7 Taxation (Note 10)\n- \u00b7 Goodwill impairment (Note 17)\n- \u00b7 Retirement benefit obligations (Note 30)\n- \u00b7 Share-based payments (Note 31)\n\n## Climate impact on the Group's balance sheet\n\nClimate, and the impact of climate on the Group's balance sheet is considered as an area of significant accounting estimate and judgment through the uncertainty of future events and the impact of that uncertainty on the Group's assets and liabilities. It is noted that although not currently quantitatively material, the Group considers climate to be qualitatively material to the Group.\n\nThe Group has assessed the impact of climate risk on the financial report. This is set out within the Sustainability Review chapter which incorporates the Group's Climaterelated Financial Disclosures which align with the recommendations from the Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Further risk disclosure has been provided in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section of the Annual Report where the Group has described how it manages climate risk as an Integrated Risk Type.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Accounting policies continued\n\nThe areas of impact where judgements and the use of estimates have been applied were credit risk and the impact on lending portfolios; ESG features within issued loans and bonds; physical risk on our mortgage lending portfolio; and, the corporate plan, in respect of which forward looking cash flows impact the recoverability of certain assets, including of goodwill, deferred tax assets and investments in subsidiary undertakings.\n\nThis assessment on the corporate loan portfolio was undertaken by considering the maturity profile of the loan portfolio which is majority shorter term. Transition risk, as our clients move to lower carbon emitting revenues, (either by virtue of legislation or changing end customer preference) is considered with reference to client transition pathways and manifests over a longer term than the maturity of the loan book (up to 2050). The setting of net zero targets for our high carbon sectors, which as of this annual report covers 11 of the 12 high carbon sectors as mandated by the Net Zero Banking Alliance, manages transition risk. Net zero targets enable the portfolio managers to work with our clients on their transition, deploy capital to those clients which are engaged and have adequate transition pathways, and exit clients that refuse to work with the Group on moving from a high carbon present to a low carbon future. All of these actions manage the Group's transition risk and engage clients before transition risk manifests itself into credit losses.\n\nPhysical risk is already included within the majority of our mortgage lending decisions, and we have applied scenario analysis against the pathways of different temperature additions and country policy scenarios. We also assess the impact of climate risk on the classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9, when Environmental, Sustainability or Governance (ESG) triggers may affect the cash flows received by the Group under the contractual terms of the instrument.\n\nThe Group Climate Risk team have performed a quantitative assessment of the impact of climate risk on the IFRS 9 ECL provision. This assessment has been performed across both the CCIB and CPBB portfolios. The Climate risk impact assessment on IFRS 9 business as usual ECL has been conducted based on newly developed internal climate risk models for four Corporate sectors (Oil and Gas, Power, Steel and Mining) and Sovereigns, whilst the top-down approach developed in 2022 was used for the remaining portfolios. The impact assessment resulted in a marginal ECL increase across CCIB and CPBB, which will not be recorded as an overlay for the 2023 year end.\n\nThe Group's corporate plan has a 5 year outlook and considers the high carbon sectors the Group finances. The majority of the Group high carbon sector targets are production/physical intensities which allow continued levels of lending as long as the products the client produce have a decreasing carbon cost. For Coal Mining and Oil and Gas, these sectors have absolute targets which represent a decreasing carbon budget. Coal Mining is an immaterial book, whilst for Oil and Gas lending is being actively monitored towards lower carbon counterparties and technologies. The corporate plan is shorter term than many of the climate scenario outlooks but seeks to capture the nearer term performance as required by recoverability models. The Group has for the second time in the 2024 corporate plan included anticipated ECL charges linked to climate for four sectors (Oil and Gas, Metals and Mining, Power and Transport excluding Aviation) over the 5 years. This addition of ECL has not in itself, impacted the recoverability of assets supported by discounted cash flow models (such as Value in Use) which utilise the Corporate plan.\n\nThe Group has further progressively strengthened its scenario analysis capabilities with the modelling of Climate Risk impact over a 30-year period across multiple dimensions including scenario data and pathways. This has been limited by availability of client-specific data, and modelling limitations which have required judgements to be made around scenarios chosen, regression and proxies used. Notwithstanding these challenges, our work to date, using certain assumptions and proxies, indicates that our business is resilient to all Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and bespoke scenarios that were explored.\n\nThe Group, although acknowledging the limitations of current data available, increasing sophistication of models evolving and nascent nature of climate impacts on internal and client assets, considers Climate Risk to have limited quantitative impact in the immediate term and as a longer-term risk will be addressed through its business strategy and financial planning as the Group implements its net zero journey.\n\n## IFRS and Hong Kong accounting requirements\n\nAs required by the Hong Kong Listing Rules, an explanation of the differences in accounting practices between UKadopted IFRS and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards is required to be disclosed. There would be no significant differences had these accounts been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards.",

Details of these changes are set out in the relevant sections and notes below:\n\n- \u00b7 Cash flow statement\n- \u00b7 Note 2 Segmental information\n- \u00b7 Note 12 Earnings per ordinary share\n- \u00b7 Note 34 Cash flow statement\n- \u00b7 Note 35 Cash and cash equivalents\n\n## New accounting standards adopted by the group\n\nThere were no new accounting standards or interpretations that had a material effect on the Group's Financial Statements in 2023.\n\n## New accounting standards in issue but not yet effective IAS 21 Amendment - Lack of Exchangeability\n\nThe IAS 21 amendment was issued in August 2023 and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025. This amendment is not yet endorsed for use in the United Kingdom. The amendment provides guidance to specify when a currency is exchangeable and how to determine the exchange rate when it is not. The amendment requires disclosure of information that enables users of financial statements to understand the impact of a currency not being exchangeable. The Group will apply the IAS 21 Amendment for annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2025 and is currently assessing the impact on the Group's financial statements but do not expect this to be material.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThese financial statements were approved by the Board of directors on 23 February 2024. The directors have made an assessment of the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment has been made having considered the current macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Review of the Group Strategy and Corporate Plan\n- \u00b7 An assessment of the actual performance to date, loan book quality, credit impairment, legal, regulatory and compliance matters, and the updated annual budget\n- \u00b7 Consideration of stress testing performed, including the Group Recovery Plan (RP) which include the application of stressed scenarios. Under the tests and through the range of scenarios, the results of these exercises and the RP demonstrate that the Group has sufficient capital and liquidity to continue as a going concern and meet minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements\n- \u00b7 Analysis of the capital, funding and liquidity position of the Group, including the capital and leverage ratios, and ICAAP which summarises the Group's capital and risk assessment processes, assesses its capital requirements and the adequacy of resources to meet them. Further, funding and liquidity was considered in the context of the risk appetite metrics, including the LCR ratio.\n- \u00b7 The Group's Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP), which considers the Group's liquidity position, its framework and whether sufficient liquidity resources are being maintained to meet liabilities as they fall due, was also reviewed\n- \u00b7 The level of debt in issue, including redemptions and issuances during the year, debt falling due for repayment in the next 12 months and further planned debt issuances, including the appetite in the market for the Group's debt\n- \u00b7 A detailed review of all principal and emerging risks\n\nBased on the analysis performed, the directors confirm they are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in business for a period of at least 12 months from 23 February 2024. For this reason, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for preparing the financial statements.\n\n## Changes in accounting policies\n\nThe Group has changed its accounting policy regarding the determination of the cost of its portfolio of Investment Securities held at amortised cost and Debt securities and other eligible bills, other than those included within financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss.

        "page_content": "## 2. Segmental information\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe analysis reflects how the client segments and geographic regions are managed internally. This is described as the Management View (on an underlying basis) and is principally the location from which a client relationship is managed, which may differ from where it is financially booked and may be shared between businesses and/or regions. In certain instances this approach is not appropriate and a Financial View is disclosed, that is, the location in which the transaction or balance was booked. Typically, the Financial View is used in areas such as the Market and Liquidity Risk reviews where actual booking location is more important for an assessment. Segmental information is therefore on a Management View unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Segments and regions\n\nThe Group's segmental reporting is in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments and is reported consistently with the internal performance framework and as presented to the Group's Management Team.\n\n## Restructuring items excluded from underlying results\n\nThe Group's reported IFRS performance is adjusted for certain items to arrive at alternative performance measures. These items include profits or losses of a capital nature, amounts consequent to investment transactions driven by strategic intent, other infrequent and/or exceptional transactions that are significant or material in the context of the Group's normal business earnings for the period and items which management and investors would ordinarily identify separately when assessing consistent performance period by period. The alternative performance measures are not within the scope of IFRS and not a substitute for IFRS measures.

Net interest income\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nInterest income for financial assets held at either fair value through other comprehensive income or amortised cost, and interest expense on all financial liabilities held at amortised cost is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.\n\nThe effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example prepayment options) but does not consider future credit losses. The calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts. For floating-rate financial instruments, periodic re-estimation of cash flows that reflect the movements in the market rates of interest alters the effective interest rate. Where the estimates of cash flows have been revised, the carrying amount of the financial asset or liability is adjusted to reflect the actual and revised cash flows, discounted at the instruments original effective interest rate. The adjustment is recognised as interest income or expense in the period in which the revision is made as long as the change in estimates is not due to credit issues.\n\nInterest income for financial assets that are either held at fair value through other comprehensive income or amortised cost that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition (stage 3) and have had amounts written off, is recognised using the credit adjusted effective interest rate. This rate is calculated in the same manner as the effective interest rate except that expected credit losses are included in the expected cash flows. Interest income is therefore recognised on the amortised cost of the financial asset including expected credit losses. Should the credit risk on a stage 3 financial asset improve such that the financial asset is no longer considered credit-impaired, interest income recognition reverts to a computation based on the rehabilitated gross carrying value of the financial asset.\n\n|                                                                                       | 2023  $million   | 2022  $million   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Balances at central banks                                                             | 2,833            | 765              |\n| Loans and advances to banks                                                           | 2,095            | 853              |\n| Loans and advances to customers                                                       | 15,518           | 10,032           |\n| Debt securities                                                                       | 5,005            | 2,836            |\n| Other eligible bills                                                                  | 1,596            | 630              |\n| Accrued on impaired assets (discount unwind)                                          | 180              | 136              |\n| Interest income                                                                       | 27,227           | 15,252           |\n| Of which: financial instruments held at fair value through other comprehensive income | 3,445            | 2,167            |\n| Deposits by banks                                                                     | 796              | 433              |\n| Customer accounts                                                                     | 14,292           | 5,443            |\n| Debt securities in issue                                                              | 3,367            | 1,169            |\n| Subordinated liabilities and other borrowed funds                                     | 951              | 570              |\n| Interest expense on IFRS 16 lease liabilities                                         | 52               | 44               |\n| Interest expense                                                                      | 19,458           | 7, 6 5 9         |\n| Net interest income                                                                   | 7, 769           | 7, 5 9 3         |\n\n## 4.

        "page_content": "## 4. Net fees and commission continued\n\nThe Group applies the following practical expedients:\n\n- \u00b7 information on amounts of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations at the end of the reporting period is not disclosed as almost all fee-earning contracts have an expected duration of less than one year\n- \u00b7 promised consideration is not adjusted for the effects of a significant financing component as the period between the Group providing a service and the customer paying for it is expected to be less than one year\n- \u00b7 incremental costs of obtaining a fee-earning contract are recognised upfront in 'Fees and commission expense' rather than amortised, if the expected term of the contract is less than one year\n\nThe determination of the services performed for the customer, the transaction price, and when the services are completed depends on the nature of the product with the customer. The main considerations on income recognition by product are as follows:\n\n## Transaction Banking\n\nThe Group recognises fee income associated with transactional trade and cash management at the point in time the service is provided. The Group recognises income associated with trade contingent risk exposures (such as letters of credit and guarantees) over the period in which the service is provided.\n\nPayment of fees is usually received at the same time the service is provided. In some cases, letters of credit and guarantees issued by the Group have annual upfront premiums, which are amortised on a straight-line basis to fee income over the year.\n\n## Financial Markets\n\nThe Group recognises fee income at the point in time the service is provided. Fee income is recognised for a significant nonlending service when the transaction has been completed and the terms of the contract with the customer entitle the Group to the fee. This includes fees such as structuring and advisory fees. Fees are usually received shortly after the service is provided.\n\nSyndication fees are recognised when the syndication is complete defined as achieving the final approved hold position. Fees are generally received before completion of the syndication, or within 12 months of the transaction date.\n\nSecurities services include custody services, fund accounting and administration, and broker clearing. Fees are recognised over the period the custody or fund management services are provided, or as and when broker services are requested.\n\n## Wealth Management\n\nUpfront consideration on bancassurance agreements is amortised straight-line over the contractual term. Commissions for bancassurance activities are recorded as they are earned through sales of third-party insurance products to customers. These commissions are received within a short time frame of the commission being earned. Target-linked fees are accrued based on percentage of the target achieved, provided it is assessed as highly probable that the target will be met. Cash payment is received at a contractually specified date after achievement of a target has been confirmed.\n\nUpfront and trailing commissions for managed investment placements are recorded as they are confirmed. Income from these activities is relatively even throughout the period, and cash is usually received within a short time frame after the commission is earned.\n\n## Retail Products\n\nThe Group recognises most income at the point in time the Group is entitled to the fee, since most services are provided at the time of the customer's request.\n\nCredit card annual fees are recognised over the service period. In most of our retail markets there are circumstances under which fees are waived, income recognition is adjusted to reflect customer's intent to pay the annual fee. The Group defers the fair value of reward points on its credit card reward programmes, and recognises income and costs associated with fulfilling the reward at the time of redemption.\n\nUpfront bancassurance consideration amounts are amortised on a straight-line basis over the contractual period to which the consideration relates.",

Deferred income on the balance sheet in respect of these activities is $474 million (31 December 2022: $549 million). Following renegotiation of the contract in 2023, the life of the contract was extended for a further 3 years. Accordingly, the income will be earned evenly over a longer period for the next 8.5 years (31 December 2022: 6.5 years). For the twelve months ended 31 December 2023, $75 million of fee income was released from deferred income (31 December 2022: $84 million).",

Net trading income\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nGains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss are recorded in net trading income in the period in which they arise. This includes contractual interest receivable or payable.\n\nWhen the initial fair value of a financial instrument held at fair value through profit or loss relies on unobservable inputs, the difference between the initial valuation and the transaction price is amortised to net trading income as the inputs become observable or over the life of the instrument, whichever is shorter.

        "page_content": "## 8. Credit impairment\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe Group's expected credit loss (ECL) calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions. The significant judgements in determining expected credit loss include:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group's criteria for assessing if there has been a significant increase in credit risk;\n- \u00b7 Development of expected credit loss models, including the choice of inputs relating to macroeconomic variables;\n- \u00b7 Determining estimates of forward looking macroeconomic forecasts;\n- \u00b7 Evaluation of management overlays and post-model adjustments;\n- \u00b7 Determination of probability weightings for Stage 3 individually assessed provisions\n\nThe calculation of credit impairment provisions also involves expert credit judgement to be applied by the credit risk management team based upon counterparty information they receive from various sources including relationship managers and on external market information. Details on the approach for determining expected credit loss can be found in the credit risk section, under IFRS 9 Methodology (page 273).\n\nEstimates of forecasts of key macroeconomic variables underlying the expected credit loss calculation can be found within the Risk review, Key assumptions and judgements in determining expected credit loss (page 275).\n\n## Expected credit losses\n\nAn ECL represents the present value of expected cash shortfalls over the residual term of a financial asset, undrawn commitment or financial guarantee.\n\nA cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due in accordance with the contractual terms of the instrument and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive over the contractual life of the instrument.\n\n## Measurement\n\nECL are computed as unbiased, probability-weighted amounts which are determined by evaluating a range of reasonably possible outcomes, the time value of money, and considering all reasonable and supportable information including that which is forward-looking.\n\nFor material portfolios, the estimate of expected cash shortfalls is determined by multiplying the probability of default (PD) with the loss given default (LGD) with the expected exposure at the time of default (EAD). There may be multiple default events over the lifetime of an instrument. Further details on the components of PD, LGD and EAD are disclosed in the Credit risk section. For less material Retail Banking loan portfolios, the Group has adopted less sophisticated approaches based on historical roll rates or loss rates.\n\nForward-looking economic assumptions are incorporated into the PD, LGD and EAD where relevant and where they influence credit risk, such as GDP growth rates, interest rates, house price indices and commodity prices among others.\n\nTo account for the potential non-linearity in credit losses, multiple forward-looking scenarios are incorporated into the range of reasonably possible outcomes for all material portfolios. For example, where there is a greater risk of downside credit losses than upside gains, multiple forward-looking economic scenarios are incorporated into the range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in respect of determining the PD (and where relevant, the LGD and EAD) and in determining the overall ECL amounts. These scenarios are determined using a Monte Carlo approach centred around the Group's most likely forecast of macroeconomic assumptions.\n\nThe period over which cash shortfalls are determined is generally limited to the maximum contractual period for which the Group is exposed to credit risk. However, for certain revolving credit facilities, which include credit cards or overdrafts, the Group's exposure to credit risk is not limited to the contractual period. For these instruments, the Group estimates an appropriate life based on the period that the Group is exposed to credit risk, which includes the effect of credit risk management actions such as the withdrawal of undrawn facilities.\n\nFor credit-impaired financial instruments, the estimate of cash shortfalls may require the use of expert credit judgement.",

Credit impairment continued\n\nThe estimate of expected cash shortfalls on a collateralised financial instrument reflects the amount and timing of cash flows that are expected from foreclosure on the collateral less the costs of obtaining and selling the collateral, regardless of whether foreclosure is deemed probable.\n\nCash flows from unfunded credit enhancements held are included within the measurement of expected credit losses if they are part of, or integral to, the contractual terms of the instrument (this includes financial guarantees, unfunded risk participations and other non-derivative credit insurance). Although non-integral credit enhancements do not impact the measurement of expected credit losses, a reimbursement asset is recognised to the extent of the ECL recorded.\n\nCash shortfalls are discounted using the effective interest rate (or credit-adjusted effective interest rate for purchased or originated credit-impaired instruments (POCI)) on the financial instrument as calculated at initial recognition or if the instrument has a variable interest rate, the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.\n\n| Instruments                                    | Location of expected credit loss provisions                       |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial assets held at amortised cost        | Loss provisions: netted against gross carrying value 1            |\n| Financial assets held FVOCI - Debt instruments | Other comprehensive income (FVOCI expected credit loss reserve) 2 |\n| Loan commitments                               | Provisions for liabilities and charges 3                          |\n| Financial guarantees                           | Provisions for liabilities and charges 3                          |\n\n- 2   Debt and treasury securities classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are held at fair value on the face of the balance sheet. The expected credit loss attributed to these instruments is held as a separate reserve within other comprehensive income (OCI) and is recycled to the profit and loss account along with any fair value measurement gains or losses held within FVOCI when the applicable instruments are derecognised\n- 3   Expected credit loss on loan commitments and financial guarantees is recognised as a liability provision. Where a financial instrument includes both a loan (i.e. financial asset component) and an undrawn commitment (i.e. loan commitment component), and it is not possible to separately identify the expected credit loss on these components, expected credit loss amounts on the loan commitment are recognised together with expected credit loss amounts on the financial asset. To the extent the combined expected credit loss exceeds the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, the expected credit loss is recognised as a liability provision\n\n## Recognition\n\n12 months expected credit losses (stage 1) Expected credit losses are recognised at the time of initial recognition of a financial instrument and represent the lifetime cash shortfalls arising from possible default events up to 12 months into the future from the balance sheet date. Expected credit losses continue to be determined on this basis until there is either a significant increase in the credit risk of an instrument or the instrument becomes credit-impaired. If an instrument is no longer considered to exhibit a significant increase in credit risk, expected credit losses will revert to being determined on a 12-month basis.\n\nSignificant increase in credit risk (Stage 2) Significant increase in credit risk is assessed by comparing the risk of default of an exposure at the reporting date to the risk of default at origination (after taking into account the passage of time). Significant does not mean statistically significant nor is it assessed in the context of changes in expected credit loss. Whether a change in the risk of default is significant or not is assessed using a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, the weight of which depends on the type of product and counterparty. Financial assets that are 30 or more days past due and not credit-impaired will always be considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk. For less material portfolios where a loss rate or roll rate approach is applied to compute expected credit loss, significant increase in credit risk is primarily based on 30 days past due.\n\nQuantitative factors include an assessment of whether there has been significant increase in the forward-looking probability of default (PD) since origination. A forward-looking PD is one that is adjusted for future economic conditions to the extent these are correlated to changes in credit risk. We compare the residual lifetime PD at the balance sheet date to the residual lifetime PD that was expected at the time of origination for the same point in the term structure and determine whether both the absolute and relative change between the two exceeds predetermined thresholds. To the extent that the differences between the measures of default outlined exceed the defined thresholds, the instrument is considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (see page 282 to 284).\n\nQualitative factors assessed include those linked to current credit risk management processes, such as lending placed on non-purely precautionary early alert (and subject to closer monitoring).\n\nA non-purely precautionary early alert account is one which exhibits risk or potential weaknesses of a material nature requiring closer monitoring, supervision, or attention by management. Weaknesses in such a borrower's account, if left uncorrected, could result in deterioration of repayment prospects and the likelihood of being downgraded. Indicators could include a rapid erosion of position within the industry, concerns over management's ability to manage operations, weak/deteriorating operating results, liquidity strain and overdue balances among other factors.",

        "page_content": "## 8. Credit impairment continued\n\nCredit-impaired (or defaulted) exposures (Stage 3) Financial assets that are credit-impaired (or in default) represent those that are at least 90 days past due in respect of principal and/or interest. Financial assets are also considered to be credit-impaired where the obligors are unlikely to pay on the occurrence of one or more observable events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset. It may not be possible to identify a single discrete event but instead the combined effect of several events may cause financial assets to become credit-impaired.\n\n- \u00b7 Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes observable data about the following events:\n- \u00b7 Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or borrower;\n- \u00b7 Breach of contract such as default or a past due event;\n- \u00b7 For economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulty, the lenders of the borrower have granted the borrower concession/s that lenders would not otherwise consider. This would include forbearance actions (page 257);\n- \u00b7 Pending or actual bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation to avoid or delay discharge of the borrower's obligation/s;\n- \u00b7 The disappearance of an active market for the applicable financial asset due to financial difficulties of the borrower;\n- \u00b7 Purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects incurred credit losses\n\nLending commitments to a credit-impaired obligor that have not yet been drawn down are included to the extent that the commitment cannot be withdrawn. Loss provisions against credit-impaired financial assets are determined based on an assessment of the present value of expected cash shortfalls (discounted at the instrument's original effective interest rate) under a range of scenarios, including the realisation of any collateral held where appropriate. The Group's definition of default is aligned with the regulatory definition of default as set out in the UK's onshored capital requirements regulations (Art 178).\n\n## Expert credit judgement\n\nFor Corporate & Institutional, Commercial and Private Banking, borrowers are graded by credit risk management on a credit grading (CG) scale from CG1 to CG14. Once a borrower starts to exhibit credit deterioration, it will move along the credit grading scale in the performing book and when it is classified as CG12 (which is a qualitative trigger for significant increase in credit risk (see page 283)the credit assessment and oversight of the loan will normally be performed by Stressed Assets Risk (SAR).\n\nBorrowers graded CG12 exhibit well-defined weaknesses in areas such as management and/or performance but there is no current expectation of a loss of principal or interest in the likely scenario. Where the impairment assessment indicates that there will be a loss of principal on a loan in the likely scenario, the borrower is graded a CG14 while borrowers of other credit-impaired loans are graded CG13. Instruments graded CG13 or CG14 are regarded as stage 3.\n\nFor individually significant financial assets within stage 3, SAR will consider all judgements that have an impact on the expected future cash flows of the asset. These include: the business prospects, industry and geo political climate of the customer, quality of realisable value of collateral, the Group's legal position relative to other claimants and any renegotiation/ forbearance/ modification options. The future cash flow calculation involves significant judgements and estimates. As new information becomes available and further negotiations/ forbearance measures are taken the estimates of the future cash flows will be revised, and will have an impact on the future cash flow analysis.\n\nFor financial assets which are not individually significant, such as the Retail Banking portfolio or small business loans, which comprise a large number of homogenous loans that share similar characteristics, statistical estimates and techniques are used, as well as credit scoring analysis.\n\nConsumer and Business Banking clients are considered credit-impaired where they are more 90 days past due, or if the borrower files for bankruptcy or other forbearance programme, the borrower is deceased or the business is closed in the case of a small business, or if the borrower surrenders the collateral, or there is an identified fraud on the account. Additionally, if the account is unsecured and the borrower has other credit accounts with the Group that are considered credit-impaired, the account may be also be credit-impaired.\n\nTechniques used to compute impairment amounts use models which analyse historical repayment and default rates over a time horizon. Where various models are used, judgement is required to analyse the available information provided and select the appropriate model or combination of models to use.\n\nExpert credit judgement is also applied to determine whether any post-model adjustments are required for credit risk elements which are not captured by the models.\n\n## Modified financial instruments\n\nWhere the original contractual terms of a financial asset have been modified for credit reasons and the instrument has not been derecognised (an instrument is derecognised when a modification results in a change in cash flows that the Group would consider substantial), the resulting modification loss is recognised within credit impairment in the income statement with a corresponding decrease in the gross carrying value of the asset. If the modification involved a concession that the bank would not otherwise consider, the instrument is considered to be credit-impaired and is considered forborne.",

Credit impairment continued\n\nExpected credit loss for modified financial assets that have not been derecognised and are not considered to be creditimpaired will be recognised on a 12-month basis, or a lifetime basis, if there is a significant increase in credit risk. These assets are assessed (by comparison to the origination date) to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk subsequent to the modification. Although loans may be modified for non-credit reasons, a significant increase in credit risk may occur. In addition to the recognition of modification gains and losses, the revised carrying value of modified financial assets will impact the calculation of expected credit losses, with any increase or decrease in expected credit loss recognised within impairment.\n\n## Forborne loans\n\nForborne loans are those loans that have been modified in response to a customer's financial difficulties. Forbearance strategies assist clients who are temporarily in financial distress and are unable to meet their original contractual repayment terms. Forbearance can be initiated by the client, the Group or a third-party including government sponsored programmes or a conglomerate of credit institutions. Forbearance may include debt restructuring such as new repayment schedules, payment deferrals, tenor extensions, interest only payments, lower interest rates, forgiveness of principal, interest or fees, or relaxation of loan covenants.\n\nForborne loans that have been modified (and not derecognised) on terms that are not consistent with those readily available in the market and/or where we have granted a concession compared to the original terms of the loans are considered credit-impaired if there is a detrimental impact on cash flows. The modification loss (see Classification and measurement - Modifications) is recognised in the profit or loss within credit impairment and the gross carrying value of the loan reduced by the same amount. The modified loan is disclosed as 'Loans subject to forbearance - credit-impaired'.\n\nLoans that have been subject to a forbearance modification, but which are not considered credit-impaired (not classified as CG13 or CG14), are disclosed as 'Forborne - not credit-impaired'. This may include amendments to covenants within the contractual terms.\n\n## Write-offs of credit-impaired instruments and reversal of impairment\n\nTo the extent a financial debt instrument is considered irrecoverable, the applicable portion of the gross carrying value is written off against the related loan provision. Such loans are written off after all the necessary procedures have been completed, it is decided that there is no realistic probability of recovery and the amount of the loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off decrease the amount of the provision for credit impairment in the income statement.\n\n## Loss provisions on purchased or originated credit-impaired instruments (POCI)\n\nThe Group measures expected credit loss on a lifetime basis for POCI instruments throughout the life of the instrument. However, expected credit loss is not recognised in a separate loss provision on initial recognition for POCI instruments as the lifetime expected credit loss is inherent within the gross carrying amount of the instruments. The Group recognises the change in lifetime expected credit losses arising subsequent to initial recognition in the income statement and the cumulative change as a loss provision. Where lifetime expected credit losses on POCI instruments are less than those at initial recognition, then the favourable differences are recognised as impairment gains in the income statement (and as impairment loss where the expected credit losses are greater).\n\n## Improvement in credit risk/curing\n\nFor financial assets that are credit-impaired (stage 3), a transfer to stage 2 or stage 1 is only permitted where the instrument is no longer considered to be credit-impaired. An instrument will no longer be considered credit-impaired when there is no shortfall of cash flows compared to the original contractual terms.\n\nFor financial assets within stage 2, these can only be transferred to stage 1 when they are no longer considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nWhere significant increase in credit risk was determined using quantitative measures, the instruments will automatically transfer back to stage 1 when the original PD based transfer criteria are no longer met. Where instruments were transferred to stage 2 due to an assessment of qualitative factors, the issues that led to the reclassification must be cured before the instruments can be reclassified to stage 1. This includes instances where management actions led to instruments being classified as stage 2, requiring that action to be resolved before loans are reclassified to stage 1.\n\nA forborne loan can only be removed from being disclosed as forborne if the loan is performing (stage 1 or 2) and a further two-year probation period is met.\n\nIn order for a forborne loan to become performing, the following criteria have to be satisfied:\n\n- \u00b7 At least a year has passed with no default based upon the forborne contract terms\n- \u00b7 The customer is likely to repay its obligations in full without realising security\n- \u00b7 The customer has no accumulated impairment against amount outstanding (except for ECL)\n\nSubsequent to the criteria above, a further two-year probation period has to be fulfilled, whereby regular payments are made by the customer and none of the exposures to the customer are more than 30 days past due.",

Taxation\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nIncome tax payable on profits is based on the applicable tax law in each jurisdiction and is recognised as an expense in the period in which profits arise.\n\nDeferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date, and that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Where permitted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset on an entity basis and not by component of deferred taxation.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax relating to items which are charged or credited directly to equity, is credited or charged directly to equity and is subsequently recognised in the income statement together with the current or deferred gain or loss.\n\n## Other accounting estimates and judgements\n\n- \u00b7 Determining the Group's tax charge for the year involves estimation and judgement, which includes an interpretation of local tax laws and an assessment of whether the tax authorities will accept the position taken. These judgements take account of external advice where appropriate, and the Group's view on settling with the relevant tax authorities.\n- \u00b7 The Group provides for current tax liabilities at the best estimate of the amount that is expected to be paid to the tax authorities where an outflow is probable. In making its estimates the Group assumes that the tax authorities will examine all the amounts reported to them and have full knowledge of all relevant information.\n- \u00b7 The recoverability of the Group's deferred tax assets is based on management's judgement of the availability of future taxable profits against which the deferred tax assets will be utilised. In preparing management forecasts the effect of applicable laws and regulations relevant to the utilisation of future taxable profits have been considered.",

These are partly offset by tax exempt income.\n\nForeign tax includes current tax of $201 million (31 December 2022: $35 million) on the profits assessable in Hong Kong.

When calculating diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted for the effects of all expected dilutive potential ordinary shares held in respect of Standard Chartered PLC totalling 56 million (2022: 52 million). The total number of share options outstanding, under schemes considered to be potentially dilutive, was 7 million (2022: 5 million). These options have strike prices ranging from $3.99 to $7.49.\n\nOf the total number of employee share options and share awards at 31 December 2023 there were nil share options and awards which were anti dilutive.\n\nThe 188 million decrease (2022: 142 million decrease) in the basic weighted average number of shares is primarily due to the impact of the share buy-back programmes completed in the year.",

Financial instruments\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## Financial assets held at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nDebt instruments held at amortised cost or held at FVOCI have contractual terms that give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) characteristics.\n\nIn assessing whether the contractual cash flows have SPPI characteristics, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Group considers:\n\n- \u00b7 Contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows\n- \u00b7 Leverage features\n- \u00b7 Prepayment and extension terms\n- \u00b7 Terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse asset arrangements)\n- \u00b7 Features that modify consideration of the time value of money - e.g. periodical reset of interest rates.\n\nWhether financial assets are held at amortised cost or at FVOCI depends on the objectives of the business models under which the assets are held. A business model refers to how the Group manages financial assets to generate cash flow.\n\nThe Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at the individual product business line, and where applicable within business lines depending on the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. Factors considered include:\n\n- \u00b7 How the performance of the product business line is evaluated and reported to the Group's management\n- \u00b7 How managers of the business model are compensated, including whether management is compensated based on the fair value of assets or the contractual cash flows collected\n- \u00b7 The risks that affect the performance of the business model and how those risks are managed\n- \u00b7 The frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity.\n\nThe Group's business model assessment is as follows:\n\n| Business model                      | Business objective                                                                                                                             | Characteristics                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Businesses                                                                                                         | Products                                                                                                                           |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Hold to  collect                    | Intent is to originate  financial assets and  hold them to maturity,  collecting the  contractual cash flows  over the term of the  instrument | \u00b7  Providing financing and  originating assets to earn interest  income as primary income stream \u00b7  Performing credit risk  management activities \u00b7  Costs include funding costs,  transaction costs and                       | \u00b7  Corporate Lending \u00b7  Financial Markets \u00b7  Transaction Banking \u00b7  Retail Lending \u00b7  Treasury Markets  (Loans and | \u00b7  Loans and advances \u00b7  Debt securities                                                                                           |\n| Hold to  collect   and sell         | Business objective met  through both hold to  collect and by selling  financial assets                                                         | \u00b7  Portfolios held for liquidity needs;  or where a certain interest yield  profile is maintained; or that are  normally rebalanced to achieve                                                                                 | \u00b7  Treasury Markets                                                                                                | \u00b7  Debt securities                                                                                                                 |\n| Fair value  through  profit or loss | All other business  objectives, including  trading and managing  financial assets on a   fair value basis                                      | \u00b7  Assets held for trading \u00b7  Assets that are originated,  purchased, and sold for profit  taking or underwriting activity \u00b7  Performance of the portfolio is  evaluated on a fair value basis \u00b7  Income streams are from fair | \u00b7  Financial Markets \u00b7  All other business lines                                                                   | \u00b7  Derivatives \u00b7  Equity shares \u00b7  Trading portfolios \u00b7  Financial Markets  reverse repos \u00b7  Financial Markets   (FM Bond and Loan |",

        "page_content": "## 13. Financial instruments continued\n\nFinancial assets which have SPPI characteristics and that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets to collect contractual cashflows (hold to collect) are recorded at amortised cost. Conversely, financial assets which have SPPI characteristics but are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cashflows and selling financial assets (Hold to collect and sell) are classified as held at FVOCI. Both hold to collect and hold to collect and sell business models involve holding financial assets to collect the contractual cashflows. However, the business models are distinct by reference to the frequency and significance that asset sales play in meeting the objective under which a particular group of financial assets is managed. Hold to collect business models are characterised by asset sales that are incidental to meeting the objectives under which a group of assets is managed. Sales of assets under a hold to collect business model can be made to manage increases in the credit risk of financial assets but sales for other reasons should be infrequent or insignificant. Cashflows from the sale of financial assets under a hold to collect and sell business model by contrast are integral to achieving the objectives under which a particular group of financial assets are managed. This may be the case where frequent sales of financial assets are required to manage the Group's daily liquidity requirements or to meet regulatory requirements to demonstrate liquidity of financial instruments. Sales of assets under hold to collect and sell business models are therefore both more frequent and more significant in value than those under the hold to collect model.\n\n## Equity instruments designated as held at FVOCI\n\nNon-trading equity instruments acquired for strategic purposes rather than capital gain may be irrevocably designated at initial recognition as held at FVOCI on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Dividends received are recognised in profit or loss. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of these instruments, including foreign exchange gains and losses, are recognised directly in equity and are never reclassified to profit or loss even on derecognition.\n\n## Mandatorily classified at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities which are mandatorily held at fair value through profit or loss are split between two subcategories as follows:\n\n## Trading, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial assets and liabilities held for trading, which are those acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term\n- \u00b7 Derivatives\n\nNon-trading mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Instruments in a business which has a fair value business model (see the Group's business model assessment) which are not trading or derivatives\n- \u00b7 Hybrid financial assets that contain one or more embedded derivatives\n- \u00b7 Financial assets that would otherwise be measured at amortised cost or FVOCI but which do not have SPPI characteristics\n- \u00b7 Equity instruments that have not been designated as held at FVOCI\n- \u00b7 Financial liabilities that constitute contingent consideration in a business combination\n\n## Designated at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities may be designated at fair value through profit or loss when the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities on a different basis ('accounting mismatch').\n\nFinancial liabilities may also be designated at fair value through profit or loss where they are managed on a fair value basis or have an embedded derivative where the Group is not able to bifurcate and separately value the embedded derivative component.\n\n## Financial liabilities held at amortised cost\n\nFinancial liabilities that are not financial guarantees or loan commitments and that are not classified as financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss are classified as financial liabilities held at amortised cost.\n\nPreference shares which carry a mandatory coupon that represents a market rate of interest at the issue date, or which are redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the shareholder are classified as financial liabilities and are presented in other borrowed funds. The dividends on these preference shares are recognised in the income statement as interest expense on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.",

        "page_content": "## 13. Financial instruments continued\n\n## Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments\n\nThe Group issues financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments in return for fees. Financial guarantee contracts and any loan commitments issued at below-market interest rates are initially recognised at their fair value as a financial liability, and subsequently measured at the higher of the initial value less the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and their expected credit loss provision. Loan commitments may be designated at fair value through profit or loss where that is the business model under which such contracts are held.\n\n## Fair value of financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments is generally measured on the basis of the individual financial instrument. However, when a group of financial assets and financial liabilities is managed on the basis of its net exposure to either market risk or credit risk, the fair value of the group of financial instruments is measured on a net basis.\n\nThe fair values of quoted financial assets and liabilities in active markets are based on current prices. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. If the market for a financial instrument, and for unlisted securities, is not active, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.\n\n## Initial recognition\n\nRegular way purchases and sales of financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss, and held at fair value through other comprehensive income are initially recognised on the trade date (the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset). Loans and advances and other financial assets held at amortised cost are recognised on the settlement date (the date on which cash is advanced to the borrowers).\n\nAll financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value, which is normally the transaction price, plus directly attributable transaction costs for financial assets and liabilities which are not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the initial fair value may be based on a valuation technique which may lead to the recognition of profits or losses at the time of initial recognition. However, these profits or losses can only be recognised when the valuation technique used is based solely on observable market data. Where the initially recognised fair value is based on a valuation model that uses unobservable inputs, the difference between the transaction price and the valuation model is not recognised immediately in the income statement but following the passage of time, or as the inputs become observable, or the transaction matures or is terminated.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\n## Financial assets and financial liabilities held at amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities held at amortised cost are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method (see 'Interest income and expense'). Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.\n\nWhere a financial instrument carried at amortised cost is the hedged item in a qualifying fair value hedge relationship, its carrying value is adjusted by the fair value gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk.\n\n## Financial assets held at FVOCI\n\nDebt instruments held at FVOCI are subsequently carried at fair value, with all unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in fair value (including any related foreign exchange gains or losses) recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity. Foreign exchange gains and losses on the amortised cost are recognised in income. Changes in expected credit losses are recognised in the profit or loss and are accumulated in equity. On derecognition, the cumulative fair value gains or losses, net of the cumulative expected credit loss reserve, are transferred to the profit or loss.\n\nEquity investments designated at FVOCI are subsequently carried at fair value with all unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in fair value (including any related foreign exchange gains or losses) recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity. On derecognition, the cumulative reserve is transferred to retained earnings and is not recycled to profit or loss.\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss\n\nGains and losses arising from changes in fair value, including contractual interest income or expense, recorded in the net trading income line in the profit or loss unless the instrument is part of a cash flow hedging relationship.",

        "page_content": "## 13. Financial instruments continued\n\n## Derecognition of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets which are subject to commercial refinancing where the loan is priced to the market with no payment related concessions regardless of form of legal documentation or nature of lending will be derecognised. Where the Group's rights to the cash flows under the original contract have expired, the old loan is derecognised and the new loan is recognised at fair value. For all other modifications for example forborne loans or restructuring, whether or not a change in the cash flows is 'substantially different' is judgemental and will be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all the relevant facts and circumstances.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in profit or loss except for equity instruments elected FVOCI (see above) and cumulative fair value adjustments attributable to the credit risk of a liability, that are held in other comprehensive income.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished. A financial liability is extinguished when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires and this is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. However, where a financial liability has been modified, it is derecognised if the difference between the modified cash flows and the original cash flows is more than 10 per cent, or if less than 10 per cent, the Group will perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the terms of the two instruments are substantially different.\n\nIf the Group purchases its own debt, it is derecognised and the difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the consideration paid is included in 'Other income' except for the cumulative fair value adjustments attributable to the credit risk of a liability that are held in Other comprehensive income, which are never recycled to the profit or loss.\n\n## Modified financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities whose original contractual terms have been modified, including those loans subject to forbearance strategies, are considered to be modified instruments. Modifications may include changes to the tenor, cash flows and or interest rates among other factors.\n\nWhere derecognition of financial assets is appropriate (see Derecognition), the newly recognised residual loans are assessed to determine whether the assets should be classified as purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI).\n\nWhere derecognition is not appropriate, the gross carrying amount of the applicable instruments is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate (or credit adjusted effective interest rate for POCI financial assets). The difference between the recalculated values and the pre-modified gross carrying values of the instruments are recorded as a modification gain or loss in the profit or loss.\n\nGains and losses arising from modifications for credit reasons are recorded as part of 'Credit Impairment' (see Credit Impairment policy). Modification gains and losses arising from non-credit reasons are recognised either as part of 'Credit Impairment' or within income depending on whether there has been a change in the credit risk on the financial asset subsequent to the modification. Modification gains and losses arising on financial liabilities are recognised within income. The movements in the applicable expected credit loss loan positions are disclosed in further detail in Risk Review.",

Financial instruments continued\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nDuring 2023, significant progress was made in support of LIBOR transition.\n\nNew LIBOR-referencing business had ceased and a full suite of Risk Free Rate-referencing derivative and cash products were standard offerings across the Group.\n\nHaving completed the remediation of all non-USD LIBOR exposures at the end of 2021 with no reliance on synthetic rates, the Programme focused on remediating legacy USD LIBOR stock ahead of the USD LIBOR cessation date (30 June 2023).\n\nThe Group made significant progress towards completing its remediation of legacy exposures over the course of 2023. Clients with legacy USD LIBOR loans were engaged to remediate their contracts via active conversion to alternative rates, or other suitable transition mechanisms such as the inclusion of robust fallbacks. For derivatives, the Group adhered to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol for all its trading entities and continued to engage clients to do the same or to negotiate remediation bilaterally. The Group also successfully participated in CCP conversion events, including both tranches of the London Clearing House (LCH) conversions for USD LIBOR and also the SGD/THB conversion, as well as the CME Eurodollar futures and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) USD LIBOR events. This significantly reduced our overall notional exposure to USD LIBOR, as centrally cleared derivatives and bilateral derivatives with fallbacks represented a substantial portion of the Group's overall USD LIBOR notional exposure.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, a number of contracts remain subject to remediation but these are considered immaterial for the Group. The largest population of remaining exposures are syndicated loans, either on a standalone basis, or where the loans have been hedged with derivatives. These contracts currently operate under a synthetic USD LIBOR rate.\n\n## Risks which the Group is exposed to due to LIBOR transition\n\nThe Group has largely mitigated all material adverse outcomes associated with the cessation of IBOR benchmarks, and these have not required a change to the Group's risk management strategy.\n\nHowever, the Group will continue to focus on the un-remediated contracts, and manage the risks of the transition until fully complete.\n\nParticular attention will continue to be paid to: legal risk of any contracts that may remain outstanding after the end of synthetic LIBOR (currently scheduled for end of September 2024); conduct risk arising from continued remediation; financial and accounting risk in terms of the financial impact of IBOR transition for the outstanding contracts, and also financial instruments that may be affected by accounting issues such as accounting for contractual changes due to IBOR reform, fair value measurement and hedge accounting, as well as other risks inherent in the reform.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022 the Group had the following notional principal exposures to interest rate benchmarks that were subject to interest rate benchmark reform.\n\n| IBOR exposures by benchmark   at 31 December 2022   | USD LIBOR  $million   | GBP LIBOR  $million   | SGD SOR  $million   | THB FIX  $million   | Other IBOR  $million   | Total IBOR  $million   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Assets                                              |                       |                       |                     |                     |                        |                        |\n| Loans and advances to banks                         | 145                   | -

Financial instruments continued\n\n## Offsetting of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nIn practice, for credit mitigation, the Group is able to offset assets and liabilities which do not meet the IAS 32 netting criteria set out below. Such arrangements include master netting arrangements for derivatives and global master repurchase agreements for repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions. These agreements generally allow that all outstanding transactions with a particular counterparty can be offset but only in the event of default or other predetermined events.\n\nIn addition, the Group also receives and pledges readily realisable collateral for derivative transactions to cover net exposure in the event of a default. Under repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements the Group pledges (legally sells) and obtains (legally purchases) respectively, highly liquid assets which can be sold in the event of a default.\n\nThe following tables set out the impact of netting on the balance sheet.

Independent price verification is the process of determining that the valuations incorporated into the financial statements are validated independent of the business area responsible for the product. The Valuation Methodology function has oversight of the fair value adjustments to ensure the financial instruments are priced to exit. These are key controls in ensuring the material accuracy of the valuations incorporated in the financial statements. The market data used for price verification (PV) may include data sourced from recent trade data involving external counterparties or third parties such as Bloomberg, Reuters, brokers and consensus pricing providers. The Valuation Methodology function performs an ongoing review of the market data sources that are used as part of the PV and fair value processes which are formally documented on a semi-annual basis detailing the suitability of the market data used for price testing. Price verification uses independently sourced data that is deemed most representative of the market the instruments trade in. To determine the quality of the market data inputs, factors such as independence, relevance, reliability, availability of multiple data sources and methodology employed by the pricing provider are taken into consideration.\n\nThe Valuation and Benchmarks Committee (VBC) is the valuation governance forum consisting of representatives from Group Market Risk, Product Control, Valuation Methodology and the business, which meets monthly to discuss and approve the independent valuations of the inventory. For Principal Finance, the Investment Committee meeting is held on a quarterly basis to review investments and valuations.\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe Group evaluates the significance of financial instruments and material accuracy of the valuations incorporated in the financial statements as they involve a high degree of judgement and estimation uncertainty in determining the carrying values of financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.\n\n- \u00b7 Fair value of financial instruments is determined using valuation techniques and estimates (see below) which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs. Changes in the observability of significant valuation inputs can materially affect the fair values of financial instruments.\n- \u00b7 When establishing the exit price of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group estimates valuation adjustments in determining the fair value (page 400).\n- \u00b7 In determining the valuation of financial instruments, the Group makes judgements on the amounts reserved to cater for model and valuation risks, which cover both Level 2 and Level 3 assets, and the significant valuation judgements in respect of Level 3 instruments (page 407).\n- \u00b7 Where the estimated measurement of fair value is more judgemental in respect of Level 3 assets, these are valued based on models that use a significant degree of non-market-based unobservable inputs.",

Financial instruments continued\n\n## Valuation techniques\n\nRefer to the fair value hierarchy explanation - Level 1, 2 and 3 (page 402)\n\n## \u00b7 Financial instruments held at fair value\n\n- -Debt securities - asset-backed securities: Asset-backed securities are valued based on external prices obtained from consensus pricing providers, broker quotes, recent trades, arrangers' quotes, etc. Where an observable price is available for a given security, it is classified as Level 2. In instances where third-party prices are not available or reliable, the security is classified as Level 3. The fair value of Level 3 securities is estimated using market standard cash flow models with input parameter assumptions which include prepayment speeds, default rates, discount margins derived from comparable securities with similar vintage, collateral type, and credit ratings.\n- -Debt securities in issue: These debt securities relate to structured notes issued by the Group. Where independent market data is available through pricing vendors and broker sources these positions are classified as Level 2. Where such liquid external prices are not available, valuations of these debt securities are implied using input parameters such as bond spreads and credit spreads, and are classified as Level 3. These input parameters are determined with reference to the same issuer (if available) or proxies from comparable issuers or assets.\n- -Derivatives: Derivative products are classified as Level 2 if the valuation of the product is based upon input parameters which are observable from independent and reliable market data sources. Derivative products are classified as Level 3 if there are significant valuation input parameters which are unobservable in the market, such as products where the performance is linked to more than one underlying variable. Examples are foreign exchange basket options, equity options based on the performance of two or more underlying indices and interest rate products with quanto payouts. In most cases these unobservable correlation parameters cannot be implied from the market, and methods such as historical analysis and comparison with historical levels or other benchmark data must be employed.\n- -Equity shares - private equity: The majority of private equity unlisted investments are valued based on earning multiples - Price-to-Earnings (P/E) or enterprise value to earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortisation (EV/EBITDA) ratios - of comparable listed companies. The two primary inputs for the valuation of these investments are the actual or forecast earnings of the investee companies and earning multiples for the comparable listed companies. To ensure comparability between these unquoted investments and the comparable listed companies, appropriate adjustments are also applied (for example, liquidity and size) in the valuation. In circumstances where an investment does not have direct comparables or where the multiples for the comparable companies cannot be sourced from reliable external sources, alternative valuation techniques (for example, discounted cash flow model or net asset value ('NAV') or option pricing model), which use predominantly unobservable inputs or Level 3 inputs, may be applied. Even though earning multiples for the comparable listed companies can be sourced from third-party sources (for example, Bloomberg), and those inputs can be deemed Level 2 inputs, all unlisted investments (excluding those where observable inputs are available, for example, over-the-counter (OTC) prices) are classified as Level 3 on the basis that the valuation methods involve judgements ranging from determining comparable companies to discount rates where the discounted cash flow method is applied.\n- -Loans and advances: These primarily include loans in the FM Bond and Loan Syndication business which were not fully syndicated as of the balance sheet date and other financing transactions within Financial Markets, and loans and advances including reverse repurchase agreements that do not have SPPI cashflows or are managed on a fair value basis. These loans are generally bilateral in nature and, where available, their valuation is based on observable clean sales transactions prices or market observable spreads. If observable credit spreads are not available, proxy spreads based on comparables with similar credit grade, sector and region, are used. Where observable transaction prices, credit spreads and market standard proxy methods are available, these loans are classified as Level 2. Where there are no recent transactions or comparables, these loans are classified as Level 3.\n- -Other debt securities: These debt securities include convertible bonds, corporate bonds, credit and structured notes. Where quoted prices are available through pricing vendors, brokers or observable trading activities from liquid markets, these are classified as Level 2 and valued using such quotes. Where there are significant valuation inputs which are unobservable in the market, due to illiquid trading or the complexity of the product, these are classified as Level 3. The valuations of these debt securities are implied using input parameters such as bond spreads and credit spreads. These input parameters are determined with reference to the same issuer (if available) or proxied from comparable issuers or assets .\n\n## \u00b7 Financial instruments held at amortised cost\n\nThe following sets out the Group's basis for establishing fair values of amortised cost financial instruments and their classification between Levels 1, 2 and 3. As certain categories of financial instruments are not actively traded, there is a significant level of management judgement involved in calculating the fair values:\n\n- -Cash and balances at central banks: The fair value of cash and balances at central banks is their carrying amounts\n- -Debt securities in issue, subordinated liabilities and other borrowed funds: The aggregate fair values are calculated based on quoted market prices. For those notes where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash flow model is used based on a current market related yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity\n- -Deposits and borrowings: The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is the amount repayable on demand. The estimated fair value of fixed interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings without quoted market prices is based on discounted cash flows using the prevailing market rates for debts with a similar Credit Risk and remaining maturity",

        "page_content": "## 13. Financial instruments continued\n\n- -Investment securities: For investment securities that do not have directly observable market values, the Group utilises a number of valuation techniques to determine fair value. Where available, securities are valued using input proxies from the same or closely related underlying (for example, bond spreads from the same or closely related issuer) or input proxies from a different underlying (for example, a similar bond but using spreads for a particular sector and rating). Certain instruments cannot be proxies as set out above, and in such cases the positions are valued using non-market observable inputs. This includes those instruments held at amortised cost and predominantly relates to asset-backed securities. The fair value for such instruments is usually derived from proxy from internal assessments of the underlying cash flows\n- -Loans and advances to banks and customers: For loans and advances to banks, the fair value of floating rate placements and overnight deposits is their carrying amounts. The estimated fair value of fixed interest-bearing deposits is based on discounted cash flows using the prevailing money market rates for debts with a similar Credit Risk and remaining maturity. The Group's loans and advances to customers' portfolio is well diversified by geography and industry. Approximately a quarter of the portfolio re-prices within one month, and approximately half re-prices within 12 months. Loans and advances are presented net of provisions for impairment. The fair value of loans and advances to customers with a residual maturity of less than one year generally approximates the carrying value. The estimated fair value of loans and advances with a residual maturity of more than one year represents the discounted amount of future cash flows expected to be received, including assumptions relating to prepayment rates and Credit Risk. Expected cash flows are discounted at current market rates to determine fair value. The Group has a wide range of individual instruments within its loans and advances portfolio and as a result providing quantification of the key assumptions used to value such instruments is impractical\n- -Other assets: Other assets comprise primarily cash collateral and trades pending settlement. The carrying amount of these financial instruments is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value as they are either short term in nature or re-price to current market rates frequently.\n\n## Fair value adjustments\n\nWhen establishing the exit price of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group considers adjustments to the modelled price which market participants would make when pricing that instrument. The main valuation adjustments (described further below) in determining fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are as follows:\n\n|                                | 01.01.23  $million   | Movement  during the year  $million   | 31.12.23  $million   | 01.01.22  $million   | Movement  during the year  $million   | 31.12.22  $million   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Bid-offer valuation adjustment | 118                  | (3)                                   | 115                  | 101                  | 17                                    | 118                  |\n| Credit valuation adjustment    | 171                  | (52)                                  | 119                  | 165                  | 6                                     | 171                  |\n| Debit valuation adjustment     | (112)                | (17)                                  | (129)                | (70)                 | (42)                                  | (112)                |\n| Model valuation adjustment     | 3                    | 1                                     | 4                    | 5                    | (2)                                   | 3                    |\n| Funding valuation adjustment   | 46                   | (13)                                  | 33                   | -                    | 46                                    | 46                   |\n| Other fair value adjustments   | 23                   | 2                                     | 25                   | 20                   | 3                                     | 23                   |\n| Total                          | 249                  | (82)                                  | 167                  | 221                  | 28                                    | 249                  |\n| Income deferrals               |                      |                                       |                      |                      |                                       |                      |\n| Day 1 and other deferrals      | 186                  | (77)                                  | 109                  | 147                  | 39                                    | 186                  |\n| Total                          | 186                  | (77)                                  | 109                  | 147                  | 39                                    | 186                  |\n\nNote: Bracket represents an asset and credit to the income statement\n\n- \u00b7 Bid-offer valuation adjustment: Generally, market parameters are marked on a mid-market basis in the revaluation systems, and a bid-offer valuation adjustment is required to quantify the expected cost of neutralising the business' positions through dealing away in the market, thereby bringing long positions to bid and short positions to offer. The methodology to calculate the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio involves netting between long and short positions and the grouping of risk by strike and tenor based on the hedging strategy where long positions are marked to bid and short positions marked to offer in the systems.\n- \u00b7 Credit valuation adjustment (CVA): The Group accounts for CVA against the fair value of derivative products. CVA is an adjustment to the fair value of the transactions to reflect the possibility that our counterparties may default and we may not receive the full market value of the outstanding transactions. It represents an estimate of the adjustment a market participant would include when deriving a purchase price to acquire our exposures. CVA is calculated for each subsidiary, and within each entity for each counterparty to which the entity has exposure and takes account of any collateral we may hold. The Group calculates the CVA by using estimates of future positive exposure, market-implied probability of default (PD) and recovery rates. Where market-implied data is not readily available, we use market-based proxies to estimate the PD. Wrongway risk occurs when the exposure to a counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that counterparty, and the Group has implemented a model to capture this impact for key wrong-way exposures. The Group also captures the uncertainties associated with wrong-way risk in the Group's Prudential Valuation Adjustments framework.",

        "page_content": "## 13. Financial instruments continued\n\n- \u00b7 Debit valuation adjustment (DVA): The Group calculates DVA adjustments on its derivative liabilities to reflect changes in its own credit standing. The Group's DVA adjustments will increase if its credit standing worsens and conversely, decrease if its credit standing improves. For derivative liabilities, a DVA adjustment is determined by applying the Group's probability of default to the Group's negative expected exposure against the counterparty. The Group's probability of default and loss expected in the event of default is derived based on bond and CDS spreads associated with the Group's issuances and market standard recovery levels. The expected exposure is modelled based on the simulation of the underlying risk factors over the expected life of the deal. This simulation methodology incorporates the collateral posted by the Group and the effects of master netting agreements.\n- \u00b7 Model valuation adjustment: Valuation models may have pricing deficiencies or limitations that require a valuation adjustment. These pricing deficiencies or limitations arise due to the choice, implementation and calibration of the pricing model.\n- \u00b7 Funding valuation adjustment (FVA): The Group makes FVA adjustments against derivative products, including embedded derivatives. FVA reflects an estimate of the adjustment to its fair value that a market participant would make to incorporate funding costs or benefits that could arise in relation to the exposure. FVA is calculated by determining the net expected exposure at a counterparty level and then applying a funding rate to those exposures that reflect the market cost of funding. The FVA for uncollateralised (including partially collateralised) derivatives incorporates the estimated present value of the market funding cost or benefit associated with funding these transactions.\n- \u00b7 Other fair value adjustments: The Group calculates the fair value on the interest rate callable products by calibrating to a set of market prices with differing maturity, expiry and strike of the trades.\n- \u00b7 Day one and other deferrals: In certain circumstances the initial fair value is based on a valuation technique which differs to the transaction price at the time of initial recognition. However, these gains can only be recognised when the valuation technique used is based primarily on observable market data. In those cases where the initially recognised fair value is based on a valuation model that uses inputs which are not observable in the market, the difference between the transaction price and the valuation model is not recognised immediately in the income statement. The difference is amortised to the income statement until the inputs become observable, or the transaction matures or is terminated. Other deferrals primarily represent adjustments taken to reflect the specific terms and conditions of certain derivative contracts which affect the termination value at the measurement date.\n\nIn addition, the Group calculates own credit adjustment (OCA) on its issued debt designated at fair value, including structured notes, in order to reflect changes in its own credit standing. Issued debt is discounted utilising the spread at which similar instruments would be issued or bought back at the measurement date as this reflects the value from the perspective of a market participant who holds the identical item as an asset. OCA measures the difference between the fair value of issued debt as of reporting date and theoretical fair values of issued debt adjusted up or down for changes in own credit spreads from inception date to the measurement date. Under IFRS 9 the change in the OCA component is reported under other comprehensive income. The Group's OCA reserve will increase if its credit standing worsens in comparison with the inception of the trade and, conversely, decrease if its credit standing improves. The Group's OCA reserve will reverse over time as its liabilities mature.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy - financial instruments held at fair value\n\nThe fair values of quoted financial assets and liabilities in active markets are based on current prices. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Wherever possible, fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments held by the Group. Where quoted market prices are not available, or are unreliable because of poor liquidity, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs. Valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models and, where appropriate, comparison with instruments that have characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group.\n\nAssets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified into three levels according to the observability of the significant inputs used to determine the fair values. Changes in the observability of significant valuation inputs during the reporting period may result in a transfer of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy. The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy when there is a significant change in either its principal market or the level of observability of the inputs to the valuation techniques as at the end of the reporting period.\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: Fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Level 2: Fair value measurements are those with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are observable.\n- \u00b7 Level 3: Fair value measurements are those where inputs which could have a significant effect on the instrument's valuation are not based on observable market data.",

Financial instruments continued\n\nThe Group has changed its method of determining the cost of its portfolio of Investment Securities held at amortised cost and Debt securities and other eligible bills, other than those included within financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss, from the weighted average cost method to the first-in-first-out method. This change in accounting policy will affect the calculation of gains or losses on derecognition of such instruments and the determination of the initial credit risk of these instruments, to better align with the IFRS 9 requirements for recognising and measuring impairment losses. The change was made prospectively for certain but not all securities and transactions. It is impracticable for the Group to determine the impact of this approach for each security and each transaction that was executed in previous periods.\n\n## Loans and advances to customers by client segment\u00b9\n\n|                                                 | 2023               | 2023                           | 2023            | 2023              | 2023                           | 2023            |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|\n|                                                 | Carrying value     | Carrying value                 | Carrying value  | Fair value        | Fair value                     | Fair value      |\n|                                                 | Stage 3   $million | Stage 1 and  stage 2  $million | Total  $million | Stage 3  $million | Stage 1 and  stage 2  $million | Total  $million |\n| Corporate, Commercial &   Institutional Banking | 1,975              | 128,430                        | 130,405         | 1,910             | 125,841                        | 127,751         |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking            | 724                | 125,335                        | 126,059         | 721               | 120,701                        | 121,422         |\n| Ventures                                        | -                  | 1,033                          | 1,033           | -                 | 1,032                          | 1,032           |\n| Central & other items                           | 209                | 29,269                         | 29,478          | 209               | 29,269                         | 29,478          |\n| At 31 December 2023                             | 2,908              | 284,067                        | 286,975         | 2,840             | 276,843                        | 279,683         |\n\n|                                                 | 2022              | 2022                            | 2022            | 2022              | 2022                            | 2022            |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|\n|                                                 | Carrying value    | Carrying value                  | Carrying value  | Fair value        | Fair value                      | Fair value      |\n|                                                 | Stage 3  $million | Stage 1 and   stage 2  $million | Total  $million | Stage 3  $million | Stage 1 and   stage 2  $million | Total  $million |\n| Corporate, Commercial &   Institutional Banking | 2,481             | 1 3 7, 1 5 0                    | 139,631         | 2,525             | 1 3 7, 1 8 7                    | 139,712         |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking            | 677               | 130,278                         | 130,955         | 685               | 131,679                         | 132,364         |\n| Ventures                                        | -                 | 698                             | 698             | -                 | 696                             | 696             |\n| Central & other items                           | 230               | 39,133                          | 39,363          | 230               | 37, 2 2 1                       | 37, 451         |\n| At 31 December 2022                             | 3,388             | 307, 2 59                       | 310,647         | 3,440             | 306,783                         | 310,223         |\n\n- 1 Loans and advances includes reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending: carrying value $13,996 million and fair value $13,996 million (31 December 2022: $24,498 million and $24,638 million respectively)",

Financial instruments continued\n\nThe following section describes the significant unobservable inputs identified in the valuation technique table:\n\n- \u00b7 Comparable price/yield is a valuation methodology in which the price of a comparable instrument is used to estimate the fair value where there are no direct observable prices. Yield is the interest rate that is used to discount the future cash flows in a discounted cash flow model. Valuation using comparable instruments can be done by calculating an implied yield (or spread over a liquid benchmark) from the price of a comparable instrument, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to derive a value for the instrument. The adjustment should account for relevant differences in the financial instruments such as maturity and/or credit quality. Alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable instrument and the instrument being valued in order to establish the value of the instrument (for example, deriving a fair value for a junior unsecured bond from the price of a senior secured bond). An increase in price, in isolation, would result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the asset. An increase in yield, in isolation, would result in an unfavourable movement in the fair value of the asset\n- \u00b7 Correlation is the measure of how movement in one variable influences the movement in another variable. An equity correlation is the correlation between two equity instruments while an interest rate correlation refers to the correlation between two swap rates\n- \u00b7 Credit spread represents the additional yield that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the Credit Risk of an instrument\n- \u00b7 Discount rate refers to the rate of return used to convert expected cash flows into present value\n- \u00b7 Equity-FX correlation is the correlation between equity instrument and foreign exchange instrument\n- \u00b7 EV/EBITDA multiple is the ratio of Enterprise Value (EV) to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA). EV is the aggregate market capitalisation and debt minus the cash and cash equivalents. An increase in EV/EBITDA multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm\n- \u00b7 EV/Revenue multiple is the ratio of Enterprise Value (EV) to Revenue. An increase in EV/Revenue multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange curves is the term structure for forward rates and swap rates between currency pairs over a specified period\n- \u00b7 Net asset value (NAV) is the value of an entity's assets after deducting any liabilities\n- \u00b7 Interest rate curves is the term structure of interest rates and measures of future interest rates at a particular point in time\n- \u00b7 Liquidity discounts in the valuation of unlisted investments are primarily applied to the valuation of unlisted firms' investments to reflect the fact that these stocks are not actively traded. An increase in liquidity discount will result in an unfavourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm\n- \u00b7 Price-Earnings (P/E) multiple is the ratio of the market value of the equity to the net income after tax. An increase in P/E multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm\n- \u00b7 Price-Book (P/B) multiple is the ratio of the market value of equity to the book value of equity. An increase in P/B multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm\n- \u00b7 Price-Sales (P/S) multiple is the ratio of the market value of equity to sales. An increase in P/S multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm\n- \u00b7 Recovery rates is the expectation of the rate of return resulting from the liquidation of a particular loan. As the probability of default increases for a given instrument, the valuation of that instrument will increasingly reflect its expected recovery level assuming default. An increase in the recovery rate, in isolation, would result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the loan\n- \u00b7 Repo curve is the term structure of repo rates on repos and reverse repos at a particular point in time\n- \u00b7 Volatility represents an estimate of how much a particular instrument, parameter or index will change in value over time. Generally, the higher the volatility, the more expensive the option will be.",

Financial instruments continued\n\n## Sensitivities in respect of the fair values of Level 3 assets and liabilities\n\nSensitivity analysis is performed on products with significant unobservable inputs. The Group applies a 10 per cent increase or decrease on the values of these unobservable inputs, to generate a range of reasonably possible alternative valuations. The percentage shift is determined by statistical analysis performed on a set of reference prices based on the composition of the Group's Level 3 inventory as the measurement date. Favourable and unfavourable changes (which show the balance adjusted for input change) are determined on the basis of changes in the value of the instrument as a result of varying the levels of the unobservable parameters. The Level 3 sensitivity analysis assumes a one-way market move and does not consider offsets for hedges.\n\n|                                                                  | Held at fair value through profit or loss   | Held at fair value through profit or loss   | Held at fair value through profit or loss   | Held at fair value through other comprehensive income   | Held at fair value through other comprehensive income   | Held at fair value through other comprehensive income   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                  | Net exposure  $million                      | Favourable  changes  $million               | Unfavourable  changes  $million             | Net exposure  $million                                  | Favourable  changes  $million                           | Unfavourable  changes  $million                         |\n| Financial instruments held at fair value                         |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                                         |                                                         |                                                         |\n| Loans and advances                                               | 1,960                                       | 1,985                                       | 1,918                                       | -

        "page_content": "## 14. Derivative financial instruments\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nFair values may be obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, recent market transactions, and valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models and option pricing models, as appropriate. Where the initially recognised fair value of a derivative contract is based on a valuation model that uses inputs which are not observable in the market, it follows the same initial recognition accounting policy as for other financial assets and liabilities. All derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nUnder certain conditions, the Group may designate a recognised asset or liability, a firm commitment, highly probable forecast transaction or net investment of a foreign operation into a formal hedge accounting relationship with a derivative that has been entered to manage interest rate and/or foreign exchange risks present in the hedged item. The Group applied the 'Phase 1' hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and the 'Phase 2' amendments to IFRS in respect of interest rate benchmark reform. There are three categories of hedge relationships:\n\n- \u00b7 Fair value hedge: to manage the fair value of interest rate and/or foreign currency risks of recognised assets or liabilities or firm commitments\n- \u00b7 Cash flow hedge: to manage interest rate or foreign exchange risk of highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability, or a forecasted transaction\n- \u00b7 Net investment hedge: to manage the structural foreign exchange risk of an investment in a foreign operation.\n\nThe Group assesses, both at hedge inception and on a quarterly basis, whether the derivatives designated in hedge relationships are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Hedges are considered to be highly effective if all the following criteria are met:\n\n- \u00b7 At inception of the hedge and throughout its life, the hedge is prospectively expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk\n- \u00b7 Prospective and retrospective effectiveness of the hedge should be within a range of 80-125%. This is tested using regression analysis\n- \u00b7 The regression co-efficient (R squared), which measures the correlation between the variables in the regression, is at least 80%.\n\nIn the case of the hedge of a forecast transaction, the transaction must have a high probability of occurring and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that are expected to affect reported profit or loss.\n\n## Fair value hedge\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedging instruments are recorded in net trading income, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to the income statement over the remaining term to maturity of the hedged item. If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the income statement. For financial assets classified as fair value through other comprehensive income, the hedge accounting adjustment attributable to the hedged risk is included in net trading income to match the hedging derivative.\n\n## Cash flow hedge\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments are initially recognised in other comprehensive income, accumulating in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity. These amounts are subsequently recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. Both the derivative fair value movement and any recycled amount are recorded in the 'Cashflow hedges' line item in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group assesses hedge effectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method, which creates a derivative instrument to serve as a proxy for the hedged transaction. The terms of the hypothetical derivative match the critical terms of the hedged item and it has a fair value of zero at inception. The hypothetical derivative and the actual derivative are regressed to establish the statistical significance of the hedge relationship. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the net trading income immediately.\n\nIf a cash flow hedge is discontinued, the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is released to the income statement as and when the hedged item affects the income statement.\n\nShould the Group consider the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur due to reasons, the cumulative gain or loss will be immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## Net investment hedge\n\nHedges of net investments are accounted for in a similar manner to cash flow hedges, with gains and losses arising on the effective portion of the hedges recorded in the line 'Exchange differences on translation of foreign operations' in other comprehensive income, accumulating in the translation reserve within equity. These amounts remain in equity until the net investment is disposed of. The ineffective portion of the hedges is recognised in the net trading income immediately.",

These derivatives are measured at fair value, with fair value changes recognised in net trading income: refer to Market Risk (page 286).\n\n## Derivatives held for hedging\n\nThe Group enters into derivative contracts for the purpose of hedging interest rate, currency and structural foreign exchange risks inherent in assets, liabilities and forecast transactions. The table below summarises the notional principal amounts and carrying values of derivatives designated in hedge accounting relationships at the reporting date.\n\nIncluded in the table above are derivatives held for hedging purposes as follows:\n\n|                                                   | 2023                                   | 2023             | 2023                  | 2022                                   | 2022             | 2022                  |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                   | Notional  principal  amounts  $million | Assets  $million | Liabilities  $million | Notional  principal  amounts  $million | Assets  $million | Liabilities  $million |\n| Derivatives designated as   fair value hedges:    |                                        |                  |                       |                                        |                  |                       |\n| Interest rate swaps                               | 69,347                                 | 1,264            | 2,397                 | 80,760                                 | 2,438            | 2,939                 |\n| Currency swaps                                    | 115                                    | 10               | 6                     | 1,273                                  | 16               | 48                    |\n|                                                   | 69,462                                 | 1,274            | 2,403                 | 82,033                                 | 2,454            | 2,987                 |\n| Derivatives designated as   cash flow hedges:     |                                        |                  |                       |                                        |                  |                       |\n| Interest rate swaps                               | 41,834                                 | 184              | 537                   | 31,977                                 | 100              | 671                   |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts                | 12,071                                 | 420              | 183                   | 11,987                                 | 99               | 385                   |\n| Currency swaps                                    | 14,321                                 | 191              | 150                   | 11,787                                 | 86               | 362                   |\n|                                                   | 68,226                                 | 795              | 870                   | 55,751                                 | 285              | 1,418                 |\n| Derivatives designated as net  investment hedges: |                                        |                  |                       |                                        |                  |                       |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts                | 15,436                                 | 32               | 41                    | 14,576                                 | 120              | 141                   |\n| Total derivatives held for hedging                | 153,124                                | 2,101            | 3,314                 | 152,360                                | 2,859            | 4,546                 |",

Derivative financial instruments continued\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe Group issues various long-term fixed-rate debt issuances that are measured at amortised cost, including some denominated in foreign currency, such as unsecured senior and subordinated debt (see Notes 22 and 27). The Group also holds various fixed rate debt securities such as government and corporate bonds, including some denominated in foreign currency (see Note 13). These assets and liabilities held are exposed to changes in fair value due to movements in market interest and foreign currency rates.\n\nThe Group uses interest rate swaps to exchange fixed rates for floating rates on funding to match floating rates received on assets, or exchange fixed rates on assets to match floating rates paid on funding. The Group further uses cross-currency swaps to match the currency of the issued debt or held asset with that of the entity's functional currency.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness from fair value hedges is driven by cross-currency basis risk and interest cashflows mismatch between the hedging instruments and underlying hedged items. The amortisation of fair value hedge adjustments for hedged items no longer designated is recognised in net interest income.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 the Group held the following interest rate and cross- currency swaps as hedging instruments in fair value hedges of interest and currency risk.\n\n## Hedging instruments and ineffectiveness\n\n|                                                                   | 2023               | 2023            | 2023                | 2023                                           | 2023                                    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                                                                   | Carrying amount    | Carrying amount | Carrying amount     | Change in fair  value used to  calculate hedge | Ineffectiveness                         |\n| Interest rate 1                                                   | Notional  $million | Asset  $million | Liability  $million | ineffectiveness 2 $million                     | recognised in  profit or loss  $million |\n| Interest rate swaps -

The amounts and timing of future cash flows, representing both principal and interest flows, are projected on the basis of contractual terms and other relevant factors, including estimates of prepayments and defaults.\n\nThe hedging strategy of the Group involves using interest rate swaps to manage the variability in future cash flows on assets and liabilities that have floating rates of interest by exchanging the floating rates for fixed rates. It also uses foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps to manage the variability in future exchange rates on its assets and liabilities and costs in foreign currencies. This is done on both a micro basis whereby a single interest rate or cross-currency swap is designated in a separate relationship with a single hedged item (such as a floating-rate loan to a customer), and on a portfolio basis whereby each hedging instrument is designated against a group of hedged items that share the same risk (such as a group of customer accounts). Hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges is mainly driven by payment frequency mismatch between the hedging instrument and the underlying hedged item.\n\nThe hedged risk is determined as the variability of future cash flows arising from changes in the designated benchmark interest and/or foreign exchange rates.",

This risk arises from the fluctuation in spot exchange rates between the functional currency of the subsidiaries and the Group's presentation currency, which causes the value of the investment to vary.\n\nThe Group's policy is to hedge these exposures only when not doing so would be expected to have a significant impact on the regulatory ratios of the Group and its banking subsidiaries. The Group uses foreign exchange forwards to manage the effect of exchange rates on its net investments in foreign subsidiaries.\n\n## Hedging instruments and ineffectiveness\n\n|                                           | 2023 Changes in    | 2023 Changes in   | 2023 Changes in     | 2023 Changes in                           | 2023 Changes in                                     | 2023 Changes in               | 2023 Changes in                     |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                           |                    |                   |                     | Change in   fair value used  to calculate | the value of   the hedging                          |                               | Amount                              |\n|                                           | Carrying amount    | Carrying amount   | Carrying amount     |                                           | instrument                                          | Ineffectiveness               | reclassified                        |\n|                                           | Notional           | Asset             |                     | hedge  ineffectiveness 1                  | recognised                                          | recognised in  profit or loss | from reserves                       |\n|                                           | $million           | $million          | Liability  $million | $million                                  | in OCI  $million                                    | $million                      | to income  $million                 |\n| Derivative forward   currency contracts 2 | 15,436             | 32                | 41                  | 215                                       | 215                                                 | -

Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar lending and borrowing\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group purchases securities (a reverse repurchase agreement - 'reverse repo') typically with financial institutions subject to a commitment to resell or return the securities at a predetermined price. These securities are not included in the balance sheet as the Group does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership, however they are recorded off-balance sheet as collateral received. Consideration paid (or cash collateral provided) is accounted for as a loan asset at amortised cost unless it is managed on a fair value basis or designated at fair value through profit or loss. In majority of cases through the contractual terms of a reverse repo arrangement, the Group as the transferee of the security collateral has the right to sell or repledge the asset concerned.\n\nThe Group also sells securities (a repurchase agreement - 'repo') subject to a commitment to repurchase or redeem the securities at a predetermined price. The securities are retained on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and these securities are disclosed as pledged collateral. Consideration received (or cash collateral received) is accounted for as a financial liability at amortised cost unless it is either mandatorily classified as fair value through profit or loss or irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition.\n\nRepo and reverse repo transactions typically entitle the Group and its counterparties to have recourse to assets similar to those provided as collateral in the event of a default. Securities sold subject to repos, either by way of a Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA), or through a securities sale and Total Return Swap (TRS) continue to be recognised on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially the associated risks and rewards of the securities (the TRS is not recognised). The counterparty liability is included in deposits by banks or customer accounts, as appropriate. Assets sold under repurchase agreements are considered encumbered as the Group cannot pledge these to obtain funding.\n\n## Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending\n\n|                                   | 2023  $million   | 2022  $million   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Banks                             | 32,286           | 24,932           |\n| Customers                         | 65,295           | 65,035           |\n|                                   | 97,581           | 89,967           |\n| Of which:                         |                  |                  |\n| Fair value through profit or loss | 81,847           | 64,491           |\n| Banks                             | 30,548           | 23,954           |\n| Customers                         | 51,299           | 40,537           |\n| Held at amortised cost            | 15,734           | 25,476           |\n| Banks                             | 1,738            | 978              |\n| Customers                         | 13,996           | 24,498           |",

        "page_content": "## 17. Goodwill and intangible assets\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of associates is included in Investments in associates and joint ventures. Goodwill included in intangible assets is assessed at each balance sheet date for impairment and carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Detailed calculations are performed based on forecasting expected cash flows of the relevant cash-generating units (CGUs) and discounting these at an appropriate discount rate, the determination of which requires the exercise of judgement. Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing. CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group which generates separate cash inflows and at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. These are equal to or smaller than the Group's reportable segments (as set out in Note 2) as the Group views its reportable segments on a global basis. The major CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are set out in the CGU table (page 425).\n\n## Other accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill is based on the application of judgements including the basis of goodwill impairment calculation assumptions. Judgement is also applied in determination of CGUs.\n\nEstimates include forecasts used for determining cash flows for CGUs, the appropriate long-term growth rates to use and discount rates which factor in country risk-free rates and applicable risk premiums. The Group undertakes an annual assessment to evaluate whether the carrying value of goodwill is impaired. The estimation of future cash flows and the level to which they are discounted is inherently uncertain and requires significant judgement and is subject to potential change over time.\n\n## Acquired intangibles\n\nAt the date of acquisition of a subsidiary or associate, intangible assets which are deemed separable and that arise from contractual or other legal rights are capitalised and included within the net identifiable assets acquired. These intangible assets are initially measured at fair value, which reflects market expectations of the probability that the future economic benefits embodied in the asset will flow to the entity and are amortised on the basis of their expected useful lives (4 to 16 years). At each balance sheet date, these assets are assessed for indicators of impairment. In the event that an asset's carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount, the asset is written down immediately to the recoverable amount.\n\n## Computer software\n\nAcquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.\n\nInternally generated software represents substantially all of the total software capitalised. Direct costs of the development of separately identifiable internally generated software are capitalised where it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the software will flow from its use. These costs include staff remuneration costs such as salaries, statutory payments and share-based payments, materials, service providers and contractors provided their time is directly attributable to the software build. Costs incurred in the ongoing maintenance of software are expensed immediately when incurred. Internally generated software is amortised over each asset's useful life to a maximum of 10-years. On an annual basis software assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, including assessing for indicators of impairment. Indicators of impairment include loss of business relevance, obsolescence, exit of the business to which the software relates, technological changes, change in use of the asset, reduction in useful life, plans to reduce usage or scope.\n\nFor capitalised software that is internally generated, judgement is required to determine which costs relate to research (expensed) and which costs relate to development (capitalised). Further judgement is required to determine the technical feasibility of completing the software such that it will be available for use. Estimates are used to determine how the software will generate probable future economic benefits: these estimates include cost savings, income increases, balance sheet improvements, improved functionality or improved asset safeguarding.\n\nSoftware as a Service (SaaS) is a contractual arrangement that conveys the right to receive access to the supplier's software application over the contract term. As such, the Group does not have control and as a result recognises an operating expense for these costs over the contract term. Certain costs, including customisation costs related to implementation of the SaaS may meet the definition of an intangible asset in their own right if it is separately identifiable and control is established. These costs are capitalised if it is expected to provide the Group with future economic benefits flowing from the underlying resource and the Group can restrict others from accessing those benefits.",

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated at the date of acquisition to a CGU. Goodwill is considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the relevant CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Indicators of impairment include changes in the economic performance and outlook of the region, including geopolitical changes, changes in market value of regional investments, large credit defaults and strategic decisions to exit certain regions. The recoverable amounts for all the CGUs were measured based on value in use (VIU). The calculation of VIU for each CGU is calculated using five-year cashflow projections and an estimated terminal value based on a perpetuity value after year five. The cashflow projections are based on forecasts approved by management up to 2028. The perpetuity terminal value amount is calculated using year five cashflows using long-term GDP growth rates. All cashflows are discounted using discount rates which reflect market rates appropriate to the CGU. Post-tax discount rates are used to calculate the VIU using the post-tax cashflows. The post-tax discount rate is subsequently grossed up to pre-tax discount rate. The calculated VIU using post-tax and pre-tax discount rate is the same.\n\nThe goodwill allocated to each CGU and key assumptions used in determining the recoverable amounts are set out below and are solely estimates for the purposes of assessing impairment of acquired goodwill.\n\n|                                                 | 2023               | 2023                              | 2023                                            | 2022               | 2022                              | 2022                                            |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash-generating unit                            | Goodwill  $million | Pre-Tax Discount  rates  per cent | Long-term  forecast GDP  growth rates  per cent | Goodwill  $million | Pre-Tax Discount  rates  per cent | Long-term  forecast GDP  growth rates  per cent |\n| Country CGUs                                    |                    |                                   |                                                 |                    |                                   |                                                 |\n| Asia                                            | 1,036              |                                   |                                                 | 1,032              |                                   |                                                 |\n| Hong Kong                                       | 357                | 12.9                              | 1.6                                             | 357                | 12.4                              | 1.7                                             |\n| Taiwan                                          | 333                | 12.4                              | 1.5                                             | 333                | 11.3                              | 1.7                                             |\n| Singapore                                       | 346                | 13.9                              | 2.1                                             | 342                | 12.3                              | 2.3                                             |\n| Africa & Middle East                            | 80                 |                                   |                                                 | 85                 |                                   |                                                 |\n| Pakistan                                        | 31                 | 35.5                              | 3.2                                             | 36                 | 30.9                              | 5.9                                             |\n| Bahrain                                         | 49                 | 12.4                              | 0.5                                             | 49                 | 16.6                              | 0.7                                             |\n| Global CGUs                                     | 1,313              |                                   |                                                 | 1,354              |                                   |                                                 |\n| Global Private Banking                          | 83                 | 15.3                              | 1.9                                             | 83                 | 14.5                              | 2.0                                             |\n| Corporate, Commercial &   Institutional Banking | 1,230              | 15.7                              | 2.3                                             | 1,271              | 14.7                              | 2.5                                             |\n|                                                 | 2,429              |                                   |                                                 | 2,471              |                                   |                                                 |",

Similarly, the GDP rates will need to decrease by 2.36 per cent and cashflows would need to decrease by 13.8 per cent.\n\n## Acquired intangibles\n\nThese primarily comprise those items recognised as part of the acquisitions of Union Bank (now amalgamated into Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Limited), Hsinchu (now amalgamated into Standard Chartered Bank (Taiwan) Limited), Pembroke, American Express Bank and ABSA's custody business in Africa.

The accounting policy for lease assets is set out in Note 19.\n\n|                                                           | 2023               | 2023                | 2023                               | 2023                                 | 2023                                | 2023            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|\n|                                                           | Premises  $million | Equipment  $million | Operating   lease assets  $million | Leased   premises   assets  $million | Leased  equipment  assets  $million | Total  $million |\n| Cost or valuation                                         |                    |                     |                                    |                                      |                                     |                 |\n| At 1 January                                              | 1,773              | 840                 | 4,420                              | 1,652                                | 29                                  | 8,714           |\n| Exchange translation differences                          | (27)               | (22)                | -                                  | (5)                                  | (3)                                 | (57)            |\n| Additions 1                                               | 45                 | 114                 | -                                  | 286                                  | 1                                   | 446             |\n| Disposals and fully depreciated assets  written off       | (68)\u00b2              | (122)\u00b2              | (4,420)\u00b3                           | (69)                                 | (9)                                 | (4,688)         |\n| Classified as held for sale                               | 18                 | -                   | -                                  | -                                    | -                                   | 18              |\n| As at 31 December                                         | 1,741              | 810                 | -                                  | 1,864                                | 18                                  | 4,433           |\n| Depreciation                                              |                    |                     |                                    |                                      |                                     |                 |\n| Accumulated at 1 January                                  | 678                | 575                 | 1,185                              | 730                                  | 24                                  | 3,192           |\n| Exchange translation differences                          | (21)               | (17)                | 1                                  | (25)                                 | (1)                                 | (63)            |\n| Charge for the year                                       | 77                 | 99                  | 27                                 | 238                                  | 4                                   | 445             |\n| Impairment charge                                         | 3                  | -                   | -                                  | 9                                    | -                                   | 12              |\n| Attributable to assets sold, transferred   or written off | (47)\u00b2              | (122)\u00b2              | (1,213)\u00b3                           | (38)                                 | (9)                                 | (1,429)         |\n| Classified as held for sale                               | 2                  | -                   | -                                  | -                                    | -                                   | 2               |\n| Accumulated at 31 December                                | 692                | 535                 | -                                  | 914                                  | 18                                  | 2,159           |\n| Net book amount at 31 December                            | 1,049              | 275                 | -                                  | 950                                  | -                                   | 2,274           |\n\n- 2.

As at 31 December 2022, this consisted of 99 commercial aircraft of which 97 were narrow-bodies and 2 were wide-bodies. The leases were classified as operating leases as they did not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of the assets. As at 31 December 2022, these assets had a net book value of $3,235 million. Refer note 6 Other operating income for the disposal gain and the associated rental income, up to the date of their disposal.\n\nUnder these leases up to the date of disposal, the lessee was responsible for the maintenance and servicing of the aircraft during the lease term while the Group receives rental income and assumes the risks of the residual value of the aircraft at the end of the lease.",

Leased assets\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nWhere the Group is a lessee and the lease is deemed in scope, it recognises a liability equal to the present value of lease payments over the lease term, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate applicable in the economic environment of the lease. The liability is recognised in 'Other liabilities'. A corresponding right-of-use asset equal to the liability, adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, is recognised in 'Property, plant and equipment'. The lease term includes any extension options contained in the contract that the Group is reasonably certain it will exercise.\n\nThe Group subsequently depreciates the right-of-use asset using the straight-line method over the lease term and measures the lease liability using the effective interest method. Depreciation on the asset is recognised in 'Depreciation and amortisation', and interest on the lease liability is recognised in 'Interest expense'.\n\nIf a leased premise, or a physically distinct portion of a premise such as an individual floor, is deemed by management to be surplus to the Group's needs and action has been taken to abandon the space before the lease expires, this is considered an indicator of impairment. An impairment loss is recognised if the right-of-use asset, or portion thereof, has a carrying value in excess of its value-in-use when taking into account factors such as the ability and likelihood of obtaining a subtenant.\n\nThe judgements in determining lease balances are the determination of whether the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise extension options present in lease contracts. On initial recognition, the Group considers a range of characteristics such as premises function, regional trends and the term remaining on the lease to determine whether it is reasonably certain that a contractual right to extend a lease will be exercised. Where a change in assumption is confirmed by the local property management team, a remeasurement is performed in the Group-managed vendor system.\n\nThe estimates are the determination of incremental borrowing rates in the respective economic environments. The Group uses third-party broker quotes to estimate its USD cost of senior unsecured borrowing, then uses cross currency swap pricing information to determine the equivalent cost of borrowing in other currencies. If it is not possible to estimate an incremental borrowing rate through this process, other proxies such as local government bond yields are used.\n\nThe Group primarily enters lease contracts that grant it the right to use premises such as office buildings and retail branches.\n\nExisting lease liabilities may change in future periods due to changes in assumptions or decisions to exercise lease renewal or termination options, changes in payments due to renegotiations of market rental rates as permitted by those contracts and changes to payments due to rent being contractually linked to an inflation index. In general the re-measurement of a lease liability under these circumstances leads to an equal change to the right-of-use asset balance, with no immediate effect on the income statement.\n\nThe total cash outflow during the year for premises and equipment leases was $283 million (2022: $310 million).\n\nThe right-of-use asset balances and depreciation charges are disclosed in Note 18. The lease liability balances are disclosed in Note 23 and the interest expense on lease liabilities is disclosed in Note 3.\n\n## Maturity analysis\n\nThe maturity profile for lease liabilities associated with leased premises and equipment assets is as follows:\n\n|                                       | 2023                          | 2023                                          | 2023                                            | 2023                              | 2023             |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|\n|                                       | One year   or less   $million | Between   one year   and two years   $million | Between   two years   and five years  $million  | More than   five years   $million | Total   $million |\n| Other liabilities - lease liabilities | 248                           | 203                                           | 373                                             | 410                               | 1234             |\n|                                       | 2022                          | 2022                                          | 2022                                            | 2022                              | 2022             |\n|                                       | One year   or less   $million | Between   one year   and two years   $million | Between   two years   and five years   $million | More than   five years   $million | Total   $million |\n| Other liabilities - lease liabilities | 272                           | 239                                           | 437                                             | 310                               | 1,258            |",

Contingent liabilities and commitments\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts and any loan commitments issued at below-market interest rates are initially recognised at their fair value as a financial liability, and subsequently measured at the higher of the initial value less the cumulative amount of income recognised and their expected credit loss provision. Loan commitments may be designated at fair value through profit or loss where that is the business model under which such contracts are held. Notional values of financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments are disclosed in the table below.\n\nFinancial guarantees, trade credits and irrevocable letters of credit are the notional values of contracts issued by the Group's Transaction Banking business for which an obligation to make a payment has not arisen at the reporting date. Transaction Banking will issue contracts to clients and counterparties of clients, whereby in the event the holder of the contract is not paid, the Group will reimburse the holder of the contract for the actual financial loss suffered. These contracts have various legal forms such as letters of credit, guarantee contracts and performance bonds. The contracts are issued to facilitate trade through export and import business, provide guarantees to financial institutions where the Group has a local presence, as well as guaranteeing project financing involving large construction projects undertaken by sovereigns and corporates. The contracts may contain performance clauses which require the counterparty performing services or providing goods to meet certain conditions before a right to payment is achieved, however the Group does not guarantee this performance. The Group will only guarantee the credit of the counterparty paying for the services or goods.\n\nCommitments are where the Group has confirmed its intention to provide funds to a customer or on behalf of a customer under prespecified terms and conditions in the form of loans, overdrafts, future guarantees whether cancellable or not and the Group has not made payments at the balance sheet date; those instruments are included in these financial statements as commitments. Commitments and contingent liabilities are generally considered on demand as the Group may have to honour them, or the client may draw down at any time.\n\nCapital commitments are contractual commitments the Group has entered into to purchase non-financial assets.\n\nThe table below shows the contract or underlying principal amounts of unmatured off-balance sheet transactions at the balance sheet date. The contract or underlying principal amounts indicate the volume of business outstanding and do not represent amounts at risk.\n\n|                                                                                                 | 2023  $million   | 2022  $million   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Financial guarantees and trade credits                                                          |                  |                  |\n| Financial guarantees, trade credits and irrevocable letters of credit                           | 74,414           | 60,410           |\n|                                                                                                 | 74,414           | 60,410           |\n| Commitments                                                                                     |                  |                  |\n| Undrawn formal standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments to lend                   |                  |                  |\n| One year and over                                                                               | 78,356           | 69,597           |\n| Less than one year                                                                              | 33,092           | 31,688           |\n| Unconditionally cancellable                                                                     | 70,942           | 67, 3 8 3        |\n|                                                                                                 | 182,390          | 168,668          |\n| Capital Commitments                                                                             |                  |                  |\n| Contracted capital expenditure approved by the directors but not provided for in these accounts | 217              | 257              |\n\nAs set out in Note 26, the Group has contingent liabilities in respect of certain legal and regulatory matters for which it is not practicable to estimate the financial impact as there are many factors that may affect the range of possible outcomes.",

Legal and regulatory matters\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group receives legal claims against it in a number of jurisdictions and is subject to regulatory and enforcement investigations and proceedings from time to time. Apart from the matters described below, the Group currently considers none of the ongoing claims, investigations or proceedings to be individually material. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters currently not considered to be material may not ultimately be material to the Group's results in a particular reporting period depending on, among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the matter(s) and the results otherwise reported for such period.\n\nSince 2014, the Group has been named as a defendant in a series of lawsuits that have been filed in the United States District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York against a number of banks on behalf of plaintiffs who are, or are relatives of, victims of attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan. The plaintiffs in each of these lawsuits have alleged that the defendant banks aided and abetted the unlawful conduct of parties with connections to terrorist organisations in breach of the United States Anti-Terrorism Act. None of these lawsuits specify the amount of damages claimed. The Group continues to defend these lawsuits.\n\nIn January 2020, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed by the City of Philadelphia in New York State Court against 45 current and former directors and senior officers of the Group. It is alleged that the individuals breached their duties to the Group and caused a waste of corporate assets by permitting the conduct that gave rise to the costs and losses to the Group related to legacy conduct and control issues. In March 2021, an amended complaint was served in which Standard Chartered Bank and seven individuals were removed from the case. Standard Chartered PLC and Standard Chartered Holdings Limited remained as named 'nominal defendants' in the complaint. In May 2021, Standard Chartered PLC filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In February 2022, the New York State Court ruled in favour of Standard Chartered PLC's motion to dismiss the complaint. The plaintiffs are pursuing an appeal against the February 2022 ruling. A hearing date for the plaintiffs' appeal is awaited.\n\nSince October 2020, four lawsuits have been filed in the English High Court against Standard Chartered PLC on behalf of more than 200 shareholders in relation to alleged untrue and/or misleading statements and/or omissions in information published by Standard Chartered PLC in its rights issue prospectuses of 2008, 2010 and 2015 and/or public statements regarding the Group's historic sanctions, money laundering and financial crime compliance issues. These lawsuits have been brought under sections 90 and 90A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. These lawsuits are at an early procedural stage.\n\nBernard Madoff's 2008 confession to running a Ponzi scheme through Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS) gave rise to a number of lawsuits against the Group. BMIS and the Fairfield funds (which invested in BMIS) are in bankruptcy and liquidation, respectively. Between 2010 and 2012, five lawsuits were brought against the Group by the BMIS bankruptcy trustee and the Fairfield funds' liquidators, in each case seeking to recover funds paid to the Group's clients pursuant to redemption requests made prior to BMIS' bankruptcy filing. The total amount sought in these cases exceeds USD 300 million, excluding any pre-judgment interest that may be awarded. The four lawsuits commenced by the Fairfield funds' liquidators have been dismissed and the appeals of those dismissals by the funds' liquidators are ongoing.\n\nAs has been reported in the press, a number of Korean banks, including Standard Chartered Bank Korea, have sold equitylinked securities ('ELS') to customers, the redemption values of which are determined by the performance of various stock indices. Standard Chartered Bank Korea sold relevant ELS to its customers with a notional value of approximately USD900m. Due to the performance of the Hang Seng China Enterprise Index, it is anticipated that several thousand Standard Chartered Bank Korea customers may redeem their ELS at a loss. The value of Standard Chartered Bank Korea customers' anticipated losses is subject to fluctuation as the ELS mature on various dates through 2026 and could total several hundred million USD. Standard Chartered Bank Korea may be faced with claims by customers and its regulator, the Financial Supervisory Service, to cover part or all of those anticipated losses and also may face regulatory penalties\n\nThe Group has concluded that the threshold for recording provisions pursuant to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets is not met with respect to the above matters; however, the outcomes of these matters are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict.\n\nIn 2023, three legal cases concluded in which allegations of corruption had been made against the Group or its employees, none of which resulted in liability being established.",

Share capital, other equity instruments and reserves\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nSecurities which carry a discretionary coupon and have no fixed maturity or redemption date are classified as other equity instruments.

Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders' equity of the Group and/or the Company.\n\n|                                                   | Number of  ordinary   shares  millions   | Ordinary   share   capital 1 $million   | Ordinary   Share   premium  $million   | Preference   Share   premium 2 $million   | Total share  capital and   share premium  $million   | Other   equity  instruments  $million   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| At 1 January 2022                                 | 3,079                                    | 1,539                                   | 3,989                                  | 1,494                                     | 7, 0 2 2                                             | 6,254                                   |\n| Cancellation of shares including   share buy-back | (184)                                    | (92)                                    | -                                      | -                                         | (92)                                                 | -                                       |\n| Additional Tier 1 equity issuance                 | -                                        | -                                       | -                                      | -                                         | -                                                    | 1,240                                   |\n| Additional Tier 1 equity redemption               | -                                        | -                                       | -                                      | -                                         | -                                                    | (990)                                   |\n| At 31 December 2022                               | 2,895                                    | 1,447                                   | 3,989                                  | 1,494                                     | 6,930                                                | 6,504                                   |\n| Cancellation of shares including   share buy-back | (230)                                    | (115)                                   | -                                      | -                                         | (115)                                                | -                                       |\n| Additional Tier 1 equity issuance                 | -                                        | -                                       | -                                      | -                                         | -                                                    | -                                       |\n| Additional Tier 1 redemption                      | -                                        | -                                       | -                                      | -                                         | -                                                    | (992)                                   |\n| At 31 December 2023                               | 2,665                                    | 1,332                                   | 3,989                                  | 1,494                                     | 6,815                                                | 5,512                                   |\n\n- 1 Issued and fully paid ordinary shares of 50 cents each\n- 2   Includes preference share capital of $75,000\n\n## Share buy-back\n\nOn 16 February 2023, the Group announced the buy-back programme for a share buy-back of its ordinary shares of $0.50 each.

        "page_content": "## 28. Share capital, other equity instruments and reserves continued\n\n## Reserves\n\nThe constituents of the reserves are summarised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The capital reserve represents the exchange difference on redenomination of share capital and share premium from sterling to US dollars in 2001. The capital redemption reserve represents the nominal value of share capital and preference shares redeemed\n- \u00b7 The amounts in the 'Capital and Merger Reserve' represents the premium arising on shares issued using a cash box financing structure, which required the Company to create a merger reserve under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006. Shares were issued using this structure in 2005 and 2006 to assist in the funding of Korea ($1.9 billion) and Taiwan ($1.2 billion) acquisitions, in 2008, 2010 and 2015 for the shares issued by way of a rights issue, primarily for capital maintenance requirements and for the shares issued in 2009 by way of an accelerated book build, the proceeds of which were used in the ordinary course of business of the Group. The funding raised by the 2008, 2010 and 2015 rights issues and 2009 share issue was fully retained within the Company. Of the 2015 funding, $1.5 billion was used to subscribe to additional equity in Standard Chartered Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Apart from the Korea, Taiwan and Standard Chartered Bank funding, the merger reserve is considered realised and distributable.\n- \u00b7 Own credit adjustment reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses on financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss relating to own credit. On derecognition of applicable instruments the balance of any OCA will not be recycled to the income statement, but will be transferred within equity to retained earnings\n- \u00b7 Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) debt reserve represents the unrealised fair value gains and losses in respect of financial assets classified as FVOCI, net of expected credit losses. Gains and losses are deferred in this reserve and are reclassified to the income statement when the underlying asset is sold, matures or becomes impaired.\n- \u00b7 FVOCI equity reserve represents unrealised fair value gains and losses in respect of financial assets classified as FVOCI. Gains and losses are recorded in this reserve and never recycled to the income statement\n- \u00b7 Cash flow hedge reserve represents the effective portion of the gains and losses on derivatives that meet the criteria for these types of hedges. Gains and losses are deferred in this reserve and are reclassified to the income statement when the underlying hedged item affects profit and loss or when a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur\n- \u00b7 Translation reserve represents the cumulative foreign exchange gains and losses on translation of the net investment of the Group in foreign operations. Since 1 January 2004, gains and losses are deferred to this reserve and are reclassified to the income statement when the underlying foreign operation is disposed. Gains and losses arising from derivatives used as hedges of net investments are netted against the foreign exchange gains and losses on translation of the net investment of the foreign operations\n- \u00b7 Retained earnings represents profits and other comprehensive income earned by the Group and Company in the current and prior periods, together with the after tax increase relating to equity-settled share options, less dividend distributions, own shares held (treasury shares) and share buy-backs\n\nA substantial part of the Group's reserves is held in overseas subsidiary undertakings and branches, principally to support local operations or to comply with local regulations. The maintenance of local regulatory capital ratios could potentially restrict the amount of reserves which can be remitted. In addition, if these overseas reserves were to be remitted, further unprovided taxation liabilities might arise.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the distributable reserves of Standard Chartered PLC (the Company) were $14.7 billion (31 December 2022: $13 billion). Distributable reserves of SC PLC were $14.7 billion, which are calculated from the Merger reserve and Retained Earnings with consideration for restricted items in line with sections 830 and 831 of the Companies Act 2006.",

Retirement benefit obligations\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group operates pension and other post-retirement benefit plans around the world, which can be categorised into defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans.\n\n- \u00b7 For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension plans on a statutory or contractual basis, and such amounts are charged to operating expenses. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.\n- \u00b7 For defined benefit plans, which promise levels of payments where the future cost is not known with certainty:\n- -   the accounting obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.\n- -  Actuarial gains and losses that arise are recognised in shareholders' equity and presented in the statement of other comprehensive income in the period they arise.\n- -  The Group determines the net interest expense on the net defined benefit liability for the year by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability during the year as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense, the cost of the accrual of new benefits, benefit enhancements (or reductions) and administration expenses met directly from plan assets are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they were incurred.\n\n## Other accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThere are many factors that affect the measurement of the retirement benefit obligations. This measurement requires the use of estimates, such as discount rates, inflation, pension increases, salary increases, and life expectancies which are inherently uncertain. The table below summarises how these assumptions are set:\n\n| Assumption              | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Discount rate           | Determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high-quality  corporate bonds (or, in countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, government bonds)   of a currency and term consistent with the currency and term of the post-employment benefit  obligations. This is the approach adopted across all our geographies.                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Inflation               | Where there are inflation-linked bonds available (e.g. United Kingdom and the eurozone), the Group  derives inflation based on the market on those bonds, with the market yield adjusted in respect of  the United Kingdom to take account of the fact that liabilities are linked to Consumer Price Index  inflation, whereas the reference bonds are linked to Retail Price Index inflation. Where no inflation- linked bonds exist, we determine inflation assumptions based on a combination of long-term  forecasts and short-term inflation data. |\n| Salary growth           | Salary growth assumptions reflect the Group's long-term expectations, taking into account future  business plans and macroeconomic data (primarily expected future long-term inflation).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Demographic assumptions | Demographic assumptions, including mortality and turnover rates, are typically set based on   the assumptions used in the most recent actuarial funding valuation, and will generally use   industry standard tables, adjusted where appropriate to reflect recent historic experience and/or  future expectations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n\nThe sensitivity of the liabilities to changes in these assumptions is shown in the Note below.\n\nRetirement benefit obligations comprise:\n\n|                                       |   2023  $million |   2022  $million |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Defined benefit plans obligation      |              166 |              128 |\n| Defined contribution plans obligation |               17 |               18 |\n| Net obligation                        |              183 |              146 |\n\nRetirement benefit charge comprises:\n\n|                                |   2023  $million |   2022  $million |\n|--------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Defined benefit plans          |               66 |               58 |\n| Defined contribution plans 1   |              365 |              332 |\n| Charge against profit (Note 7) |              431 |              390 |\n\nThe Group operates over 60 defined benefit plans across its geographies, many of which are closed to new entrants who now join defined contribution arrangements. The aim of all these plans is, as part of the Group's commitment to financial wellbeing for employees, to give employees the opportunity to save appropriately for retirement in a way that is consistent with local regulations, taxation requirements and market conditions. The defined benefit plans expose the Group to currency risk, interest rate risk, investment risk and actuarial risks such as longevity risk.",

        "page_content": "## 30. Retirement benefit obligations continued\n\nThe material holdings of government and corporate bonds shown partially hedge movements in the liabilities resulting from interest rate and inflation changes. Setting aside movements from other drivers such as currency fluctuation, the reduction in discount rates in most countries with material pension liabilities over 2023 has led to higher liabilities. This has been partly offset by increases in the value of bonds held as well as good performance of growth assets such as equities, leading to an increase in the pension deficit reported. These movements are shown as actuarial gains and losses in the tables below. Contributions into a number of plans in excess of the amounts required to fund benefits accruing have also partially offset the increase in the net deficit over the year.\n\nThe disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by independent qualified actuaries based on the most recent full actuarial valuations updated, where necessary, to 31 December 2023.\n\n## UK Fund\n\nThe Standard Chartered Pension Fund (the 'UK Fund') is the Group's largest pension plan, representing 53 per cent (31 December 2022: 53 per cent) of total pension liabilities. The UK Fund is set up under a trust that is legally separate from the Bank (its formal sponsor) and, as required by UK legislation, at least one third of the trustee directors are nominated by members; the remainder are appointed by the Bank. The trustee directors have a fiduciary duty to members and are responsible for governing the UK Fund in accordance with its Trust Deed and Rules.\n\nThe UK Fund was closed to new entrants from 1 July 1998 and closed to the accrual of new benefits from 1 April 2018: all UK employees are now offered membership of a defined contribution plan.\n\nThe financial position of the UK Fund is regularly assessed by an independent qualified actuary. The funding valuation as at 31 December 2020 was completed in December 2021 by the Scheme Actuary, T Kripps of Willis Towers Watson, using assumptions different from those below, and agreed with the UK Fund trustee. It showed that the UK Fund was 92% funded at that date, revealing a past service deficit of $162 million (\u00a3127 million).\n\nTo repair the deficit, three annual cash payments each of $42 million (\u00a332.9 million) were agreed, with the first of these paid in December 2021, and two further instalments to be paid in December 2022 and December 2023. However, the agreement allowed that, if the funding position improves to being at or near a surplus in future years, the payments due in 2022 and 2023 will be reduced or eliminated. Based on the funding positions at the agreed measurement point of mid-year, no payment was made in December 2022, and a reduced payment of $8m (\u00a36m) was made in December 2023. As part of the 2020 valuation, in order to provide security for future contributions an additional $64 million nominal gilts (\u00a350 million) were purchased and transferred into the existing escrow account of $140 million gilts (\u00a3110 million), topping it up to $204 million. Under the terms of the 2020 valuation agreement, the USD8m payment made in December 2023 is deductible from the funds held in escrow.\n\nThe Group has not recognised any additional liability under IFRIC 14, as the Bank has control of any pension surplus under the Trust Deed and Rules.\n\n## Virgin Media vs NTL Pension Trustees II Ltd\n\nFollowing the June 2023 ruling in the case of Virgin Media vs NTL Pension Trustees II Limited, the Bank has considered the potential impact of this ruling on the UK Fund and is of the view that any potential impact is not expected to be material.\n\n## Overseas plans\n\nThe principal overseas defined benefit arrangements operated by the Group are in Hong Kong, India, Jersey, Korea, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States of America (US). Plans in Hong Kong, India, Korea, Taiwan and UAE remain open for the accrual of future benefits.\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nThe principal financial assumptions used at 31 December 2023 were:\n\n|                              | 2023         | 2023               | 2023                                        | 2022         | 2022               | 2022                                        |\n|------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|                              | UK Funded  % | Overseas Plans 1 % | Unfunded Plans 2 %                          | UK Funded  % | Overseas Plans 1 % | Unfunded Plans 2 %                          |\n| Discount rate                | 4.6          | 1.2 - 4.9          | 3.1 - 7.4                                   | 4.8          | 1.2 - 5.4          | 3.7 - 7.6                                   |\n| Price inflation              | 2.5          | 2.0 - 2.9          | 2.0 - 5.0                                   | 2.6          | 1.0 - 3.1          | 2.0 - 4.0                                   |\n| Salary increases             | n/a          | 3.5 - 4.5          | 4.0 - 8.5                                   | n/a          | 3.5 - 4.5          | 4.0 - 7.8                                   |\n| Pension increases            | 2.3          | 2.9                | 0.0 - 2.3                                   | 2.4          | 3.1                | 0.0 - 2.4                                   |\n| Post-retirement medical rate |              |                    | 8% in 2023  reducing by  0.5% per  annum to |              |                    | 7% in 2022  reducing by  0.5% per  annum to |\n\nThe principal non-financial assumptions are those made for UK life expectancy.

Scaling factors of 92% for male pensioners, 92% for female pensioners, 92% for male dependants and 82% for female dependants have been applied.",

Retirement benefit obligations continued\n\nThe resulting assumptions for life expectancy for the UK Fund are that a male member currently aged 60 will live for 27 years (2022: 27 years) and a female member for 30 years (2022: 30 years) and a male member currently aged 40 will live for 29 years (2022: 29 years) and a female member for 32 years (2022: 32 years) after their 60th birthdays.\n\nBoth financial and non-financial assumptions can be expected to change in the future, which would affect the value placed on the liabilities. For example, changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the amounts shown below:\n\n- \u00b7 If the discount rate increased by 25 basis points the liability would reduce by approximately $35 million for the UK Fund |(2022: $30 million) and $20 million for the other plans (2022: $15 million)\n- \u00b7 If the rate of inflation increased by 25 basis points the liability, allowing for the consequent impact on pension and salary increases, would increase by approximately $20 million for the UK Fund (2022: $20 million) and $15 million for the other plans (2022: $15 million)\n- \u00b7 If the rate of salary growth relative to inflation increased by 25 basis points the liability would increase by nil for the UK Fund (2022: nil) and approximately $10 million for the other plans (2022: $10 million)\n- \u00b7 If longevity expectations increased by one year the liability would increase by approximately $35 million for the UK Fund (2022: $35 million) and $10 million for the other plans (2022: $10 million)\n\nAlthough this analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity to the main assumptions. While changes in other assumptions would also have an impact, the effect would not be as significant.\n\n## Profile of plan obligations\n\n|                                                       | Funded plans   | Funded plans   | Unfunded   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|------------|\n|                                                       | UK Fund        | Overseas       | plans      |\n| Duration of the defined benefit obligation (in years) | 11             | 8              | 8          |\n| Duration of the defined benefit obligation -

        "page_content": "## 31. Share-based payments\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group operates equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services (measured by the fair value of the awards granted) received in exchange for the grant of the shares and awards is recognised as an expense. For deferred share awards granted as part of an annual performance award, the expense is recognised over the period from the start of the performance period to the vesting date. For example, the expense for three-year awards granted in 2024 in respect of 2023 performance, which vest in 2025-2027, is recognised as an expense over the period from 1 January 2023 to the vesting dates in 2025-2027. For all other awards, the expense is recognised over the period from the date of grant to the vesting date.\n\nFor equity-settled awards, the total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares and awards at the date of grant, which excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and growth targets). The fair value of equity instruments granted is based on market prices, if available, at the date of grant. In the absence of market prices, the fair value of the instruments is estimated using an appropriate valuation technique, such as a binomial option pricing model. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions for the number of shares and awards that are expected to vest.\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares and awards that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period. Forfeitures prior to vesting attributable to factors other than the failure to satisfy service conditions and non-market vesting conditions are treated as a cancellation and the remaining unamortised charge is debited to the income statement at the time of cancellation. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when awards in the form of options are exercised.\n\nCash-settled awards are revalued at each balance sheet date and a liability recognised on the balance sheet for all unpaid amounts, with any changes in fair value charged or credited to staff costs in the income statement until the awards are exercised. Where forfeitures occur prior to vesting that are attributable to factors other than a failure to satisfy service conditions or market-based performance conditions, the cumulative charge incurred up to the date of forfeiture is credited to the income statement.\n\n## Other accounting estimates and judgements\n\nShare-based payments involve judgement and estimation uncertainty in determining the expenses and carrying values of share awards at the balance sheet date.\n\n- \u00b7 LTIP awards are determined using an estimation of the probability of meeting certain metrics over a three-year performance period using the Monte Carlo simulation model.\n- \u00b7 Deferred shares are determined using an estimation of expected dividends.\n- \u00b7 Sharesave Plan valuations are determined using a binomial option-pricing model.\n\nThe Group operates a number of share-based arrangements for its executive directors and employees.

Share-based payments continued\n\n## 2021 Standard Chartered Share Plan (the '2021 Plan') and 2011 Standard Chartered Share Plan (the '2011 Plan')\n\nThe 2021 Plan was approved by shareholders in May 2021 and is the Group's main share plan, replacing the 2011 Plan for new awards from June 2021. It may be used to deliver various types of share awards to employees and former employees of the Group, including directors and former executive directors:\n\n- \u00b7 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards: granted with vesting subject to performance measures. Performance measures attached to awards granted previously include: relative total shareholder return (TSR); return on tangible equity (RoTE) (with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) underpin); and strategic measures. Each measure is assessed independently over a three-year period. LTIP awards have an individual conduct gateway requirement that results in the award lapsing if not met.\n- \u00b7 Deferred awards are used to deliver:\n- -  the deferred portion of variable remuneration, in line with both market practice and regulatory requirements. These awards vest in instalments on anniversaries of the award date specified at the time of grant. Deferred awards are not subject to any plan limit. This enables the Group to meet regulatory requirements relating to deferral levels, and is in line with market practice.\n- -  replacement buy-out awards to new joiners who forfeit awards on leaving their previous employers. These vest in the quarter most closely following the date when the award would have vested at the previous employer. This enables the Group to meet regulatory requirements relating to buy-outs, and is in line with market practice. In line with similar plans operated by our competitors, these awards are not subject to an annual limit and do not have any performance measures.\n\nUnder the 2021 Plan and 2011 Plan, no grant price is payable to receive an award. The remaining life of the 2021 Plan during which new awards can be made is eight years. The 2011 Plan has expired and no further awards will be granted under this plan.\n\n## Valuation - LTIP awards\n\nThe vesting of awards granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021 is subject to relative TSR performance measures, achievement of a strategic scorecard and satisfaction of RoTE (subject to a capital CET1 underpin). The vesting of awards also have additional conditions under strategic measures related to targets set for sustainability linked to business strategy. The fair value of the relative TSR component is calculated using the probability of meeting the measures over a three-year performance period, using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The value of the remaining components is based on the expected performance against the RoTE and strategic measures in the scorecard and the resulting estimated number of shares expected to vest at each reporting date. These combined values are used to determine the accounting charge.\n\nNo dividend equivalents accrue for the LTIP awards made in 2023, 2022 or 2021 and the fair value takes this into account, calculated by reference to market consensus dividend yield.\n\n| Grant date                    | 2023 13-March   | 2022 14-March   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Share price at grant date (\u00a3) | 7.40            | 4.88            |\n| Vesting period (years)        | 3-7             | 3-7             |\n| Expected divided yield (%)    | 3.1             | 3.4             |\n| Fair value (RoTE) (\u00a3)         | 1.91, 1.85      | 1.24, 1.20      |\n| Fair value (TSR) (\u00a3)          | 1.08, 1.04      | 0.70, 0.68      |\n| Fair value (Strategic) (\u00a3)    | 2.54, 2.46      | 1.65, 1.60      |\n\n## Valuation - deferred shares\n\nThe fair value for deferred awards which are not granted to material risk takers is based on 100 per cent of the face value of the shares at the date of grant as the share price will reflect expectations of all future dividends. For awards granted to material risk takers in 2023, the fair value of awards takes into account the lack of dividend equivalents, calculated by reference to market consensus dividend yield.\n\n## Deferred share awards - variable remuneration\n\n|                               | 2023                          | 2023             | 2023                          | 2023             | 2023                          | 2023                     |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Grant date                    | 18 September                  | 18 September     | 19 June                       | 19 June          | 13 March                      | 13 March                 |\n| Share price at grant date (\u00a3) | 7. 4 3                        | 7. 4 3           | 6.75                          | 6.75             | 7.40                          | 7.40                     |\n| Vesting period (years)        | Expected  dividend yield  (%) | Fair value   (\u00a3) | Expected  dividend yield  (%) | Fair value   (\u00a3) | Expected  dividend yield  (%) | Fair value   (\u00a3)         |\n| 1-3 years                     | N/A                           | 7. 4 3           | 3.3                           | 6.75             | 3.1                           | 7. 4                     |\n| 1-5 years                     | 3.0                           | 6.51             | 3.3, 3.3                      | 6.23, 5.83       | 3.1, 3.1                      | 6.85, 6.65               |\n| 3-7 years                     | -                             | -                | -                             | -                | 3.1, 3.1, 3.1, 3.1            | 6.65, 6.75,   6.35, 6.16 |",

Share-based payments continued\n\n## All Employee Sharesave Plans\n\n## Sharesave Plans\n\nThe 2013 Sharesave Plan expired in May 2023 and a new 2023 Sharesave Plan was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in May 2023. Under the 2023 Sharesave Plan, employees may open a savings contract. Employees can save up to \u00a3250 per month over three years to purchase ordinary shares in the Company at a discount of up to 20 per cent on the share price at the date of invitation (the 'option exercise price'), after which they have a period of six months to exercise the option. There are no performance measures attached to options granted under the Sharesave Plans and no grant price is payable to receive an option. In some countries in which the Group operates, it is not possible to operate Sharesave plans, typically due to securities law and regulatory restrictions. In these countries, where possible, the Group offers an equivalent cash-based alternative to its employees.\n\nThe remaining life of the 2023 Sharesave Plan during which new awards can be made is ten years. The 2013 Sharesave Plan has expired and no further awards will be granted under this plan.\n\n## Valuation - Sharesave:\n\nOptions under the Sharesave plans are valued using a binomial option-pricing model. The same fair value is applied to all employees including executive directors. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:\n\n## All Employee Sharesave Plan (Sharesave)\n\n| Grant date                    | 2023 18 September   |   2022 28 November |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| Share price at grant date (\u00a3) | 7. 3 5              |               5.8  |\n| Exercise price (\u00a3)            | 5.88                |               4.23 |\n| Vesting period (years)        | 3                   |               3    |\n| Expected volatility (%)       | 36.7                |              39.3  |\n| Expected option life (years)  | 3.5                 |               3.33 |\n| Risk-free rate (%)            | 4.48                |               3.21 |\n| Expected dividend yield (%)   | 3.0                 |               3.4  |\n| Fair value (\u00a3)                | 3.05                |               2.08 |\n\nThe expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years, or three years prior to grant.

The number of Standard Chartered PLC ordinary shares which may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2023 Sharesave Plan in any 12-month period must not exceed such number as represents 1 per cent of the ordinary share capital of Standard Chartered PLC in issue at that time.\n\nStandard Chartered PLC has been granted waivers from strict compliance with Rules 17.03A, 17.03B(1), 17.03E and 17.03(18) of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Details are set out in the market announcements made on 30 March 2023. . In relation to the waiver of strict compliance with Note 1 to 17.03(18), in 2023 no changes to the Plan rules have been proposed and therefore the Board has not been required to exercise its discretion.",

        "page_content": "## 32. Investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## Associates and joint arrangements\n\nThe Group did not have any contractual interest in joint operations.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. The Group's investment in associates and joint ventures includes goodwill identified on acquisition (net of any accumulated impairment loss).\n\nThe Group's share of its associates' and joint ventures' post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in reserves. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group's share of losses in an associate or a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.\n\nUnrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associates and joint ventures. At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any objective evidence of impairment in the investment in associates and joint ventures. Such evidence includes a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the Group's investment in an associate or joint venture below its cost, among other factors.\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe Group applies judgement in determining if it has control, joint control or significant influence over subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates respectively. These judgements are based upon identifying the relevant activities of counterparties, being those activities that significantly affect the entities returns, and further making a decision of if the Group has control over those entities, joint control, or has significant influence (being the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions but not control them).\n\nThese judgements are at times determined by equity holdings, and the voting rights associated with those holdings. However, further considerations including but not limited to board seats, advisory committee members and specialist knowledge of some decision-makers are also taken into account. Further judgement is required when determining if the Group has de-facto control over an entity even though it may hold less than 50% of the voting shares of that entity. Judgement is required to determine the relative size of the Group's shareholding when compared to the size and dispersion of other shareholders.\n\nImpairment testing of investments in associates and joint ventures, and on a Company level investments in subsidiaries is performed if there is a possible indicator of impairment. Judgement is used to determine if there is objective evidence of impairment. Objective evidence may be observable data such as losses incurred on the investment when applying the equity method, the granting of concessions as a result of financial difficulty, or breaches of contracts/regulatory fines of the associate or joint venture. Further judgement is required when considering broader indicators of impairment such as losses of active markets or ratings downgrades across key markets in which the associate or joint venture operate in.\n\nImpairment testing is based on estimates including forecasting the expected cash flows from the investments, growth rates, terminal values and the discount rate used in calculation of the present values of those cash flows. The estimation of future cash flows and the level to which they are discounted is inherently uncertain and requires significant judgement.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.\n\nIn the Company's financial statements, investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are held at cost less impairment and dividends from pre-acquisition profits received prior to 1 January 2009, if any. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated in the Group accounts.\n\n| Investments in subsidiary undertakings   | 2023  $million   | 2022  $million   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| As at 1 January                          | 60,975           | 60,429           |\n| Additions 1                              | 1,566            | 1,545            |\n| Disposal 2                               | (1,750)          | (999)            |\n| As at 31 December                        | 60,791           | 60,975           |",

The carrying amount was composed of Property, plant and equipment of $3,249 million, Goodwill and intangible assets of $23 million, Other assets of $124 million and Other liabilities of $292 million. The principal activity of these subsidiaries was the aviation finance leasing business. In Q1 2023, the aviation finance leasing business was classified as held for sale and was subsequently sold on 2nd November 2023 for a total consideration of $3,570 million. The gain on sale of the business was $309 million. In addition the Group disposed of its wholly owned subsidiaries Cardspal Pte. Ltd. and Kozagi during 2023. The gain on sale of Cardspal Pte. Ltd. and Kozagi comprised $12 million and $7 million, respectively.\n\nWhile the Group's subsidiaries are subject to local statutory capital and liquidity requirements in relation to foreign exchange remittance, these restrictions arise in the normal course of business and do not significantly restrict the Group's ability to access or use assets and settle liabilities of the Group.\n\nThe Group does not have significant restrictions on its ability to access or use its assets and settle its liabilities other than those resulting from the regulatory framework within which the banking subsidiaries operate. These frameworks require banking operations to keep certain levels of regulatory capital, liquid assets, exposure limits and comply with other required ratios. These restrictions are summarised below:\n\n## Regulatory and liquidity requirements\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital, leverage ratios, liquidity and exposure ratios which therefore restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to distribute cash or other assets to the parent company.",

At 31 December 2023, the total cash and balances with central banks was $70 billion (31 December 2022: $58 billion) of which $6 billion (31 December 2022: $9 billion) is restricted.\n\n## Statutory requirements\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements not to make distributions of capital and unrealised profits to the parent company, generally to maintain solvency. These requirements restrict the ability of subsidiaries to remit dividends to the Group. Certain subsidiaries are also subject to local exchange control regulations which provide for restrictions on exporting capital from the country other than through normal dividends.\n\n## Contractual requirements\n\nThe encumbered assets in the balance sheet of the Group's subsidiaries are not available for transfer around the Group.\n\nShare of profit from investment in associates and joint ventures comprises:\n\n|                                            | 2023  $million   | 2022  $million   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Loss from investment in joint ventures     | (13)             | (7)              |\n| Profit from investment in associates       | 154              | 163              |\n| Total                                      | 141              | 156              |\n| Interests in associates and joint ventures | 2023  $million   | 2022  $million   |\n| As at 1 January                            | 1,631            | 2,147            |\n| Exchange translation difference            | 16               | (232)            |\n| Additions\u00b9                                 | 64               | 26               |\n| Share of profits                           | 141              | 156              |\n| Dividend received\u2074                         | (11)             | (58)             |\n| Disposals                                  | -                | (1)              |\n| Impairment 2                               | (872)            | (336)            |\n| Share of FVOCI and Other reserves          | (7)              | (79)             |\n| Other movements 3                          | 4                | 8                |\n| As at 31 December                          | 966              | 1,631            |\n\nDuring 2023 the Group disposed of its 13.09% share of investment in associate Metaco SA for a total consideration of $18 million. The entire amount was recognised as gain on sale.\n\nA complete list of the Group's interest in associates is included in Note 40. The Group's principal associates are:\n\n| Associate                             | Nature of  activities   | Main areas of  operation   |   Group interest in  ordinary share  capital % |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| China Bohai Bank                      | Banking                 | China                      |                                          16.26 |\n| CurrencyFair Limited Exchange Ireland | Banking                 | Ireland                    |                                          43.42 |\n\nThe Group's ownership percentage in China Bohai Bank is 16.26%.\n\nAlthough the Group's investment in China Bohai Bank is less than 20 per cent , it is considered to be an associate because of the significant influence the Group is able to exercise over its management and financial and operating policies. This influence is exercised through Board representation and the provision of technical expertise to Bohai. The Group applies the equity method of accounting for investments in associates.\n\nBohai has a statutory year end of 31 December, but publishes its year-end financial statements after the Group. As it is impracticable for Bohai to prepare financial statements sooner, the Group recognises its share of Bohai's earnings on a threemonth lag basis. Therefore, the Group recognised its share of Bohai's profits and movements in other comprehensive income for the 12 months ended 30 September 2023 in the Group's consolidated statement of income and consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2023, respectively.\n\nThere have been significant developments since 2022, which have required an impairment to the Group's carrying amount of the investment in Bohai. These events include Bohai's lower reported net profit in 2023 (compared to 2022) as well as banking industry challenges and property market uncertainties in Mainland China, that may impact Bohai's future profitability.\n\nIf the Group did not have significant influence over Bohai, the investment would be measured at fair value rather than the current carrying value, which is based on the application of the equity method as described in the accounting policy note.",

Investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates continued\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the listed equity value of Bohai is below the carrying amount of the Group's investment in associate. As a result, the Group assessed the carrying value of its investment in Bohai for impairment and concluded that an impairment of $850 million was required in 2023 (2022: $308 million impairment). Total impairment is recorded in the 'Goodwill, property, plant and equipment and other impairment' line in the Consolidated Income Statement, under Central & other items segment. The carrying value of the Group's investment in Bohai of $700 million (2022: $1,421 million) represents the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs to sell. The financial forecasts used in the VIU calculation reflects Group management's best estimate of Bohai's future earnings considering the significant developments explained above.\n\n| Bohai                   |   2023   $million | 2022   $million   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| VIU                     |               700 | 1,421             |\n| Carrying amount 1       |               700 | 1,421             |\n| Market capitalisation 2 |               418 | 685               |\n\n## Basis of recoverable amount\n\nThe impairment test was performed by comparing the recoverable amount of Bohai, determined as the higher of VIU and fair value less costs to sell, with its carrying amount.\n\nThe value in use ('VIU') is calculated using a dividend discount model ('DDM'), which estimates the distributable future cashflows to the equity holders, after adjusting for regulatory capital requirements, for a 5-year period, after which a terminal value ('TV') is calculated based on the 'Gordon Growth' model. The key assumptions in the VIU are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Short to medium term projections are based on Group management's best estimates of future profits available to ordinary shareholders and have been determined with reference to the latest published financial results and historical performance of Bohai\n- \u00b7 The projections use available information and include normalised performance over the forecast period, inclusive of: (i) asset growth assumptions based on the long-term GDP growth rate for Mainland China; (ii) ECL assumptions using Bohai's historical reported ECL, based on the proportion of ECL from loans and advances to customers and financial investments measured at amortised cost and FVOCI. This was further adjusted for banking industry challenges and property market uncertainties; (iii) Net Interest Margin (NIM) increases from 2025 with reference to third party market interest rate forecasts in China; (iv) Net fee income estimated according to the latest available performance of Bohai and contribution of the constituent parts (trading and fee income) ; and (v) Effective Tax Rate (ETR) based on Bohai's historical reported results for the short term projection, updated, for the medium and long term to a more conservative view\n- \u00b7 The discount rate applied to these cash flows was estimated with reference to transaction and broker data in the local Chinese market, cross-checked to the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which includes a long term risk-free rate, beta and company risk premium assumptions for Bohai\n- \u00b7 A long-term GDP growth rate for Mainland China is used to extrapolate the expected short to medium term earnings to perpetuity to derive a terminal value; and\n- \u00b7 Capital maintenance ratio consists of a capital haircut taken in order to estimate Bohai's target regulatory capital requirements over the forecast period. This haircut takes into account movements in risk weighted assets (RWA) projected based on the historical proportion of RWA to total assets and the total capital required (Core CET 1 and Minimum Core CET 1 ratios), including required retained earnings over time to meet the target capital ratios. RWA projection is adjusted to reflect management's best estimates for the impact of implementing Basel 3.1, effective 1 January 2024 in China.\n\nThe VIU model was refined during 2023 to include a projected summary balance sheet and more granular income statement assumptions for each period. While it is impracticable for the Group to estimate the impact on future periods, the key changes to the 2023 model are summarised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Asset growth rates, net interest income margin and ECL assumptions were applied to the relevant balance sheet lines to produce the profit and loss forecasts for each period\n- \u00b7 RWAs were modelled as a percentage of total assets, to reflect the potential capital impact(s) of regulatory changes (e.g., Basel 3.1) in each period. For the purposes of the VIU for 31 December 2023, it was assumed that the minimum CET 1 ratio is 8.0% (2022: 7.5%) over the forecast and terminal periods\n- \u00b7 Consistent with the model updates explained above, net fee income was modelled separately from net interest income.\n\nPrior to its use, the 2023 VIU model was calibrated using the 2022 modelled assumptions.",

Structured entities\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nStructured entities are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between the Group and the structured entity indicates the Group has power over the contractual relevant activities of the structured entity, is exposed to variable returns, and can use that power to affect the variable return exposure.\n\nIn determining whether to consolidate a structured entity to which assets have been transferred, the Group takes into account its ability to direct the relevant activities of the structured entity. These relevant activities are generally evidenced through a unilateral right to liquidate the structured entity, investment in a substantial proportion of the securities issued by the structured entity or where the Group holds specific subordinate securities that embody certain controlling rights. The Group may further consider relevant activities embedded within contractual arrangements such as call options which give the practical ability to direct the entity, special relationships between the structured entity and investors, and if a single investor has a large exposure to variable returns of the structured entity.\n\nJudgement is required in determining control over structured entities. The purpose and design of the entity is considered, along with a determination of what the relevant activities are of the entity and who directs these. Further judgements are made around which investor is exposed to and absorbs the variable returns of the structured entity. The Group will have to weigh up all of these facts to consider whether the Group, or another involved party is acting as a principal in its own right or as an agent on behalf of others. Judgement is further required in the ongoing assessment of control over structured entities, specifically if market conditions have an effect on the variable return exposure of different investors.\n\nInterests in consolidated structured entities: A structured entity is consolidated into the Group's financial statements where the Group controls the structured entity, as per the determination in the accounting policy above. The following table presents the Group's interests in consolidated structured entities.\n\n|                                        |   2023   $million | 2022  $million   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Aircraft and ship leasing              |                52 | 3,531            |\n| Principal and other structured finance |               353 | 330              |\n| Total                                  |               405 | 3,861            |\n\nInterests in unconsolidated structured entities: Unconsolidated structured entities are all structured entities that are not controlled by the Group. The Group enters into transactions with unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of business to facilitate customer transactions and for specific investment opportunities. This is predominantly within the CCIB business segment. An interest in a structured entity is contractual or non-contractual involvement which creates variability of the returns of the Group arising from the performance of the structured entity.\n\nThe table below presents the carrying amount of the assets recognised in the financial statements relating to variable interests held in unconsolidated structured entities, the maximum exposure to loss relating to those interests and the total assets of the structured entities. Maximum exposure to loss is primarily limited to the carrying amount of the Group's on-balance sheet exposure to the structured entity. For derivatives, the maximum exposure to loss represents the on-balance sheet valuation and not the notional amount. For commitments and guarantees, the maximum exposure to loss is the notional amount of potential future losses.\n\n|                                                                           | 2023                                | 2023              | 2023                          | 2023                                | 2023                        | 2023            | 2022                                | 2022              | 2022                          | 2022                                | 2022                        | 2022            |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|\n|                                                                           | Asset- backed  securities  $million | Lending  $million | Structured  finance  $million | Principal  Finance  funds  $million | Other  activities  $million | Total  $million | Asset- backed  securities  $million | Lending  $million | Structured  finance  $million | Principal  Finance  funds  $million | Other  activities  $million | Total  $million |\n| Group's interest -

Structured entities continued\n\nThe main types of activities for which the Group utilises unconsolidated structured entities cover synthetic credit default swaps for managed investment funds (including specialised Principal Finance funds), portfolio management purposes, structured finance and asset-backed securities. These are detailed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Asset-backed securities (ABS): The Group also has investments in asset-backed securities issued by third-party sponsored and managed structured entities. For the purpose of market making and at the discretion of ABS trading desk, the Group may hold an immaterial amount of debt securities from structured entities originated by credit portfolio management. This is disclosed in the ABS column above.\n- \u00b7 Portfolio management (Group sponsored entities): For the purposes of portfolio management, the Group purchased credit protection via synthetic credit default swaps from note-issuing structured entities. This credit protection creates credit risk which the structured entity and subsequently the end investor absorbs. The referenced assets remain on the Group's balance sheet as they are not assigned to these structured entities. The Group continues to own or hold all of the risks and returns relating to these assets. The credit protection obtained from the regulatory-compliant securitisation only serves to protect the Group against losses upon the occurrence of eligible credit events and the underlying assets are not derecognised from the Group's balance sheet. The Group does not hold any equity interests in the structured entities, but may hold an insignificant amount of the issued notes for market making purposes. This is disclosed in the ABS section above. The proceeds of the notes' issuance are typically held as cash collateral in the issuer's account operated by a trustee or invested in AAArated government-backed securities to collateralise the structured entities swap obligations to the Group, and to repay the principal to investors at maturity. The structured entities reimburse the Group on actual losses incurred, through the use of the cash collateral or realisation of the collateral security. Correspondingly, the structured entities write down the notes issued by an equal amount of the losses incurred, in reverse order of seniority. All funding is committed for the life of these vehicles and the Group has no indirect exposure in respect of the vehicles' liquidity position. The Group has reputational risk in respect of certain portfolio management vehicles and investment funds either because the Group is the arranger and lead manager or because the structured entities have Standard Chartered branding.\n- \u00b7 Corporate Lending: Corporate Lending comprises secured lending in the normal course of business to third parties through structured entities.\n- \u00b7 Structured finance: Structured finance comprises interests in transactions that the Group or, more usually, a customer has structured, using one or more structured entities, which provide beneficial arrangements for customers. The Group's exposure primarily represents the provision of funding to these structures as a financial intermediary, for which it receives a lender's return. The transactions largely relate to real estate financing and the provision of aircraft leasing and ship finance.\n- \u00b7 Principal finance Fund: The Group's exposure to Principal Finance Funds represents committed or invested capital in unleveraged investment funds, primarily investing in pan-Asian infrastructure, real estate and private equity.\n- \u00b7 Other activities: Other activities include structured entities created to support margin financing transactions, the refinancing of existing credit and debt facilities, as well as setting up of bankruptcy remote structured entities.\n\nIn the above table, the Group determined the total assets of the structured entities using following bases:\n\n- \u00b7 Asset Backed Securities, Principal Finance, and Other activities are based on the published total assets of the structured entities.\n- \u00b7 Lending and Structured Finance are estimated based on the Group's loan values to the structured entities\n\n## 34.

The Group does not believe that the information presented in these tables would be significantly different had such balances been determined on a daily basis.\n\n|                                                                          | 2023                                               | 2023                                             | 2023                        | 2023           | 2023                           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|\n| Average assets                                                           | Average  non-interest  earning   balance  $million | Average   interest   earning   balance  $million | Interest   income  $million | Gross yield  % | Gross yield   total balance  % |\n| Cash and balances at central banks                                       | 10,466                                             | 67,634                                           | 2,833                       | 4.19           | 3.63                           |\n| Gross loans and advances to banks                                        | 34,743                                             | 44,161                                           | 2,095                       | 4.74           | 2.66                           |\n| Gross loans and advances to customers                                    | 55,235                                             | 301,570                                          | 15,698                      | 5.20           | 4.40                           |\n| Impairment provisions against loans and advances to  banks and customers | -

This only differs for Category 1: Purchased Goods (other); Category 2: Capital Goods; Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution; Category 6: Business travel (miscellaneous other than air travel) and Category 15: Investments where a period of 1 January to 31 December is used. Emissions data for these categories is also on a one-year lag with emissions reported in 2023 based on 2022 emissions data.\n- 2 Scope 1 figure includes fugitive emissions for the first time in 2023. For more information on the methodology and assumptions used to calculate GHG emissions, please refer to the Environmental Reporting Criteria at sc.com/sustainabilityhub .\n- 3 Location based emissions have been restated for prior comparative periods. Emissions erroneously included renewable energy certificates and power purchase agreements. Other scope 2 reductions outside clean power are attributed to footprint reduction and efficiency gains.\n- 4  We use an independent third-party assurance provider to verify our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. In 2023, limited assurance was completed by Global Documentation Ltd, excluding fugitive emissions in this first reporting year.\n- 5 Scope 3 Category 1: Purchased goods and services is made up of third-party on-premise data centres (data centres) and all other purchased goods and services (other). Purchased goods and services (data centres) have been restated from 706tCO 2 e to 7,060tCO 2 e due to an error in converting the unit of emissions.\n- 6  Scope 3 Category 3, Category 8, Category 9, Category 10, Category 11, Category 12 and Category 14 are not relevant for the Group due to the nature of our business, products and services and operations. GHG emissions associated with these categories are not deemed as relevant and/or material.\n- 7 Scope 3 Category 5: Waste generated from operations emissions have been restated for the 2022 reporting period due to an out of date emissions factor being used in prior year.\n- 8  Emissions for Scope 3 Category 5: Waste generated in operations, Category 7: Employee commuting and Category 13: Downstream leased assets were measured and reported for the first time in 2022.\n- 9  Reporting of emissions associated with downstream leased aircrafts related to the Group's aircraft leasing business has been paused following the sale of this business during 2023.\n- 10 Scope 3 Category 15 emissions includes financed emissions associated with the Group's transactions with clients. 2022 absolute emissions have been restated from 58.5MtCO 2 e to 49.5MtCO 2 e. This is due to (i) reduction in shipping absolute emissions as improved data has resulted in individual ship-level fair values being obtained, (ii) pausing of aviation emissions reporting due to the sale of the Group's aviation leasing and lending business, (iii) decreases in Automotive Manufacturers' emissions due to changes in the industry emissions reporting methodology referenced earlier, (iv) decreases in emissions from the 'Others' sector where improved data has been obtained to calculate emissions and (v) the sectoral baselining of emissions reporting for the Cement and Commercial Real Estate as separate high-emitting sectors.\n- 11  Energy intensity metric updated to kWh per square meter in the current year from kWh per headcount in 2022. Water intensity metric updated to cubic litres of water per square meter in the current year from cubic litres of water per headcount in 2022. Waste intensity metric updated to cubic kilograms of waste per square meter in the current year from cubic metres of waste per headcount in 2022.\n- 12  Scope 1 figure includes fugitive emissions for the first time in 2023 (2023: 5,266 tCO2e). Prior year data was not available for fugitive emissions. For more information on the methodology and assumptions used to calculate GHG emissions, please refer to the Environmental Reporting Criteria at sc.com/sustainabilityhub .\n- 13  Market based emissions has decreased from 2022 to 2023 due to footprint reduction, efficiency gains and the purchase of additional energy attribution certificates by the Group.\n- 14  Financed emissions are included on page 110. A facilitated emissions baseline was measured for the first time during the year. Refer to page 112 for more details.",

Details on the risks identified such as sectors vulnerable to climate risks, loan impairment intensities, client-level climate risk grading, exposure concentration to physical risk hazards for residential mortgage portfolios and across our own operations are discussed in more detail within the 'Risk review and Capital review' section.\n\n## Products and services\n\n- \u00b7 We have Product Programme Guidance documents which underpin each Sustainable Finance product that we offer, signed off by a delegate of the Sustainable Finance Governance Committee (SFGC) following approval of the product construct by the SFGC. The SFGC is our forum for reviewing Sustainable Finance products and derives its authority from the Group Reputational and Responsibility Risk Committee. SFGC is our foremost committee on greenwashing risk in Sustainable Finance product design and labelling.\n- \u00b7 Our Green and Sustainable Product Framework governs all activities we as an organisation view as green or sustainable. It is publicly available and externally verified by Morningstar Sustainalytics.\n- \u00b7 The Sustainability Bond Framework provides the basis for issuance of Green, Social and Sustainability bonds, drawing on the activities that we view as green or sustainable.\n- \u00b7 Informed by the IEA NZE Energy 2050 scenario, we outline what assets and activities qualify for labelling as 'transition' in our Transition Finance Framework.\n\n## In our own operations\n\n- \u00b7 Since 2018 we have been actively targeting a reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We aim to optimise our office and branch network by retiring unused or inefficient space and creating a working environment that matches office and hybrid-working patterns of our workforce.\n- \u00b7 We are actively seeking to increase the proportion of our electricity usage that comes from renewable sources. These can take the form of power purchase agreements, clean energy contracts, on-site solar installations and renewable energy certificates.\n\n## In our supply chain\n\n- \u00b7 Through our Supplier Charter, we expect our suppliers to support and promote environmental protection, and to comply with local environmental laws and regulations. We expect our suppliers to promote the development and distribution of environmentally friendly technologies and manage environmental concerns in their own supply chains.\n- \u00b7 With 11,563 suppliers, we recognise our contribution to climate impacts through the goods and services we procure. Severe weather events could result in material disruptions to our supply chain that may potentially impact our ability to serve our clients. As such, we work to gather site locations for our material suppliers to assess their physical risk exposures, such that suitable continuity plans can be developed.\n- \u00b7 We continue to engage with our suppliers to collect emissions data, directly from them, thereby improving the accuracy of our Scope 3 Categories 1, 2, 4 and 6 (miscellaneous other than air travel) emissions calculations and reporting.\n- \u00b7 In 2023, climate-related risks and opportunities were considered as part of our formal annual corporate plan, strategy, and financial planning process, and included if considered material.\n- \u00b7 In addition, we developed management scenarios with an aim to strengthen business strategy and financial planning to support the Group's net zero roadmap.\n- \u00b7 From a capital perspective, Climate Risk considerations have been part of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) submissions.\n\nStrategic report pages 70; 76-78 Sustainability review - pages 105-107; 126-129\n\nDirectors' report pages 226-227 Risk review and Capital review - pages 298-313\n\nStrategic report page 78 Sustainability review - page 129 Risk review and Capital review - pages 298-313 Note 1 significant judgement and estimates - pages 367-369",

        "page_content": "## Important notices\n\n## Forward-looking statements\n\nThe information included in this document may contain 'forward-looking statements' based upon current expectations or beliefs as well as statements formulated with assumptions about future events. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, projections, estimates, commitments, plans, approaches, ambitions and targets (including, without limitation, ESG commitments, ambitions and targets). Forward-looking statements often use words such as 'may', 'could', 'will', 'expect', 'intend', 'estimate', 'anticipate', 'believe', 'plan', 'seek', 'aim', 'continue' or other words of similar meaning to any of the foregoing. Forwardlooking statements may also (or additionally) be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts.\n\nBy their very nature, forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results, and the Group's plans and objectives, to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Readers should not place reliance on, and are cautioned about relying on, any forward-looking statements.\n\nThere are several factors which could cause the Group's actual results and its plans and objectives to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. The factors include (but are not limited to): changes in global, political, economic, business, competitive and market forces or conditions, or in future exchange and interest rates; changes in environmental, geopolitical, social or physical risks; legal, regulatory and policy developments, including regulatory measures addressing climate change and broader sustainability-related issues; the development of standards and interpretations, including evolving requirements and practices in ESG reporting; the ability of the Group, together with governments and other stakeholders to measure, manage, and mitigate the impacts of climate change and broader sustainability-related issues effectively; risks arising out of health crises and pandemics; risks of cyber-attacks, data, information or security breaches or technology failures involving the Group; changes in tax rates or policy; future business combinations or dispositions; and other factors specific to the Group, including those identified in this Annual Report and financial statements of the Group. To the extent that any forward-looking statements contained in this document are based on past or current trends and/or activities of the Group, they should not be taken as a representation that such trends or activities will continue in the future.\n\nNo statement in this document is intended to be, nor should be interpreted as, a profit forecast or to imply that the earnings of the Group for the current year or future years will necessarily match or exceed the historical or published earnings of the Group. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date that it is made. Except as required by any applicable laws or regulations, the Group expressly disclaims any obligation to revise or update any forwardlooking statement contained within this document, regardless of whether those statements are affected as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nPlease refer to this Annual Report and the financial statements of the Group for a discussion of certain of the risks and factors that could adversely impact the Group's actual results, and cause its plans and objectives, to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statements.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nNothing in this document shall constitute, in any jurisdiction, an offer or solicitation to sell or purchase any securities or other financial instruments, nor shall it constitute a recommendation or advice in respect of any securities or other financial instruments or any other matter.\n\n## Basis of Preparation and Caution Regarding Data Limitations\n\nThis section is specifically relevant to, amongst others, the sustainability and climate models, calculations and disclosures throughout this report.\n\nThe information contained in this document has been prepared on the following basis:\n\n- i. disclosures in the Strategic report, Sustainability review, Directors' report, Risk review and Capital review and Supplementary information are unaudited unless otherwise stated;\n- ii. all information, positions and statements set out in this document are subject to change without notice;\n- iii. the information included in this document does not constitute any investment, accounting, legal, regulatory or tax advice or an invitation or recommendation to enter into any transaction;\n- iv. the information included in this document may have been prepared using models, methodologies and data which are subject to certain limitations. These limitations include: the limited availability of reliable data, data gaps, and the nascent nature of the methodologies and technologies underpinning this data; the limited standardisation of data (given, amongst other things, limited international coordination on data and methodology standards); and future uncertainty (due, amongst other things, to changing projections relating to technological development and global and regional laws, regulations and policies, and the current inability to make use of strong historical data);\n- v. models, external data and methodologies used in information included in this document are or could be subject to adjustment which is beyond our control;\n- vi. any opinions and estimates should be regarded as indicative, preliminary and for illustrative purposes only. Expected and actual outcomes may differ from those set out in this document (as explained in the 'Forward-looking statements' section above);\n- vii.  some of the related information appearing in this document may have been obtained from public and other sources and, while the Group believes such information to be reliable, it has not been independently verified by the Group and no representation or warranty is made by the Group as to its quality, completeness, accuracy, fitness for a particular purpose or noninfringement of such information;\n- viii. for the purposes of the information included in this document, a number of key judgements and assumptions have been made. It is possible that the assumptions drawn, and the judgement exercised may subsequently turn out to be inaccurate.

CCyB as defined in the Basel III standard provides for an additional capital requirement of up to 2.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets in a given jurisdiction. The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee has the power to set the CCyB rate for the United Kingdom. Each bank must calculate its 'institution-specific' CCyB rate, defined as the weighted average of the CCyB rates in effect across the jurisdictions in which it has credit exposures. The institution-specific CCyB rate is then applied to a bank's total risk-weighted assets.\n\n## Counterparty credit risk\n\nThe risk that a counterparty defaults before satisfying its obligations under a derivative, a securities financing transaction (SFT) or a similar contract.\n\n## CCF or Credit conversion factor\n\nAn estimate of the amount the Group expects a customer to have drawn further on a facility limit at the point of default.

Income RoRWA calculated as income for year as a percentage of RWA.\n\n## RWA or Risk-weighted assets\n\nA measure of a bank's assets adjusted for their associated risks, expressed as a percentage of an exposure value in accordance with the applicable standardised or IRB approach provisions.\n\n## Risks-not-in-VaR (RNIV)\n\nA framework for identifying and quantifying marginal types of market risk that are not captured in the Value at Risk (VaR) measure for any reason, such as being a far-tail risk or the necessary historical market data not being available.\n\n## Roll rate\n\nUses a matrix that gives average loan migration rate from delinquency states from period to period. A matrix multiplication is then performed to generate the final PDs by delinquency bucket over different time horizons.\n\n## Scope 1 emissions\n\nDirect GHG emissions that occur from sources owned or controlled by the Group - i.e., emissions from combustion in owned or controlled boilers, furnaces, vehicles, as well as fugitive emissions from pressure containing equipment at Group locations.\n\n## Scope 2 emissions\n\nIndirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heating, or cooling consumed by the Group.\n\n## Scope 3 emissions\n\nAll indirect GHG emissions (not included in Scope 2) that occur in the value chain of the Group, arising from sources not controlled by the Group. This comprises of both upstream and downstream value chain emissions and includes absolute financed emissions.\n\n## Secured (fully and partially)\n\nA secured loan is a loan in which the borrower pledges an asset as collateral for a loan which, in the event that the borrower defaults, the Group is able to take possession of. All secured loans are considered fully secured if the fair value of the collateral is equal to or greater than the loan at the time of origination. All other secured loans are considered to be partly secured.\n\n## Securitisation\n\nSecuritisation is a process by which credit exposures are aggregated into a pool, which is used to back new securities. Under traditional securitisation transactions, assets are sold to a structured entity which then issues new securities to investors at different levels of seniority (credit tranching). This allows the credit quality of the assets to be separated from the credit rating of the originating institution and transfers risk to external investors in a way that meets their risk appetite. Under synthetic securitisation transactions, the transfer of risk is achieved by the use of credit derivatives or guarantees, and the exposures being securitised remain exposures of the originating institution.\n\n## Senior debt\n\nDebt that takes priority over other unsecured or otherwise more 'junior' debt owed by the issuer. Senior debt has greater seniority in the issuer's capital structure than subordinated debt. In the event the issuer goes bankrupt, senior debt theoretically must be repaid before other creditors receive any payment.\n\n## SICR or Significant increase in credit risk\n\nAssessed by comparing the risk of default of an exposure at the reporting date to the risk of default at origination (after considering the passage of time).\n\n## Solo\n\nThe solo regulatory group as listed in the Prudential Regulation Authority waiver written notice dated 21 August 2023. This differs from Standard Chartered Bank in that it includes the full consolidation of three subsidiaries, namely Standard Chartered Holdings (International) B.V, Standard Chartered Grindlays PTY Limited, SCMB Overseas Limited.\n\n## Sovereign exposures\n\nExposures to central governments and central government departments, central banks and entities owned or guaranteed by the aforementioned. Sovereign exposures, as defined by the European Banking Authority, include only exposures to central governments.\n\n## Stage 1\n\nAssets have not experienced a significant increase in credit risk since origination and impairment recognised on the basis of 12 months expected credit losses.\n\n## Stage 2\n\nAssets have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since origination and impairment is recognised on the basis of lifetime expected credit losses.\n\n## Stage 3\n\nAssets that are in default and considered credit-impaired (non-performing loans).",
