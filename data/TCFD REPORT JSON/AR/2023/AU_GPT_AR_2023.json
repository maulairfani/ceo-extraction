The content in the reporting suite has been formed by recommendations from other frameworks, including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Task Force on nature-related Financial Disclosures, and the united nations Sustainable Development Goals (un SDGs).\n\nThe primary audience of this report is our securityholders, however the information is also of value to other stakeholders which are listed on page 21.\n\nunless otherwise stated, references in this report to 'GPT', 'Group', 'we', 'us' and 'our' refer to The GPT Group.

Material matters are those that have the highest likelihood and/or consequence of impacting our business and our ability to create value for our stakeholders over the long term, whether by directly impacting our assets or the communities in which we operate. To identify what is material, GPT researches trends, consults advisors and regularly engages with our stakeholders to consider their views.\n\nWe use the 'double' or 'nested' materiality approach to prioritise topics that are both financially material as well as being material from an 'impact' perspective, in line with global best practice. By prioritising these topics, we are able to focus on the areas where we can make the greatest impact.\n\nWe continue to review the new and emerging disclosure standards, including the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Sustainability Disclosure Standards and the Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards, together with TNFD in the context of our business and will adhere to the reporting requirements.\n\nTo read more about these topics and how we consider material risks and opportunities when developing our strategy and preparing our corporate reporting, see pages 10 to 16 of our Sustainability Report.\n\nGPT DesignSuites, Melbourne Central, Melbourne\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are delighted to welcome Russell to GPT and are confident that he has the leadership capability, strategic insight and proven experience to lead GPT through its next phase of growth.\n\nI would like to thank Bob for his outstanding stewardship of the Group and his valuable and significant contribution to GPT over the last eight years. Bob has brought a wealth of experience in the Australian property landscape to GPT and across his tenure as CEO has implemented changes to our strategy, structure and portfolio mix that continue to position the Group for success. Through his inclusive and considered leadership style, Bob captures the essence of our purpose and values of caring for our people, place and planet. On behalf of the Directors, management, and all stakeholders of GPT, we are greatly appreciative of his exceptional service and contribution to the Group and wish Bob all the best with his next endeavours.\n\n## Group performance\n\nHigher interest rates and the disruption in the office sector impacted valuations and earnings during 2023. The Group delivered a statutory net loss after tax of $240.0 million for the year, including a net investment property valuation decline of $819.0 million. FFO was $600.9 million, which was marginally down on 2022, primarily as a result of higher financing costs. Our Retail and Logistics segments performed strongly in the period, with high portfolio occupancy maintained and positive leasing outcomes achieved. The Office segment result was impacted by elevated vacancy following lease expiries.\n\nDistributions to securityholders for the year ended 31 December 2023 are $478.8 million, representing an annual distribution of 25.0 cents per security and a payout ratio of 96.0 per cent of free cash flow.\n\nA key focus for the Group is growing funds under management and our result includes the first full year contribution of managing UniSuper's $2.7 billion portfolio of real estate investments, management of the $2.7 billion Australian Core Retail Trust and property management of Pacific Fair Shopping Centre. GPT was pleased to have been selected by QuadReal as the investment manager for its Student Accommodation portfolio which transitioned to the Group in the second half of the year. The Group was recently selected by Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to manage a property portfolio comprising of office and retail assets.",

        "page_content": "Following an extensive engagement process with employees, the Leadership Team and Board, GPT's purpose and values were refreshed during 2023. Our renewed set of values guide our purpose to create experiences that drive positive impact for people, place and planet. Furthermore, our purpose puts the customer experience at the heart of everything we do and leads our employees on how to drive impactful outcomes for our stakeholders.\n\nLeadership in sustainability is an important pillar of GPT's strategy. Our sustainability goals and efforts align to being a positive contributor to our people, communities, stakeholders and the environment, and take a restorative approach to addressing the residual environmental impacts of our direct activities. As part of our Net Zero Plan, we are on target to achieve carbon neutral certification for the operation of our owned and managed Retail and Office assets by the end of 2024.\n\nThe health and safety of our people, customers, contractors and all users and visitors to our assets is paramount. During the year we reviewed and updated our Health and Safety Management System to ensure it remains appropriate in an evolving risk environment, and achieved a 23 per cent reduction in serious and notifiable incidents compared to the prior year. We remain focused on identifying and eliminating safety incidents and risks from our business.\n\nWe continued to participate in global efforts to align and enhance human rights-focused action and disclosures as set out in our fourth Modern Slavery Statement. We are a participant in the United Nations Global Compact and a signatory to the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investment.\n\n## Board renewal\n\nDuring the year, Michelle Somerville retired from the Board. Michelle joined the Board in 2015 and made a significant contribution, in particular as the Chairman of the Audit Committee. We would like to extend our gratitude to Michelle for her outstanding service and contribution to GPT.\n\nShane Gannon was appointed to the Board in May. Shane's extensive experience as a senior financial and property executive with over 40 years working with market-leading ASX-listed companies brings complementary knowledge, skills and experience to the Board.\n\nWe also recently announced the appointment of Louise Mason who will commence on 1 May 2024 as a Non-Executive Director. Louise will bring extensive and supplementary property experience given her senior executive roles in the industry across both multiple sectors and development.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nAs we move into 2024, the Board is focused on supporting our new CEO and the management team as we refine and execute our strategy to enhance securityholder value. While the operating environment remains uncertain and the disruption in the office sector will be an ongoing focus for management, we are reassured by the overall quality of the Group's portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet and our disciplined approach.\n\nOur purpose, values and culture provide a strong foundation for ensuring we do what is right for all stakeholders. GPT's approach ensures environmental, social and governance considerations are not just part of our business, but central to every experience we create.\n\nI would like to thank the Board, Leadership team and our employees for their commitment and engagement over the past year. Sustainable growth remains a priority for GPT as we look to build on the results from the last 12 months and deliver long term value for securityholders. We are excited by the opportunities ahead of us.\n\nVickki McFadden Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

I am incredibly proud and privileged to have had the opportunity to lead GPT since late 2015 and I am confident in the future prospects for the Group under the new leadership that Russell Proutt will bring.\n\nWhile 2023 certainly presented challenges for GPT, with higher interest rates a headwind to earnings and impacting asset valuations, I am pleased with the business performance and the focus our leaders have maintained during the CEO succession process.\n\nThe strategic shift we made through increasing capital allocation to the logistics sector over the last five years has provided greater diversification and resilience of our investment portfolio and our Retail portfolio is delivering sector leading results. The office sector however, is facing a period of disruption and we expect that occupancy levels will remain below long term averages due to new supply and muted demand as a result of hybrid working practices and economic uncertainty.\n\nDespite the headwinds, the Group delivered FFO and distributions per security in line with guidance provided at the beginning of the period. Both the Retail and Logistics business segments reported increased FFO on the prior period. This was offset by significantly higher financing costs as a result of interest rate rises and a lower FFO contribution from the Office segment.\n\nThe Group's Total Return of -2.0 per cent for the year was impacted by property valuation declines as valuation metrics adjusted to reflect the higher interest rate environment and changes to risk adjusted return expectations.\n\nDuring the year we maintained a disciplined approach to capital management. Gearing at the end of 2023 was 28.3 per cent which is well within our stated gearing range of 25-35 per cent. Liquidity of $1.5 billion meets funding requirements through to mid-2026. Given the economic uncertainty and the potential for further softening of property valuation metrics, we will continue to take a measured and prudent approach to capital management.\n\nOur Retail business delivered exceptional results in 2023, up 12.3 per cent on the prior year, boosted by the recovery of Melbourne Central and the transition of the management of the $2.7 billion UniSuper portfolio and the $2.7 billion Australian Core Retail Trust (ACRT) to GPT in the second half of 2022. Despite the pressure on consumer spending from rising interest rates, which appear to be near their peak, GPT's Retail portfolio is well positioned with high occupancy, strong sales productivity and fixed rental increases.\n\nThe office sector has been disrupted with hybrid work practices being adopted by many organisations in response to the demand for greater workplace flexibility. While office utilisation gradually improved through 2023, it is still tracking well below pre-pandemic levels and we anticipate that hybrid working will continue to be a strategy adopted by our tenant customers to attract talent. Despite elevated levels of expiry and a challenging leasing market, occupancy at year-end for the Office portfolio improved to 92.3 per cent.\n\nThe logistics sector continues to benefit from structural tailwinds and favourable supply and demand conditions. Our growth in this sector has been delivered through both acquisitions and developments with our primary focus now on developing new product. Our partnership with QuadReal in this sector also provides growth opportunities. Our Logistics portfolio is well positioned with contracted rental increases, expected positive leasing spreads on expiring leases and the build out of our development pipeline.",

Performance of existing funds and mandates is important to attract third-party capital, and I am pleased to report that both the GPT Wholesale Shopping Centre Fund and the GPT Wholesale Office Fund outperformed their respective MSCI/Mercer benchmarks in 2023. During the year, we were appointed by QuadReal as the investment manager for its Student Accommodation portfolio which transitioned to GPT management in the fourth quarter. In addition, GPT has recently been selected as investment manager of a portfolio of premium real estate assets by Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation. The mandate is expected to transition to GPT in the second quarter of 2024. These management mandates provide further scale and operating leverage for our real estate platform and is a strong endorsement of the Group's capabilities and governance framework.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nExcellence in ESG is part of how we do business and our approach goes beyond a set of principles or good intentions and into tangible actions that drive positive impact for people, place and planet. ESG is central to every experience we create and is integrated into our organisational culture, stakeholder engagement, and development and investment management. Our sustainability practices continue to be successful in delivering results across the business.\n\nWe recognise the global threat posed by climate change and the decline in nature, and in response released our first integrated Climate and Nature Disclosure Statement which provides details of the work we are doing on delivering our Net Zero Plan. During the year, GPT achieved carbon neutrality for all material emissions sources (including Scope 1, 2 and 3) under our operational control and we are on track for all our managed assets to be Climate Active Carbon Neutral (for Buildings) certified by December 2024.\n\nGender equality is also a focal point of our diversity and inclusion strategy and during the year GPT was ranked 9th globally in the Equileap Gender Equality Global Report & Ranking. We continue to invest in supporting female talent to succeed both within GPT and within the industry.\n\nOur second Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan was released in October and includes the development of a First Nations Procurement Strategy, entry into formal placemaking partnerships to ensure our assets reflect First Nations voices, and the establishment, as appropriate, of biodiversity management plans in collaboration with Traditional Custodians.\n\nStrong relationships with First Nations partners, GPT Foundation partners and community groups enabled us to make meaningful contributions during the year through donations, sponsoring and attending events, time and expertise. Together, our work amplifies the voices of charities that are critical to the health and wellbeing of Australian society.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWhile economic uncertainty remains in the current operating environment, GPT has a strong balance sheet, a high quality diversified portfolio and an experienced management team, making it well positioned to create long term value for securityholders.\n\nI am sure the Group's new CEO will bring a sharp focus on creating securityholder value and build on the strong culture and capabilities across the Group.\n\nI would like to extend my thanks to the Board for their advice, support and counsel over my tenure as CEO. To our people, I thank you for your ongoing dedication to GPT and for meeting our challenges and opportunities head on to optimise our performance.\n\nI am proud of what we have accomplished together for our customers, investors, employees, securityholders and the industry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Bob Johnston\n\nChief Executive Officer and Managing Director",

It informs our assessment of the material risks and opportunities arising from our environmental impact.\n\nAt GPT, we are committed to being a positive contributor to the environment and take a restorative approach to addressing the residual environmental impacts of our direct activities.\n\nComprehensive operations management systems and processes enable us to monitor and measure our performance and set targets to improve building efficiency and reduce environmental impact. In 2023, we maintained ISO14001 Certification for our Environmental Management System across GPT building operations and development activities.\n\nPreserving the environment for future generations is a material topic for GPT and our stakeholders. GPT leads the property industry's decarbonisation efforts. Our carbon neutral commitment is delivered by running efficient buildings on renewable electricity and offsetting the emissions that we cannot eliminate through a combination of energy and Australian nature-based reforestation offsets. Our progressive electricity procurement strategy and long term renewable energy contract, has delivered significant energy cost savings. We have reduced our carbon emissions intensity (net scope 1 and 2) by 92 per cent and energy intensity by 52 per cent against our 2005 baseline. Cumulatively, an estimated 2.3 million tonnes of CO2-e emissions have been avoided and saved the Group more than $340 million in energy costs.\n\nAs part of our Net Zero Plan, at the end of 2023, GPT proudly progressed to carbon neutral operations for all material emissions sources (including scope 1, 2 and 3) under our control. This includes our corporate operations (Climate Active certified since 2011), base building emissions (28 of 32 GPT assets already certified) as well as embodied carbon from developments (which we have already started certifying).\n\nGPT is also improving our assets' resilience to climate risk and supporting an orderly transition to a low carbon economy. We undertake detailed climate risk assessment processes for our portfolio to identify and manage physical climate risk as well as address risks and opportunities. For example, we assess physical risk informed by detailed climate modelling under RCP 8.5 for all of our assets in increments out as far as 2100. Additionally, to support the transition to a renewable energy grid, GPT is installing more Smart Energy Hubs and Loadflex programs at assets which also reduce our energy and networks costs as well as generate income.\n\nOur ability to create value over the long term is critically dependent on resilient ecosystems. We are guided by our Biodiversity Policy, which is to have a net positive impact on biodiversity and be resilient to nature-related risks. As such, we are reviewing all of our assets for their interfaces with nature to understand our risks and establishing natural capital accounts including nature-related impacts and dependency registers.",

GPT's partnership with Greenfleet and Traditional Owners provides certainty of supply, quality and cost of offsets for approximately the next five years, helping GPT commit to our nature targets, including upfront embodied carbon neutrality, with strong confidence for delivery.\n\nDuring the year, we continued developing our asset holistic water management plans in support of our water neutral objective. When compared to our 2005 baseline water intensities, we saw a 57 per cent improvement in our water intensity and saved $8 million in water costs in 2023. We also achieved a 4.6 Star Average NABERS Water Rating across our Office portfolio 1 .\n\nThe transition to a circular economy remains a material issue to GPT, and the property industry, with a focus on addressing risks associated with resource scarcity by embracing a closed loop approach to resource consumption. We report on closed loop waste recovery outcomes, not just diversion from landfill.\n\nGPT delivered a 34 per cent closed loop recovery outcome in 2023 which was below our target of 36.5 per cent. There are structural and cultural challenges ahead to achieve a truly circular economy with gaps in processing facilities and continued confusion over recycling processes.

Collaboration within the property industry and shared expertise with relevant businesses, governments, and non-government bodies, specifically the Australian Red Cross, was a focus for GPT during the year and has played a crucial role in helping us further understand and address these shared human rights challenges. In addition to this work, we continue to build productive, long term partnerships with our suppliers. Part of our procurement and supply chain commitment is the timely payment of our suppliers, and in 2023 we paid 94 per cent of small businesses on time.\n\nGPT became a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI) in 2022, and in September 2023 we submitted our first report. Our support of the UN PRI further demonstrates our commitment and actions to incorporate ESG factors into our investment decision making.\n\nOur places contribute to their local communities by providing employment and business opportunities, events and experiences where people can come together, and spaces everyone can enjoy. In partnership with national and local organisations, and through our tailored asset social plans, we hosted National Reconciliation Week and NAIDOC week events alongside key First Nations partners throughout 2023, as well as Sydney World Pride, IDAHOBIT and Wear it Purple activations with our LGBTQIA+ partners in both our office and retail assets. At a grassroots level, a broad range of events and experiences were delivered by our retail and office assets in partnership with national and local not-for-profit organisations.

As a recognised member of the RAP network, the plan outlines GPT's formal commitments to reconciliation with First Nations peoples in Australia.\n\nFirst Nations engagement is an important human rights responsibility for GPT, and the RAP framework provides us with measurable objectives to increase our accountability and contributions to reconciliation and drive genuine, positive change.\n\nReconciliation Australia approves a Stretch RAP for organisations that have developed strategies, and established a strong approach towards advancing reconciliation internally and within the\n\norganisation's sphere of influence. The plan requires organisations to embed reconciliation initiatives into business strategies so they become 'business as usual'.\n\nAs part of our RAP, GPT collaborated with two First Nations artists to create a unique artwork (see the inside front cover of this report) which was used throughout the document itself and is currently on display at GPT Space&Co. 550 Bourke Street, Melbourne. Lowell Hunter, a proud Nyul Nyul Saltwater man from the Kimberley region and Bobbi Lockyer, a proud Ngarluma, Kariyarra, Nyul Nyul and Yawuru woman from Kariyarra Country in Port Hedland, worked together to create 'Saltwater Spirit'. The artwork invites people to appreciate the richness and beauty of the land, fostering a\n\nCASe STuDy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndeep understanding of First Nations culture, community, and the vital connection to a sustainable future.\n\nThrough our RAPs, we are able to gain a deeper understanding of our responsibilities to Country, culture and community, to build stronger connections and partnerships, and importantly co-create thriving communities. At GPT, we believe genuine interest and action enables positive, sustainable change and we are committed to listening, learning and taking action to meaningfully advance reconciliation in Australia.",

        "page_content": "## Group Performance\n\n## Review of Operations and Operating Result\n\nThe Group's FFO reflects increased FFO contributions from the Retail and Logistics segments, offset by lower income in the Office segment and higher financing costs, as a consequence of the higher interest rate environment versus the prior year.\n\nThe Retail portfolio continued to perform strongly, with high occupancy maintained and strong leasing outcomes achieved. Retail sales across the portfolio were above the prior year, and our CBD located asset at Melbourne Central surpassed pre-pandemic retail sales levels benefiting from increased levels of visitation. Leasing spreads continued to strengthen across the portfolio, with lease structures consisting of fixed base rents and annual fixed increases. The transition of management of UniSuper's real estate mandate and the Australian Core Retail Trust has provided deeper tenant relationships and operational leverage for our Retail platform.\n\nThe office leasing environment remained challenging during the year with elevated market vacancy and subdued demand. Office portfolio occupancy at year-end was 92.3 per cent (including heads of agreement). Our premium turn-key product, GPT DesignSuites, specifically designed for smaller tenants, continues to resonate well with the market.\n\nOffice portfolio income was down, primarily driven by lease expiries. The GPT Wholesale Office Fund's development at 51 Flinders Lane, Melbourne is progressing well and due for completion in 2025.\n\nHigh occupancy and positive leasing outcomes have been achieved across our Logistics portfolio. There were five development completions during the year and we continue to progress our pipeline, with the first phases of the Yiribana East estate in Western Sydney and the Djeembana estate in Melbourne's west achieving planning approvals. Logistics represents 28 per cent of the Group's diversified property portfolio.\n\nThe growth of Funds Management remains a key focus for the Group. The strong result delivered reflects the full period contribution of managing UniSuper's $2.7 billion portfolio of real estate investments, which transitioned to GPT in September 2022 and management of ACRT and property management of Pacific Fair Shopping Centre, which commenced in December 2022. Additionally, GPT was delighted to be selected by QuadReal as the investment manager for its approximately 5,000 bed Student Accommodation portfolio which transitioned to GPT in October.\n\nThe Group's gearing at 31 December 2023 of 28.3 per cent remains below the mid-point of our stated range of 25-35 per cent.\n\n## Funds From Operations\n\nFFO represents GPT's underlying earnings from its operations. This is determined by adjusting statutory net profit after tax (under Australian Accounting Standards) for certain items which are non-cash, unrealised or capital in nature. This is in accordance with FFO and Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) in the Property Council of Australia 'Voluntary Best Practice Guidelines for Disclosing FFO and AFFO'.\n\nGPT delivered FFO of $600.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2023, down 3.2 per cent on the prior period (2022: $620.6 million). FFO per security decreased 3.2 per cent to 31.37 cents (2022: 32.40 cents).\n\nBoth the Retail and Logistics segments contributed strongly with growth of 12.3 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively. The Office segment contribution fell by 3.4 per cent predominantly as a consequence of higher vacancy during the period despite increased leasing volumes. Net finance costs from borrowings increased by 38.0 per cent to $193.0 million (2022: $139.9 million). This was due to an increase in the cost of debt to 4.7 per cent (2022: 3.2 per cent).\n\nGPT's statutory net loss after tax was $240.0 million, as compared to a $469.3 million profit after tax in the prior corresponding period, predominantly due to negative investment property valuation movements of $819.0 million (2022: $159.3 million negative revaluation).\n\nThe Group's 12 month total return was negative 2.0 per cent (2022: positive 3.9 per cent) predominantly as a result of the negative investment property revaluations resulting in a decrease in NTA per stapled security to $5.61.",

The rise in interest rates has increased GPT's cost of debt and this had a material impact on FFO in 2023 and will further impact the FFO outlook for the year ahead. It would appear that the interest rate rising cycle may now have peaked as inflation moderates.\n\nIndependent valuations were undertaken for all investment properties as at 31 December 2023, resulting in a softening of valuation metrics. Valuation declines have been more prominent in the office sector. There is the potential for further softening of valuation metrics as a greater level of transaction evidence emerges.\n\nThe Group delivered strong results from its Retail portfolio in 2023 and we expect this positive trend to continue. Portfolio occupancy has been maintained at greater than 99 per cent supported by ongoing tenant demand from existing and new retailers. While there has been a moderation in retail sales growth as a result of inflationary pressure and rising interest rates, the Group's portfolio is well positioned with high occupancy, ongoing tenant demand, fixed rental increases and sustainable tenant occupancy costs. The transition of management of the $2.7 billion UniSuper portfolio and the $2.7 billion Australian Core Retail Trust in 2022, has provided deeper tenant relationships and operational leverage for the GPT Retail platform.\n\nThe office sector continues to be impacted by elevated vacancy, subdued demand, and new supply. The Group made solid leasing progress in 2023, however vacancy remains elevated for the Office portfolio and we anticipate the leasing market will remain very competitive for some time. We have invested in our assets to ensure that they represent compelling propositions for our tenant customers.\n\nGPT's Logistics portfolio is benefiting from the ongoing demand for quality logistics space. While market vacancy has increased from historical lows it remains below 2 per cent in both Melbourne and Brisbane, and Sydney vacancy is less than 1 per cent. GPT's Logistics portfolio is well positioned with occupancy of greater than 99 per cent, contracted rental increases and further developments to commence.

The Statement applies to the whole of The GPT Group, including GPT Funds Management Limited in its capacity as the responsible entity for the GPT Wholesale Office Fund (GWOF) and the GPT Wholesale Shopping Centre Fund (GWSCF).\n\nAs the owner and manager of a $32.6 billion portfolio of retail, office and logistics properties across Australia, we have taken a strong position on climate action. Through our Climate Policy, we are fully committed to tangible actions that meet or exceed expectations under the Paris Agreement to avoid dangerous climate change and limit global warming to well under 2 degrees. In addition, our commitments through our Biodiversity, Water and Resource Circularity Policies are playing a crucial role in helping us responsibly manage our other nature-related impacts.\n\nGPT's governance structures and risk management processes are common across sustainability-related risks and opportunities, including climate, energy, biodiversity, water, and resource management.\n\nOur strategies and targets recognise the interconnectedness of all aspects of environmental sustainability and we endeavour to ensure that a positive impact on one has a positive flow-on effect on the others.\n\nClimate and nature-related risk and opportunity considerations inform key decisions across GPT, both to minimise our impact on the environment and to ensure the financial and operational resilience of our assets and core business strategy to the changing environment. We undertake resilience planning for a transition to a low carbon economy\n\nas well as scenario modelling and climate adaptation planning for potential future physical impacts caused by continued business-as-usual emissions. We also implement processes of reviewing and responding to nature-related risks and opportunities.\n\nOur actions to address climate change and nature impacts align with our Experience First purpose to create experiences that drive positive impact for people, place and planet. Combined with our commitment to ESG leadership and our environmental focus of - 'Carbon Neutral Now, Nature Positive Next', we believe our approach will contribute to long term value creation.\n\nGPT's 2023 Climate and nature Disclosure Statement is available here.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFull detail of GPT's climate and nature-related metrics and targets can be found in the GPT Sustainability Data Dashboard with numerous case studies in our Case Study library .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGPT obtains independent external assurance over our sustainability performance data, details of which can also be found in Sustainability Data Dashboard.\n\nOne One One Eagle Street, Brisbane\n\n<!-- image -->",

It provides the arrangements and practices through which GPT's strategy and business objectives are set, performance is monitored, and risks are managed. It includes a clear framework for decision making and accountability across the business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information on GPT's corporate governance framework is available in the 2023 Corporate Governance Statement .\n\n## The Board and Committees\n\nThe Board comprises six independent Non-Executive Directors and the CEO and Managing Director. The Chairman of the Board is an independent Non-Executive Director who is responsible for providing leadership to the Board. During 2023, Shane Gannon was appointed to the Board following the retirement of Michelle Somerville. Mr Gannon was appointed on 1 May 2023 and his extensive experience as a senior financial and property executive brings complementary skills to the Board.\n\nThe Board has established the Audit, Human Resources and Remuneration, Nomination and Sustainability and Risk Committees to assist it in carrying out its responsibilities. The Board also establishes special purpose committees as may be required from time-to-time to focus on specific matters.\n\nThe Chairman of each Committee is an independent Non-Executive Director with the appropriate qualifications and experience to carry out that role. The Board receives minutes of Board Committee meetings and updates from the Chairman of each Committee to ensure that there is an appropriate flow of information between the Committees and the Board.\n\nAn internal review of the Board, Committees and each Director's performance was undertaken in 2023, following the external review which took place in 2022. Details of the key areas included in the review, along with a summary of the responsibilities of each Committee and their areas of focus in 2023, is available in the 2023 Corporate Governance Statement.\n\nEach Committee has a formal Charter setting out its responsibilities which is reviewed at least every three years to ensure that they remain appropriate. Copies of these Charters are available in the Corporate Governance section of GPT's website: www.gpt.com.au .\n\n## Culture\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board is committed to ensuring that there is a transparent and inclusive culture at GPT and understands the importance of the Board and Management's role in promoting and supporting behaviours that underpin the desired culture, as shown in our values . The Board meets regularly with various levels of the organisation, both formally at meetings and informally during asset tours and staff functions, to test and observe the organisation's culture. In addition, a culture dashboard is reported to the Board regularly through its Committees and the results of GPT's Employee Engagement Survey and planned actions to address any issues raised are reported to the Board's Human Resources and Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThe Group's Code of Conduct (Code) is an important aspect of establishing and maintaining GPT's culture and assists Directors and employees to ensure that their conduct and the conduct of GPT meets the highest ethical and professional standards.\n\nAll Directors and employees are bound by the Code. In addition to setting out what our expectations are of our people, the Code articulates the consequences if these expectations are not met. The Board is informed of any material breaches to the Code via the Sustainability and Risk and Human Resources and Remuneration Committees. For further information regarding any breaches that occurred during the year, see page 81 of the Remuneration Report.\n\nThe Code was revised in 2023 as part of GPT's planned program of policy review, including aligning the Code to our new purpose and values.\n\n## Corporate Governance Framework\n\nThe Board's Governance Framework, as shown on page 65, is based on accountability, effective delegation and adequate oversight to support sound decision making. The Board is accountable to securityholders for GPT's performance and responsible for the overall management and governance of GPT, as well as setting GPT's strategic objectives and risk appetite.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails of GPT's governance arrangements, including key policies, can be found in the Corporate Governance section of the website. These key policies are reviewed regularly to ensure that they remain appropriate, meet regulatory requirements and evolving stakeholder expectations, and maintain a high standard of corporate governance.",

        "page_content": "## Board skills and experience\n\nThe Board is committed to ensuring that collectively the Board has a mix of skills, experience, expertise and diversity to enable it to discharge its responsibilities. The Board recognises the value of diversity and the Directors represent a range of ages and backgrounds. The Board has a gender target of 40 per cent female, 40 per cent male and 20 per cent of any gender that hold the relevant skills and experience. As at 31 December 2023, 43 per cent of the Directors were female and 57 per cent male.\n\nThe Board also consists of a mix of tenures to balance knowledge of GPT and our business with fresh insights. 33 per cent of Non-Executive Directors have less than three years tenure and 67 per cent have three to six years tenure at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe Board has identified the skills and experience set out in the matrix on page 68 as those required for Directors to provide effective governance and direction for the Group. The matrix is reviewed on a regular basis, in line with GPT's strategic direction and changes in Directors' skills and experience, and used by the Board as a key component of succession planning, Committee membership and professional development.\n\nHaving assessed its composition and the results of the analysis set out on page 68 the Board considers that it has the appropriate mix of skills and experience to enable it to discharge its responsibilities.\n\n## Induction and training\n\nOn commencement of employment, all Directors and employees undertake an induction program which includes information on GPT's values, Code of Conduct, health and safety, and employment practices and procedures. In addition, for Director induction, any new Directors meet with the members of the Leadership Team and visit GPT's assets as appropriate to discuss our strategy, the nature of our various businesses, our financial position and performance and risk management. This induction program was provided on the appointment of Shane Gannon as a Director during 2023.\n\nOngoing training for Directors is incorporated into the Board calendar to ensure that Directors, individually and collectively, develop and maintain the skills and knowledge required for the Board to fulfil its roles and responsibilities. This involves visits to GPT's offices and assets and presentations on developments impacting the business and the wider economy.\n\nIn 2023, the Board visited GPT's offices and assets in Brisbane and Maroochydore.

        "page_content": "## Tax Transparency\n\nConsistent with our commitment to good corporate governance, GPT is committed to managing the Group's tax obligations responsibly and in compliance with all laws and regulations.\n\nThe GPT Group is a stapled entity, a common arrangement in the Australian real estate sector. Each GPT security listed on the ASX is comprised of a share in GPT Management Holdings Limited (GMH) that is 'stapled' to a unit in General Property Trust (GPT). GPT is a unit trust (Managed Investment Trust) that is treated separately to GMH for Australian tax purposes. The GPT Group conducts our business only in Australia.\n\n## Tax Risk Management Framework\n\nGPT has a Tax Risk Management Framework that is reviewed by the Audit Committee and reflects our conservative risk appetite with respect to taxation. By applying this framework, GPT is able to manage its tax obligations efficiently and ensure compliance with tax laws and mitigate transaction-related tax risks.\n\nThe Tax Risk Management Framework provides a holistic governance approach that ensures compliance with tax law through the implementation of tax-related policies, processes, procedures and systems across the Group's business. GPT applies this framework across the broader business to fully integrate the taxation implications of transactions, projects and business initiatives into day-to-day activities.\n\nPrivate tax rulings, external advice and counsel opinion are obtained as necessary to ensure the correct application of the tax law to the Group's business.\n\n## Our tax contribution\n\nThe payment of applicable taxes is an important aspect of GPT's contribution to the Australian economy. The GPT Group's real estate investment assets are held in a trust (GPT) that is owned by securityholders. Under Australian tax law, rental income arising from real estate investments held by the Trust is taxed directly to securityholders. All other profits that arise from trading activities are earned by GMH and are subject to the Australian corporate income tax rate of 30 per cent.\n\nGPT is also subject to goods and services tax, stamp duty, council rates, land tax, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, and remits 'pay as you go' withholding taxes on behalf of employees and investors.\n\n## Tax Transparency Code\n\nGPT reports in accordance with the voluntary Tax Transparency Code (TTC) issued by the Board of Taxation. The TTC recommends a set of principles and minimum standards for the disclosure of tax information by businesses.\n\n## Tax disclosures\n\nInformation regarding taxation of the Group is disclosed in this Annual Report.\n\nPage 126.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\n## Introduction from the Chairman of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee\n\nOn behalf of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee (the Committee), I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for 2023. This report provides an overview of our executive Remuneration Framework, including the objectives, mechanisms and outcomes, and the link between Group and individual performance and associated reward outcomes.\n\nThe Committee continues to focus on ensuring that the remuneration structures and outcomes reflect the drivers of Group performance and appropriately reward, attract and retain talent in order to drive positive outcomes for our securityholders.\n\n## 2023 Remuneration Outcomes\n\nThe remuneration outcomes for 2023 reflect the intended operation of the Remuneration Framework which is designed to deliver competitive remuneration to attract, engage and retain talent and be aligned to securityholders, using the following mechanisms:\n\n- \u00b7 Short term and long term incentives based on the achievement of financial measures and strategic and operational objectives important to the organisation's success\n- \u00b7 Consideration of values, behaviours and risk through the design of performance incentives and the Remuneration Framework, including clawback mechanisms and the exercise of Board discretion\n- \u00b7 A minimum security holding requirement, that aligns the interests of executives to those of securityholders, and\n- \u00b7 Strong governance through the Committee ensuring remuneration outcomes are reasonable taking into account community and stakeholder expectations.\n\nThe Group met our primary financial measure of FFO for the year, achieving its \"target\" performance level to determine the STIC pool. However, this was lower than what was achieved in 2022 primarily as a result of the rapid rise in interest rates during 2022 and 2023. In considering the objectives for 2023, the Board set management a FFO growth target of at least three per cent for 2024. Guidance for the year ahead currently sits below this target and this has been reflected in the STIC outcomes for the Leadership Team. More details on the Group performance can be found on pages 42-55.\n\nThe CEO received a short-term incentive compensation (STIC) payment of $950,000 (52 per cent of maximum opportunity), which included a downward adjustment reflecting the 2024 FFO growth target below the Board-determined target and consideration of the outcomes achieved against the scorecard, detailed on pages 83-84. The Interim CFO received a STIC payment of $350,000 (64 per cent of maximum opportunity against annualised Interim CFO salary) and the COO received a STIC payment of $540,000 (64 per cent of maximum opportunity), aligned to performance outcomes achieved at the Group and at an individual level.\n\nThe 2021-23 Long Term Incentive (LTI) plan vested at 80.4 per cent. This is calculated with the Relative Total Securityholder Return (RTSR) metric achieving a 100 per cent vesting outcome and an achievement of 60.8 per cent for the Total Return (TR) metric. Each of these metrics has an equal weighting. This is the first time in four years that the plan has delivered a payout to participants as the 2018 and 2019 plans did not meet requisite performance-based thresholds and the 2020 plan was withdrawn.\n\nFor 2023, the Committee approved a budget for fixed remuneration reviews, resulting in an average increase of 3.75 per cent for eligible employees. No fixed remuneration increases were awarded to Executive KMP in 2023. The Deputy CFO was appointed to Interim CFO in October 2023 and his fixed remuneration was adjusted to reflect the expanded role.\n\nThe Committee determined that modest increases would be applied to Non-Executive Director (NED) fees in 2023 for the Board Chairman, Committee Members, and the Chairs of the Sustainability and Risk and Human Resources and Remuneration Committees. The average increase was 3.3 per cent.",

Russell will commence on 1 March 2024 and details of his remuneration package, which was determined with reference to peer benchmarking and GPT's Remuneration Framework, are set out in the market announcement in September 2023.\n\nIn September 2023, Anastasia Clarke resigned as CFO. Dean McGuire was appointed as the Interim CFO and a search for a permanent CFO was initiated. There were no other changes to the Leadership team in 2023.\n\n## Our People and Culture\n\nWe are proud of our people and culture at GPT, with our people being our most important asset. In 2023, we refreshed our purpose and values, with widespread input from across the business. Our values led culture is reflected in our purpose, 'Experience First, we create experiences that drive positive impact for people, place, and planet'. Our engagement results demonstrate that our refreshed purpose and values also resonated with our people. In 2023, we increased our engagement score by four per cent overall, up ten per cent since 2021 and we now sit in the top quartile of all employers across Australia with 89 per cent of our people believing GPT is a great place to work and 90 per cent being proud to work at GPT. We continue to invest in our employee experience targeting initiatives in areas such as diversity and inclusion, leadership capability, flexible working arrangements and wellbeing.\n\nGPT continues to implement actions through our Respect@Work program to enable everyone across our workforce to feel safe, respected and valued. In particular, a specific team has been established to focus on actions to prevent and eliminate any form of sexual harassment in the workplace. Any matters pertaining to behavioural conduct are reported to the Committee.\n\nDuring 2023 we also made some enhancements to our Code of Conduct. These include the incorporation of the Group's new purpose and values, highlighting the breadth of the code in its application to everyone, irrespective of location or type of work activity and extends to representing GPT in any way including social media activity. The Code also reinforces our safety first culture and the elimination of workplace hazards, a focus on physical and psychological safety and our commitment to expectations of no anti-competitive practices.\n\nIn 2023, we are particularly proud of being recognised by Equileap as 9th globally in the Gender Equality Global Report and Ranking. We have enhanced our parental support policy to provide the same amount of leave to both parents and we have implemented a work and family hub, providing resources to all of our employees across all life stages. We have continued our focus on reducing the gender pay gap (which reduced again since the end of 2022 from 17.53 per cent to 16.54 per cent) and ensuring we support, promote and empower female employees across the organisation.\n\n## 2024 Priorities\n\nAs we welcome our new CEO in early 2024, we are planning to review our Remuneration Framework as part of a broader strategic review to ensure best possible alignment between strategic goals and remuneration outcomes over a multi-year horizon. This is likely to include the broadening of the metrics used at a Group-level to determine short term incentive and the review of the metrics for the long term incentive in order to better align to our securityholder experience. Any changes to the Long Term Incentive for 2024 will be provided with the notice of meeting ahead of our Annual General Meeting.\n\nWe welcome feedback and comments from investors and stakeholders regarding this Remuneration Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Tracey Horton AO\n\nChairman of the Human Resources & Remuneration Committee\n\nThe information provided in this Report has been audited in accordance with section 308(3C) of the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\nSydney\n\n19 February 2024",

The remuneration principles are the foundation of the Framework, and the diagram below describes the typical delivery for remuneration and reward. The Framework also provides a basis for the Board to exercise discretion when determining remuneration outcomes.\n\n## How We Create Value\n\nGrowing and predictable earnings\n\nThriving places\n\nEmpowered people\n\nSustainable environment\n\nProspering customers, suppliers and communities\n\n## GPT's Remuneration Principles\n\nAttract and retain high calibre executives and employees\n\nAligned to investor outcomes and behaviours consistent with GPT values\n\nDetermined with reference to Group and individual financial and non financial performance\n\nDrive focus and encourage our people to think and act like an owner\n\n## Executive Remuneration Components 1\n\nThe timeline below outlines how remuneration is delivered. Executives participate in the Group's LTI and STIC plan. Performance testing of both plans occurs in quarter one of the year following the conclusion of each performance period. Deferred STIC awards are made 50 per cent as cash and 50 per cent as deferred STIC (securities vesting 12 months after the end of the performance period). 2 If LTI plan performance conditions are met, the requisite number of performance rights will convert to GPT securities, alternatively, performance rights will lapse. 3 All vested and unvested awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Component          | Year 1                            | Year 2   | Year 3   | Year 4   |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Fixed Remuneration | Salary & statutory superannuation |          |          |          |\n| STIC               | 1 year performance period         |          |          |          |\n| LTI 4              | 3 year performance period         |          |          |          |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPerformance tested, deferred securities granted and cash award paid. See note 2.\n\nSecurities vest\n\n- Performance rights granted using the prior December 30-day Volume Weighted Average Price\n- Performance tested, eligible performance rights convert to securities and vest after Board approval in Q1 Year 4\n\n## Other Employee Ownership Schemes 5\n\n## General Employee Security Ownership Plan (GESOP)\n\n- \u00b7 For STIC eligible individuals who are ineligible for LTI.\n- \u00b7 Equal to 10 per cent of STIC outcome (less tax).\n- \u00b7 Delivered in GPT securities around the same time as the cash STIC payment and must be held for at least one year.\n\n## Broad-Based Employee Security Ownership Plan (BBESOP)\n\n- \u00b7 For individuals ineligible for STIC or LTI.\n- \u00b7 GPT must achieve at least Target outcome on annual FFO growth per security for the plan to operate.\n- \u00b7 Awarded as either:\n- -  $1,000 cash (less tax), or\n- -  a grant of $1,000 worth of GPT securities which must be held until the earlier of three years from the allocation date or cessation of employment.\n- 1. Eligibility to participate in the STIC and LTI plans is role-based and typically limited to permanently employed individuals. Generally, participants must satisfy the minimum service criteria applicable under each plan and have not resigned or been subject to any formal performance management process when an award is made.\n- 2. Where deferred securities are awarded, the number allocated is determined by dividing 50% of the value of the total STIC by the 30-day VWAP immediately before the end of the performance period. The value of the award on the conversion date may vary as a result of security price having increased or decreased since that point in time. Any STIC award for non LTI eligible employees is delivered as 100% cash.\n- 3. Participants may elect at the commencement of the LTI plan to apply additional dealing restrictions of up to a maximum of 4 years post vesting. A taxing point will arise in the financial year securities vest and become unrestricted.\n- 4. The CEO's performance rights are granted following the relevant resolution's approval at the Annual General Meeting.\n- 5. Eligibility to participate in the GESOP and BBESOP is subject to the same criteria set out in footnote 1.",

        "page_content": "## Minimum Security Holding Requirement (MSHR)\n\nGPT's Minimum Security Holding Policy requires Non-Executive Directors, the CEO and members of the Leadership Team to build and maintain a minimum holding of GPT securities. The policy requires the CEO to maintain a holding equal to 150 per cent of fixed remuneration. For Non-Executive Directors, other KMP and Leadership Team members, the MSHR is equal to 100 per cent of fixed remuneration or board fees. For Non Executive Directors, the base fee on the date of appointment, and in the case of the Chairman, the date of becoming the Chairman, is the requirement. The timeframe to meet the MSHR was reviewed this year and increased from four years to five years for the CEO and members of the Leadership Team to align with market practice and remains four years for Non-Executive Directors.\n\n## Clawback and Malus\n\nGPT's Clawback Policy provides the Board with the discretion to modify remuneration outcomes as a result of adverse circumstances that arise or become known after remuneration has been granted, paid or vested. Individuals who participate in the STIC and LTI are subject to these awards being adjusted, cancelled or clawed back if a trigger event occurs. No trigger events occurred in 2023, and the Board did not enact the Clawback Policy during the reporting period.\n\n## Consequence Management\n\nOur Code of Conduct guides the way that our employees are expected to conduct themselves on a day-to-day basis and provides a benchmark for ethical behaviour to assist GPT in maintaining the trust and confidence of GPT's stakeholders. There are consequences for anyone who fails to meet these expectations, including requirements to undergo training, adjustments to performance-based remuneration, impact on promotion, formal warnings and termination.\n\nAll Directors and employees are bound by GPT's Code of Conduct and receive training on commencement of employment with GPT and routine refresher training thereafter.\n\nIn 2023, there was one substantiated incident that resulted in termination and two breaches of our Code of Conduct for multiple expense management breaches and failure to complete compulsory training on time. Consequences were in line with our consequence management framework.\n\n## GPT's Values and Culture\n\nGPT provides a workplace where our people can realise their potential and consistently deliver high performance in a safe and inclusive work environment. Our diverse workforce benefits from a dynamic work environment, investment in technology and a culture where people feel they can bring their whole selves to work. These key elements that drive value are underpinned by GPT's shared sense of purpose, Experience First, we create experiences that drive positive impact for people, place and planet. Experience First puts the customer at the heart of everything we do. It means leading with insights and shifting our focus from the physical asset to the benefit of what happens inside to deliver real and meaningful impact.\n\n## Our culture is underpinned by the following values\n\n## Everybody Counts\n\nPeople really matter to us. We learn from our differences and we pull together as one. Life is precious so safety and wellbeing are our priority, always.\n\n## Go For It!\n\nWe turn ideas into action. We back ourselves and each other. Energy and enthusiasm power everything we do. We're great at getting things done. We're excited to pioneer the firsts that others follow.\n\n## Imagine If...\n\nWe believe anything is possible. We're inquisitive about the world around us and use customer insights to drive the creative and the new. Great questions drive great outcomes.\n\n## Make an Impact\n\nProperty impacts our planet in a very real way. So, we act with courage and conviction to make a difference - no matter how big or small. We know a better tomorrow is up to each of us.\n\nAs part of employees' end-of-year performance assessments, GPT employees are assessed against our values. This signals that performance is not just about \"what\" employees deliver, it is \"how\" employees deliver.

In the event that a review results in changes, the new Board and Committee fees are effective from 1 January in the applicable year and advised in the ensuing Remuneration Report.\n- \u00b7 Fees (including superannuation) paid to Non-Executive Directors are subject to an aggregate limit of $2,200,000 per annum, which was approved by GPT securityholders at the Annual General Meeting on 10 May 2023.

See note 2(c) for information on GPT's valuation process, and note 2(d) for a sensitivity analysis showing indicative movements in investment property valuations should certain key metrics differ from those assumed in the valuations.\n\nThe following judgements, estimates and assumptions have the potential to have a material impact on the financial statements:\n\n| Area of judgements and estimates   | Assumptions underlying                             | Note          |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Lease liabilities                  | Lease term, incremental borrowing rate             | 2, 24(d)(vii) |\n| Investment properties              | Fair value                                         | 2             |\n| Trade receivables                  | Measurement of expected credit loss                | 4             |\n| Inventories                        | Lower of cost and net realisable value             | 6             |\n| Security based payments            | Fair value                                         | 20            |\n| Equity accounted investments       | Assessment of control versus significant influence | 24(c)         |\n| Right-of-use assets                | Recoverable amount                                 | 24(d)(vii)    |\n\n## RESULT FOR THE YEAR\n\n## 1.  Segment Information\n\nGPT's operating segments are described in the following table. The chief operating decision makers monitor the performance of the business on the basis of Funds from Operations (FFO) for each segment. FFO represents GPT's underlying and recurring earnings from its operations, and is determined by adjusting the statutory net profit after tax for certain items which are non-cash, unrealised or capital in nature. FFO has been determined in accordance with guidelines issued by the Property Council of Australia.\n\n| Segment                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Types of products and services which generate the segment result   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Retail Ownership, development (including mixed-use) and property management of predominantly regional, sub-regional                                                                                                  |                                                                    |\n| Office Ownership, development and property management of prime office properties and also includes the funds                                                                                                         |                                                                    |\n| Ownership, development and property management of logistics assets and also includes the funds management  of the GPT QuadReal Logistics Trust (GQLT) and the QuadReal Student Accommodation mandate, as well as the | Logistics                                                          |\n| Corporate Cash, other assets, borrowings and associated hedges as well as net finance costs, corporate management and                                                                                                |                                                                    |",

Investment Properties\n\n## Basis of valuation\n\nIn line with the Valuation Policy, GPT independently values each completed investment property (including investment property assets disclosed within equity accounted investments) at least annually. Independent valuers consider transaction evidence and prevailing market conditions, which guides them in their key valuation assumptions, including capitalisation and discount rates, market rental levels, tenant incentives, lease up periods, income growth rates and capital expenditure.\n\nGPT provides factual information to the independent valuers, including passing rent information, outstanding incentives and capital expenditure forecasts which the independent valuers then use to form their own assessment.\n\nIn late January 2024 the Group consulted with the independent valuers to understand whether any changes subsequent to the balance date changed their view regarding the 31 December 2023 valuations. In particular the Group noted the current economic environment, including high inflation, rising interest rates and a slowing in capital flows. All valuers confirmed that their valuations were appropriate as at 31 December 2023. On 30 January 2024, the Valuation Committee met to reconfirm and recommend the 31 December 2023 valuations to the Board of Directors.\n\nManagement has reviewed the investment property valuations for both factual accuracy and reasonableness of the assumptions used to determine fair value. The fair values are shown in the following tables.\n\n## a)  Investment properties\n\n|                              |       | Investment  properties   | Less lease  liabilities   | Fair value   | Investment  properties   | Less lease  liabilities   | Fair value   |\n|------------------------------|-------|--------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|\n|                              |       | 31 Dec 23                | 31 Dec 23                 | 31 Dec 23    | 31 Dec 22                | 31 Dec 22                 | 31 Dec 22    |\n|                              | Note  | $M                       | $M                        | $M           | $M                       | $M                        | $M           |\n| Retail                       | (i)   | 4,715.0                  | (6.4)                     | 4,708.6      | 4,783.5                  | (6.5)                     | 4,777.0      |\n| Office                       | (ii)  | 2,802.8                  | -                         | 2,802.8      | 2,987.8                  | -                         | 2,987.8      |\n| Logistics                    | (iii) | 3,511.5                  | (7.5)                     | 3,504.0      | 3,841.3                  | (7.7)                     | 3,833.6      |\n| Properties under development | (iv)  | 236.0                    | -                         | 236.0        | 344.0                    | -                         | 344.0        |\n| Total investment properties  | (vi)  | 11,265.3                 | (13.9)                    | 11,251.4     | 11,956.6                 | (14.2)                    | 11,942.4     |",

Fair value is based on the latest independent valuation adjusting for capital expenditure and capitalisation and amortisation of lease incentives since the date of the independent valuation report. Any change in fair value is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period.\n\nProperties under development are stated at fair value at each balance date. Fair value is assessed with reference to reliable estimates of future cash flows, status of the development and the associated risk profile. Finance costs incurred on properties undergoing development are included in the cost of the development.\n\nLease incentives provided by GPT to lessees are included in the measurement of fair value of investment property and are amortised over the lease term using a straight line basis.",

Where an exceptional circumstance arises, the extension of the valuer's term must be approved by the relevant Board.\n\nThe Valuation Policy requires an independent valuation at least annually for all completed investment properties. Properties under development with a value of $100 million or greater are independently valued at least every six months. Unimproved land is independently valued at least every three years. Additional valuations will be completed in the event an internal tolerance check identifies the requirement for an independent valuation.\n\nCritical judgements are made by GPT in respect of the fair values of investment properties (including investment properties within equity accounted investments). Fair values are reviewed regularly by management with reference to independent property valuations, recent transactions and market conditions, and using generally accepted market practices. The valuation process, critical assumptions underlying the valuations and information on sensitivity are disclosed below and in note 2(b).\n\nAn independent valuer will typically conduct both an income capitalisation valuation and a DCF valuation for each asset, which informs a range of valuation outcomes. The valuer will then apply their expertise in determining an adopted value, which may include adopting one of these specific approaches or a mid-point of these two approaches.\n\nThe valuation of the properties under development is determined by a development feasibility analysis for each parcel of land within each asset. The development feasibility analysis is prepared on an 'as if complete' basis and is a combination of the income capitalisation method and where appropriate, the DCF method. The cost to complete of the development includes development costs, finance costs and an appropriate profit and risk margin. These costs are deducted from the 'as if complete' valuation to determine the 'as is' basis or 'current fair value.'\n\nThe fair value of vacant land parcels is based on the market land value per square metre.\n\n## internal tolerance checks\n\nEvery six months, with the exception of properties independently valued, an internal tolerance check is prepared. The internal tolerance check involves the preparation of a DCF and income capitalisation valuation for each investment property. These are produced using a capitalisation rate, terminal yield and discount rate based on comparable market evidence and recent independent valuation parameters. The tolerance measurement will typically be a mid-point of these two approaches.\n\nThese internal tolerance checks are used to determine whether the book value is in line with the fair value or whether an independent valuation is required.\n\n## highest and best use\n\nThe fair value of investment properties is calculated based on the highest and best use whether or not the current use reflects the highest and best use.",

For those assets, the independent valuer conducted the sensitivity analysis in the following tables. Results for individual assets may differ based on each asset's particular attributes and market conditions.\n\nThe following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation to movements in the significant variables of capitalisation rates and market rent per sqm when using the income capitalisation valuation approach and the discount rate and terminal rate and market rental growth rates when using the DCF valuation approach.\n\n|                                 | Capitalisation Method   | Capitalisation Method   | Capitalisation Method   | Capitalisation Method   | Capitalisation Method   | Capitalisation Method   |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                 | Capitalisation Rate     | Capitalisation Rate     | Capitalisation Rate     | Market Rent per sqm     | Market Rent per sqm     | Market Rent per sqm     |\n|                                 | 0.25%                   | 0.50%                   | 0.75%                   | 1.00%                   | (5.0%)                  | 5.0%                    |\n| Retail - impact to valuation    | (4.9%)                  | (9.4%)                  | (13.5%)                 | (17.2%)                 | (5.9%)                  | 5.9%                    |\n| Office - impact to valuation    | (4.9%)                  | (9.3%)                  | (13.5%)                 | (17.3%)                 | (4.6%)                  | 4.4%                    |\n| Logistics - impact to valuation | (4.7%)                  | (9.0%)                  | (13.0%)                 | (16.6%)                 | (4.1%)                  | 4.1%                    |\n\n|                                 | DCF Method                      | DCF Method                      | DCF Method                      | DCF Method            | DCF Method            | DCF Method            |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                 | Discount Rate and Terminal Rate | Discount Rate and Terminal Rate | Discount Rate and Terminal Rate | 10-Year Growth Rate 1 | 10-Year Growth Rate 1 | 10-Year Growth Rate 1 |\n|                                 | 0.25%                           | 0.50%                           | 0.75%                           | 1.00%                 | (0.50%)               | 0.50%                 |\n| Retail - impact to valuation    | (4.9%)                          | (9.4%)                          | (13.4%)                         | (17.2%)               | (3.1%)                | 3.3%                  |\n| Office - impact to valuation    | (5.2%)                          | (10.0%)                         | (14.4%)                         | (18.4%)               | (3.7%)                | 3.9%                  |\n| Logistics - impact to valuation | (4.9%)                          | (9.3%)                          | (13.4%)                         | (17.1%)               | (3.3%)                | 3.2%                  |\n\n## e)  Lease payments to be received\n\nLease amounts to be received not recognised in the financial statements at balance date are as follows:\n\n|                                     | 31 Dec 23  $M   | 31 Dec 22  $M   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Less than 1 year                    | 613.2           | 589.2           |\n| 2 years                             | 548.3           | 530.0           |\n| 3 years                             | 471.8           | 459.4           |\n| 4 years                             | 373.0           | 381.1           |\n| 5 years                             | 297.3           | 292.3           |\n| Due after five years                | 879.0           | 920.1           |\n| Total lease payments to be received | 3,182.6         | 3,172.1         |\n\nLease amounts to be received include future amounts to be received on non-cancellable operating leases, not recognised in the financial statements at balance date.

Trade and Other Receivables continued\n\n## c)  Accounting policies\n\nReceivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance under the 'expected credit loss' (ECL) model. GPT holds these financial assets in order to collect the contractual cash flows, and the contractual terms are solely payments of outstanding principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nAll loans and receivables with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance date are classified as non-current assets.\n\n## rent waivers and other write-offs\n\nDebts which management has determined will be subject to a rent waiver, or are otherwise uncollectible have been written off as at 31 December 2023, in accordance with the requirements of AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9). Bad debt write offs of $4.0 million (31 December 2022: $26.5 million) relating to COVID-19 abatements and other non recoverable amounts have been recognised during the financial year. Waivers which have been reflected on invoices issued to tenants and do not relate to previous outstanding debtors, have been shown as a reduction to rent from investment properties on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## recoverability of receivables\n\nFor remaining trade and other receivables balances which have not been written off, management has assessed whether these balances are 'credit impaired', and recognised a loss allowance equal to the lifetime ECL. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset is expected to occur.\n\nLifetime ECLs result from all possible default events over the expected life of the receivables and are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to GPT in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that GPT expects to receive). A default on receivables is when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments when they fall due and management determines that the debt is uncollectible, or where management forgives all or part of the debt.\n\nGPT analyses the age of outstanding receivable balances and applies historical default percentages adjusted for other current observable data as a means to estimate lifetime ECL. Other current observable data may include:\n\n- \u00b7 Forecasts of economic conditions such as unemployment, interest rates, gross domestic product and inflation\n- \u00b7 Financial difficulties of a counterparty or probability that a counterparty will enter bankruptcy, and\n- \u00b7 Conditions specific to the asset to which the receivable relates.\n\nDebts that are known to be uncollectible are written off when identified.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, GPT has assessed the likelihood of future defaults and debt forgiveness taking into account several factors. These include the risk profile of the tenant, the age of the debt, the asset location, and tenant cash payment trends after the completion of rent relief agreements and other economic conditions impacting the tenants' ability to pay.\n\nThis has resulted in an ECL allowance of $14.4 million being recognised as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: $16.9 million). The remaining net balance of trade receivables (excluding accrued income and related party receivables) is $7.2 million (31 December 2022: $12.7 million).",

Rights are initially measured at cost and subsequently amortised over their useful life.\n\nFor the management rights of Highpoint Shopping Centre, management considers the useful life as indefinite as there is no fixed term included in the management agreement. Therefore, GPT tests for impairment at balance date. Assets are impaired if the carrying value exceeds their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined using a discounted cash flow. A 13.75 per cent pre-tax discount rate and 3.01 per cent growth rate have been applied to these asset specific cash flow projections.\n\nThe asset was impaired in full during the year ended 31 December 2021, with the full amount reversed at 31 December 2022 due to economies of scale benefits as a result of the commencement of management of the UniSuper and ACRT mandates.\n\n## IT development and software\n\nCosts incurred in developing systems and acquiring software and licences that will contribute future financial benefits and which the Group controls (therefore excluding Software as a Service) are capitalised until the software is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. These include external direct costs of materials and services and direct payroll and payroll related costs of employees' time spent on the project. Amortisation is calculated on a straight line basis over the length of time over which the benefits are expected to be received, generally ranging from 5 to 7 years.\n\nIT development and software are assessed for impairment at each reporting date by evaluating if any impairment triggers exist. Where impairment triggers exist, management calculate the recoverable amount. The asset is impaired if the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. Critical judgements are made by GPT in setting appropriate impairment triggers and assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount.\n\nManagement believe the carrying value reflects the recoverable amount.\n\nCosts incurred in relation to Software as a Service are recognised as an expense as incurred.",

Intangible Assets continued\n\n## Carbon offsets\n\nThe Group has purchased carbon credits (or offsets). These carbon credits are used by the Group to offset its operational emissions or to offset embodied carbon within a development project. The carbon credits are measured at cost and management considers that the carbon credits have an indefinite useful life. Therefore, GPT tests for impairment at balance date. The costs of the carbon credits include any direct purchase costs.\n\nAssets are impaired if the carrying value exceeds their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined with reference to the current market price for equivalent carbon credits.\n\nWhen carbon credits are utilised, they are derecognised and the cost is recognised as an expense where the carbon credits are utilised to offset operational emissions, or capitalised to development costs of investment properties where utilised to offset embodied carbon.\n\nGPT has assessed the carbon credits for impairment indicators and has calculated the recoverable amount where indicators exist. This has resulted in an impairment expense of $0.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: nil).\n\n## 6.  Inventories\n\n|                          |   31 Dec 23  $M | 31 Dec 22  $M   |\n|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Properties held for sale |            68.8 | -               |\n| Development properties   |            17.4 | 13.4            |\n| Current inventories      |            86.2 | 13.4            |\n| Development properties   |            93.5 | 141.3           |\n| Non-current inventories  |            93.5 | 141.3           |\n| Total inventories        |           179.7 | 154.7           |\n\nDevelopment properties held as inventory are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.\n\nCost includes the cost of acquisition and any subsequent capital addition. For development properties, cost also includes development, finance costs and all other costs directly related to specific projects including an allocation of direct overhead expenses. Post completion of the development, finance costs and other holding charges are expensed as incurred. A total of $3.6 million in finance costs have been capitalised to inventory for the year ended 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: $2.2 million). When inventories are sold, the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognised. For wholly owned, internally managed developments, this expense is determined on a forward looking, revenue proportional basis.\n\n## Net realisable value (NRV)\n\nThe NRV is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs to sell, and where relevant, any estimated costs of completion. At each reporting date, management reviews these estimates by considering:\n\n- \u00b7 The most reliable evidence, and\n- \u00b7 Any events which confirm conditions existing at the year end that could cause any fluctuations of selling price and costs to sell.\n\nThe amount of any write down is recognised as an impairment expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. An impairment expense of $1.0 million has been recognised for the year ended 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: $1.1 million).",

Under current tax legislation, the Trust is not liable for income tax provided the taxable income of the Trust including realised capital gains is attributed in full to its securityholders each financial year. Securityholders are subject to income tax at their own marginal tax rates on amounts attributable to them.\n\n## Company\n\nIncome tax expense for the financial year is the tax payable on the current year's taxable income. This is adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences.\n\n## Deferred income tax liabilities and assets - recognition\n\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences.\n\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carried forward unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent it is probable that taxable profit will be available to utilise them. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available.\n\n## Deferred income tax liabilities and assets - measurement\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance date.\n\nDeferred income tax is provided on temporary differences at the reporting date between accounting carrying amounts and the tax cost bases of assets and liabilities, other than for the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Where taxable temporary differences relate to investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures:\n- -  Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future, and\n- -  Deferred tax assets are not recognised if it is not probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will not be available to utilise the temporary differences.",

Taxation continued\n\n## Tax relating to equity items\n\nIncome taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe Australian Accounting Standards Board have issued a Draft Appendix to the Tax Transparency Code outlining the method to calculate the effective tax rate as shown in note 9(b), using:\n\n- \u00b7 Accounting profit before tax adjusted to exclude transactions which are not reflected in the calculation of income tax expense, including,\n- -Trust taxable income which is attributed in full to its securityholders, and\n- -Non-tax related material items in the Company, and\n- \u00b7 Tax expense adjusted to exclude carry forward tax losses that have been recognised and prior year tax under/overstatements.\n\n## Attribution managed investment trust regime\n\nThe Trust made an election to be an attribution managed investment trust (AMIT). Under Australia's taxation laws, unitholders of the Trust pay income tax to the Federal Government on taxable income that is attributed to them as part of the Trust distribution process.\n\nIn the case where a GPT unitholder is an Australian resident, the unitholder pays tax on the taxable income attributed to them at their own applicable tax rate. Where the unitholder is a non-resident, Managed Investment Trust (MIT) withholding tax applies at the rate of 15 per cent where the place of payment is in a country that has an exchange of information agreement with Australia. If such an agreement does not exist, a withholding tax rate of 30 per cent or 45 per cent applies, depending on the circumstances.\n\n## CAPITAL STRUCTURE\n\nCapital is defined as the combination of securityholders' equity, reserves and net debt (borrowings less cash and cash equivalents). The Board is responsible for monitoring and approving the capital management framework within which management operates. The purpose of the framework is to safeguard GPT's ability to continue as a going concern while optimising its debt and equity structure. GPT aims to maintain a capital structure which includes net gearing levels within a range of 25 to 35 per cent that is consistent with a stable investment grade credit rating in the 'A category'.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, GPT is credit rated A- (stable) / A2 (stable) by Standard and Poor's (S&P) and Moody's Investor Services (Moody's) respectively. The ratings are important as they reflect the investment grade credit rating of GPT which allows access to global capital markets to fund the business. The stronger ratings improve both the availability of capital, in terms of amount and tenor, and reduce the cost at which it can be obtained.\n\nGPT is able to vary the capital mix by:\n\n- \u00b7 Issuing stapled securities\n- \u00b7 Buying back stapled securities\n- \u00b7 Activating the distribution reinvestment plan\n- \u00b7 Adjusting the amount of distributions paid to stapled securityholders\n- \u00b7 Selling assets to reduce borrowings, or\n- \u00b7 Increasing borrowings.",

This reserve is inclusive of the share of cost of hedging reserve of equity accounted investments. Refer to note 14 for further details.\n\n## employee incentive scheme reserve\n\nThe reserve is used to recognise the fair value of equity-settled security based payments provided to employees, including key management personnel, as part of their remuneration.

Borrowings continued\n\nAll borrowings with maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting date are classified as non-current liabilities.\n\nBorrowings are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nWhen the terms of a financial liability are modified, AASB 9 requires an entity to perform an assessment to determine whether the modified terms are substantially different from the existing financial liability. Where a modification is substantial, it will be accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and a recognition of a new financial liability. Where the modification does not result in extinguishment, the difference between the existing carrying amount of the financial liability and the modified cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as a gain/loss on modification of financial liabilities.

Financial Risk Management\n\nThe GPT Board approve GPT's treasury policy which:\n\n- \u00b7 Establishes a framework for the management of risks inherent to the capital structure\n- \u00b7 Defines the role of GPT's treasury, and\n- \u00b7 Sets out the policies, limits, monitoring and reporting requirements for cash, borrowings, liquidity, credit risk, foreign exchange, interest rate and other derivative instruments.\n\n## a) Derivatives\n\nAs part of normal business operations, GPT is exposed to financial market risks which are principally interest rate risk on borrowings and foreign exchange rate risk on foreign currency borrowings. GPT manages these risks through the use of derivative instruments including interest rate swaps (fixed to floating, floating to fixed and floating to floating swaps), cross currency interest rate swaps and option based derivatives. Regular coupons under these instruments are reported in finance costs in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income along with the interest cost on borrowings to which it relates.\n\nDerivatives are carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at fair value and classified according to expected cash flow. If they do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in fair value (including amortisation of upfront payment including premiums) are recognised in net gain/loss on fair value movements of derivatives in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting and are designated in hedge relationships, the recognition of any gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged. Refer to note 14(b) on hedge accounting. All of GPT's derivatives are valued using market observable inputs (level 2). For additional fair value disclosures refer to note 15.\n\nThe 31 December 2022 balances of derivative assets and liabilities have been restated to reflect a correction of an immaterial error in determining the current and non-current portions of the balances. The total derivative valuation remains unchanged.\n\n|                                                                      | 31 Dec 23  $M   | 31 Dec 22  $M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Derivative Assets                                                    |                 |                 |\n| Interest Rate Swaps - AUD                                            | 63.3            | 150.6           |\n| Cross Currency Interest Rate Swaps - fair value hedges               | 9.9             | 0.9             |\n| Cross Currency Interest Rate Swaps - fair value and cash flow hedges | 290.5           | 259.3           |\n| Total Derivative Assets                                              | 363.7           | 410.8           |\n| Derivative Liabilities                                               |                 |                 |\n| Interest Rate Swaps - AUD                                            | 70.0            | 125.4           |\n| Cross Currency Interest Rate Swaps - fair value hedges               | 42.6            | 64.5            |\n| Cross Currency Interest Rate Swaps - fair value and cash flow hedges | 25.5            | 21.9            |\n| Total Derivative Liabilities                                         | 138.1           | 211.8           |\n| Net Derivative Assets                                                | 225.6           | 199.0           |",

Financial Risk Management continued\n\n## a) Derivatives continued\n\nGPT enters into ISDA (International Swap Derivatives Association) Master Agreements with its derivative counterparties. Under the terms of these agreements, where certain credit events occur, there is a right to set-off the position owing/receivable to a single counterparty to a net position as long as all outstanding derivatives with that counterparty are terminated. As GPT does not presently have a legally enforceable right to set-off, these amounts have not been offset in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. In the event a credit event occurred, the ISDA Master Agreement would have the effect of netting, allowing a reduction to derivative assets and derivative liabilities of the same amount of $104.1 million (31 December 2022: $151.6 million).\n\n## b)  Hedge accounting\n\nGPT's objective is to manage the risk of volatility in FFO and NTA and whilst economic hedges exist to manage its financial market risks, GPT has elected to apply hedge accounting only in relation to foreign currency borrowings. Foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from foreign currency borrowings are managed with cross currency interest rate swaps which convert foreign currency fixed interest rate cash flows into Australian dollar floating interest rate cash flows.\n\nAt inception of the hedge relationship, GPT designates and documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item and the proposed effectiveness of the risk management objective the hedge relationship addresses. GPT fully hedges 100 per cent of its foreign currency exposure in respect of foreign currency borrowings with cross currency interest rate swaps and therefore applies a hedge ratio of 1:1. This means that whilst there are fair value movements from period to period, there is 100 per cent matching of cash flows, resulting in nil fair value movements over the duration of the borrowings nor FFO impact in any period. On an ongoing basis, GPT determines and documents its assessment of prospective hedge effectiveness of all hedge relationships.\n\nCross currency interest rate swaps hedging foreign currency borrowings are designated as either dual fair value and cash flow hedges or fair value hedges only.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nA fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of the underlying item (foreign currency borrowings) that is attributable to a particular risk (movements in foreign benchmark interest rates and if applicable, foreign exchange rates). All changes in the fair value of the foreign currency borrowings relating to the risk being hedged are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income together with the changes in the fair value of cross currency interest rate swaps with the net difference reflecting the hedge ineffectiveness.\n\n## cash flow hedges\n\nA cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk (movements in foreign exchange rates) associated with a liability (foreign currency borrowings). The portion of the fair value gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is effective (that which offsets the movement on the hedged item attributable to foreign exchange movements) is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised as net ineffectiveness on qualifying hedges directly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## currency basis\n\nA component of the cross currency interest rate swap is the currency basis. This is a liquidity premium that is charged for exchanging different currencies, and changes over time. Where currency basis has been included in fair value hedge designations, movement in currency basis is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. In all other cases, currency basis have been excluded from GPT's fair value hedge designation with movements recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in the cost of hedging reserve in equity.",

Refinancing risk arises when GPT is required to obtain debt to fund existing and new debt positions. GPT manages this risk by spreading sources, counterparties and maturities of borrowings in order to minimise debt concentration risk, allow averaging of credit margins over time and reducing refinance amounts.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, GPT's exposure to refinancing risk can be monitored by the spreading of its contractual maturities on borrowings in the liquidity risk table above or with the information in note 13.",

Financial Risk Management continued\n\n## f)  Foreign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial commitment, asset or liability will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. GPT's foreign exchange risk arises primarily from:\n\n- \u00b7 Firm commitments of highly probable forecast transactions for receipts and payments settled in foreign currencies or with prices dependent on foreign currencies, and\n- \u00b7 Investments in foreign assets.\n\nThe foreign exchange risk arising from borrowings denominated in foreign currency is managed with cross currency interest rate swaps which convert foreign currency exposures into Australian dollar exposures. Sensitivity to foreign exchange is deemed insignificant.\n\n## Foreign currency assets and liabilities\n\nThe following table shows the Australian dollar equivalents of amounts within the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position which are denominated in foreign currencies.\n\n|                                  | United States Dollars   | United States Dollars   | Hong Kong Dollars   | Hong Kong Dollars   |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                  | 31 Dec 23  $M           | 31 Dec 22  $M           | 31 Dec 23  $M       | 31 Dec 22  $M       |\n| Assets                           |                         |                         |                     |                     |\n| Derivative financial instruments | 222.2                   | 202.2                   | 78.2                | 58.0                |\n|                                  | 222.2                   | 202.2                   | 78.2                | 58.0                |\n| Liabilities                      |                         |                         |                     |                     |\n| Derivative financial instruments | 30.0                    | 32.1                    | 38.2                | 54.3                |\n| Borrowings 1                     | 1,641.2                 | 1,630.5                 | 843.9               | 736.5               |\n|                                  | 1,671.2                 | 1,662.6                 | 882.1               | 790.8               |\n\n## g)  Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a contracting entity will not complete its obligations under a contractual agreement, resulting in a financial loss to GPT. GPT has exposure to credit risk on all financial assets included on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\n\n## GPT manages this risk by:\n\n- \u00b7 Establishing credit limits for financial institutions and monitoring credit exposures for customers to ensure that GPT only trades and invests with approved counterparties\n- \u00b7 Investing and transacting derivatives with multiple counterparties that have a minimum long term credit rating of A- from S&P, or equivalent if an S&P rating is not available, minimising exposure to any one counterparty\n- \u00b7 Providing loans into joint ventures, associates and third parties, only where GPT is comfortable with the underlying property exposure within that entity\n- \u00b7 Regularly monitoring loans and receivables balances\n- \u00b7 Regularly monitoring the performance of its associates, joint ventures and third parties, and\n- \u00b7 Obtaining collateral as security (where appropriate).\n\nReceivables are reviewed regularly throughout the year. A provision for doubtful debts is recognised at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. Refer to note 4 for the calculation of lifetime ECL. GPT's policy is to hold collateral as security over tenants via bank guarantees (or less frequently, collateral such as bond deposits or cash).\n\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk as at 31 December 2023 is the carrying amounts of financial assets recognised on GPT's Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

Revenue for leases with fixed increases is recognised on a straight line basis for the minimum contracted rent over the lease term with an asset recognised as a component of investment properties relating to the fixed increases in operating lease rentals in future periods. When GPT provides lease incentives to tenants, these costs are amortised against lease income on a straight line basis. Contingent rental income is recognised as revenue in the period in which it is earned.\n\nIn addition to revenue generated directly from the lease, rent from investment properties includes non-lease revenue earned from tenants, predominately in relation to recovery of asset operating costs, which is recognised and measured under AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers .\n\nManagement has assessed if a rent waiver constitutes a lease modification under AASB 16 and concluded that where rent waivers relate to periods after the execution of an agreement with the tenant, this constitutes a lease modification and the rent waiver is reflected on a straight line basis over the life of the lease. Rent waivers relating to periods prior to the execution of an agreement are treated as write-offs under AASB 9 where the rent waiver offsets a receivable from the tenant (see note 4). Waivers reflected on invoices issued to tenants and which do not relate to previous outstanding debtors, are shown as a reduction to rent from investment properties on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.",

Contingent Liabilities\n\nA contingent liability is a liability that is not sufficiently certain to qualify for recognition as a provision where uncertainty may exist regarding the outcome of future events.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, GPT has no material contingent liabilities.\n\n## 20.  Security Based Payments\n\nGPT currently has four employee security schemes - the General Employee Security Ownership Plan (GESOP), the Broad Based Employee Security Ownership Plan (BBESOP), the Deferred Short Term Incentive Plan (DSTI) and the Long Term Incentive (LTI) Scheme.\n\n## a) GESOP\n\nThe Board believes in creating ways for employees to build an ownership stake in the business. As a result, the GESOP is in place for individuals who do not participate in the LTI.\n\nUnder the plan individuals who participate receive an additional benefit equivalent to 10 per cent of their short term incentives (STIC). The amount after the deduction of income tax is invested in GPT securities to be held for a minimum of one year. The cost of this benefit is recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## b) BBESOP\n\nUnder the plan individuals who are not eligible to participate in any other employee security scheme may receive $1,000 worth of GPT securities or $1,000 cash if GPT achieves at least target level performance. Securities must be held for the earlier of three years or the end of employment. The cost of this benefit is recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.",

Security Based Payments continued\n\n## c) DSTI\n\nSTIC is delivered to the senior executives as 50 per cent in cash and 50 per cent in GPT stapled securities (a deferred component). The deferred component is rewarded in restricted securities which vest one year after award, subject to continued employment up to the vesting date.\n\n## d) LTI\n\nAt the 2009 AGM, GPT securityholders approved the introduction of a LTI plan based on performance rights.\n\nThe LTI plan covers each three year period. Awards under the LTI to eligible participants are in the form of performance rights which convert to GPT stapled securities for nil consideration if specified performance conditions for the applicable three year period are satisfied. Please refer to the Remuneration Report for detail on the performance conditions.\n\nThe Board determines those executives eligible to participate in the plan and, for each participating executive, grants a number of performance rights calculated as a percentage of their base salary divided by GPT's volume weighted average price (VWAP) for the 30-day period immediately prior to the commencement of the performance period.\n\n## Fair value of performance rights and restricted securities under DsTi and lTi\n\nThe fair value of the performance rights is recognised as an employee benefit expense over the vesting period (2023: $4.0 million, 2022: $5.9 million) with a corresponding increase in the employee incentive scheme reserve in equity. For LTI, the fair value is measured at grant date. For DSTI, the fair value is measured at each reporting date until the grant date. Total security based payment expense based on the fair value is recognised over the period from the service commencement date to the vesting date of the performance rights.\n\nNon-market vesting conditions are included in the calculation of the number of rights that are expected to vest. At each reporting date, GPT revises its estimate of the number of performance rights that are expected to vest and the employee benefit expense recognised each reporting period takes into account the most recent estimate.

Accounting Policies\n\n## a)  Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements are a general purpose financial report which has been prepared:\n\n- \u00b7 In accordance with the requirements of the Trust's Constitution, Corporations Act 2001 , Australian Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting Standards\n- \u00b7 In accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)\n- \u00b7 On a going concern basis. GPT has prepared an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern, taking into account all available information for a period of 12 months from the date of these financial statements and future cash flow assessments have been made (refer to note 24(b)). GPT is confident in the belief that it will realise its assets and settle its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business and for at least the amounts stated in the financial statements. The net deficiency of current assets over current liabilities of $235.7 million arises as a result of the inclusion of borrowings due within 12 months (inclusive of $67.1 million of outstanding commercial paper). As set out in note 13, GPT has access to $1,509.6 million in undrawn financing facilities (prior to repayment of the commercial paper). Refer to note 24(b) for further information on going concern\n- \u00b7 Under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation for financial assets and liabilities and investment properties at fair value through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\n- \u00b7 Using consistent accounting policies with adjustments to bring into line any dissimilar accounting policies being adopted by the controlled entities, associates or joint ventures, and\n- \u00b7 In Australian dollars with all values rounded in the nearest hundred thousand dollars in accordance with ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191, unless otherwise stated.\n\nIn accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, the stapled entity reflects the consolidated entity. Equity attributable to other stapled entities is a form of non-controlling interest and represents the contributed equity of the Company.\n\nComparatives in the financial statements have been restated to the current year presentation.\n\nAs a result of the stapling, investors in GPT may receive payments from each component of the stapled security comprising distributions from the Trust and dividends from the Company.\n\nThe financial report was approved by the Board of Directors on 19 February 2024.\n\n## b)  Going Concern\n\nGPT is of the opinion that it is able to meet its liabilities and commitments as and when they fall due for at least a period of 12 months from the date of this report. In reaching this position, GPT has taken into account the following factors:\n\n- \u00b7 Available liquidity, through cash and undrawn facilities, of $1,465.2 million (after allowing for repayment of $67.1 million of outstanding commercial paper) as at 31 December 2023;\n- \u00b7 Weighted average debt facility expiry of 5.9 years, with sufficient liquidity in place to cover the $200.0 million of debt (excluding commercial paper outstanding) due between the date of this report and 31 December 2024;\n- \u00b7 Primary covenant gearing of 28.7 per cent, compared to a covenant level of 50.0 per cent, and\n- \u00b7 Interest cover ratio for the twelve months to 31 December 2023 of 4.0 times, compared to a covenant level of 2.0 times.\n\n## c)  Basis of consolidation\n\n## controlled entities\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of GPT include the assets, liabilities and results of all controlled entities for the financial year.\n\nControlled entities are all entities over which GPT has control. GPT controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity.\n\nControlled entities are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained to the date on which control is disposed. The acquisition of controlled entities is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. All intercompany balances and transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses resulting from intra-group transactions have been eliminated.",

Accounting Policies continued\n\n## c)  Basis of consolidation continued\n\n## Associates\n\nAssociates are entities over which GPT has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying voting or decision making rights of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent. Management considered if GPT controls its associates and concluded that it does not based on its level of control over each associate.\n\nInvestments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. Under this method, GPT's investment in associates is carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at cost plus post acquisition changes in GPT's share of net assets. GPT's share of the associates' result is reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Where GPT's share of losses in associates equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured long term receivables, GPT does not recognise any further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.\n\n## Joint arrangements\n\nInvestment in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations each investor has, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. GPT has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined it has both joint operations and joint ventures.\n\n## Joint operations\n\nGPT has significant co-ownership interests in a number of properties through unincorporated joint ventures. These interests are held directly and jointly as tenants in common. GPT recognises its direct share of jointly held assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the consolidated financial statements under the appropriate headings. The investment properties that are directly owned as tenants in common are disclosed in note 2.\n\n## Joint ventures\n\nInvestment in joint ventures are accounted for in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position using the equity method which is the same method adopted for associates.\n\n## d)  Other accounting policies\n\nSignificant accounting policies that summarise the recognition and measurement basis used and are relevant to an understanding of the financial statements are provided throughout the notes to the financial statements.\n\n## i)  Foreign currency translation\n\n## Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the GPT entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate ('the functional currency').\n\n## Transactions and balances\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## Foreign operations\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost are converted using the exchange rate as at the date of the initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. Translation differences of non-monetary items, such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.\n\nExchange differences arising on monetary items that form part of the net investment in a foreign operation are taken against a foreign currency translation reserve on consolidation.\n\nWhere forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into to cover any anticipated excesses of revenue less expenses within foreign joint ventures, they are converted at the ruling rates of exchange at the reporting period. The resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are taken to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.",

Accounting Policies continued\n\n## d)  Other accounting policies continued\n\n## ii)  Goods and services Tax (GsT)\n\nRevenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST (or equivalent tax in overseas locations) except where the GST incurred on purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the tax authority, in which case the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable. Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST. The net amount of GST receivable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included with other receivables or payables in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\n\nCash flows are presented on a gross basis in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority are presented as operating cash flows. Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority.\n\n## iii) revenue\n\nRental revenue from investment properties is recognised on a straight line basis for the minimum contracted rent over the lease term with an asset recognised as a component of investment properties relating to the fixed increases in operating lease rentals in future periods. When GPT provides lease incentives to tenants, these costs are amortised against lease income on a straight line basis.\n\nContingent rental income is recognised as revenue in the period in which it is earned.\n\nRevenue from dividends and distributions is recognised when they are declared.\n\nInterest income is recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.",

Accounting Policies continued\n\n## d)  Other accounting policies continued\n\n## vi)  Finance costs\n\nFinance costs include interest on borrowings and regular coupons paid or received under derivative instruments hedging GPT's interest rate risk on a portfolio basis, amortisation of discounts or premiums relating to borrowings and amortisation of ancillary costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings. Finance costs are expensed as incurred unless they relate to a qualifying asset.\n\nA qualifying asset is an asset under development which generally takes a substantial period of time to bring to its intended use or sale. Finance costs incurred for the acquisition and construction of a qualifying asset are capitalised to the cost of the asset for the period of time that is required to complete the asset. Where funds are borrowed specifically for a development project, finance costs associated with the development facility are capitalised. Where funds are used from Group borrowings, finance costs are capitalised using the relevant capitalisation rate taking into account the Group's weighted average cost of debt.\n\n## vii) leases\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, GPT's incremental borrowing rate is used. The incremental borrowing rate is calculated by interpolating or extrapolating secondary market yields on the Group's domestic medium term notes (MTNs) for a term equivalent to the lease. If there are no MTNs that mature within a reasonable proximity of the lease term, indicative pricing of where the Group can price a new debt capital market issue for a comparative term will be used in the calculation.\n\nLease liabilities are subsequently measured by:\n\n- \u00b7 Increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability\n- \u00b7 Reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made, and\n- \u00b7 Remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications.\n\nInterest on the lease liability and any variable lease payments not included in the measurement of the lease liability are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they relate. Interest on lease liabilities included in Finance costs in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income totalled $0.9 million for the year (31 December 2022: $1.2 million).\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost less depreciation and impairment and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The cost of the asset includes:\n\n- \u00b7 The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability\n- \u00b7 Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received\n- \u00b7 Any initial direct costs, and\n- \u00b7 Restoration cost.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight line basis from the commencement date of the lease to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term, unless they meet the definition of an investment property. Right-of-use assets which meet the definition of an investment property form part of the investment property balance and are measured at fair value in accordance with AASB 140 Investment Property (refer note 2 and the following section on ground leases).\n\nGPT's right-of-use assets are all property leases.\n\nGPT determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with both:\n\n- \u00b7 The periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and\n- \u00b7 Periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise that option.\n\nManagement considers all the facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option or not exercise a termination option. This assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is within the control of the lessee.\n\nGPT tests right-of-use assets for impairment where there is an indicator that the asset may be impaired. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.",

This has resulted in an impairment expense of $1.3 million for the year (31 December 2022: $1.4 million reversal of impairment).\n\n## Ground Leases\n\nA lease liability reflecting the leasehold arrangements of investment properties is separately disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and the carrying value of the investment properties is adjusted (i.e. grossed up) so that the net of these two amounts equals the fair value of the investment properties. The lease liabilities are calculated as the net present value of the future lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate.\n\n## e)  New and amended accounting standards and interpretations adopted from 1 January 2023\n\nGPT has applied the following standard and amendment for the first time for the annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 AASB 2021-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards Disclosure of Accounting Policies and Definition of Accounting Estimates [AASB 7, AASB 101, AASB 108, AASB 134 & AASB Practice Statement 2].\n- \u00b7 AASB 2021-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Disclosure of Accounting Policies: Tier 2 and Other Australian Accounting Standards [AASB 1049, AASB 1054 and AASB 1060].\n\nOther than the above, there are no significant changes to GPT's financial performance and position as a result of the adoption of the new and amended accounting standards and interpretations effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.\n\n## f)  New accounting standards and interpretations issued but not yet adopted\n\nCertain new accounting standards, amendments to accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2023 reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Group.

Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial report as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management structure of the Group, its accounting processes and controls and the industry in which it operates.\n\n## Audit scope\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- \u25cf The structure of the Group is commonly referred to as a stapled group. In a stapled group, the securities of two or more entities are 'stapled' together and cannot be traded separately. In the case of the Group, the units in the Trust have been stapled to the shares in the Company. For the purposes of consolidation accounting, the Trust is the 'deemed' parent and the financial report reflects the consolidation of the Trust and its controlled entities and the Company and its controlled entities.\n- \u25cf Our audit focused on where the Group made subjective judgments; for example, significant accounting estimates involving assumptions and inherently uncertain future events.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report for the current period. The key audit matter was addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on this matter. Further, any commentary on the outcomes of a particular audit procedure is made in that context.\n\n| Key audit matter                                                                                                        | How our audit addressed the key audit matter                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Valuation of investment properties, including  investment properties in equity accounted  investments                   | We developed an understanding of the control  activities relevant to our audit over the data provided by  the Group to external valuers; and review and  recommendation of the valuations by the Valuation  Committee. |\n| Refer to Note 2 and 3                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| The Group's investment property portfolio is comprised                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| of office, retail and logistics properties including  properties under development in those categories.
