It is embedded into every aspect of our business and woven into the fabric of our culture, inspiring us to create the circumstances necessary to make the world a better place.

Together, we supported 22 humanitarian and emergency relief efforts, providing $ 12.6 million toward global aid through cash donations and in-kind contributions, including support for the people facing unprecedented wildfires and hurricanes in Canada and earthquakes in T\u00fcrkiye, Syria and Morocco.\n\nOur 18th annual TELUS Days of Giving raised the bar higher than ever before, mobilizing a record-breaking 80,000 volunteers globally and helping to drive a world-leading 1.5 million volunteer hours through events such as planting",

Indeed, in a world that continues to be ravaged by tragic disasters and humanitarian crises, a strong sense of connection and helping one another has never been more important.\n\nIn this regard, your Company has invested approximately $ 259 billion in network infrastructure, operations and spectrum over the past 24 years and we have committed another $ 81 billion through 2027. These investments will ensure that TELUS customers continue to benefit from the best network experience in the world, which facilitates critical, generational change in healthcare, education, teleworking, the environment and our digital economy. Indeed, TELUS' networks continued to earn global accolades in 2023 for reliability, expansiveness, speed and superiority, including multi-year recognition from independent third-party organizations, such as Opensignal and PCMag. Perhaps most importantly, our networks also help us bridge digital divides, so every member of our society has the opportunity to reach their full potential.\n\nIn 2023, your Company celebrated the 10th anniversary of our unparalleled TELUS PureFibre network, which brings the fastest and most reliable communications technology in the world to 3.2 million households and businesses. Over the past decade, we have invested more than $ 7 billion to connect both urban and rural communities to our leading PureFibre network. Furthermore, $ 112 million has been invested to date, inclusive of the co-funding partnerships we initiated, to connect 248 Indigenous lands. We also demonstrated our leadership on the path of reconciliation by contributing $ 10 million to Indigenous initiatives, such as the digital Witness Blanket, as well as doubling the impact of the TELUS Indigenous Communities Fund, with a $ 2 million commitment through to 2028. Our goal is to make a meaningful impact in Indigenous communities and enable transformative outcomes that will be experienced positively by generations to come.\n\nAs we continue to expand TELUS PureFibre, your Company is progressing our global-best copper retirement program.

By way of example, the transition from copper to fibre has already led to the reduction of more than 7,400 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions cumulatively since the program's inception. The program has also unlocked the potential of urban mining, in which we recycle unused telecom cables, mitigating the need to mine new copper sources. To date, we have repurposed more than 3,600 tonnes of copper, supporting the circular economy. Importantly, fibre is also more resilient to extreme weather, temperature changes and moisture, which helps ensure TELUS' network is always available, including during severe weather emergencies.",

Disconcertingly, the average Canadian post-secondary student owes almost $30,000 upon graduation and two in five students consider withdrawing from school due to financial constraints. Our goal is to make the TELUS Student Bursary so large and impactful that every person in Canada who wants an education will get one, regardless of their financial or social circumstances.\n\n## Subsidizing connectivity to bridge digital divides\n\nWe also celebrated the 10th anniversary of our TELUS Wise program, through which we provide citizens with free access to digital literacy tools and resources needed to stay safe and informed in our digital society. Certainly, the world has evolved significantly in recent years, with technology becoming more pervasive, including the accelerated adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI). To help young people navigate this rapidly evolving technology, we launched a new workshop in 2023 on responsible AI.\n\nNotably, your Company expanded our Internet for Good program to provide faster speeds and higher data usage to support the livelihoods of low-income families, seniors, youth, people with disabilities and refugees. Our Mobility for\n\nGood program for low-income seniors has provided invaluable support to nearly 14,000 individuals, facilitating essential connections that enable them to remain connected with loved ones, access vital healthcare services and utilize other crucial resources. Moreover, our Mobility for Good program was enhanced to provide over 6,200 government-assisted refugees with free smartphones and low-cost mobility plans. In doing so, TELUS is helping newcomers connect to support networks, online resources and their loved ones as they begin their new lives in Canada. These are just three examples of how our Connecting for Good programs ensure that the most vulnerable among us have access to worldleading technology and connectivity, to help them succeed in our digital world. Since inception, our TELUS team has supported over 1.1 million individuals through our Connecting for Good and TELUS Wise programs.\n\n## Creating a friendlier future for young people in need\n\nAt TELUS, we believe that every young person deserves an equal opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential. It was this philosophy that drove your Company to establish TELUS Friendly Future Foundation in 2018, and its positive and lasting impact will be felt by generations of youth.\n\nThe Foundation's inspiring legacy continued to flourish in 2023, committing $ 11 million in cash grants to 550 grassroots charities and other community partners, while fundraising $ 3.6 million to advance the Foundation's mission. The Foundation also made numerous sustainability-related investments, including providing $ 200,000 innovation grants to EcoSpark and Living Lakes Canada, organizations that teach students about environmental conservation and water stewardship. Importantly, this past year, TELUS and the Foundation celebrated a historic milestone, launching our $ 50 million TELUS Student Bursary - the largest bursary fund ever in Canada (see sidebar).\n\nSince inception, the Foundation has contributed $ 47 million to local charities, supporting the incredible work of our TELUS Community Boards in Canada. In the United States, our recently launched TELUS North Carolina Community Board has already given US $ 350,000 to 38 grassroots organizations since 2022. Globally, TELUS Community Boards have invested $ 107 million in cash donations in more than 9,600 initiatives since 2005, assisting underserved youth populations in the communities where our team members live, work and serve.\n\n## Leading with purpose to protect our planet and strengthen communities\n\nIn 2023, we accelerated our sustainability efforts to reflect our team's commitment to preserving our environment and our customers' growing concerns about the impact of climate change.

To help support a circular economy, we also extended our programs to repair, recycle and reuse wireless devices, which, to date, have diverted 15 million devices from landfills.\n\nBeyond these initiatives, TELUS embraces tax morality as another way to improve outcomes for our fellow citizens. Since 2000, your Company has paid nearly $ 57 billion in total tax and spectrum remittances to federal, provincial and municipal governments. These funds support healthcare, education, national defence, arts and culture, public works projects and critical national infrastructure - all fundamental ingredients in the recipe for a vibrant and thriving society and growing economy.\n\n## Investing in businesses with a social purpose\n\nOne of the ways that TELUS amplifies our impact is by investing in companies and charities that share our passion for purpose. It was this vision that inspired us to create the TELUS Pollinator Fund four years ago, which today is one of the largest corporate impact funds in the world. In 2023, we increased the Fund's portfolio to 30 companies, announcing investments in clean-tech startups like Flash Forest and Dryad Networks, which use cutting-edge technology to prevent and mitigate the effects of wildfires (see sidebar on page 14). To date, the Fund has committed nearly $ 50 million in investments to purpose-driven startups. Notably, 40 per cent of our portfolio companies are led by women and 50 per cent are led by Indigenous and racialized founders.\n\nSimilarly, through TELUS Ventures, your Company has invested in more than 100 market-transforming companies since 2001, including circa $ 200 million in 2023 alone, to support companies such as Miovision, which aims to reduce traffic congestion and emissions through real-time data analytics, and Rhino Health, which leverages AI insights to improve efficiency in the healthcare sector.\n\nThrough our fourth annual #StandWithOwners campaign, your organization championed game-changing small business owners, and five grand prize winners each received $ 125,000 in funding, along with advertising, technology and mentorship. This was a record-breaking year for the campaign, with over 12,000 applications, representing a 70 per cent year-over-year increase. Since 2020, your Company has committed $ 3.5 million through #StandWithOwners in support of deserving entrepreneurs.\n\nYour Company is also investing in our greatest asset: our amazing TELUS team members, whose collective grit, passion and ingenuity propel our leadership in social capitalism.\n\n## Shining a spotlight on our amazing people\n\nYour Company is also investing in our greatest asset: our amazing TELUS team members, whose collective grit, passion and ingenuity propel our leadership in social capitalism. In this regard, TELUS finalized four major collective agreements in 2023, securing long-term contracts that support the best interests of our team members, customers and Company.\n\nIn 2023, we unveiled several initiatives to support our team members and strengthen our award-winning culture. These included our new digital and interactive well-being platform, which supports team members' health through group challenges and access to relevant, health-minded content. We also launched our new Indigenous Wellness Benefit, a unique program that provides up to $ 1,000 per year in reimbursement for traditional healing practices, ceremonies and medicines to help support our team members' well-being. Additionally, we introduced a mentorship and career development program for Indigenous team members and expanded our Truth & Reconciliation e-learning program, which has been completed by over 17,000 team members.\n\nYour Company also continued aligning our practices with the National Standard for Psychological Health and Safety in 2023 through our industryleading TELUS Mental Health Commitment, including extensive mental health training for team members. In doing so, TELUS earned recognition from Excellence Canada for our holistic approach to well-being, once again placing us in the top echelon of Canadian employers.\n\nThese initiatives helped TELUS realize world-leading team member engagement of 82 per cent, once again placing us in the top 10 per cent of Canadian employers and the top quartile of employers, globally. These remarkable engagement scores were achieved amidst a challenging year, during which our organization implemented staff reductions as part of a significant cost efficiency program, demonstrating the resilience of our dedicated team members worldwide.\n\nYour Company's long-standing commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive culture extends to our Board of Directors.

This included surpassing one million mobile phone and connected device net additions - a record-best for your Company. Notably, we recorded 443,000 mobile phone net additions, the best result since 2010, and a record-high 564,000 connected devices, bringing our total connected devices to more than three million. During the year, we also welcomed our one millionth security customer, reinforcing TELUS' leadership as the fastest-growing and most trusted security provider in North America.\n\nYour Company's consistent, industry-leading success is the result of our team's dedication to putting our customers first. Indeed, it is thanks to our operational execution, unmatched bundled product offerings across mobile and home, and innovative programs such as HomePro, which provides 24/7 technical support for our customers, that millions of Canadians prefer to choose TELUS.\n\n## Converting our passion into strong operational and financial results\n\nThroughout 2023, your Company successfully navigated a highly competitive industry, overcoming a dynamic regulatory environment and challenging macroeconomic landscape to achieve strong financial and operational results across our business. This was evidenced by operating revenues and Adjusted EBITDA increasing by 9.4 and 7.6 per cent, respectively. Net income declined by 50 per cent, primarily as a result of higher efficiency-related restructuring costs, depreciation and amortization from acquisitions, and financing costs. Importantly, free cash flow of approximately $ 1.8 billion was higher by an industryleading 38 per cent, surpassing our updated target of approximately $ 1.5 billion.\n\nThroughout 2023, your Company successfully navigated a highly competitive industry, overcoming a dynamic regulatory environment and challenging macroeconomic landscape to achieve strong financial and operational results across our business.\n\nTELUS International (TI) delivered solid revenue growth amidst a challenging operating landscape that impacted the global IT services sector.

This ongoing transformation led to the launch of Fuel iX - TI's comprehensive suite of services that includes digital consulting, data and analytics, web and mobile development, and an AI-enabled platform. TI expanded operations into South Africa and Morocco, bringing the total number of countries in which TI operates to 32.\n\nSimilarly, our TELUS Business Solutions team contributed to our strong performance in 2023, notably delivering continued profitable growth and achieving best-ever results across several business verticals. In addition to our partnerships in the electric vehicle market, as outlined above, our team also accelerated the deployment of 5G industry solutions such as smart building technologies, worker safety measures, video fleet solutions, private wireless networks, data insight solutions and enhanced Internet of Things connectivity to help support organizations looking to reduce emissions, improve energy costs, enhance safety and drive efficiency.\n\n## Leveraging our purpose to revolutionize health and well-being\n\nAcross TELUS Health, we continue to pursue our mission to build the most trusted well-being company in the world and support the mental, physical and financial health of organizations and individuals around the globe.

Dryad leverages Internet of Things networks and sensor innovation to detect fires as early as their initial smoldering phase, greatly reducing the risk of fires spreading, while Flash Forest uses drones to reforest post-wildfire areas that are deemed unsafe for human tree planters.\n\nWe also saw 20 per cent growth in TELUS Health MyCare users in 2023 and successfully finalized a significant MyCare contract with the Government of British Columbia.\n\nIn 2023, we launched Total Mental Health, offering unlimited access to counselling for organizations across Canada and the United States.

Through these initiatives, we have positively impacted more than 200,000 people in 2023 - and over 1.1 million since the inception of these programs - significantly enhancing access to technology and healthcare, and building digital literacy knowledge.\n\nOur Mobility for Good\u00ae and Internet for Good\u00ae programs made remarkable strides in 2023, with a key focus on providing support to even more government-assisted refugees arriving in Canada. Through Mobility for Good, we provided free or low-cost mobile phones and data plans to an additional 8,600 refugees, low-income seniors, youth aging out of foster care, Indigenous women at\n\nrisk of or surviving violence, and other marginalized individuals. And through Internet for Good, we expanded the program to offer faster speeds and provided low-cost, high-speed internet access to 8,500 new households, supporting 25,500 refugees, low-income family members and seniors, people living with disabilities and youth leaving foster care.\n\n## Celebrating a decade of helping people stay safe and secure online\n\nWe marked the 10th anniversary of TELUS Wise with significant educational outreach in 2023. With the introduction of a TELUS Wise responsible AI online workshop, we focused on educating teens about the safe and responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital technologies. Our impact has been widespread, with 680,000 individuals reached through TELUS Wise workshops since the program began in 2013. These efforts underscore our dedication to promoting online safety and digital literacy, equipping individuals with the knowledge, tools and resources they need to navigate the digital world responsibly.\n\n## 69.5 million\n\nlives covered by our health programs\n\n## 1.5 million\n\nhours of giving by our team members, retirees, family and friends\n\n## $100 million\n\ncontributed to charitable and community organizations\n\n## 1 millionth\n\ntree planted to help mitigate climate change",

Additionally, TELUS, our team members and retirees provided $ 100 million in cash, in-kind contributions, time and programs to charitable and community organizations.\n\nIn 2023, TELUS Friendly Future Foundation\u00ae contributed $ 11 million to 550 projects delivered by registered charities and community partners that promote health, well-being and education for youth across Canada. Notably, the Foundation also launched the $ 50 million TELUS Student Bursary program, the largest bursary fund in Canada, to award bursaries annually to more than 400 students experiencing financial need and who are committed to making a difference in their communities. Working in collaboration with the Foundation, our 13 Canadian TELUS Community Boards provide recommendations on the allocation of grants to grassroots charities. In 2023, we extended the geographical reach of five of our TELUS Community Boards in Alberta and Ontario, enabling more support of local programs and initiatives.\n\n## Transforming access to healthcare\n\nIn our first year after integrating LifeWorks' significant capabilities, TELUS Health continued strengthening our mission as a trusted global well-being company, fostering and enabling healthy communities and workplaces. Through our innovative healthcare resources and solutions, we are now providing support to 69.5 million lives worldwide.\n\nOur Health for Good\u00ae program saw a significant expansion in 2023, with the launch of Victoria's second mobile health clinic, in partnership with the Victoria Cool Aid Society, and a new mobile health clinic in Montreal, in partnership with Old Brewery Mission. The clinics offer a wide range of services, including primary healthcare and mental health support for marginalized populations, many of whom are experiencing homelessness. Since the program's inception, our mobile clinics have provided care in 25 communities across the country and, in 2023 alone, supported over 56,000 patient visits. We also expanded Health for Good to support women in need of mental health services by providing free access to TELUS Health MyCare\u2122 counselling sessions across British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario.\n\n## Passionate about environmental leadership\n\nIn 2023, our dedication to environmental stewardship and leadership in sustainability continued to grow as we implemented numerous sustainable\n\npractices that help us care for the planet. Visit telus.com/sustainability for more information.\n\nWe remain on track to achieving our environmental and sustainability targets, which include:\n\n- \u00b7 Effectively procuring 100 per cent of our electricity requirements from renewable or low-emitting sources by 2025\n- \u00b7 Improving energy efficiency by 50 per cent from 2019 levels by 2030\n- \u00b7 Becoming a zero-waste and net carbon neutral company by 2030 or sooner.\n\n## Restoring and protecting nature\n\nIn partnership with established global leaders, we are accelerating climate action by offering planting and other nature-based solutions, enabled by technology, to help others transition to a low-carbon future. A significant milestone in this regard was the planting of our one millionth tree in May, a testament to our steadfast commitment to reforestation and afforestation.\n\nThroughout 2023, our comprehensive approach has supported restoration efforts for more than 1,100 hectares of land and marine ecosystems, including the planting of an additional 2.1 million trees in Canada and internationally. This collective effort is projected to sequester nearly 600,000 tonnes of CO$\\_{2}e, which is equivalent to removing 62,000 cars from the road for a year. In addition to mitigating the effects of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, these initiatives also create important co-benefits, such as local employment opportunities and wildlife habitat provisioning.\n\n## Empowering a greener future\n\nIn 2023, we marked the 10th anniversary of our TELUS PureFibre\u00ae investment, celebrating a decade of connecting Canadians to our 100 per cent pure fibreto-the-premises network. This milestone coincided with our eco-conscious shift from copper to fibre, resulting in a cumulative GHG emission reduction of 7,400 tonnes. Through our copper retirement program, we have recycled or repurposed eight million pounds of copper, offsetting the need to mine new copper sources.\n\n## Procuring with purpose\n\nWe are committed to integrating sustainability considerations, such as environmental and social factors, as part of our supplier selection processes, supply chain management practices, and strategic planning and decisionmaking. Our supplier code of conduct helps us govern our collective performance on sustainability topics and ensures the well-being of our team members, contractors and communities.",

        "page_content": "As a member of the Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC), we conduct annual on-site audits of selected suppliers that include facility evaluations, management and worker interviews and documentation reviews. Being a member of JAC allows us to more effectively monitor our supply chain risks while working directly with our industry peers to foster collaboration, share resources and reduce the burden on suppliers.\n\n## Creating sustainable value\n\nIn 2023, we continued to advance our efforts to reduce GHG emissions across our value chain, in line with our ambitious scope 3 science-based target to reduce emissions from purchased goods and services, capital goods and use of sold products by 75 per cent per million dollars revenue from a 2019 base year by 2030. These three categories represent our most significant GHG emissions sources and areas where we can have the greatest impact.\n\nThrough our membership in the CDP Supply Chain Program, we engaged directly with our suppliers to help them understand and disclose their environmental impacts. By providing educational webinars and other resources to reinforce our expectations and build capacity, many of our suppliers participated in the CDP climate questionnaire for the first time, enabling us to gather primary GHG emissions data and restate our value chain scope 3 emissions.\n\n## Passionate about good governance and integrity\n\nWe continually pursue best-in-class corporate governance practices to ensure greater transparency and integrity in all our actions. Visit telus.com/governance for more information.\n\n## Cultivating diversity and inclusion\n\nDiversity and inclusion at TELUS is the ethos that permeates our entire organization. In fact, our commitment to diversity and inclusion is at the core of our values and culture, and central to our leadership in social capitalism.\n\nThis past year, we updated our Board diversity policy, increasing our gender target for our independent directors to at least 40 per cent women or men and expanding the categories of diversity our Board is targeting to include racialized persons, Indigenous Peoples, persons with disabilities and members of the LGBTQ2+ community. In December 2023, 42 per cent of our independent directors were female and three directors identified with one of these diverse groups. This policy reflects our commitment to diversity and inclusion.\n\nIn 2023, we scored 85 per cent on our inclusion index for the third consecutive year, reflecting a strong sense of inclusion and belonging among team members. This result demonstrates our ability to encourage, harness and value diversity\n\nof thought, driven by the diversity of our teams and our inclusive team culture, which enables team members to be their best selves.\n\nWe further expanded our TELUS Resource Groups (TRGs), advancing inclusion and fostering well-being within our global organization and communities. As an example, we welcomed a new Spectrum chapter in India, expanding our support of team members who identify as part of the LGBTQ2+ community. Our six TRGs play a vital role in recognizing diversity and supporting team members who identify as women, Indigenous, persons with disabilities and caregivers, newcomers and people with different cultural backgrounds, Black and LGBTQ2+.\n\n## Commitment to reconciliation\n\nThroughout the year, we made meaningful progress on the path of reconciliation, guided by our Indigenous Reconciliation Action Plan and our expanded Indigenous Advisory Council. As an example, in 2023, we doubled our commitment to the TELUS Indigenous Communities Fund, increasing our investment to $ 2 million over the next five years, and allocated 14 grants to Indigenous-led organizations across Canada, totalling $ 300,000. This fund enables impactful social outcomes and supports grant recipients in creating meaningful change in their communities. To learn more about our commitments and actions, visit telus.com/reconciliation .\n\n## Managing data responsibly\n\nOctober 2023 marked a historic milestone for TELUS as we became the first company in the world to achieve the ISO 31700-1 Privacy by Design certification, for our Data for Good program. This substantiates our unwavering commitment to safeguarding privacy and trustworthy data practices. Additionally, in September, we were the first Canadian telecom to sign the federal government's voluntary AI code of conduct, which seeks to ensure the transparent, equitable and responsible development of GenAI technology and emphasizes our commitment to ethical AI usage. To learn more about our trustworthy data practices, visit telus.com/trust .\n\n## Sustaining a culture of trust and integrity\n\nAt TELUS, a strong ethical culture is a shared commitment and responsibility of all team members. We provide comprehensive training programs on integrity, privacy, security awareness and data management, reinforcing our commitment to ethical conduct. Our EthicsLine, managed by an independent agency, remains an accessible tool for anonymous and confidential reporting, reflecting our commitment to transparency and accountability. For the 21st consecutive year, none of the calls reported to the Ethics Office in 2023 involved officers or team members with a significant role in internal control over financial reporting.",

During the year, we continued to invest strategically to support long-term, sustainable growth, while continuing to make a difference in our communities globally.\n\n## Making a meaningful difference\n\nAt TELUS, our commitment to social capitalism and sustainability is deeply ingrained in everything we do. Guided by our social purpose, we work passionately to enhance the lives of our customers and communities by providing solutions that help address many of the world's most significant issues. We believe our approach deepens customer loyalty and team engagement, broadens economic opportunities and ensures our efforts lead to positive and sustainable outcomes.\n\n## Investing for the future\n\nIn 2023, we continued to enhance our network leadership position, the foundation of our sustainable success, investing strategically in the continued expansion of our world-leading PureFibre and 5G networks. Furthermore, we provisionally secured 72 MHz nationally in the 3800 MHz\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nspectrum auction. When combined with our 3500 MHz holdings, we hold 100 MHz of contiguous 5G spectrum, positioning us to deliver an unparalleled 5G experience for our customers.\n\nWith an eye to the future, we implemented a substantial cost efficiency program in 2023, made possible by our generational investments in our leading networks and digital transformation. This program will continue to be a priority in 2024 as we leverage our fibre expansion and copper decommissioning initiatives, investments in digitization and artificial intelligence (AI), real estate rationalization aligned with the work styles of our team members, and the continued integration of systems, products and processes from our acquisitions, to highlight a few examples. These will improve our customer service, enhance product delivery and support our leading networks, while also driving EBITDA expansion, margin accretion and accelerated cash flow growth with significant cost savings.",

        "page_content": "## Delivering value for our investors\n\nIn 2023, we delivered strong financial results supported by our consistent focus on profitable customer growth, leveraging our leading portfolio of bundled solutions, and cost efficiency. Operating revenues grew by 9.4 per cent to $ 20 billion; net income decreased by 50 per cent to $ 867 million, due to higher efficiency-related restructuring costs, depreciation and amortization, primarily from acquisitions, and financing costs; and Adjusted EBITDA increased by 7.6 per cent to $ 7.15 billion. Furthermore, cash from operations decreased by 6.5 per cent to $ 4.5 billion, while free cash flow increased by 38 per cent to approximately $ 1.8 billion, surpassing our updated annual target of approximately $ 1.5 billion. The higher free cash flow result for the year reflects the timing of restructuring costs related to our efficiency program that will partially flow into 2024 and a lower-than-expected cash impact from device financing.\n\nOur balance sheet remains robust and was reinforced by a series of debt offerings in 2023 totalling $ 2.25 billion, underscoring our ready access to capital markets. These comprehensive offerings were met with strong investor demand and included our fifth sustainability-linked bond (SLB), solidifying TELUS' standing as the largest SLB issuer in Canada and demonstrating our commitment to sustainable business practices.\n\nOur debt maturity schedule is a testament to our effective financial planning. With the average maturity of our long-term debt of over 11 years and 87 per cent of our debt being fixed, we are well-positioned to successfully navigate future financial landscapes with resilience and foresight. Furthermore, the average cost of our long-term debt of 4.33 per cent at the end of 2023 remains low relative to the current interest rate environment.\n\nReturning capital to shareholders through our well-established dividend growth program, now in its 14th year, remains a priority. We announced two dividend increases in 2023, supported by our strong balance sheet and free cash flow outlook. As we navigate the complexities of the current environment, we stand by our commitment to deliver value for our investors, striking a balance between strategic initiatives and astute financial stewardship.\n\n## Progressing our growth strategy\n\nOur globally diversified asset mix remains a key competitive differentiator, providing a solid foundation for long-term success. We continue to strategically advance key verticals, which enables us to diversify our revenue streams and tap into important significant global growth opportunities. These businesses have a common thread - leveraging our expertise in technology, data analytics and AI to drive better outcomes for citizens around the world.\n\nIn 2023, TELUS International (TI) realized solid revenue growth, as reported in our digitally-led customer experiences (DLCX) segment, driven by continued momentum from AI services. In response to macroeconomic pressures, our TI team executed against its significant efficiency plans, and achieved a substantial rightsizing of its cost structure and notable margin improvement through the second half of 2023, positioning the business for continued growth in 2024 and beyond.\n\nMeanwhile, TELUS Health continued on its path toward becoming the world's most trusted well-being company, as the full integration of LifeWorks delivers cost efficiencies and opportunities for significant expansion in the years ahead. Lastly, our TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods team was strategically situated for meaningful advancement within TELUS Business Solutions, and in 2024, will benefit from newfound synergies, expertise and the high-performance culture of this expanded team.\n\n## Advancing with purpose and passion\n\nLooking forward, we are committed to continuing to build on our track record of operational and financial excellence. Our differentiated growth strategy, a cornerstone of our success, will drive our efforts toward achieving our ambitious 2024 consolidated financial targets.\n\nThese targets include realizing meaningful growth in our TELUS technology solutions (TTech) segment, including operating revenues of two to four per cent and Adjusted EBITDA of 5.5 to 7.5 per cent, demonstrating our determination to achieve long-term, sustainable financial success. We are also targeting consolidated free cash flow of approximately $ 2.3 billion and stable consolidated capital expenditures (excluding real estate development initiatives) of approximately $ 2.6 billion. When combined with TI's outlook for 2024, we anticipate consolidated operating revenues and Adjusted EBITDA to grow at similar rates to our TTech outlook. These targets for 2024 are a testament to our financial resilience and prudent capital management.\n\nWe are grateful for your continued support and eagerly anticipate another year of shared success and meaningful achievements, thanks to our people, purpose and passion.\n\nBest regards,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExecutive Vice-president and Chief Financial Officer February 16, 2024 Doug French",

Forward-looking statements include any statements that do not refer to historical facts. They include, but are not limited to, statements relating to our objectives and our strategies to achieve those objectives, our expectations regarding trends in the telecommunications industry (including demand for data and ongoing subscriber base growth), and our financing plans (including our multi-year dividend growth program). Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the words assumption , goal , guidance , objective , outlook , strategy , target and other similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as aim , anticipate , believe , could , expect , intend , may , plan , predict , seek , should , strive and will . These statements are made pursuant to the 'safe harbour' provisions of applicable securities laws in Canada and the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 .\n\nBy their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and are based on assumptions, including assumptions about future economic conditions and courses of action. These assumptions may ultimately prove to have been inaccurate and, as a result, our actual results or other events may differ materially from expectations expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements.\n\nThese risks and assumptions underlying our forward-looking statements are described in additional detail in Section 9 General trends, outlook and assumptions, and regulatory developments and proceedings and Section 10 Risks and risk management in this Management's discussion and analysis (MD&A). Those descriptions are incorporated by reference in this cautionary statement but are not intended to be a complete list of the risks that could affect the Company or of our assumptions.\n\nRisks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or other events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made herein and in other TELUS filings include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Regulatory matters. We operate in a number of highly regulated industries and are therefore subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations domestically and internationally. Policies and practices of elected officials and regulatory decisions, reviews and government activity may have strategic, operational and/or financial implications (including on revenue and free cash flow).\n\n## Risks and uncertainties include:\n\n- \u00b7 changes to our regulatory regime or the outcomes of proceedings, cases or inquiries relating to its application, including but not limited to those set out in Section 9.4 Communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings in this MD&A;\n- \u00b7 the potential for government to allow consolidation of competitors in our industry or conversely for government to intervene with the intent of further increasing competition, for example, through mandated wholesale access, including to fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) facilities;\n- \u00b7 the potential for additional government intervention on pricing, including internet overage charges and roaming fees;\n- \u00b7 the introduction of new privacy legislation by the federal, provincial or territorial governments or in non-Canadian jurisdictions where we do business that could materially expand or alter the scope of consumer privacy rights, include significant administrative monetary penalties and a private right of action, and implement a new regulatory regime for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the private sector, with significant enforcement powers;\n- \u00b7 changes to federal or provincial legislation or its application (including consumer protection legislation);\n- \u00b7 potential threats to unitary federal regulatory authority over communications in Canada;\n- \u00b7 potential threats to the CRTC's ability to enforce competitive safeguards such as the Standstill Rule and the Wholesale Code , which aim to ensure the fair treatment by vertically integrated firms of rival competitors operating as both broadcasting distributors and programming services;\n- \u00b7 regulatory action by the Competition Bureau or other regulatory agencies;\n- \u00b7 spectrum allocation and compliance with licences, including our compliance with licence conditions, changes to spectrum licence fees, spectrum policy determinations such as restrictions on the purchase, sale, subordination, use and transfer of spectrum licences, the cost and availability of spectrum and timing of spectrum allocation, and ongoing and future consultations and decisions on spectrum licensing and policy frameworks, auctions and allocation;\n- \u00b7 draft legislation permitting the government to restrict the use in telecommunications networks of equipment made by specified companies, including Huawei and ZTE;\n- \u00b7 draft legislation imposing new cybersecurity reporting requirements; the request by the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry to telecommunications service providers, including TELUS, to improve network resiliency, along with CRTC proceedings to investigate network reliability and resiliency;\n- \u00b7 potential limitations on international roaming fees and ancillary service fees;\n- \u00b7 restrictions on non-Canadian ownership and control of the common shares of TELUS Corporation (Common Shares) and the ongoing monitoring of, and compliance with, such restrictions;\n- \u00b7 unanticipated changes to the current copyright regime, which could impact obligations for internet service providers or broadcasting undertakings;\n- \u00b7 our ability to comply with complex and changing regulation of the healthcare, virtual care and medical devices industries in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including as an operator of health clinics; and risks related to the quality of care and provision of insured/uninsured services; and\n- \u00b7 our ability to comply with, or facilitate our clients' compliance with, numerous, complex and sometimes conflicting legal regimes, both domestically and internationally.\n- \u00b7 Competitive environment. Competitor expansion, activity and intensity (pricing, including discounting, bundling), as well as non-traditional competition, disruptive technology and disintermediation, may alter the nature of the market and impact our market share and financial results (including revenue and free cash flow).\n\n## Risks and uncertainties include:\n\n- \u00b7 our ability to continue to retain customers by providing a customer service experience that meets or exceeds expectations, a range of relevant products and services and a reliable state-of-the-art network;\n- \u00b7 the intensity of competition, including aggressive promotional offers and device financing strategies and the ability of industry competitors to offer bundled and/or discounted services;\n- \u00b7 competition across all services with communications companies and virtual broadcast distribution undertakings and other over-the-top (OTT) services, which, among other things, places pressures on current and future average revenue per subscriber per month (ARPU), cost of acquisition, cost of retention and churn rates for all services;\n- \u00b7 consolidation, mergers and acquisitions of industry competitors (including the acquisition of Shaw by Rogers and associated assets divested to Videotron), as well as any related regulatory actions;\n- \u00b7 regional operators leveraging wholesale access regulations to enter the market;\n- \u00b7 our ability to obtain and offer content on a timely basis across multiple devices on mobile and TV platforms at a reasonable cost as content costs per unit continue to grow;\n- \u00b7 low-earth-orbit satellite internet services becoming available in urban areas;\n- \u00b7 vertical integration in the broadcasting industry resulting in competitors owning broadcast content services, and timely and effective enforcement of related regulatory safeguards;\n- \u00b7 TI's ability to compete with professional services companies that offer consulting services, information technology companies with digital capabilities, and traditional contact centre and business process outsourcing companies that are expanding their capabilities to offer higher-margin and higher-growth digital services;\n- \u00b7 in our TELUS Health business, our ability to compete with other providers of employee and family assistance programs, benefits administration, electronic medical records and pharmacy management products, claims adjudicators, systems integrators and health service providers, including competitors with a vertically integrated mix of health services delivery, IT solutions and related services, global providers that could achieve expanded Canadian footprints, and providers of virtual healthcare services, preventative health services and personal emergency response services; and\n- \u00b7 in our TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods business, our ability to compete with focused software and IoT competitors.\n- \u00b7 Technology. Consumer adoption of alternative technologies and changing customer expectations have the potential to impact our revenue streams and customer churn rates.\n\n## Risks and uncertainties include:\n\n- \u00b7 reduced utilization and increased commoditization of traditional fixed voice services (local and long distance) resulting from impacts of OTT applications and mobile substitution;\n- \u00b7 a declining overall market for TV services, resulting in part from content piracy and signal theft, a rise in OTT direct-to-consumer video offerings and virtual multichannel video programming distribution platforms;\n- \u00b7 the increasing number of households with only mobile and/or internet-based telephone services;\n- \u00b7 potential decline in ARPU as a result of, among other factors, substitution by messaging and OTT applications; substitution by increasingly available Wi-Fi services;\n- \u00b7 disruptive technologies, such as OTT IP services, including software-defined networks in the business market that may displace or cause us to reprice our existing data services, and self-installed technology solutions;\n- \u00b7 any failure to innovate, maintain technological advantages or respond effectively and in a timely manner to changes in technology;\n- \u00b7 high subscriber demand for data that challenges wireless networks and spectrum capacity levels and may be accompanied by increases in delivery cost;\n- \u00b7 the roll-out, anticipated benefits and efficiencies, and ongoing evolution of wireless broadband technologies and systems;\n- \u00b7 availability of resources and our ability to build out adequate broadband capacity;\n- \u00b7 our choice of suppliers and those suppliers' ability to maintain and service their product lines, which could affect the success of upgrades to, and evolution of, technology that we offer;\n- \u00b7 our reliance on wireless network access agreements, which have facilitated our deployment of mobile technologies;\n- \u00b7 supplier limitations and concentration and market power for products such as network equipment, TELUS TV and mobile handsets;\n- \u00b7 our expected long-term need to acquire additional spectrum capacity through future spectrum auctions and from third parties to address increasing demand for data, and our ability to utilize spectrum we acquire;\n- \u00b7 deployment and operation of new fixed broadband network technologies at a reasonable cost and the availability and success of new products and services to be rolled out using such network technologies;\n- \u00b7 network reliability and change management; and\n- \u00b7 Security and data protection. Our ability to detect and identify potential threats and vulnerabilities depends on the effectiveness of our security controls in protecting our infrastructure and operating environment, and our timeliness in responding to attacks and recovering business operations. A successful attack may impede the operations of our network or lead to the unauthorized interception, destruction, use or dissemination of customer, team member or business information.\n- \u00b7 our deployment of self-learning tools and automation, which may change the way we interact with customers.\n- \u00b7 Generative AI (GenAI). GenAI exposes us to numerous risks including risks related to the responsible use of AI, data privacy and cybersecurity, and the possibility that our use of AI may produce inaccurate or inappropriate content or create negative perceptions among companies and regulators that could affect demand for our services.\n- \u00b7 Climate and the environment. Natural disasters, pandemics, disruptive events and climate change may impact our operations, customer satisfaction and team member experience.",

Investments and acquisitions present opportunities to expand our operational scope, but may expose us to new risks.

Risks and uncertainties include:\n- \u00b7 our ability to identify suitable candidates for partnerships or strategic transactions and our ability to complete these transactions;\n- \u00b7 our reliance on legacy systems and our ability to implement and support new products and services and business operations in a timely manner;\n- \u00b7 our ability to manage the requirements of large enterprise deals;\n- \u00b7 our ability to implement effective change management for system replacements and upgrades, process redesigns, cost efficiency programs and business integrations (such as our ability in a timely manner to successfully complete and integrate acquisitions into our operations and culture, complete divestitures or establish partnerships and realize expected strategic benefits, including those following compliance with any regulatory orders);\n- \u00b7 our ability to identify and manage new risks inherent in new service offerings that we may provide, including as a result of acquisitions, which could result in damage to our brand, our business in the relevant area or as a whole, and additional exposure to litigation or regulatory proceedings;\n- \u00b7 our ability to effectively manage the growth of our infrastructure and integrate new team members;\n- \u00b7 economic, political and other risks associated with doing business globally (including war and other geopolitical developments), as we have assets and operations located outside Canada and the U.S.\n- \u00b7 our reliance on third-party cloud-based computing services to deliver our IT services; and\n- \u00b7 Customer service. Our service delivery directly impacts customer experience, customer churn rates, and likelihood to recommend outcomes. We may not be able to deliver the excellence our customers expect or maintain our competitive advantage in this area.\n\n## Risks and uncertainties include:\n\n- our ability to successfully implement cost reduction initiatives (including efficiency and effectiveness programs, business integrations, business product simplification, business process automation and outsourcing, offshoring, reorganizations, procurement initiatives, and real estate rationalization). \u00b7\n- \u00b7 Our systems and processes. Systems and technology innovation, maintenance and management may impact our IT systems and network reliability, as well as our operating costs.\n\n## Risks and uncertainties include:\n\n- \u00b7 our ability to maintain customer service and operate our network in the event of human error or human-caused threats, such as cyberattacks and equipment failures that could cause various degrees of network outages;\n- \u00b7 technical disruptions and infrastructure breakdowns;\n- \u00b7 the completeness and effectiveness of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and responses.\n- \u00b7 delays and rising costs, including as a result of government restrictions or trade actions; and\n- \u00b7 Our team. The rapidly evolving and highly competitive nature of our markets and operating environment, along with the globalization and evolving demographic profile of our workforce, and the effectiveness of our internal training, development, succession and health and well-being programs, may impact our ability to attract, develop and retain team members with the skills required to meet the changing needs of our customers and our business. There may be greater physical and mental health challenges faced by team members (and their families) as a result of the pandemic, and the effect of other significant change initiatives at the organization may result in the loss of key team members through short-term and long-term disability.\n\n## Risks and uncertainties include:\n\n- \u00b7 recruitment, retention and appropriate training in a highly competitive industry (including retention of team members leading recently acquired businesses in emerging areas of our business);\n- \u00b7 the level of our employee engagement and impact on engagement or other aspects of our business or any unresolved collective agreements;\n- \u00b7 our ability to maintain our unique culture and team member engagement as we grow and implement organizational changes and cost reduction initiatives;\n- \u00b7 the risk that certain independent contractors in our business could be classified as employees; and\n- \u00b7 Suppliers. We may be impacted by supply chain disruptions and lack of resiliency in relation to global or local events. Dependence on a single supplier for products, components, service delivery or support may impact our ability to efficiently meet constantly changing and rising customer expectations while maintaining quality of service.\n- \u00b7 the physical and mental health of our team, which are critical to engagement and productivity.\n- \u00b7 Real estate matters. Real estate investments are exposed to possible financing risks and uncertainty related to future demand, occupancy and rental rates, especially following the pandemic. Future real estate developments may not be completed on budget or on time and may not obtain lease commitments as planned.\n- \u00b7 Financing, debt and dividends. Our ability to access funding at optimal pricing may be impacted by general market conditions and changing assessments in the fixed-income and capital markets regarding our ability to generate sufficient future cash flow to service our debt. Our current intention to return capital to shareholders could constrain our ability to invest in our operations to support future growth.\n\nOur capital expenditure levels and potential outlays for spectrum licences in auctions or purchases from third parties affect and are affected by: our broadband initiatives, including connecting more homes and businesses directly to fibre; our ongoing deployment of newer mobile technologies, including wireless small cells that can improve coverage and capacity; investments in network technology required to comply with laws and regulations relating to the security of cyber systems, including bans on the products and services of certain vendors; investments in network resiliency and reliability; the allocation of resources to acquisitions and future spectrum auctions held by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), including the millimetre wave spectrum auction, which is expected to commence in 2024. Our capital expenditure levels could be impacted if we do not achieve our targeted operational and financial results or if there are changes to our regulatory environment.\n\nLower than planned free cash flow could constrain our ability to invest in operations, reduce leverage or return capital to shareholders. This program may be affected by factors such as the competitive environment, fluctuations in the Canadian economy or the global economy, our earnings and free cash flow (which may be affected by restructuring and other costs resulting from initiatives such as post-acquisition integration and cost efficiency programs), our levels of capital expenditures and spectrum licence purchases, acquisitions, the management of our capital structure, regulatory decisions and developments, and business continuity events. Quarterly dividend decisions are subject to assessment and determination by our Board of Directors based on our financial position and outlook. There can be no assurance that our dividend growth program will be maintained through 2025 or renewed.\n\nFactors that may affect TI's financial performance are described in TI's public filings available on SEDAR+ and EDGAR. TI may choose to publicize targets or provide other guidance regarding its business and it may not achieve such targets. Failure to meet these targets could affect TELUS' ability to achieve targets for the organization as a whole and could result in a decline in the trading price of the TI Subordinate Voting Shares or the TELUS Common Shares or both.\n\n- \u00b7 Tax matters. Complexity of domestic and foreign tax laws, regulations and reporting requirements applying to TELUS and our international operating subsidiaries may impact financial results, effective governance of tax considerations and compliance. International acquisitions and expansion of operations heighten our exposure to multiple forms of taxation. Risks and uncertainties include:\n- \u00b7 interpretation of complex domestic and foreign tax laws by the relevant tax authorities that may differ from our interpretations;\n- \u00b7 the timing and character of income and deductions, such as depreciation and operating expenses;\n- \u00b7 changes in tax laws, including tax rates;\n- \u00b7 tax credits or other attributes;\n- \u00b7 tax expenses that are materially different than anticipated, including the taxability of income and deductibility of tax attributes or retroactive application of new legislation;\n- \u00b7 elimination of income tax deferrals; and\n- \u00b7 changes to the interpretation of tax laws, including those resulting from changes to applicable accounting standards or the adoption of more aggressive auditing practices by tax authorities, tax reassessments or adverse court decisions impacting the tax payable by us.\n- \u00b7 The economy. Changing global economic conditions, including a potential recession and alternating expectations about inflation, as well as our effectiveness in monitoring and revising growth assumptions and contingency plans, may impact the achievement of our corporate objectives, our financial results (including free cash flow), and our defined benefit pension plans.\n\n## Risks and uncertainties include:\n\n- \u00b7 the state of the economy in Canada, which may be influenced by economic and other developments outside of Canada, including potential outcomes of future policies and actions of foreign governments;\n- \u00b7 expectations regarding future interest rates;\n- \u00b7 unemployment levels;\n- \u00b7 inflation;\n- \u00b7 immigration levels;\n- \u00b7 effects of low business spending (such as reducing investments and cost structure);\n- \u00b7 effects of volatility in oil prices;\n- \u00b7 pension investment returns and factors affecting pension benefit obligations, funding and solvency discount rates;\n- \u00b7 sovereign credit ratings and effects on the cost of borrowing;\n- \u00b7 fluctuations in exchange rates of the currencies of various countries in which we operate;\n- \u00b7 the impact of tariffs on trade between Canada and the United States; and\n- \u00b7 Litigation and legal matters. Complexity of, and compliance with, laws, regulations, commitments and expectations may have a financial and reputational impact.\n- \u00b7 global implications of the dynamics of trade relationships among major world economies.\n\n## Risks and uncertainties include:\n\n- \u00b7 our ability to successfully respond to investigations and regulatory proceedings;\n- \u00b7 our ability to defend against existing and potential claims and lawsuits (including intellectual property infringement claims and class actions based on consumer claims, data, privacy or security breaches and secondary market liability), or our ability to negotiate and exercise indemnity rights or other protections in respect of such claims and lawsuits; and\n- \u00b7 the complexity of legal compliance in domestic and foreign jurisdictions, including compliance with competition, anti-bribery and foreign corrupt practices laws.\n\nMany of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control or outside of our current expectations or knowledge. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our financial position, financial performance, cash flows, business or reputation. Except as otherwise indicated in this document, the forward-looking statements made herein do not reflect the potential impact of any non-recurring or special items or any mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other business combinations or transactions that may be announced or that may occur after the date of this document.\n\nReaders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

The generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that we use are International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and Canadian GAAP. In this MD&A, the term IFRS refers to these standards. In our discussion, we also use certain non-GAAP and other specified financial measures to evaluate our performance, monitor compliance with debt covenants and manage our capital structure. These measures are defined, qualified and reconciled with their nearest GAAP measures, as required by National Instrument 52-112, Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Disclosure , in Section 11.1 . All currency amounts are in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise specified.\n\nAdditional information relating to the Company, including our Annual Information Form and other filings with securities commissions or similar regulatory authorities in Canada, is available on SEDAR+ ( sedarplus.com ). Our information filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States, including Form 40-F, is available on EDGAR ( sec.gov ). Additional information about our TELUS International (Cda) Inc. (TELUS International or TI) subsidiary, including discussion of its business and results, can be found in its public filings available on SEDAR+ and EDGAR.\n\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information is gathered and reported to senior management on a timely basis, so that appropriate decisions can be made regarding public disclosure. This MD&A and the Consolidated financial statements were reviewed by our Audit Committee and authorized by our Board of Directors (Board) for issuance on February 9, 2024.\n\nIn this MD&A, unless otherwise indicated, results for the year ended December 31, 2023 are compared with results for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## 1.2 The environment in which we operate\n\nThe success of our business and the challenges we face can best be understood with reference to the environment in which we operate, including broader economic factors that affect both TELUS and our customers, and the competitive nature of our business operations.\n\n## Est. 3%\n\n2023 Canadian telecom industry growth\n\n## 19.3 million\n\nTELUS telecom subscriber connections\n\n## $20.1 billion\n\nTELUS 2023 operating revenues and other income\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTELUS Corporation Common Share 2023 dividends declared and growth per share\n\n## Canadian telecommunications industry\n\nCanadians have become increasingly reliant on connectivity for many purposes - business, education, entertainment and staying connected, - and facilities-based operators continued to invest in expanding and enhancing network infrastructure to meet this demand. We estimate that Canadian telecommunications industry revenues (including TV revenue and excluding equipment and media revenue) grew by approximately 3% in 2023, with industry mobile network revenue growth of approximately 5.3%. Revenues generated by mobile products and services continued to account for the largest portion of telecommunications sector revenues, as Canadians increasingly relied on their mobile devices. We estimate that the Canadian mobile phone industry added approximately 1.7 million net new subscribers in 2023, compared to an estimate of approximately 1.8 million in 2022. With respect to fixed products and services, we estimate the Canadian consumer high-speed internet penetration rate grew by approximately one percentage point to 92% in 2023, and subscriber growth is expected to remain steady. Industry internet services revenue growth continued, as many Canadians relied on access to high-speed internet for work and entertainment at home and increased the speed of their service packages. The shift from the conventional television landscape to alternative forms of media also continued.",

(See Section 9 General trends, outlook and assumptions, and regulatory developments and proceedings , Section 10.4 Competitive environment and Section 10.17 The economy .) In May 2023, the World Health Organization announced that COVID-19 no longer qualified as a global health emergency. Notably, neither Ontario nor Quebec introduced widespread public health measures in 2023. Travel also returned to pre-pandemic levels during the year.\n\n## TELUS technology solutions (TTech)\n\nAcross TTech, we are leveraging our leading technology and social purpose to enable remarkable human outcomes.

This efficient and effective collaboration helps ensure the quality and safety of food and consumer goods.\n\n## Digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International (DLCX)\n\nTechnology is transforming the way businesses interact with their customers at an accelerating pace and scale. This transformation is making customer experience and digital experience critically important competitive differentiators across a wide range of industries and sectors. DLCX clients and their customers have access to more information and more choices than ever before, and their expectations about brand experiences and the speed at which companies must process and respond to customer interactions are changing rapidly. Customers value a consistent and personalized experience across every channel when interacting with the companies that serve them. Businesses face pressure to engage with their customers across digital and human channels, and seek to do so by combining technology with an authentic human experience that demonstrates a genuine commitment to customer satisfaction. Brands need to move at the speed of the customer, which means rapid response and fast resolution with low customer effort, powered by next-generation technology. The opportunities that artificial intelligence (AI) presents for augmenting and enhancing CX are far-reaching.\n\n## Economic estimates\n\nOur estimates regarding our economic and operational environment, including economic growth, inflation, unemployment, housing starts and immigration, serve as important inputs for the assumptions on which our targets are based. The extent of the impact these estimates will have on us, and the timing of that impact, will depend upon the actual future outcomes in specific sectors of the Canadian economy.\n\n|         |

        "page_content": "## 1.3 Highlights of 2023\n\n## WillowTree acquisition\n\nOn January 3, 2023, subsequent to the satisfaction of the closing conditions, WillowTree was acquired by TELUS International and has been consolidated in our DLCX segment. The acquisition brings key talent and diversity to the DLCX portfolio of next-generation solutions, and further augments its digital consulting and client-centric software development capabilities.\n\n## Collective bargaining\n\nDuring the year, collective agreements were successfully achieved with each of our largest three bargaining units, represented by the Telecommunications Workers Union, United Steelworkers Local 1944 (TWU), the Syndicat des agents de ma\u00eetrise (SAMT) and the Syndicat qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois des employ\u00e9s de TELUS (SQET). In March of 2023, a new four-year collective agreement, expiring March 31, 2027, was reached with the TWU. The renewal agreement with the SAMT is effective from October 29, 2023 to October 31, 2028. Our new contract with the SQET came into effect on July 9, 2023, and expires on June 30, 2028.\n\n## Long-term debt issues\n\nOn March 28, 2023, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured 4.95% Sustainability-Linked Notes, Series CAJ, maturing on March 28, 2033. This was our fourth offering of a sustainabilitylinked bond (SLB), issued pursuant to the SLB framework we announced on June 14, 2021. The net proceeds from this offering were used for the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, including the repayment of commercial paper and the reduction of cash amounts under an arm's-length securitization trust, and for other general corporate purposes.\n\nOn September 8, 2023, we completed a three-tranche note issuance of: $850 million of senior unsecured 5.75% Sustainability-Linked Notes, Series CAK, maturing on September 8, 2033; $400 million of senior unsecured 5.95% Notes, Series CAL, maturing on September 8, 2053; and $500 million of senior unsecured 5.60% Notes, Series CAM, maturing on September 9, 2030.\n\nThe net proceeds from the three-tranche offering were used for the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, including the repayment of commercial paper and the reduction of cash amounts outstanding under an arm's-length securitization trust, and for other general corporate purposes.\n\nThe Series CAK notes were issued pursuant to the previously mentioned SLB framework. Cumulatively, we have issued four SLBs in Canada and one in the U.S., which solidifies our position as the largest SLB issuer in Canada, contributing to our position as a leader in social capitalism.\n\n## Spectrum\n\nInnovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) held its auction of spectrum in the 3800 MHz band from October 24, 2023 through November 24, 2023. We acquired 72 MHz of spectrum for a total purchase price of $620 million. Combined with the 3500 MHz spectrum obtained in 2021, we have secured approximately 100 MHz of prime 5G mid-band spectrum nationally, with contiguity in 96% of the country, including all major markets, at an average price of $0.82 per MHz-pop (where pop refers to the population in a licence area). In accordance with the terms of the auction, 20% ($124 million) was remitted to ISED on its due date of January 17, 2024, while the remaining balance will be paid on, or before, May 29, 2024.\n\n## Our Board of Directors\n\nAt our 2023 annual general meeting held on May 4, 2023, the nominees listed in the TELUS 2023 information circular were elected as directors of TELUS. The Honourable John P. Manley was appointment as the new Chair of the Board and succeeded Dick Auchinleck, who retired after 20 years of service on the Board, including eight years as Chair.\n\nIn October 2023, Kathy Kinloch stepped down from our Board. Kathy joined the Board in 2017 and during her tenure, served on the Audit, Corporate Governance, and People, Culture and Compensation Committees.\n\nWe thank Dick and Kathy for their outstanding contributions and service to TELUS.",

Service revenues increased by $1.6 billion in 2023. TTech service revenue growth was driven by growth in health services revenues inclusive of our acquisition of LifeWorks on September 1, 2022, higher mobile network revenues and an increase in fixed data service revenues. Increased DLCX revenues resulted from growth from expanded services for certain existing clients and growth from new clients, including new clients from our acquisition of WillowTree on January 3, 2023.\n\nEquipment revenues increased by $161 million in 2023, driven by higher mobile equipment revenues due to higher-value smartphones in the sales mix.\n\n| Years ended December 31   ($ millions, except footnotes and unless noted otherwise)   | 2023   | 2022   | Change     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| Other highlights                                                                      |        |        |            |\n| Telecom subscriber connections3 (thousands)                                           | 19,339 | 17,971 | 7.6 %      |\n| Earnings before interest, income taxes,   depreciation and amortization1 (EBITDA)     | 6,431  | 6,406  | 0.4 %      |\n| EBITDA margin1 (%)                                                                    | 32.0   | 34.8   | (2.8) pts. |\n| Restructuring and other costs                                                         | 717    | 240    | n/m        |\n| Adjusted EBITDA1                                                                      | 7,149  | 6,643  | 7.6 %      |\n| Adjusted EBITDA margin1 (%)                                                           | 35.5   | 36.1   | (0.6) pts. |\n| Free cash flow1                                                                       | 1,759  | 1,274  | 38.1 %     |\n| Net debt to EBITDA - excluding   restructuring and other costs1 (times)               | 3.71   | 3.63   | 0.08       |\n\nNotations used in MD&A: n/m - not meaningful; pts. - percentage points.\n\nOther income decreased by $9 million in 2023, largely due to lower net reversals of business combination-related provisions, the non-recurrence of a gain on acquisition of control of LifeWorks in the prior year, and lower equity income. These effects were partly offset by higher net gains on residential real estate projects with an arm's-length party.\n\nFor additional details on Operating revenues and other income, see Section 5.4 TELUS technology solutions segment and Section 5.5 Digitally-led customer experiences TELUS International segment .\n\n- \u00b7 Operating income decreased by $592 million in 2023.

This reflected: (i) higher mobile network revenues; (ii) broad-based cost reduction efforts across both the TTech and DLCX segments; (iii) inorganic contributions from business acquisitions, predominantly from LifeWorks, in addition to its higher capitalized labour; and (iv) higher mobile equipment margins. These factors were partly offset by: (i) merit-based compensation increases; (ii) higher costs related to the scaling of our digital capabilities; (iii) declining TV and fixed legacy voice margins; (iv) higher bad debt expense; and (v) lower agriculture and consumer goods margins.

Adjusted basic EPS decreased by $0.23 or 19.5% in 2023.\n- \u00b7 Dividends declared per Common Share were $1.4544 in 2023, an increase of 7.3% from 2022. On February 8, 2024, the Board declared a first quarter dividend of $0.3761 per share on our issued and outstanding Common Shares, payable on April 1, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 11, 2024. The first quarter dividend increased by $0.0250 per share or 7.1% from the dividend of $0.3511 per share declared one year earlier,\n\n- consistent with our multi-year dividend growth program described in Section 4.3 Liquidity and capital resources .\n- \u00b7 During 2023, our total telecom subscriber connections increased by 1,368,000 or 7.6%. This reflected growth of 4.1% in mobile phone subscribers, 26.2% in connected device subscribers, 8.8% in internet subscribers, 5.2% in TV subscribers and 8.0% in security subscribers, partly offset by a decline of 2.8% in residential voice subscribers. (See Section 5.4 TELUS technology solutions segment for additional details.)\n\n## Liquidity and capital resource highlights\n\n- \u00b7 Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $312 million in 2023, primarily driven by other working capital changes and an increase in interest paid, partially offset by lower income taxes paid, net of recoveries received. (See Section 7.2 Cash provided by operating activities .)\n- \u00b7 Cash used by investing activities decreased by $660 million in 2023, largely attributable to lower cash payments for capital assets, excluding spectrum licences, and a decrease in cash payments for business acquisitions. Acquisitions decreased by $258 million in 2023, primarily reflecting the impact of the LifeWorks acquisition in the prior year, partially offset by the WillowTree acquisition in 2023. Capital expenditures decreased by $650 million in 2023, mainly due to the planned slowdown of our fibre and wireless network build and systems development, consistent with 2023 build targets, when compared to accelerated investments in 2022. (See Section 7.3 Cash used by investing activities .)\n- \u00b7 Cash provided by financing activities decreased by $709 million in 2023, primarily reflecting lower issuances of long-term debt, net of redemptions and repayment. (See Section 7.4 Cash provided by financing activities .)\n- \u00b7 Net debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs ratio was 3.71 times at December 31, 2023, up from 3.63 times at December 31, 2022. The effect of the increase, primarily due to business acquisitions, in net debt levels (which were already elevated in the current and comparative periods due to our spectrum acquisitions) exceeded the effect of growth in EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs. As at December 31, 2023, the acquisition of spectrum licences increased the ratio by approximately 0.45 and business acquisitions over the past 12 months increased the ratio by approximately 0.17. (See Section 4.3 Liquidity and capital resources and Section 7.5 Liquidity and capital resource measures .)\n- \u00b7 Free cash flow increased by $485 million in 2023, reflecting lower capital expenditures and the timing of restructuring and other disbursements into the following year, partly offset by an increase in cash interest paid and the timing related to device subsidy repayments and associated revenue recognition and our TELUS Easy Payment\u00ae device financing program. Our definition of free cash flow, for which there is no industry alignment, is unaffected by accounting standards that do not impact cash.",

On July 13, 2023, we updated our full-year 2023 targets for consolidated operating revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth to reflect TELUS International's updated annual outlook. On August 4, 2023, we updated our free cash flow target to reflect significantly higher restructuring and other costs related to accelerated\n\ncost efficiency programs. The following pertains to our performance against revised targets, as applicable.\n\nWe effectively hit the low end of our consolidated operating revenues target. Our low-margin equipment revenue expectations saw a reduction in contracted volumes attributed to increased promotional activity centred around rate plans and market aggression, in addition to more customers taking advantage of bring-your-own-device (BYOD) plan offerings. While we experienced stronger growth in our mobile phones and connected devices subscriber bases, domestic average revenue per subscriber per month (ARPU) softened slightly, reflecting heightened market aggression that first escalated in the second quarter of 2023 and continued throughout the remainder of the year. Our commitment to remaining disciplined in balancing optimal economic outcomes with volume helped to ameliorate the flow-through down to margins.\n\nWe achieved our Adjusted EBITDA target as a result of broad-based cost reduction efforts across both the TTech and DLCX segments, higher-value smartphones with continued discipline in balancing economic outcomes benefiting our equipment margins, in addition to higher mobile phones and connected devices subscriber bases growth. Our focused execution on these factors helped to offset the macroeconomic headwinds and escalating competitive pressures that persisted throughout the remainder of the year.\n\nOur free cash flow target was surpassed, attributable to the timing of restructuring and other disbursements that will partially flow into the following year, more customers adopting bring-yourown-device plan offerings with fewer contracted volumes and lower income taxes paid, as well as our disciplined focus on profitable loading in an environment with pervasive macroeconomic and competitive pressures. These factors, combined with previously mentioned broad-based cost reductions, contributed to free cash flow growth.\n\nOur capital expenditures in 2023 exceeded our consolidated target as a result of additional investments in the areas of digitization and platform development, particularly within key growth areas of our business, along with additional investments to expand the reach of our PureFibre network within targeted communities. These additional investments will further enhance our go-to-market opportunities as we begin the new year.\n\nOur capital structure financial policies and report on financing and capital structure management plans are included in Section 4.3 .",

Roaming revenues from business and consumer travel improved, primarily in the first quarter of 2023.\n- \u00b7 Continued pressure on mobile products and services acquisition and retention expenses, dependent on gross loading and customer renewal volumes, competitive intensity and changing customer preferences, as well as continued connected devices growth. The effect of contract asset, acquisition and fulfilment and TELUS Easy Payment device financing was a net cash outflow of $143 million.\n- \u00b7 Continued growth in fixed products and services data revenue, reflecting an increase in internet, TV and security subscribers, speed upgrades, rate plans with larger data buckets or unlimited data usage, and expansion of our broadband infrastructure, healthcare solutions, agriculture and consumer goods solutions, and home and business security offerings.\n- \u00b7 Continued erosion of residential voice revenues, resulting from technological substitution and greater use of inclusive long distance.\n- \u00b7 Continued optimization of our DLCX segment's cost structure enabled by automation and generative AI solutions to mitigate near-term challenges from persistent global macroeconomic pressures.\n- \u00b7 Continued focus on our customers first initiatives and maintaining our customers' likelihood-torecommend.\n- \u00b7 Our original assumptions for employee defined benefit pension plans for 2023: current service costs of approximately $62 million recorded in Employee benefits expense and interest expense of approximately $7 million recorded in Financing costs; a rate of 5.05% for discounting the obligation and a rate of 5.05% for current service costs for employee defined benefit pension plan accounting purposes; and defined benefit pension plan funding of approximately $35 million.\n\nIn our second quarter 2023 MD&A, we revised our assumptions for defined benefit pension plan funding to approximately $28 million.\n\nActual results were: $62 million recorded in Employee benefits expense for current service costs, $10 million recorded in Employee benefits expense for past service costs and interest expense of $7 million recorded in Financing costs; a rate of 4.65% for discounting the obligation and a rate of 5.05% for current service costs for employee defined benefit pension plan accounting purposes; and defined benefit pension plan funding of $28 million.\n\n- \u00b7 Our original assumption for 2023 restructuring and other costs was approximately $275 million. In our second quarter 2023 MD&A, we revised our assumption for restructuring and other costs to up to $750 million to reflect accelerated cost efficiency programs.\n- Actual restructuring and other costs were $717 million, as we incurred these costs to drive EBITDA expansion, margin accretion and accelerated cash flow growth.\n- \u00b7 Our assumption for 2023 net Cash interest paid was approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Actual net Cash interest paid was $1.2 billion.",

The following table provides a discussion of activities and initiatives that relate to our 2023 corporate priorities.\n\n## Elevating our customers, communities and social purpose by honouring our brand promise, Let's make the future friendly\u2122\n\n- \u00b7 Each year, we conduct a Pulsecheck engagement survey to gather confidential team member feedback about TELUS as a place to work in order to measure our progress in building and strengthening a high-performance culture. Following each survey, leaders share results with team members and use fair process to build and refine action plans focused on high-priority areas in need of improvement based on Pulsecheck results. In 2023, we achieved an engagement score of 82%, which is an encouraging accomplishment against the backdrop of the highly competitive and dynamic environment in which we operate, demonstrating the strength of the culture our team members have built together. TELUS is the most engaged organization globally compared to organizations of our size and composition according to our survey provider, Kincentric.\n- \u00b7 Throughout 2023, we continued to leverage our Connecting for Good programs to support marginalized individuals by enhancing their access to both technology and healthcare, as well as our TELUS Wise program to improve digital literacy and online safety knowledge. Since the launch of these programs, they have provided support for over 1.1 million individuals.\n- \u00b7 During the year, we welcomed 8,500 new households to our Internet for Good program. Since we launched the program in 2016, we have connected over 55,000 households and 175,000 low-income family members and seniors, persons in need who are living with disabilities, government-assisted refugees and youth leaving foster care with low-cost internet service.\n- \u00b7 Our Mobility for Good program offers free or low-cost smartphones and mobile phone rate plans to all youth aging out of foster care and to qualifying low-income seniors across Canada. During the year, we added 8,600 youth and seniors, as well as Indigenous women at risk of or surviving violence, government-assisted refugees and other marginalized individuals to the program. Since we launched Mobility for Good in 2017, the program has provided support for 52,300 people.\n- \u00b7 In June 2023, we expanded the reach of our Internet for Good and Mobility for Good programs to help government-assisted refugees arriving in Canada get connected. Partnering with 15 resettlement assistance program service provider organizations across the country and growing, Mobility for Good for government-assisted refugees offers a free smartphone and low-cost data plan while Internet for Good for government-assisted refugees offers low-cost high-speed internet service. To date, we have provided support to over 6,200 government-assisted refugees and their family members through these programs.\n- \u00b7 Since launching our Mobility for Good for Indigenous Women at Risk program in 2021, we have supported 2,700 women.\n- \u00b7 Our Health for Good mobile health clinics facilitated more than 56,000 patient visits during the year. Since the program's inception, we have accommodated 200,000 cumulative patient visits in 25 communities across Canada, bringing primary and mental healthcare to individuals experiencing homelessness.\n- \u00b7 In March 2023, we expanded our Health for Good program to support women and caregivers in need of mental health services by providing free access to TELUS Health MyCare counselling services. Partnering with three charitable organizations, we have provided\n\n900 free counselling sessions this year to women and caregivers in need in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario.\n\n- \u00b7 In April 2023, we partnered with Old Brewery Mission to launch a new mobile health clinic in Montreal. The Old Brewery Mission Mobile Health Clinic, powered by TELUS Health, is helping marginalized Montreal residents and communities with access to free healthcare services, as well as social and housing-related support.\n- \u00b7 In July 2023, we launched a second mobile health clinic in Victoria in partnership with Victoria Cool Aid Society to address the growing need for primary healthcare and provide support for people experiencing homelessness.\n- \u00b7 During the year, our Tech for Good\u00ae program provided access to personalized one-on-one training, support and customized recommendations on mobile devices and related assistive technology and/or access to discounted mobile plans for over 2,300 Canadians living with disabilities, helping them improve their independence and quality of life. Since the program's inception in 2017, we have supported 8,800 individuals in Canada who are living with disabilities through the program and/or the TELUS Wireless Accessibility Discount.\n- \u00b7 In 2023, 116,500 individuals in Canada and around the world participated in virtual TELUS Wise workshops and events to improve digital literacy and online safety, bringing total cumulative participation to 680,000 individuals since the program launched in 2013.\n- In October 2023, we celebrated 10 years of TELUS Wise with the launch of a new TELUS Wise responsible AI online workshop for youth. \u00b7\n- \u00b7 TELUS Friendly Future Foundation (the Foundation) and Canadian TELUS Community Boards continue to direct all of their funding to charitable initiatives that promote health and well-being for youth across Canada, including the TELUS Student Bursary for post-secondary students facing financial barriers. In 2023, the Foundation supported two million youth by granting $11 million, including $2 million in bursaries, to 550 charitable and community organizations. Since its inception in 2018, the Foundation has provided $47 million in cash donations to our communities, helping 15 million youth reach their full potential.\n- \u00b7 In February 2023, the Foundation launched its Livable Communities for our Youth Challenge , providing funding to improve the lives of youth by connecting innovative entrepreneurs to Canadian charities.\n- \u00b7 In October 2023, the Foundation launched the TELUS Student Bursary, Canada's largest bursary fund, supporting students facing financial barriers that impact their ability to enrol in or continue their education. With bursaries valued at up to $5,000, this new $50 million fund, established through an endowment gift of $25 million from TELUS and a commitment of $25 million in fundraising from the Foundation, will help hundreds of students each year access post-secondary education leading to a brighter future. Each bursary recipient will also have access to free mobility and low-cost internet service plans through our Mobility for Good and Internet for Good programs.\n\nAt the start of the 2023-2024 school year in September, the Foundation awarded its first round of bursaries to more than 400 students across the country.",

These grants support registered charities that offer health, education or technology programs to help youth thrive. Since 2005, our 19 TELUS Community Boards have directed $107 million in cash donations to more than 9,600 initiatives, providing resources and support for underserved citizens, especially young people, around the world.\n- During the third quarter of 2023, we announced the expansion of five TELUS Community Boards in Alberta and Ontario, which are now providing support for millions of citizens in Alberta and Ontario. \u00b7\n- \u00b7 In May 2023, our 18th annual TELUS Days of Giving inspired more than 80,000 TELUS team members, retirees, family and friends in 260 communities, across 32 countries to volunteer, contributing to 1.5 million hours of service globally in 2023. Thanks to the passion and generosity of our TELUS family, 2023 was our most giving year ever.\n- \u00b7 In November 2023, we added two new clubs in North Carolina to the TELUS Community Ambassadors program, bringing together over 5,000 current and retired team members across 25 clubs to volunteer in their local communities.\n- \u00b7 During 2023, TELUS, our team members, customers and the Foundation have provided $12.6 million, in cash donations and in-kind contributions to support 22 humanitarian and disaster relief efforts in Canada and around the world.

This network evolved in 2017 when we adopted LTE-A technology, which now covers more than 95% of Canada's population and offers peak theoretical speeds of up to 1.5 Gbps. Our LTE CAT-M1 IoT network covers 96% of Canada's population. See Leveraging TELUS' world-leading technology to drive superior growth across mobile, home and business services in Section 3 Corporate priorities for additional information.\n- \u00b7 We have made significant investments in heterogeneous network (HetNet) technology, one of the key building blocks for 5G. HetNet combines multiple types of cells, such as outdoor macrocells and microcells, as well as indoor pico cells, to enhance coverage and capacity in crowded urban areas and inside buildings. By taking continuous strides to evolve our small-cell technology, concurrent with the evolution of network technologies to LTE-A pro (i.e. 4.5G), in 2017, we became the first operator in Canada to introduce licensed assisted access (LAA) small cells for both outdoor and indoor environments, capable of speeds of up to 970 Mbps.

At the end of 2023, approximately 3.2 million homes and businesses in communities across B.C., Alberta and Quebec had access to ultra-fast symmetrical internet speeds ranging from 150 Mbps to 1 Gbps, including approximately 2.0 million premises in B.C. and Alberta that had access to symmetrical internet speeds of up to 2.5 Gbps with TELUS PureFibre. Recognizing the need for highly reliable connectivity with low latency throughput to support emerging services such as virtualized networks and IoT applications, we have also begun rolling out new equipment for enhanced speeds and services.\n- \u00b7 We continue to deploy the next evolution of our fixed IP and optical core/edge technology, smart edge architecture. This architecture enables significant automation and per-port cost improvement to support network growth and evolution.\n- \u00b7 We continue to roll out our third-generation national dense wavelength division multiplexing transport backbone (packet transport 3.0) colourless, directionless and contentionless (CDC) network overlay, which is connected from B.C. to Quebec and into the United States. This architecture allows network growth without the need for costly re-generation, enables optimal optical rerouting during a fibre cut and improves network growth costs.\n- \u00b7 In 2023, we continued evolving our PureFibre and HSIA technologies to deliver a superior customer experience, advancing our market leadership in home and business services by launching 3.0 Gbps symmetrical service in major markets in B.C. and Alberta, while continuing to bring broadband network speeds to thousands of homes in rural and Indigenous communities in B.C., Alberta and Quebec.\n- \u00b7 In 2023, we continued to bring broadband network speeds to homes in rural and Indigenous communities in B.C., Alberta and Quebec, enabling connectivity for approximately 24,000 premises across 112 communities, including 120 Indigenous lands. To date, we have enabled 715,000 rural premises with access to PureFibre across 406 communities, and by December 31, 2023, 86% of homes, communities, small businesses and government buildings on Indigenous lands had access to our advanced broadband networks.\n- \u00b7 In 2023, we were awarded $36 million in government subsidies that will help bring TELUS PureFibre to over 5,000 premises spread across more than 17 rural communities, including expanding our broadband networks to more than 20 Indigenous lands between now and 2026.",

Notwithstanding this target, dividend decisions will continue to be subject to our Board's assessment and the determination of our financial position and outlook on a quarterly basis. Our long-term Common Share dividend payout ratio guideline is 60 to 75% of free cash flow on a prospective basis. (See Section 7.5 Liquidity and capital resource measures .) There can be no assurance that we will maintain a dividend growth program or that it will be unchanged through 2025. (See Caution regarding forward-looking statements - Lower than planned free cash flow could constrain our ability to invest in operations, reduce leverage or return capital to shareholders and Section 10.15 Financing, debt and dividends .)\n- \u00b7 Dividends declared in 2023 totalled $1.4544 per share, an increase of $.0987 per share or 7.3% compared to the dividends declared in 2022. On February 8, 2024, the Board elected to declare a first quarter dividend of $0.3761 per share, payable on April 1, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close\n\n## Purchase Common Shares\n\n- We did not purchase any shares pursuant to the 2022 NCIB which concluded on June 5, 2023. \u00b7\n\n## Use proceeds from securitized receivables (Short-term borrowings), bank facilities and commercial paper as needed, to supplement free cash flow and meet other cash requirements\n\n- \u00b7 Our issued and outstanding commercial paper was $1.0 billion at December 31, 2023, all of which was denominated in U.S. dollars (US$0.8 billion), compared to $1.5 billion (US$1.1 billion) at December 31, 2022. During the third quarter of 2023, our unsecured revolving credit facility, with uses that include the backstop of commercial paper, was renewed and expiry was extended approximately two years to July 14, 2028. See Section 7.6 for additional details.\n\n## Maintain compliance with financial objectives\n\n- \u00b7 Maintain investment-grade credit ratings On February 9, 2024, investment-grade credit ratings from all rating agencies that cover TELUS were in the desired range. (See Section 7.8 Credit ratings .)\n- \u00b7 Net debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs ratio of 2.20 to 2.70 times As measured at December 31, 2023, this ratio was 3.71 times, outside of the objective range, primarily due to the acquisition of spectrum licences (as spectrum is our largest indefinite life asset) and business acquisitions. Given the cash demands of the 600 MHz auction in 2019, the 3500 MHz auction in 2021, the 3800 MHz auction in 2023 and the expected upcoming spectrum auction in 2024 for millimetre wave, the assessment of the guideline and timing of return to the objective range remains to be determined; however, it is our intent to return to a ratio below 2.70 times in the medium term (following the spectrum auctions in 2021 and 2023, and the spectrum auction upcoming in 2024), consistent with our long-term strategy. (See Section 7.5 Liquidity and capital resource measures .)\n- \u00b7 Net draws due to a syndicate of financial institutions (excluding TELUS Corporation) on the TI credit facility were US$1.4 billion at December 31, 2023, compared to US$689 million at December 31, 2022. The TI credit facility is non-recourse to TELUS Corporation.\n- \u00b7 Proceeds from securitized trade receivables were $100 million at December 31, 2023, unchanged from December 31, 2022.\n- \u00b7 Common Share dividend payout ratio of 60 to 75% of free cash flow on a prospective basis Our objective range is on a prospective basis. The Common Share dividend payout ratio1 we present in this MD&A is a historical measure utilizing the dividends declared in the most recent four quarters, net of dividend reinvestment plan effects, and free cash flow, and is disclosed on a retrospective basis for illustrative purposes in evaluating our target guideline. As at December 31, 2023, the ratio was 77%, outside of the objective range. We estimate the ratio will be within the objective range on a prospective basis. (See Section 7.5 Liquidity and capital resource measures .)\n- \u00b7 Generally maintain a minimum of $1 billion in available liquidity As at December 31, 2023, our available liquidity1 was approximately $3.1 billion.

We may, at our discretion, offer Common Shares at a discount of up to 5% from the market price under the DRISP. Effective with the dividends paid beginning on October 1, 2019, we offered Common Shares from Treasury at a discount of 2%. During 2023, our DRISP plan trustee acquired from Treasury approximately 30 million dividend reinvestment Common Shares for $748 million. For the dividends paid on January 2, 2024, the DRISP participation rate, calculated as the DRISP investment of $191 million (including the employee share purchase plan) as a percentage of gross dividends, was approximately 35%.\n- \u00b7 TELUS International currently intends to retain all available funds and any future earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of its business.",

Segmented information in Note 5 of the Consolidated financial statements is regularly reported to our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (our chief operating decision-maker).\n\nThe TELUS technology solutions (TTech) segment includes: network revenues and equipment sales arising from mobile technologies; data revenues (which include internet protocol; television; hosting, managed information technology and cloud-based services; and home and business security); healthcare services, software and technology solutions (including employee and family assistance programs and benefits administration); agriculture and consumer goods services (software, data management and data analytics-driven smart-food chain and consumer goods technologies); voice and other telecommunications services revenues; and equipment sales.\n\nThe digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International (DLCX) segment, which has the U.S. dollar as its primary functional currency, is comprised of digital customer experience and digital-enablement transformation solutions, including artificial intelligence (AI) and content management, provided by TELUS International.\n\n## Selected annual information\n\n| Years ended December 31 ($ in millions, except per share amounts)            | 2023     | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|\n| Operating revenues and other income                                          | 20,1 1 6 | 18,412 | 17,258 |\n| Net income                                                                   | 867      | 1,718  | 1,698  |\n| Net income attributable to TELUS Corporation   Common Shares (Common Shares) | 841      | 1,615  | 1,655  |\n| Net income per Common Share                                                  |          |        |        |\n| Basic earnings per share (EPS)                                               | 0.58     | 1.16   | 1.23   |\n| Diluted EPS                                                                  | 0.58     | 1.15   | 1.22   |\n| Dividends declared per Common Share                                          | 1.4544   | 1.3557 | 1.2710 |\n\n| At December 31 ($ millions)             | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total assets                            | 56,136 | 54,069 | 47,983 |\n| Current maturities of long-term debt    | 3,994  | 2,541  | 2,927  |\n| Non-current financial liabilities1      |        |        |        |\n| Provisions                              | 345    | 201    | 51     |\n| Long-term debt                          | 23,355 | 22,496 | 17,925 |\n| Other long-term financial liabilities   | 334    | 161    | 181    |\n| Total non-current financial liabilities | 24,034 | 22,858 | 18,157 |\n| Deferred income taxes                   | 4,390  | 4,455  | 4,045  |\n| Common equity                           | 16,112 | 16,569 | 15,116 |",

        "page_content": "Operating revenues and other income: Consolidated Operating revenues and other income increased by $1,704 million in 2023 and $1,154 million in 2022. These increases were largely attributable to increased health services revenues, higher mobile and fixed data service revenues, and growth in DLCX operating revenues.\n\nTotal assets: Growth in Total assets includes increases in Property, plant and equipment and Intangible assets, which increased by a combined $646 million in 2023 and $2,912 million in 2022. These increases resulted primarily from business acquisitions, our ongoing investments in broadband infrastructure, connecting additional homes and businesses directly to our fibre-optic technology and accelerating our 5G network roll-out.

The investments in our fibre-optic technology also support our technology strategy to improve network coverage and capacity, including the ongoing build-out of our 5G network.\n\nThe trend of general year-over-year increases in Financing costs reflects greater long-term debt outstanding and increases in effective interest rates attributed to floating-rate debt and for recent fixed-rate issuances, mainly associated with our investments in spectrum and fibre technology, as well as business acquisitions. Financing costs are net of capitalized interest related to spectrum licences acquired during the 600 MHz spectrum auction, which we commenced deploying into our existing network in 2021, and during the 3500 MHz spectrum auction. Financing costs also include Interest accretion on provisions (asset retirement obligations and written put options) and Employee defined benefit plans net interest. Additionally, for the eight periods shown, Financing costs include varying amounts of foreign exchange gains or losses, varying amounts of interest income and, effective for the second quarter of 2022, unrealized changes in virtual power purchase agreements forward element, which contributed to income up to the third quarter of 2022 and to losses thereafter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fourth quarter recap\n\nResults for the fourth quarter of 2023 (three-month period ended December 31, 2023) are discussed in our February 9, 2024 news release and are compared with results from the fourth quarter of 2022 (three-month period ended December 31, 2022).\n\n- \u00b7 Consolidated Operating revenues and other income were $5,198 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $140 million.\n- \u00b7 Service revenues were $4,417 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $131 million. TTech service revenue increased due to: (i) higher mobile network revenues attributable to subscriber and moderating roaming revenue growth; (ii) an increase in fixed data service revenues, resulting from subscriber growth and higher, albeit moderating, revenue per internet customer; and (iii) growth in health services revenues. These factors were partly offset by lower TV and fixed legacy voice services revenues, primarily due to technological substitution, as well as macroeconomic and competitive pressures impacting consumer purchasing decisions across various products. Higher DLCX operating revenues resulted from expanded services for certain existing clients and growth from new clients, including new clients from our acquisition of WillowTree on January 3, 2023, and favourable foreign exchange impacts, which collectively more than offset the impact of some DLCX clients managing their own costs thus reducing our revenue.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Equipment revenues increased by $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by higher mobile equipment revenues attributable to higher-value smartphones in the sales mix, partly offset by a reduction in contracted volumes.\n- \u00b7 Other income was $42 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $7 million, largely due to gains on residential real estate projects with an arm's-length party, as well as a decrease in provisions arising from business acquisition-related written put options when compared to the prior year. These effects were partly offset by lower equity income.\n- \u00b7 Consolidated operating expenses were $4,534 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $145 million.\n- \u00b7 Depreciation was $665 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $76 million, primarily due to growth in capital assets over the past 12 months, including business acquisitions and our expanded broadband footprint, increased depreciation on network leases, and the impact of our continuing program of asset life studies.\n- \u00b7 Amortization of intangible assets was $376 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $36 million, arising from business acquisitions and higher expenditures associated with the intangible asset base over the past 12 months.\n- \u00b7 Financing costs were $278 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of $44 million, mainly due to the following factors:\n- \u00b7 Interest expense was $336 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $71 million.\n- \u00b7 Gross interest expense on long-term debt, excluding lease liabilities, was $272 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $38 million, primarily driven by an increase in average long-term debt balances outstanding, attributable in part to business acquisitions, in addition to an increase in the effective interest rate.\n- \u00b7 Interest on lease liabilities was $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $16 million, resulting from increases in both lease principal and the effective interest rate.\n- \u00b7 Unrealized changes in virtual power purchase agreements forward element was a recovery of $59 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, and represents the estimated unrealized appreciation recorded from our virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) with renewable energy projects as of December 31, 2023.\n- \u00b7 Total income tax expense was $76 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of $6 million. The effective tax rate decreased from 23.6% to 19.4%, primarily driven by non-taxable amounts and adjustments recognized in the current period for income taxes of prior periods.\n- \u00b7 EBITDA, which includes restructuring and other costs and other equity losses (income) related to real estate joint ventures, was $1,705 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $107 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n66 \u00b7\n\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes restructuring and other costs, and other equity losses (income) related to real estate joint ventures, was $1,847 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $158 million. This reflected: (i) broad-based cost reduction efforts across both the TTech and DLCX segments, including workforce reductions, synergies achieved between LifeWorks and our legacy Health business, and increased TTech outsourcing to DLCX, as well as savings in marketing, discretionary and administrative costs; (ii) higher mobile network, residential internet and security revenues largely driven by subscriber growth; (iii) higher mobile equipment margins; and (iv) organic health services growth. These factors were partly offset by: (i) merit-based compensation increases; (ii) higher bad debt expense; (iii) declining TV and fixed legacy voice margins; (iv) higher costs related to the scaling of our digital capabilities, inclusive of increased subscription-based software licences, contractor and cloud usage costs; and (v) lower agriculture and consumer goods margins.\n- \u00b7 Net income attributable to Common Shares was $288 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $40 million, primarily reflecting the after-tax impacts of lower Financing costs. Adjusted Net income excludes the effects of restructuring and other costs, income taxrelated adjustments, other equity losses related to real estate joint ventures and unrealized changes in virtual power purchase agreements forward element. Adjusted Net income in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $341 million, an increase of $2 million or 0.6%.\n- \u00b7 Basic EPS was $0.20 in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $0.03, primarily reflecting the after-tax impacts of lower Financing costs, as well as the effect of a higher number of Common Shares outstanding. Adjusted basic EPS excludes the effects of restructuring and other costs, income tax-related adjustments, other equity losses related to real estate joint ventures and unrealized changes in virtual power purchase agreements forward element. Adjusted basic EPS was $0.24 in the fourth quarter of 2023, unchanged compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.\n- \u00b7 Cash provided by operating activities was $1,314 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $188 million, primarily driven by other working capital changes and a decrease in income taxes paid, net.\n- \u00b7 Cash used by investing activities was $716 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of $138 million, largely attributable to lower cash payments for capital assets. Capital expenditures were $533 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of $127 million, primarily due to the planned slowdown of our fibre and wireless network build and systems development, consistent with 2023 build targets, when compared to accelerated investments in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n- \u00b7 Cash used by financing activities was $938 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $200 million, primarily reflecting lower issuances of long-term debt, net of redemptions and repayment.\n- \u00b7 Free cash flow was $590 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $267 million, reflecting lower capital expenditures and lower income taxes paid, partly offset by an increase in cash interest paid.",

We discuss the performance of our segments in Section 5.4 TELUS technology solutions segment and Section 5.5 Digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International segment .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operating revenues\n\n| Years ended December 31 ($ in millions)                    | 2023     | 2022   | Change   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|----------|\n| Operating revenues                                         |          |        |          |\n| Service                                                    | 17,508   | 15,956 | 9.7 %    |\n| Equipment                                                  | 2,497    | 2,336  | 6.9 %    |\n| Operating revenues (arising from contracts with customers) | 20,005   | 18,292 | 9.4 %    |\n| Other income                                               | 111      | 120    | (7.5) %  |\n| Operating revenues and other income                        | 20,1 1 6 | 18,412 | 9.3 %    |\n\nConsolidated Operating revenues and other income increased by $1,704 million in 2023.\n\n- \u00b7 Service revenues increased by $1,552 million in 2023. TTech service revenue increased due to: (i) growth in health services revenues, mainly driven by our acquisition of LifeWorks on September 1, 2022 and organic growth; (ii) higher mobile network revenues attributable to subscriber and roaming revenue growth, partly offset by the impact of lower base rate plan prices; and (iii) an increase in fixed data service revenues, resulting from subscriber growth and higher, albeit moderating, revenue per internet customer. These factors were partly offset by lower TV and fixed legacy voice services revenues, primarily due to technological substitution, as well as macroeconomic and competitive pressures impacting consumer purchasing decisions across various products. Higher DLCX operating revenues resulted from expanded services for certain existing clients and growth from new clients, including new clients from our acquisition of WillowTree on January 3, 2023, and favourable foreign exchange impacts, which collectively more than offset the impact of some DLCX clients managing their own costs thus reducing our revenue.\n- \u00b7 Equipment revenues increased by $161 million in 2023, largely driven by higher mobile equipment revenues due to higher-value smartphones in the sales mix, partly offset by a reduction in contracted volumes.\n\n- \u00b7 Other income decreased by $9 million in 2023, largely due to lower net reversals of business combination-related provisions, the non-recurrence of a gain on acquisition of control of LifeWorks in the prior year, and lower equity income. These effects were partly offset by gains on residential real estate projects with an arm's-length party.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n| Years ended December 31 ($ in millions)   | 2023   | 2022   | Change   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Goods and services purchased              | 7,537  | 7,107  | 6.1 %    |\n| Employee benefits expense                 | 6,148  | 4,899  | 25.5 %   |\n| Depreciation                              | 2,514  | 2,226  | 12.9 %   |\n| Amortization of intangible assets         | 1,555  | 1,226  | 26.8 %   |\n| Operating expenses                        | 17,754 | 15,458 | 14.9 %   |\n\nConsolidated operating expenses increased by $2,296 million in 2023.\n\n- \u00b7 Depreciation increased by $288 million in 2023, primarily due to growth in capital assets over the past 12 months, including business acquisitions and our expanded broadband footprint, increased depreciation on network leases, and increased depreciation from impairments arising from real estate rationalization.\n- \u00b7 Amortization of intangible assets increased by $329 million in 2023, arising from business acquisitions and higher expenditures associated with the intangible asset base over the past 12 months.\n\n## Operating income\n\n| Years ended December 31 ($ in millions)                                            | 2023   | 2022   | Change   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| TTech EBITDA1 (see  Section 5.4 )                                                  | 5,722  | 5,697  | 0.4 %    |\n| DLCX EBITDA1 (see  Section 5.5 )                                                   | 709    | 709    | -        |\n| EBITDA                                                                             | 6,431  | 6,406  | 0.4 %    |\n| Depreciation and amortization (discussed above)                                    | 4,069  | 3,452  | 17.9 %   |\n| Operating income (consolidated earnings   before interest and income taxes (EBIT)) | 2,362  | 2,954  | (20.0) % |\n\n- 1 See Section 11.1 Non-GAAP and other specified financial measures .\n\nOperating income decreased by $592 million in 2023, while EBITDA increased by $25 million. As a partial offset to the growth drivers discussed within Adjusted EBITDA below, EBITDA also reflects higher restructuring and other costs of $477 million in 2023, primarily related to efficiency and effectiveness programs, including workforce reduction, real estate rationalization, and one-time amounts recorded of $68 million for the ratification of the new collective agreement between the Telecommunications Workers Union, United Steelworkers Local 1944 (TWU) and ourselves.",

Supplementing this, the trend of mobile phone ARPU has been supported by the recovery of international roaming revenues from increasing travel volumes. Domestic ARPU declines were largely attributable to customers having greater access to higher network speeds and larger allotments of data for a given price point, as well as heightened market aggression that first escalated in the second quarter of 2023 and continued throughout the remainder of the year.\n\nMobile equipment revenues have been increasing largely as a result of higher-value smartphones in the sales mix. As a partial offset, mobile devices sales volumes have been slowly decreasing, reflecting improvements in durability but also increases in cost, resulting in customers deferring upgrades and increasing adoption of bring-your-own-device (BYOD) plans. We continue to offer certified pre-owned devices and our Bring-It-Back\u00ae program to provide customers with alternative options for handset upgrades, thereby contributing to a circular economy.\n\nOur spectrum investments and capital expenditures in network improvements increase capacity, reliability and coverage, allowing us to grow revenue through net additions of new mobile phone and connected device subscribers. The growth in our mobile phone subscriber base is attributable to: (i) industry-leading product offerings with continuous improvements in the speed, performance and reliability of our network, as well as enhanced digital capabilities; (ii) the success of our promotions, including our bundling of mobility and home services; (iii) our ability to capture a proportion of the growing population, changing population demographics and an increasing number of customers with multiple devices; and (iv) our relatively low churn rate, which reflects our customers first efforts and upgrade volume programs.\n\nOur connected device subscriber base has been growing, primarily in response to our expanded IoT offerings. Growth within our IoT subscriber base is attributable to increased demand for IoT solutions across various industries, including healthcare, agriculture, transportation,\n\nsmart buildings and smart cities, energy and retail. Our investments in network infrastructure and expanding our IoT product portfolio have also allowed us to provide reliable and scalable IoT solutions to our customer base.\n\nGrowth in our internet subscriber base has been supported by our continued investments in building out our fibre-optic infrastructure, supplemented by our relatively low customer churn rate. The total number of TV subscribers has increased (in contrast to market-reported declines in conventional television viewing habits), reflecting net subscriber additions in response to our diverse and flexible product offerings, combined with our relatively low customer churn rate. Our security subscriber base growth is increasing as a result of organic growth, acquisitions and bundling of home services, including our bundling of mobility and home services. Adoption increases our services per home and positively impacts churn for most services, in addition to the effectiveness of our self-install and virtual-install models. Residential voice subscriber losses have remained low as a result of the success of our bundled services and lower-priced offerings, as well as strong retention efforts to mitigate the ongoing substitution to mobile and internet-based services.\n\nThe trend of growing fixed data services revenues is attributable to the sustained demand for faster internet speeds and larger bandwidth, home and business security offerings and other advanced applications, which are enabled by investments in our fibre-optic footprint. The trend of declining TV revenues and legacy fixed voice revenues is due to technological substitution and intensification of competition in the small and medium-sized business market. However, we are mitigating this trend with our bundled product and lower-priced offerings, product diversification and successful retention efforts. The migration of business product and service offerings to IP services and the entry of new competitors have yielded inherently lower margins compared to some legacy business product and service offerings; however, we are continually refining and diversifying our portfolio of innovative business offerings.\n\nThe trend of growth in health services revenues has been propelled by the acquisition of LifeWorks in the third quarter of 2022, as well as organic growth in our existing health offerings, which include virtual care, virtual and traditional pharmacy solutions, collaborative health records, health benefits management, personal health monitoring solutions, and employee and family assistance programs and benefits administration. The LifeWorks acquisition immediately enabled the opportunity for health services to operate and grow internationally through long-standing corporate relationships globally, with notable areas of focus in employee health and wellness programs, mental and physical health solutions, pensions and benefits management, and retirement solutions. We are well-positioned to continue improving health and wellness outcomes for people around the world. Our competencies and assets in health, combined with the trend in digitization and automation, position us well to bolster the global healthcare system in a complementary fashion. With our technology heritage, we see the trend moving the healthcare system to improved efficiency and outcomes through better insights. We also believe Canadians and others will have greater control of their healthcare outcomes through the integration of disparate data (better flow of information across the system) and consent-based data management. Our diversified virtual care offerings continue to grow to meet the healthcare needs of Canadians and drive better health outcomes, including the accelerated adoption of virtual consultations, as reflected in the growing number of virtual care members.",

Through our global team and cloud-based solutions, we are able to service our diverse client base, including growers, producers, agronomists, advisors, processors and retailers, by helping to drive more effective and agile decision-making that will address changing consumer demands, improve profitability and generate a better flow of information across the value chain. This improves the safety and sustainability of our outputs and drives efficiencies in the way we produce, distribute and consume food and consumer goods.\n\n## TTech operating indicators\n\n| At December 31                                             | 2023   | 2022   | Change    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Subscriber connections  (thousands)                        |        |        |           |\n| Mobile phone1                                              | 10,084 | 9,691  | 4.1 %     |\n| Connected device1                                          | 3,114  | 2,468  | 26.2 %    |\n| Internet2                                                  | 2,626  | 2,413  | 8.8 %     |\n| TV                                                         | 1,394  | 1,325  | 5.2 %     |\n| Residential voice                                          | 1,065  | 1,096  | (2.8) %   |\n| Security                                                   | 1,056  | 978    | 8.0 %     |\n| Total telecom subscriber connections                       | 19,339 | 17,971 | 7.6 %     |\n| LTE population coverage3 (millions)                        | 36.7   | 36.7   | -         |\n| 5G population coverage3 (millions)                         | 31.6   | 30.2   | 4.6 %     |\n| Years ended December 31                                    | 2023   | 2022   | Change    |\n| Mobile phone gross additions (thousands)                   | 1,676  | 1,475  | 13.6 %    |\n| Subscriber connection net additions (losses)  (thousands): |        |        |           |\n| Mobile phone                                               | 443    | 401    | 10.5 %    |\n| Connected device                                           | 564    | 368    | 53.3 %    |\n| Internet                                                   | 143    | 142    | 0.7 %     |\n| TV                                                         | 69     | 60     | 15.0 %    |\n| Residential voice                                          | (31 )  | (27)   | (14.8) %  |\n| Security                                                   | 78     | 99     | (21.2) %  |\n| Total telecom subscriber connection net additions          | 1,266  | 1,043  | 21.4 %    |\n| Mobile phone ARPU, per month4 ($)                          | 58.78  | 58.10  | 1.2 %     |\n| Mobile phone churn, per month5 (%)                         | 1.05   | 0.95   | 0.10 pts. |\n\n| At December 31              | 2023   | 2022   | Change   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Health services  (millions) |        |        |          |\n| Healthcare lives covered    | 69.5   | 67.7   | 2.7 %    |\n| Virtual care members        | 5.6    | 4.5    | 24.4 %   |\n| Years ended December 31     | 2023   | 2022   | Change   |\n| Digital health transactions | 610.3  | 580.5  | 5.1 %    |\n\n- \u00b7 Mobile phone gross additions were 1,676,000 in 2023, an increase of 201,000, driven by growth in postpaid gross additions due to continued market-driven promotional activity, which first escalated in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through the remainder of the year, particularly during the heightened seasonal promotional periods, in addition to increased retail and digital traffic, and growth in the Canadian population.\n- \u00b7 Our mobile phone churn rate was 1.05% in 2023, compared to 0.95% in 2022, largely due to higher customer switching activity corresponding with increased market-driven promotions, as discussed above.

These impacts were partly offset by the impact of lower base rate plan prices and lower overage revenues, as previously discussed in mobile phone ARPU.\n\nMobile equipment and other service revenues increased by $158 million in 2023, due to highervalue smartphones in the sales mix. This was partly offset by a reduction in contracted volumes attributed to increased promotional activity centred around rate plans and market aggression, in addition to more customers taking advantage of BYOD plan offerings.\n\nFixed data services revenues increased by $232 million in 2023, driven by an increase in our internet, security and TV subscribers and higher, albeit moderating, revenue per customer as a result of internet speed upgrades and rate changes. This growth was partially offset by lower TV revenue per customer, reflecting an increased mix of customers selecting smaller TV combination packages and technological substitution.\n\nFixed voice services revenues decreased by $32 million in 2023, reflecting the ongoing decline in legacy voice revenues as a result of technological substitution and price plan changes. Declines were partly mitigated by the success of our bundled product offerings, our retention efforts and the migration from legacy to IP services offerings.\n\nFixed equipment and other service revenues increased by $12 million in 2023, reflecting higher business and consumer sales volumes and lower discounts on consumer premises equipment, partly offset by a reduction in residential and business development project work resulting from the non-recurrence of large projects in 2022 and rising interest rates that softened the property development market in 2023.\n\nHealth services revenues increased by $792 million in 2023, driven by: (i) our acquisition of LifeWorks on September 1, 2022, inclusive of organic growth in demand for our integrated health, productivity, retirement and benefit solutions; (ii) the continued adoption of our virtual care solutions; and (iii) increased pharmacy management software revenue.\n\nAgriculture and consumer goods services revenues decreased by $7 million in 2023, reflecting transient headwinds and macroeconomic challenges, including subscription demand softness and customer churn for our software-as-a-service (SaaS)-based revenue management software for consumer goods manufacturers. These effects were partly offset by increased animal agriculture pharmacy and research revenues. Our agriculture and consumer goods revenues are largely earned in U.S. dollars, and in 2023 compared to 2022, the Canadian dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in favourable impacts to revenues in the year.\n\nOther income decreased by $36 million in 2023, largely due to lower net reversals of business combination-related provisions in the current period, the non-recurrence of a gain on acquisition of control of LifeWorks in the prior year, and lower equity income. These effects were partly offset by gains on residential real estate projects with an arm's-length party.\n\nIntersegment revenues represent services provided to the DLCX segment that are eliminated upon consolidation, together with the associated DLCX expenses.",

These factors were partially offset by: (i) merit-based compensation increases; (ii) higher costs related to the scaling of our digital capabilities, inclusive of increased subscription-based licences, contractor and cloud usage costs; (iii) lower TV and legacy voice margins driven by technological substitution; (iv) higher bad debt expense; and (v) lower agriculture and consumer goods margins.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA margin decreased by 0.2 percentage points in 2023. This decline was largely due to our continued diversification into emerging sectors that are generally lower margin - and less capital intensive - than traditional telecommunications, inclusive of our LifeWorks acquisition, in addition to rising subscription-based software licence and cloud infrastructure costs as we scale our digital capabilities while working in the early stages of decommissioning certain on-premises servers and other organizational processes.

The higher revenue also includes revenue from internal services provided to the TTech segment. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we experienced a greater-than-expected reduction in service volume demand from some of our larger technology clients, particularly in Europe, which became more significant beginning in the second quarter of 2023. At the same time, several of our key clients also began to aggressively reduce their costs, which has created delays and near-term reductions in spend commitments.",

We had a greater number of real estate rationalization initiatives where payments of executory costs will be disbursed over multiple years, in addition to the timing of disbursements for personnelrelated costs expected to partially flow into the following year. Restructuring and other costs, net of disbursements also included $68 million in one-time amounts for the ratification of the new collective agreement between the Telecommunications Workers Union, United Steelworkers Local 1944 (TWU) and ourselves that was paid in the second quarter of 2023.\n- \u00b7 Interest paid increased by $380 million in 2023, largely due to: (i) the issuances of the first quarter 2023 Series CAJ notes and the third quarter 2023 three-tranche notes described in Section 7.4 ; (ii) increased draws on the TELUS International (TI) credit facility used to fund the acquisition of WillowTree; (iii) the unsecured non-revolving $1.1 billion bank credit facility maturing July 9, 2024, which was first drawn during the third quarter of 2022; and (iv) increased interest paid on commercial paper driven by higher interest rates.\n- \u00b7 Income taxes paid, net of recoveries received, decreased by $130 million in 2023, primarily related to lower required income tax instalments attributable to lower income before income taxes.\n- \u00b7 For a discussion of Other operating working capital changes, see Section 6 Changes in financial position and Note 31(a) of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consequently, capital expenditures differ from Cash payments for capital assets, excluding spectrum licences, as reported in the Consolidated statements of cash flows. Refer to Note 31 of the Consolidated financial statements for further information.\n- 2 See Section 11.1 Non-GAAP and other specified financial measures .\n\nConsolidated capital expenditures decreased by $650 million in 2023. TTech operations drove $658 million of the decrease, primarily due to the planned slowdown of our fibre and wireless network build and systems development, which is consistent with 2023 build targets when compared to our accelerated investments in 2022. Our capital investments have enabled: (i) our internet, TV and security subscriber growth, as well as more premises connected to our fibre network; (ii) increased coverage of our 5G network; (iii) the expansion of our health product offerings and capabilities, as well as to support business integration; and (iv) enhancement of our product and digital development to increase our system capacity and reliability. TTech real estate development capital expenditures increased by $18 million in 2023, due to increased capital investment to support construction of multi-year development projects, including TELUS Ocean and other commercial buildings in B.C. By December 31, 2023, our 5G network covered more than 31.6 million Canadians, representing approximately 86% of the population.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Effective with the dividends paid on October 1, 2019, we offered Common Shares from Treasury at a discount of 2%. Cash payments for dividends increased by $127 million in 2023, which reflected higher dividend rates under our dividend growth program (see Section 4.3 ) and an increase in the number of shares outstanding. This was partly offset by a higher discounted DRISP issuance. During 2023, our DRISP plan trustee acquired Common Shares for $748 million.\n\nIn January 2024, we paid dividends of $359 million to the holders of Common Shares and the trustee acquired dividend reinvestment Common Shares from Treasury for $191 million, totalling $550 million.\n\n## Issue (repayment) of short-term borrowings, net\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, we drew down amounts advanced to us from an arm's-length securitization trust to finance working capital. These amounts were repaid in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nBy comparison, we drew down amounts in the second quarter of 2022 and early in the third quarter of 2022, before repaying those amounts later in the third quarter of 2022.\n\n## Long-term debt issued and Redemptions and repayment of long-term debt\n\nIn 2023, long-term debt issued decreased by $1,048 million, while redemptions and repayment of long-term debt decreased by $359 million. These changes were primarily composed of:\n\n- \u00b7 A net decrease in commercial paper outstanding, including foreign exchange effects, of $437 million to a balance of $1.0 billion (US$0.8 billion) at December 31, 2023, from a balance of $1.5 billion (US$1.1 billion) at December 31, 2022. Our commercial paper program, when utilized, provides lower-cost funds than our revolving credit facility and is fully backstopped by the revolving credit facility (see Section 7.6 Credit facilities ).\n- \u00b7 An increase in net draws on the TI credit facility, including foreign exchange effects, of $867 million. As at December 31, 2023, net draws due to a syndicate of financial institutions (excluding TELUS Corporation) were US$1.4 billion, whereas as at December 31, 2022, net draws were US$689 million. The increase in net draws on the TI credit facility was used to fund the acquisition of WillowTree. The TI credit facility is non-recourse to TELUS Corporation.\n- \u00b7 The March 28, 2023 issue of $500 million of senior unsecured 4.95% Sustainability-Linked Notes, Series CAJ, maturing on March 28, 2033. The net proceeds were used for the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, including the repayment of commercial paper and the reduction of cash amounts under an arm's-length securitization trust, and for other general corporate purposes.\n- \u00b7 The September 8, 2023 three-tranche note issuance of $850 million of senior unsecured 5.75% Sustainability-Linked Notes, Series CAK, maturing on September 8, 2033; $400 million of senior unsecured 5.95% Notes, Series CAL, maturing on September 8, 2053; and $500 million of senior unsecured 5.60% Notes, Series CAM, maturing on September 9, 2030. The net proceeds from the three-tranche offering will be used for the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, including the repayment of commercial paper and the reduction of cash amounts under an arm's-length securitization trust, and for other general corporate purposes.\n- \u00b7 The repayment upon maturity of $500 million of 3.35% Notes, Series CJ due March 2023.\n\nBy comparison, in 2022, long-term debt issued increased by $5,380 million, while redemptions and repayment of long-term debt increased by $3,077 million. These changes were primarily composed of:\n\n- \u00b7 A net decrease in commercial paper outstanding, including foreign exchange effects, of $442 million from a balance of $1.9 billion (US$1.5 billion) at December 31, 2021.\n- \u00b7 A decrease in net draws on the TI credit facility, including foreign exchange effects, of $148 million. As at December 31, 2021, net draws were US$854 million.\n- \u00b7 The February 28, 2022 issue of US$900 million of our senior unsecured 3.40% U.S. Dollar Sustainability-Linked Notes, due May 13, 2032.\n- \u00b7 The September 13, 2022 three-tranche note issuance of: $1.1 billion of senior unsecured 5.25% Sustainability-Linked Notes, Series CAG, maturing on November 15, 2032; $550 million of senior unsecured 5.65% Notes, Series CAH, maturing on September 13, 2052; and $350 million of senior unsecured 5.00% Notes, Series CAI, maturing on September 13, 2029.",

(TCI) due April 2022.\n\nThe average term to maturity of our long-term debt (excluding commercial paper, TELUS bank credit facilities, the revolving components of the TI credit facility, lease liabilities and other longterm debt) was 11.3 years at December 31, 2023, a decrease from 12.1 years at December 31, 2022. Additionally, the weighted average cost of our long-term debt (excluding commercial paper, TELUS bank credit facilities, the revolving components of the TI credit facility, lease liabilities and other long-term debt) was 4.33% at December 31, 2023, an increase from 4.03% at December 31, 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shares of subsidiary issued and sold to (purchased from) non-controlling interests, net\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, we acquired 2.5 million multiple voting shares of TELUS International from a non-controlling interest.

And, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we acquired additional shares of TELUS International by way of market purchases.\n\n## Other\n\n## 7.5 Liquidity and capital resource measures\n\nNet debt was $26.5 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $2.3 billion compared to one year earlier, resulting mainly from: the third quarter 2023 three-tranche issuance of $1.75 billion of notes as described in Section 7.4 ; an increase in net draws due to a syndicate of financial institutions (excluding TELUS Corporation) on the TI credit facility, which is non-recourse to TELUS Corporation; and the first quarter 2023 issuance of $500 million of Sustainability-Linked Notes, Series CAJ, as described in Section 7.4 ; and less Cash and temporary investments. These factors were partially offset by: a decrease in commercial paper outstanding and the repayment upon maturity of 3.35% Notes, Series CJ in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nFixed-rate debt as a proportion of total indebtedness , which excludes lease liabilities and other long-term debt, was 87% as at December 31, 2023, up from 86% one year earlier. The increase was primarily due to: (i) the third quarter 2023 three-tranche issuance of $1.75 billion of notes and the first quarter 2023 issuance of $500 million of Sustainability-Linked Notes, Series CAJ, both as described in Section 7.4 ; and (ii) a decrease in commercial paper outstanding, which is classified as floating-rate debt in this calculation. These factors were partially offset by: (i) an increase in net draws due to a syndicate of financial institutions (excluding TELUS Corporation) on the TI credit facility; and (ii) the repayment upon maturity of 3.35% Notes, Series CJ in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nOur Net debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs ratio supports our financial objective of maintaining investment-grade credit ratings, which facilitates reasonable access to capital. This ratio was 3.71 times, as measured at December 31, 2023, up from 3.63 times one year earlier. The effect of the increase, primarily due to business acquisitions, in net debt levels (which were already elevated in the current and comparative periods due to our acquisitions of spectrum licences, our largest indefinite life asset) exceeded the effect of growth in EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs. As at December 31, 2023, the acquisition of spectrum licences increased the ratio by approximately 0.45 and business acquisitions over the past 12 months increased the ratio by approximately 0.17. Our recent acquisitions of spectrum licences have increased our national spectrum holdings and represent an investment to extend our network capacity to support continuing growth in demand for data, as well as growth in our mobile subscriber base. Given the cash demands of the 600 MHz auction in 2019, the 3500 MHz auction in 2021, the 3800 MHz auction in 2023 and the upcoming spectrum auction in 2024 for millimetre wave, the assessment of the guideline and timing of return to the objective range remains to be determined; however, it is our intent to return to a ratio below 2.70 times in the medium term (following the spectrum auctions in 2021 and 2023, and the upcoming spectrum auction expected in 2024), consistent with our long-term strategy. While this ratio exceeds our long-term objective range, we are well in compliance with the leverage ratio covenant in our credit facilities, which states that we may not permit our leverage ratio to exceed 4.25 to 1.00 at December 31, 2023 (see Section 7.6 Credit facilities ).\n\nIn 2023, we incurred debt issuance costs in connection with the first quarter issuance of our senior unsecured 4.95% Sustainability-Linked Notes, Series CAJ and the September 8, 2023 issuance of our three-tranche note. This was less than the debt issuance costs incurred during 2022 in connection with February 2022 3.40% U.S. Dollar Sustainability-Linked Notes issuance and the September 2022 three-tranche note issuance.",

So as to be consistent with the way we manage our business, our Common Share dividend payout ratio is presented as a historical measure calculated as the sum of the dividends declared in the most recent four quarters for Common Shares, as recorded in the financial statements, net of dividend reinvestment plan effects, divided by the sum of the most recent four quarters' free cash flow amounts for interim reporting periods. For fiscal years, the denominator is annual free cash flow. The historical measure for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2023 is presented for illustrative purposes in evaluating our target guideline. As at December 31, 2023, the ratio was outside of the objective range.

As at December 31, 2023, we had drawn $1.1 billion on the non-revolving bank credit facility, with an effective average interest rate of 6.0% through January 2024.\n\n## TELUS revolving credit facility at December 31, 2023\n\n| ($ millions)               | Expiry        | Size   | Drawn   | Outstanding  undrawn  letters of  credit   | Backstop for  commercial  paper  program   | Available  liquidity   |\n|----------------------------|---------------|--------|---------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Revolving credit facility1 | July 14, 2028 | 2,750  | -       | -                                          | (1,021)                                    | 1,729                  |\n\nOur credit facilities contain customary covenants, including a requirement that we not permit our consolidated leverage ratio to exceed 4.25 to 1.00 and that we not permit our consolidated coverage ratio to be less than 2.00 to 1.00 at the end of any financial quarter. As at December 31, 2023, our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.71 to 1.00 and our consolidated coverage ratio\n\nwas 5.6 to 1.00. These ratios are expected to remain well within the covenants. There are certain minor differences in the calculation of the leverage ratio and coverage ratio under the revolving credit facility, as compared with the calculation of Net debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs and EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs interest coverage. Historically, the calculations are substantially similar. The covenants are not impacted by revaluation, if any, of Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets or Goodwill for accounting purposes. Continued access to our credit facilities is not contingent on maintaining a specific credit rating.\n\n## Commercial paper\n\nTELUS Corporation has an unsecured commercial paper program, which is backstopped by our revolving credit facility, enabling us to issue commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate equivalent amount at any one time of $2.0 billion (US$1.5 billion maximum) as at December 31, 2023. Foreign currency forward contracts are used to manage currency risk arising from issuing commercial paper denominated in U.S. dollars. The commercial paper program is to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, capital expenditures and investments. Our ability to reasonably access the commercial paper market in the U.S. is dependent on our credit ratings (see Section 7.8 Credit ratings ).\n\n## TELUS International credit facility\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, TELUS International (Cda) Inc. had a credit facility, secured by its assets, expiring on January 3, 2028, with a syndicate of financial institutions, including TELUS Corporation. The TI credit facility is comprised of revolving components totalling US$800 million (TELUS Corporation as approximately 7.2% lender) and amortizing term loan components totalling US$1.2 billion (TELUS Corporation as approximately 7.2% lender). The TI credit facility is non-recourse to TELUS Corporation. The outstanding revolving components and term loan components had a weighted average interest rate of 7.5% as at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe term loan components are subject to amortization schedules which require that 5% of the principal advanced be repaid each year of the term of the agreement, with the balance due at maturity.\n\n## Other letter of credit facilities\n\nAt December 31, 2023, we had $60 million of letters of credit outstanding issued under various uncommitted facilities; such letter of credit facilities are in addition to the ability to provide letters of credit pursuant to our committed revolving bank credit facility. Available liquidity under various uncommitted letters of credit facilities was $124 million at December 31, 2023. We had arranged $338 million of incremental letters of credit to allow us to participate in Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada's 3800 MHz wireless spectrum auction that was held in October to November 2023, as discussed further in Note 18(a) of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Other long-term debt\n\nOther liabilities bear interest at 3.3%, are secured by the AWS-4 spectrum licences associated with these other liabilities, and are subject to amortization schedules, so that the principal is repaid over the periods to maturity, the last period ending March 31, 2035.",

        "page_content": "## 7.7 Sale of trade receivables\n\nTCI, a wholly owned subsidiary of TELUS, is a party to an agreement with an arm's-length securitization trust associated with a major Schedule I Canadian bank, under which it is currently able to sell an interest in certain trade receivables up to a maximum of $600 million. The agreement is in effect until December 31, 2024, and available liquidity was $500 million as at December 31, 2023. (See Note 22 of the Consolidated financial statements.) Sales of trade receivables in securitization transactions are recognized as collateralized Short-term borrowings and thus do not result in our de-recognition of the trade receivables sold.\n\n## 7.8 Credit ratings\n\nWe continued to have investment-grade ratings in 2023 and as at February 9, 2024. We believe adherence to most of our stated financial policies (see Section 4.3 ), coupled with our efforts to maintain a constructive relationship with banks, investors and credit rating agencies, continues to provide reasonable access to capital markets. (See discussion of risks in Section 10.15 Financing, debt and dividends .)\n\nTCI is required to maintain a credit rating of at least BB from DBRS Ltd. or the securitization trust may require that the sale program be wound down prior to the end of the term. The minimum credit rating was exceeded as of February 9, 2024.\n\n## 7.9 Financial instruments, commitments and contingent liabilities\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nOur financial instruments, their accounting classification and the nature of certain risks that they may be exposed are described in Note 4 of the Consolidated financial statements.

Unrealized changes in the fair values of financial instruments are included in net income unless the instrument is part of a cash flow hedging relationship. The effective portions of unrealized changes in the fair values of financial instruments held for hedging are included in other comprehensive income.\n\nIn respect of hedges of anticipated transactions, hedge gains/losses are included with the related expenditure and are expensed when the transaction is recognized in our results of operations. We have selected this method as we believe that it results in a better matching of the hedge gains/losses with the risk exposure being hedged. Derivatives that are not part of a documented cash flow hedging relationship are accounted for as held for trading and thus are measured at fair value through net income.",

Excluding the TI credit facility and including cash and temporary investments of $864 million, we had available liquidity of approximately $3.1 billion at December 31, 2023 (see Section 11.1 Non-GAAP and other specified financial measures ). This adheres to our objective of generally maintaining at least $1 billion of available liquidity.

        "page_content": "## Claims and lawsuits\n\nA number of claims and lawsuits (including class actions and intellectual property infringement claims) seeking damages and other relief are pending against us and, in some cases, other mobile carriers and telecommunications service providers. As well, we have received notice of, or are aware of, certain possible claims (including intellectual property infringement claims) against us and, in some cases, other mobile carriers and telecommunications service providers. (See the related risk discussion in Section 10.18 Litigation and legal matters .)\n\nIt is not currently possible for us to predict the outcome of such claims, possible claims and lawsuits due to various factors, including: the preliminary nature of some claims; uncertain damage theories and demands; an incomplete factual record; uncertainty concerning legal theories and procedures and their resolution by the courts, at both the trial and the appeal levels; and the unpredictable nature of opposing parties and their demands.\n\nHowever, subject to the foregoing limitations, management is of the opinion, based upon legal assessments and information presently available, that it is unlikely that any liability, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, would have a material effect on our financial position and the results of our operations, including cash flows, with the exception of the items disclosed in Note 29(a) of the Consolidated financial statements. This is a significant judgment for us (see Section 8.1 Critical accounting estimates and judgments ).\n\n## Indemnification obligations\n\nIn the normal course of operations, we provide indemnification in conjunction with certain transactions. The terms of these indemnification obligations range in duration. These indemnifications would require us to compensate the indemnified parties for costs incurred as a result of failure to comply with contractual obligations, or litigation claims or statutory sanctions, or damages that may be suffered by an indemnified party. In some cases, there is no maximum limit on these indemnification obligations. The overall maximum amount of an indemnification obligation will depend on future events and conditions and therefore cannot be reasonably estimated. Where appropriate, an indemnification obligation is recorded as a liability. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of the related transactions, historically we have not made significant payments under these indemnifications.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, we had no liability recorded in respect of our indemnification obligations.\n\n## 7.10 Outstanding share information\n\n2\n\n8\n\n| Outstanding shares (millions)                                    | December 31,  2023   | January 31,   2024   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Common Shares                                                    | 1,468                | 1,476                |\n| Common Share options                                             | 2                    |                      |\n| Restricted share units and deferred share units - equity-settled | 8                    |                      |\n\n## 7.11 Transactions between related parties\n\n## Transactions with key management personnel\n\nOur key management personnel have authority and responsibility for overseeing, planning, directing and controlling our activities and consist of our Board of Directors and our Executive Team. Total compensation expense for key management personnel was $71 million in 2023 compared to $92 million in 2022. The decrease in compensation expense for key management personnel was primarily due to lower share-based compensation. See Note 30(a) of the Consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\n## Transactions with defined benefit pension plans\n\nWe provided our defined benefit pension plans with management and administrative services on a cost recovery basis and actuarial services on an arm's-length basis. Charges for these services were immaterial.\n\n## Transactions with real estate joint ventures and associate\n\nDuring 2023, we had transactions with real estate joint ventures, which are related parties, as set out in Note 21 of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the TELUS Sky real estate joint venture entered into an agreement to sell the income-producing properties and the related net assets to the venture partners; the two arm's-length parties will purchase the residential parcel and we will purchase the commercial parcel. Timing for the closing of these sales and purchases is dependent upon timing for the subdivision of the parcels, as well as other customary closing conditions. In addition, for the TELUS Sky real estate joint venture, commitments and contingent liabilities include construction financing ($282 million, with Canadian financial institutions and others as 662/3% lenders and TELUS as 331/3% lender) under a credit agreement maturing July 12, 2024. We have entered into lease agreements with the TELUS Sky real estate joint venture.\n\nDuring 2023, we increased our investment in Miovision Technologies Incorporated, as set out in Note 21(b) of the Consolidated financial statements.",

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect: the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and the reported amounts and classification of income and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our critical accounting estimates and significant judgments are generally discussed with the Audit Committee each quarter.\n\nRefer to Note 1 of the Consolidated financial statements for further information on our critical accounting estimates, including examples of the significant estimates and judgments that we make, and their relative significance and degree of difficulty, as illustrated in the graphic included in Note 1 .\n\n## General\n\n- \u00b7 In determining our critical accounting estimates, we consider trends, commitments, events or uncertainties that we reasonably expect to materially affect our methodology or assumptions. Our statements in this MD&A regarding such consideration are made subject to the Caution regarding forward-looking statements .\n- \u00b7 In the normal course, we make changes to the assumptions underlying all critical accounting estimates so that they reflect current economic conditions, updated historical information used to develop the assumptions, and changes in our credit ratings, where applicable. Unless indicated otherwise in the discussion below, we expect that no material changes in overall financial performance and financial statement line items would arise, either from reasonably likely changes in material assumptions underlying the estimate, or from selection of a different estimate from within a range of valid estimates.\n- \u00b7 Our critical accounting estimates affect the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income, and the Consolidated statements of financial position, as follows:\n\n## Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income\n\n|                                               | Operating                   | Operating expenses             | Operating expenses          | Operating expenses   | Operating expenses                 |                   |                                                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Consolidated statements of financial position | revenues and   other income | Goods and   services purchased | Employee   benefits expense | Depreciation         | Amortization of  intangible assets | Financing   costs | Employee defined  benefit plans   re-measurements1 |\n| Intangible assets, net, and Goodwill, net     |                             |                                |                             |                      | X2                                 |                   |                                                    |\n| Employee defined benefit pension plans        |                             |                                | X                           | X3                   | X3                                 | X                 | X                                                  |\n| Property, plant and equipment, net            |                             |                                |                             | X                    |                                    |                   |                                                    |\n| Provisions for asset retirement obligations   |                             | X                              |                             | X                    |                                    | X                 |                                                    |\n| Provisions related to business combinations   | X                           |                                |                             |                      |                                    | X                 |                                                    |\n| Investments                                   | X                           |                                |                             |                      |                                    |                   |                                                    |\n| Accounts receivable                           |                             | X                              |                             |                      |                                    |                   |                                                    |\n| Contract assets                               | X                           | X                              |                             |                      |                                    |                   |                                                    |\n| Inventories                                   |                             | X                              |                             |                      |                                    |                   |                                                    |\n\n- 1 Other comprehensive income - Item never subsequently reclassified to income.\n- 2 Accounting estimate, as applicable to Intangible assets with indefinite lives, relates to spectrum holdings.\n- 3 Accounting estimate impact due to internal labour capitalization rates.\n- All critical accounting estimates are uncertain at the time the estimates are made and affect the following Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income line items: Income taxes (except for estimates about Goodwill) and Net income.

        "page_content": "## Intangible assets, net; Goodwill, net; and Property, plant and equipment, net\n\n## General\n\n- \u00b7 The Intangible assets, net, line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position represents approximately 35% of Total assets as at December 31, 2023 (36% as at December 31, 2022). Included in Intangible assets are spectrum licences, which represent approximately 22% of Total assets as at December 31, 2023 (23% as at December 31, 2022).\n- \u00b7 The Goodwill, net, line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position represents approximately 18% of Total assets as at December 31, 2023 and approximately 17% of Total assets as at December 31, 2022.\n- \u00b7 The Property, plant and equipment, net, line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position represents approximately 31% of Total assets as at December 31, 2023 and approximately 32% of Total assets as at December 31, 2022.\n- \u00b7 If our estimates of the useful lives of assets were incorrect and/or our estimates of the acquisition-date fair value of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets acquired in business combinations were incorrect, we could experience increased or decreased charges for amortization or depreciation in the future. If the future were to differ adversely from our best estimates for the key economic assumptions and associated cash flows were to materially decrease, we could potentially experience future material impairment charges in respect of our Property, plant and equipment assets, Intangible assets or Goodwill. If Intangible assets with indefinite lives were determined to have finite lives at some point in the future, we could experience increased charges for amortization of Intangible assets. Such charges in and of themselves do not result in a cash outflow and would not immediately affect our liquidity.\n\n## The recoverability of Intangible assets with indefinite lives; the recoverability of Goodwill\n\n- \u00b7 The carrying values of Intangible assets with indefinite lives and Goodwill are periodically tested for impairment, and this test represents a significant estimate for us.\n- \u00b7 The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units' assets have been determined based on a fair value less costs of disposal calculation. There is a material degree of uncertainty with respect to the estimates of the recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units' assets, given the necessity of making key economic assumptions about the future. The fair value less costs of disposal calculation uses future cash flows and growth projections; associated economic risk assumptions and estimates of the likelihood of achieving key operating metrics and drivers; estimates of future generational infrastructure capital expenditures; the future weighted average cost of capital; and climate considerations.\n- \u00b7 See Note 18(f) of the Consolidated financial statements for further discussion of methodology and sensitivity testing.\n\n## The estimated useful lives of assets; the recoverability of tangible assets\n\n- \u00b7 The estimated useful lives of most assets are determined by a continuing program of asset life studies. The recoverability of assets with finite lives is significantly impacted by the estimated useful lives of assets.\n- \u00b7 Assumptions underlying the estimated useful lives of assets include the timing of technological obsolescence, competitive pressures, future infrastructure utilization plans and climate.\n\n## Employee defined benefit pension plans\n\nCertain actuarial and economic assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension costs, accrued pension benefit obligations and pension plan assets\n\n- \u00b7 We review industry practices, trends, economic conditions and data provided by actuaries when developing assumptions used in the determination of defined benefit pension costs and accrued pension benefit obligations. Pension plan assets are generally valued using market prices; however, some assets are valued using market estimates when market prices are not readily available. Actuarial support is obtained for interpolations of experience gains and losses that affect the employee defined benefit plan actuarial gains and losses and accrued pension benefit obligations. The discount rate used to determine the accrued benefit obligation is based upon the yield on long-term, high-quality, fixed-term investments. The discount rate is set annually at the end of each calendar year, at a minimum, based upon yields on long-term corporate bond indices in consultation with actuaries. Future increases in compensation are based upon the current benefits policies and economic forecasts. We have examined our respective pension obligation and current service cost durations and observed an approximate 10-year difference in duration. As individual discount rates more accurately reflect the obligation and current service cost, commencing in 2016, we applied a dual discount rate methodology.\n- \u00b7 On an annual basis, at a minimum, the defined benefit pension plan assumptions are assessed and revised as appropriate. Assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension costs, accrued pension benefit obligations and pension plan assets include life expectancy, discount rates, market estimates and rates of future compensation increases. Material changes in overall financial performance and financial statement line items would arise from reasonably likely changes in the material assumptions underlying this estimate, since certain assumptions may have been revised to reflect updated historical information and updated economic conditions. See Note 15 of the Consolidated financial statements for further analysis.\n- \u00b7 This accounting estimate related to employee defined benefit pension plans is in respect of components of the Operating expenses line item, Financing costs line item and Other comprehensive income line item on our Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income. If the future were to adversely differ from our best estimate of assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension costs, defined benefit obligations accrued and pension plan assets, we could experience future increased (or decreased) defined benefit pension expense, financing costs and charges to Other comprehensive income.\n\n## Income tax assets and liabilities\n\n## The amount and composition of income tax assets and income tax liabilities, including the amount of unrecognized tax benefits\n\n- \u00b7 Assumptions underlying the composition of income tax assets and liabilities are based upon an assessment of the technical merits of tax positions. Income tax benefits on uncertain tax positions are recognized only when it is more likely than not that the ultimate determination of the tax treatment of a position will result in the related benefit being realizable; however, this does not mean that tax authorities cannot challenge these positions. Income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount that is expected to be realized or incurred upon ultimate",

        "page_content": "settlement with tax authorities. Such assessments are based upon the applicable income tax legislation, regulations, interpretations and jurisprudence, all of which in turn are subject to change and interpretation.\n\n- \u00b7 Current income tax assets and liabilities are estimated based upon the amount of income tax that is calculated as being owed to tax authorities, net of periodic instalment payments. Deferred income tax liabilities are composed of the tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as the income tax effect of undeducted income tax losses. The timing of the reversal of temporary differences is estimated and the income tax rate substantively enacted for the periods of reversal is applied to the temporary differences. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are based upon the amounts recorded in the financial statements and are, therefore, subject to accounting estimates that are inherent in those balances. The tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as the amount of undeducted income tax losses, is based upon the assessment and measurement of tax positions, as noted above. Assumptions as to the timing of reversal of temporary differences include expectations about the future results of operations and future cash flows. The composition of income tax liabilities is reasonably likely to change from period to period because of changes in the estimation of these significant uncertainties.\n- \u00b7 This accounting estimate is in respect of material asset and liability line items on our Consolidated statements of financial position comprising less than 1% of Total assets as at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and approximately 8% of Total liabilities and owners' equity as at December 31, 2023 and 2022. If the future were to adversely differ from our best estimate of the likelihood of tax positions being sustained, the amount of tax expected to be incurred, the future results of operations, the timing of reversal of deductible temporary differences and taxable temporary differences, and the tax rates applicable to future years, we could experience material current income tax adjustments and deferred income tax adjustments. Such current and deferred income tax adjustments could result in an increase or acceleration of cash outflows at an earlier time than might otherwise be expected.\n\n## Provisions for asset retirement obligations\n\n## Certain economic assumptions used in provisioning for asset retirement obligations\n\n- \u00b7 Asset retirement obligation provisions are recognized for statutory, contractual or legal obligations, normally when incurred, associated with the retirement of Property, plant and equipment (primarily certain items of outside plant and mobile site equipment) when those obligations result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal operation of the assets. The obligations are measured initially at fair value, determined using present value methodology, and the resulting costs are capitalized as a part of the carrying value of the related asset.\n- \u00b7 On an annual basis, at a minimum, assumptions underlying the provisions for asset retirement obligations include expectations about inflation, discount rates and any changes in the amount or timing of the underlying future cash flows, which may span numerous decades. Material changes in financial position would arise from reasonably likely changes in the material assumptions underlying this estimate, since certain assumptions may have been revised to reflect updated historical information and updated economic conditions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- The capitalized asset retirement cost is depreciated on the same basis as the related asset, and the discount accretion is included in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as a component of Financing costs.\n- \u00b7 This accounting estimate is in respect of the asset retirement obligations component of the Provisions line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position, and this component comprises approximately 1% of Total liabilities and owners' equity as at December 31, 2023 and 2022. If the provisions for asset retirement obligations were to be inadequate, we could experience a charge to Goods and services purchased in the future. A charge for an inadequate asset retirement obligation provision would result in a cash outflow proximate to the time that the asset retirement obligation is satisfied.\n\n## Provisions related to business combinations\n\n## Provisions for written put options\n\n- \u00b7 In connection with certain business acquisitions, we have established provisions for written put options in respect of non-controlling interests. We provide written put options to the remaining selling shareholders under which they could put the remaining non-controlling interests at, or after, a specified date. The acquisition-date fair values of the puttable shares held by the non-controlling shareholders are recorded as provisions.\n- \u00b7 On an annual basis, at a minimum, the provisions for written put options are assessed and revised as appropriate. The provisions for written put options have been determined based on the net present values of estimated future earnings results; there is a material degree of uncertainty with respect to the estimates of future earnings results, given the necessity of making significant economic assumptions about the future. The amounts of provisions for written put options are reasonably likely to change from period to period because of changes in the estimation of future earnings and foreign exchange rate movements.\n- \u00b7 This accounting estimate is in respect of the provisions for written put options related to the non-controlling interests component of the Provisions line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position, and this component comprises less than 1% of Total liabilities and owners' equity as at December 31, 2023 and 2022. If the provisions for written put options were to be inadequate, we could experience a charge to Other income in the future. A charge for an inadequate written put option provision could result in a cash outflow, if cash-settled, proximate to the time that the written put option is exercised.\n\n## Portfolio investments\n\n## The recoverability of long-term portfolio investments\n\n- \u00b7 We assess the recoverability of our long-term portfolio investments on a regular, recurring basis. The recoverability of portfolio investments is assessed on a specific-identification basis, taking into consideration expectations about future performance of the portfolio investments and comparison of historical results to past expectations.\n- \u00b7 The most significant assumptions underlying the recoverability of long-term portfolio investments are related to the achievement of future cash flow and operating expectations. Our estimate of the recoverability of long-term portfolio investments could change from period to period due to both the recurring nature of the recoverability assessment and the nature of long-term portfolio investments (we do not control the investees).",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Portfolio investments are included in the Other long-term assets line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position, which itself comprises approximately 4% of Total assets as at December 31, 2023 and 2022. If the allowance for recoverability of long-term portfolio investments were to be inadequate, we could experience an increased charge to Other income or Other comprehensive income depending on the financial asset classification. Such a provision for recoverability of long-term portfolio investments does not result in a cash outflow.\n\n## Accounts receivable\n\n## General\n\n- \u00b7 When determining our allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider the line of business that gave rise to the Accounts receivable, conduct a statistical analysis of portfolio delinquency trends and perform specific account identification.\n- \u00b7 These accounting estimates are in respect of the Accounts receivable line item and the Unbilled customer finance receivables line within the Other long-term assets line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position, which together comprise approximately 8% of Total assets as at December 31, 2023 (7% as at December 31, 2022). If the future were to differ adversely from our best estimates of the fair value of the residual cash flows and the allowance for doubtful accounts, we could experience an increase in doubtful accounts expense in the future. Such doubtful accounts expense in and of itself does not result in a cash outflow.\n\n## The allowance for doubtful accounts\n\n- The estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts could materially change from period to period because the allowance is a function of the balance and composition of Accounts receivable, which can vary on a month-to-month basis. The variability of the balance of Accounts receivable arises from the variability of the amount and composition of Operating revenues and other income and from the variability of Accounts receivable collection performance. \u00b7\n\n## Contract assets\n\n## General\n\n- We maintain allowances for lifetime expected credit losses related to contract assets. Current economic conditions, historical information (including credit agency reports, if available), and the line of business from which the contract asset arose are all considered when determining impairment allowances. The same factors are considered when determining whether to write off amounts charged to the impairment allowance for contract assets against contract assets. \u00b7\n\n## The impairment allowance\n\n- These accounting estimates are in respect of the Contract assets line items on our Consolidated statements of financial position, which comprise approximately 2% of Total assets as at December 31, 2023 and 2022. If the future were to differ adversely from our best estimates of the fair value of the residual cash flows and the impairment allowance for contract assets, we could experience an increase in the impairment allowance for contract assets against contract assets in the future. Such impairment allowance in and of itself does not result in a cash outflow. \u00b7\n\n## Inventories\n\n## The allowance for inventory obsolescence\n\n- \u00b7 We determine our allowance for inventory obsolescence based upon expected inventory turnover, inventory aging, and current and future expectations with respect to product offerings.\n- \u00b7 Assumptions underlying the allowance for inventory obsolescence include future sales trends and offerings and the expected inventory requirements and inventory composition necessary to support these future offerings. Our estimate of the allowance for inventory obsolescence could change materially from period to period due to changes in product offerings and the level of consumer acceptance of those products.\n- \u00b7 This accounting estimate is in respect of the Inventories line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position, which comprises approximately 1% of Total assets as at December 31, 2023 and 2022. If the allowance for inventory obsolescence were to be inadequate, we could experience a charge to Goods and services purchased in the future. Such an inventory obsolescence charge does not result in a cash outflow.\n\n## 8.2 Accounting policy developments\n\nRefer to Note 2 of the Consolidated financial statements for a description of current and future changes in accounting policies, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Initial application of standards, interpretations and amendments to standards and interpretations in the reporting period.\n- \u00b7 Standards, interpretations and amendments to standards and interpretations in the reporting period not yet effective and not yet applied.",

        "page_content": "## 9 General trends, outlook and assumptions, and regulatory developments and proceedings\n\nThis section contains forward-looking statements, which should be read together with the Caution regarding forward-looking statements at the beginning of this MD&A.\n\n## 9.1 Telecommunications industry in 2023\n\nWe estimate that Canadian telecommunications industry revenues (including TV revenue and excluding equipment and media revenue) increased by approximately 3% in 2023. Mobile and data services continue to drive ongoing industry growth. Additionally, trends in consumer communications and data consumption continue to demonstrate a strong preference for data-rich applications and data-intensive devices, including smartphones and tablets. Similar to many other industries, the telecommunications industry, including TELUS across our TELUS Technology Solutions (TTech) and digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International (DLCX) segments, undertook significant cost efficiency efforts in 2023, in response to the evolving regulatory, competitive and macroeconomic landscape that we currently face.\n\n## Mobile products and services\n\nWe estimate that in 2023, the Canadian mobile industry experienced mobile network revenue growth of approximately 5.3%, which we believe was largely attributable to ongoing customer growth that in turn reflected robust immigration and population growth. We estimate that the Canadian mobile phone industry added approximately 1.7 million net new subscribers in 2023 (inclusive of TELUS' mobile phone additions), compared to our estimate of approximately 1.8 million in 2022 for the industry. These additions were supported by immigration and population growth, a continued increase in the rate of penetration in line with the trend toward multiple devices, and the ongoing adoption of mobile devices and services. With penetration rates in other developed nations well above 100% (United States, Europe and Asia), we estimate that the Canadian mobile phone penetration rate will continue to increase, above and beyond the approximate rate of 91% we estimate for 2023. TELUS mobile network revenue increased by 5.1% in 2023, and TELUS mobile products and services direct contribution increased by 7.4%.\n\nIn 2023, the Canadian mobile industry continued to experience heightened levels of competition nationally, particularly within the flanker environment. This competitive intensity has led to continued declines in chargeable data usage and rising levels of data allocation in monthly plans, including unlimited data plans, in addition to other ongoing factors, such as: the popularity of data sharing plans, including family plans; customer-friendly data usage notifications; and an evolving shift in the customer mix toward non-traditional mobile devices and tools such as video chats. The roll-out of 5G network infrastructure continued in 2023, with 5G coverage by the national carriers reaching approximately 86% of the Canadian population at the end of 2023, compared to approximately 80% at the end of 2022. For TELUS, our longstanding commitment to network excellence is reflected in the recognition we received from independent third-party sources in 2023, including being recognized as Canada's most awarded network by global analytics company, Opensignal, since 2017 for the 12th consecutive time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are well-prepared for the evolution in the competitive landscape, and we continue to work diligently to better monetize the robust growth in data services, while simultaneously delivering a strong value-for-money proposition and leading customer service. To this end, we are continuing our consistent and disciplined approach to realizing profitable customer growth through our strategic execution excellence of premium and economical smartphone loading. Moreover, we are focusing on the other levers available to us in an environment of moderating ARPU growth and expanding 5G network infrastructure, to ensure we continue to deliver on the EBITDA growth objectives for our TTech segment, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Evolving our approach to mobile plans and device sales with the availability of Unlimited data plans on our 5G network, TELUS Easy Payment device financing, TELUS Family Discount offerings and our extensive selection of certified pre-owned devices, which have resulted in simplification for both customers and team members, while supporting growth in digital transactions and improved recovery of handset costs\n- \u00b7 Monetizing our expanding 5G network by driving customer adoption of higher-value unlimited data plans and using speed tiers to encourage our customers' adoption of faster 5G speeds; Koodo Pick Your Perk plans, allowing customers to add a free feature of their choice while driving growth in ARPU; and marketing our innovative product and service offerings, including Stream+\n- \u00b7 Continuing to drive customer growth through high-quality loading supported by strong industry growth as discussed above, including 5G device upgrades\n- \u00b7 Working persistently to enhance the efficiency of the flow through from revenue to EBITDA, and the flow through from ARPU to average margin per subscriber unit per month (AMPU), in order to enhance our operating margins through ongoing efficiency and digitization initiatives; our digital-only, subscription-based Public Mobile brand supports our focus on AMPU through its focus on the bring-your-own-phone market and digital-only customer experience\n- \u00b7 Seeking new sources of mobile revenue, such as Internet of Things (IoT) or Internet of Everything, machine-to-machine (M2M) and security applications in the business-to-business (B2B) market, including health, agriculture and consumer goods, as well as smart cities\n- \u00b7 Exploring and implementing new channel strategies with attractive economic characteristics, including our certified pre-owned device program\n- \u00b7 Pursuing smart bundling opportunities across mobile and fixed products and services to achieve better economies of scope and enhance lifetime revenue per customer with higher revenue per account and lower customer churn.\n\nThe Canadian mobile industry remains highly competitive and capital-intensive among facilitiesbased providers, as carriers continue to expand and enhance their broadband mobile networks, including the ongoing build-out of 5G, as well as making material investments in spectrum.",

        "page_content": "## Fixed products and services\n\nThe cable-TV market changed in 2023 as Rogers completed its acquisition of Shaw. The three major cable-TV companies had an estimated 7.50 million internet subscribers at the end of 2023 (47% market share - down one percentage point), relatively unchanged compared to an estimated 7.50 million subscribers at the end of 2022. Meanwhile, telecommunications companies had approximately 8.46 million internet subscribers (53% market share - up one percentage point), compared to approximately 8.06 million at the end of 2022. We continue to make gains in market share as a result of the ongoing expansion of our TELUS PureFibre infrastructure and the pullthrough of subscribers from our IP-based TELUS TV services, including our bundled mobility and home services, as well as significant growth in home security and automation. Our ongoing focus on fibre to the premises or home (FTTP/FTTH), and its superior characteristics as compared to cable, such as higher and symmetrical download and upload speeds, has allowed us to connect approximately 3.2 million households and businesses in B.C., Alberta and Eastern Quebec as of December 31, 2023 to our TELUS PureFibre technology. Notably, we received recognition from PCMag in 2023 as the fastest internet service provider (ISP) in Canada among major ISPs for the fourth consecutive year.\n\nWhile Canadians still watch conventional TV, digital streaming platforms are playing an increasingly important role in the broadcasting industry and in the distribution of content. Popular online video services are providing Canadians with more choice about where, when and how to access video content. In 2023, Canadian IP TV providers expanded their subscriber base by an estimated 4% to 3.5 million, or 38% of market share, up compared to approximately 34% at the end of 2022, through wider network coverage, enhanced differentiated services and bundled offerings, and marketing and promotions focused on IP TV. Despite this growth in the overall IP TV subscriber base, the combined cable-TV and satellite-TV subscriber penetration rate was lower. We estimate that the three major cable-TV companies had approximately 4.7 million TV subscribers or a 50% market share at the end of 2023, up compared to 48% at the end of 2022.\n\nIn recent years, two of the largest Canadian cable-TV companies have launched new TV services based on the Comcast X1 TV platform - Rogers (and previously Shaw prior to its acquisition by Rogers) and Videotron (a Quebecor brand). Our IP-based Optik TV platform continues to offer numerous service advantages compared to this cable platform, including: flexible pricing plans and packages available to all customers; picture clarity and quality; content depth and breadth, including multicultural and hard-to-find shows from abroad, as well as specialty options such as wellness and entertainment; the number of ways customers can access content, including wireless set-top boxes, Restart TV, higher-capacity PVR and the Optik TV app, which offers more than twice as many live TV channels at home or on the go compared to our largest Western Canadian cable competitor. The TELUS PureFibre network was named the number one network for streaming Netflix for 17 consecutive months prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (based on the Netflix ISP Speed Index rankings for Canadian providers released monthly, as of March 2020) and we are the only Canadian carrier to consistently achieve a number one ranking for each month from August 2020 to December 2023 for the newly revamped index. We continue to offer more on-demand content and more over-the-top (OTT) content with Netflix, YouTube, Prime Video (included in the Amazon Prime membership), hayu, TED Talks and the National Film Board of Canada, and we are the leader in multicultural content in Western Canada.\n\nThe national Canadian telecom providers continue to acquire and develop capabilities in home security and automation. Through a variety of recent acquisitions, we have advanced our commitment to leverage the power of technology in order to bring state-of-the-art convenience, control and safety into the lives, homes and businesses of more Canadians and become the leading provider of security and home automation services in Canada. Our security offerings also provide opportunities to offer attractive bundled solutions and advance our connected home strategy while accelerating our entry into the market for smart home and automation and physical and cybersecurity business solutions. Our SmartHome Security, TELUS Secure Business, and Custom Building Solutions service offerings complement our industry-leading customer service and build on our strategy and commitment to leverage our world-leading wireless and PureFibre network to enhance connected home, business, security, IoT, cybersecurity, smart buildings and smart cities, as well as health and wellness services for our customers across Canada.\n\nCanada's three major cable-TV companies had an estimated combined base of approximately 2.7 million telephony subscribers at the end of 2023. This represents a national consumer market share of approximately 41%, relatively flat compared to approximately 41% at the end of 2022. Telecommunications companies had an estimated combined total of 3.3 million telephony subscribers at the end of 2023, representing a market share of approximately 50%, up compared to approximately 49% at the end of 2022. Technological substitution by mobile services continues to erode the number of residential voice subscribers and associated local and long distance revenues, as expected.\n\n## TELUS Health\n\nIn 2023, we continued to drive strong growth within our health business, complemented by the post-acquisition integration of LifeWorks, acquired in 2022, as well as the ongoing adoption of our unique and innovative portfolio of health and well-being product and service offerings across the health ecosystem. Health services revenue increased by 87% to $1.7 billion in 2023. Demand for health and well-being services has never been higher, and TELUS Health is improving health outcomes and delivering better preventive health and wellness experiences for people worldwide. Employers are leading an evolution in health and wellness - from prevention to care delivery presenting a significant global growth opportunity for our health business. We are simplifying our offerings for this market by bringing together employee and family assistance programs (EFAP) and mental health and well-being solutions, and supporting these capabilities with continued digital enhancements. The digitization of everyday functions within the health ecosystem, combined with increased and pervasive broadband network connectivity, provides a unique opportunity to support the ongoing development and delivery of advanced health and wellness applications that will benefit Canadians and our global customers, to improve health and well-being outcomes. With these additional solutions, TELUS Health is providing meaningful interventions that improve employee mental and physical well-being, through both physical and telemedicine solutions.\n\n## TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods\n\nThe global agriculture industry and global food industry had market values of approximately $13 trillion and $12 trillion, respectively, in 2023. However, to meet the demands of a growing global population and changing preferences in developing nations, it is estimated that global food supplies will need to increase by as much as 70% over the next 30 years. Historically, we have seen the agriculture sector lag other sectors in adopting digital technology solutions.",

        "page_content": "However, in response to the challenges posed by a growing population, food producers, consumer packaged goods companies, and retailers worldwide are now embracing innovative digital technologies to drive new efficiencies in production and consumption. By leveraging these new technologies, such as data analytics and automation, stakeholders in the food industry can achieve significant cost savings, optimize resource allocation, reduce production time and significantly reduce food waste. Moreover, these solutions have the potential to enhance the safety, quality, traceability and sustainability of the food we consume.\n\nAt TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods, we are committed to transforming the food supply value chain, from producer to consumer. Our focus is on providing our customers with access to data insights that can drive operational improvements and deliver tangible benefits. Our efforts are focused on three primary areas - software and business process solutions that target agriculture industry participants such as growers and agribusiness companies, software and consulting services that serve the animal agriculture industry with a primary focus on cattle, and software and data analytics services that serve consumer packaged goods companies. In 2023, we updated our support model for TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods and repositioned the business under common leadership with our TELUS Business Solutions operations. This has enabled us to leverage our expertise in the TELUS Business Solutions space to accelerate our TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods growth plans.\n\n## Digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International (DLCX)\n\nIn 2023, TELUS International (TI) faced a challenging operating environment, due to meaningful headwinds from the global macroeconomic environment and aggressive cost-cutting initiatives undertaken by certain large clients. Despite these challenges, TI continued to win business with both new and existing clients, driving solid revenue growth. TI also undertook significant cost efficiency efforts, including workforce right-sizing, to better align its cost structure with current demand, which helped drive improved profitability in the second half of 2023, with DLCX Adjusted EBITDA margin of 26% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 21% for the full year (see Section 11.1 Non-GAAP and other specified financial measures ), more in line with its historic margin profile. Across its more than 650 global clients, TI partners with major global and disruptive brands, with a focus on designing, building and delivering premium digital customer experience solutions. With exposure to an expanding variety of industry verticals, such as tech and games, communications and media, eCommerce and fintech, as well as more conventional sectors, such as healthcare, banking, financial services and insurance, TI is positioned for continued diversification of its revenue sources that will support sustainable, long-term business success. TI's end-to-end capabilities address multiple client needs, including digital customer experience management and the digital transformation of IT and customer experience systems, as well as new and emerging client needs, such as digital trust and safety, AI data services and generative AI solutions in customer experience. The demand for AI data services historically has been driven by large technology companies; however, demand from other enterprises is growing as AI adoption increases. In early 2023, TI completed its acquisition of WillowTree, a premier, full-service digital product provider focused on end-user experiences, such as native mobile applications and unified web interfaces. The acquisition of WillowTree brought key tech talent, including digital strategists, designers, engineers and project managers, diversifying TI's portfolio of next-generation solutions and augmenting its digital product offerings and innovative client-centric software development capabilities.\n\n## 9.2 Telecommunications industry general outlook and trends\n\n## Mobile products and services\n\nMobile growth continues to be driven by the ongoing increase in data usage and adoption, including: higher-value smartphones, unlimited data offerings, shared family data plans, and IoT and M2M devices. In addition, consumers continue to replace fixed access services with mobile access and related data services. These trends are expected to drive the growing demand for mobile data services for the foreseeable future, particularly as the industry continues to shift to 5G. Industry ARPU is expected to continue moderating, compared to periods prior to the pandemic, particularly now that the industry has lapped the meaningful recovery in roaming revenues, which had fallen during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, as a result of increased competitive intensity, the industry continues to see greater adoption of bring-your-own-device (BYOD) additions, resulting in increased switching activity.\n\nWhile LTE and LTE advanced (LTE-A) technologies increase download speeds, encourage data usage and enhance the customer experience, growth in data traffic poses challenges to mobile access technology. To better manage this data traffic, Canadian providers continue to evolve their networks and deploy spectrum to support the shift to 5G. Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) held its auction of spectrum in the 3800 MHz band in the fourth quarter of 2023 and we expect the auction of millimetre wave (mmWave) spectrum to commence in 2024; these bands are important for the expansion of 5G networks.\n\nIoT technologies connect communications-enabled devices via wireless technologies, allowing them to exchange key information and share processes. Advanced platforms and networks are already in place in industries such as healthcare, utilities, agriculture and fleet management, with deployment ongoing in other sectors, including smart cities, vehicle insurance, retail, utilities, and connected vehicles. These industries are adopting IoT solutions, combined with other applications, to digitally transform their operations and generate value from their connections. IoT presents a meaningful opportunity for growth in wireless connectivity, which can deliver services to customers more efficiently, at a higher level of security and productivity. IoT connectivity generally has a lower ARPU when sold as a stand-alone service, but supports both revenue and margin growth, since it often leads to the sale of IoT applications or our other service offerings, enhancing customer penetration. In 2023, we added 564,000 connected devices, bringing our connected device subscriber base to more than 3.1 million, up 26% from 2022.\n\n5G now plays a leading global role in technology evolution and innovation. In Canada, 5G is supporting our social purpose and our efforts to further bridge the digital divide and connect rural Canadians. Our ongoing investments in 5G will also generate capital expenditure savings by allowing us to deliver high-speed mobile internet services in more rural areas, as well as improved cost savings and innovative services in industrial automation, transportation and telehealth. With its significantly faster speeds, lower latencies, improved reliability and attractive economics, 5G will enable a host of new applications, including: for businesses, new opportunities for enhanced productivity, virtual work and profitability; for industries, remote operations, industrial control and automated manufacturing; for consumers, it will enable home automation, autonomous vehicles, and wireless-to-the-home connectivity with speeds comparable to fixed access technologies; for healthcare, it will support converged solutions for hospitals, clinics and remote patient monitoring, and potentially medical procedures; and for agriculture and consumer goods, it will drive autonomous farm equipment, precision agronomy, food traceability and real-time data insights.",

        "page_content": "5G is also essential to the future of a global digital economy, as well as the Canadian economy, and is expected to generate significant innovation, growth and productivity. As the 5G ecosystem evolves, it will move from a non-stand-alone core, based on the existing 4G LTE infrastructure, to a stand-alone core, which leverages cloud-based technology to enable new functionality with ultra-low latency and the capacity to support more connected devices. In 2023, we started to see 5G stand-alone adoption by early adopters around the world, including TELUS, and functionality and 5G stand-alone adoption are expected to progress further in 2024.\n\nDelivering a robust and reliable 5G experience for Canadians will require complementary spectrum bands - a portfolio of low, mid and high-band spectrum to meet the needs of a diverse subscriber base. Low-band spectrum, such as 600 MHz, covers wide areas and penetrates buildings effectively, thus improving coverage in urban and suburban areas. This low-band spectrum will play a vital role in bringing 5G to Canadians and as such, it is an important resource for Canada, as wireless operators build out 5G coverage in rural areas. High-band spectrum, such as mmWave, can deliver speeds up to 100 times faster than 600 MHz spectrum; however, it does not have the same coverage characteristics for penetrating buildings effectively or covering wide areas. This high-bandwidth spectrum and the associated faster connection speeds will help unlock new technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality, and enable a user experience similar to fibre for fixed wireless access. Mid-band spectrum, such as the 3500 MHz and 3800 MHz bands, is important to the 5G ecosystem, as it balances both speed and coverage characteristics. This spectrum will be integral to low-latency communications services, including autonomous monitoring, fixed wireless access and vehicle-to-everything communication. The 3500 MHz and 3800 MHz spectrum bands are globally recognized as key for 5G networks. All of the national carriers in Canada introduced 5G services in 2020, which then accelerated in the following years. This is expected to continue in the years ahead, as spectrum is auctioned and deployed and new 5G technologies are rolled out. See Section 1.3 Highlights of 2023 for further details on the recent spectrum auction and Section 9.4 Communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings for more information about upcoming spectrum auctions.\n\n## Fixed products and services\n\nThe fixed telecommunications market is expected to remain very competitive in 2024. Although the consumer high-speed internet market is maturing, with a penetration rate of approximately 91% in Western Canada and 92% across Canada at the end of 2023, subscriber growth is expected to continue over the coming years. Technology substitution, including the growth of mobile and voiceover-IP (VoIP) services, is expected to continue to replace higher-margin legacy voice revenues, while digital streaming services and other online content providers are expected to impact current linear TV services. In our incumbent operating areas of B.C. and Alberta, it is estimated that in 2023, 65% of households no longer had a fixed line and 40% of households no longer had linear TV service. We are an important provider of these substitution services and the decline in this legacy business is continuing as expected, although residential voice losses continued at a slower pace than previous years, reflecting our success in bundling our home solutions and services. Our longstanding growth strategy remains focused on mobile, data and IP-centric fixed capabilities.\n\nThe popularity of viewing TV and on-demand content anywhere, particularly on handheld devices, is expected to continue to grow as customers adopt services that enable them to view content on multiple screens. Streaming media providers continue to enhance OTT and direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming services in order to compete for a share of viewership,\n\nas viewing habits and consumer demand evolve. Studies suggest that approximately 72% of Canadians subscribed to paid OTT video service subscriptions in Canada at the end of 2023.\n\nConventional TV content providers are monitoring OTT developments and adapting their content and market strategies to compete with these new offerings. We view OTT as an opportunity to add further capabilities to our linear and on-demand assets, providing customers with flexible options to choose the content they want and encouraging greater use of our high-speed internet and mobile services by those customers, while also limiting their frustration with the need to have multiple subscriptions. We continue to partner with, and offer services from, a wide range of OTT providers. With our launch of Stream+, our subscribers can enjoy their favourite shows and movies in the comfort of their home or on the go, powered by our award-winning mobile network.\n\nConsistent with facilities-based competition, telecommunications companies continue to make significant capital investments in broadband networks, with a focus on FTTP, to maintain and enhance their ability to support advanced IP-based services and higher broadband speeds. Cable-TV companies continue to evolve their cable networks with DOCSIS-related bandwidth enhancements and node splitting. Although the platform increases speed in the near term and is cost-efficient, it does not offer the advanced capabilities of FTTP over the longer term, such as fast symmetrical upload and download speeds. At the end of 2023, our fibre-optic infrastructure was available to approximately 3.2 million homes and businesses. 5G and other wireless access technologies allow us to target otherwise underserved areas with a fixed mobile solution.\n\nOur broadband investments, including the build-out of our FTTP broadband network and our IP-based Optik TV service, home security and automation and integrated bundled service offerings, which also encompass mobility, consumer healthcare and cybersecurity, continue to enhance our superior competitive position relative to our competitors. Our bundled offerings drive higher product intensity with our customers, as well as improved customer loyalty.\n\nIn the business market (public sector, commercial sector, and small and medium-sized businesses or SMB), the convergence of IT and telecommunications, facilitated by the ubiquity of IP, continues to shape the competitive environment, with non-traditional providers increasingly blurring the lines of competition and business models. Cable-TV companies continue to make investments to better compete in the highly contested SMB space. Telecommunications companies like TELUS are providing network-centric managed applications that leverage their significant FTTP investments, while IT service providers are bundling network connectivity with their proprietary software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings.\n\nThe development of IP-based platforms providing combined IP voice, data and video solutions offers potential cost efficiencies that compensate, in part, for the loss of margins resulting from the migration from legacy to IP-based services. New opportunities exist for integrated solutions, as well as business process and IT outsourcing, that could have a greater business impact than legacy telecommunications services. Increasingly, businesses are looking to partner with their communications service provider to address their business objectives and challenges, and to tailor cloud-based solutions for their needs that leverage telecommunications in ways not imagined a decade ago. Cloud computing is changing service delivery to always-on and everything-as-aservice, and strong growth is expected in this area. We offer network-as-a-service capabilities for businesses with the option of an IT network as a service over the internet, mirrored across multiple locations, based on a self-serve platform that reduces deployment cycles and reliance on IT specialists. Heightened data security needs represent both a challenge and an opportunity.",

These assumptions may ultimately prove to have been inaccurate. Events or our actual results may differ materially from expectations expressed in or implied by this outlook due to these assumptions having been incorrect or as a result of risks such as those described in detail in Section 10 Risks and risk management .\n\n## 9.4 Communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings\n\nOur telecommunications, broadcasting and radiocommunication services are regulated under federal laws by various authorities, including the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), ISED, Canadian Heritage and the Competition Bureau.\n\nThe operations of our health business are also subject to various federal and provincial health laws and regulations, as well as policies, guidelines and directives issued by regulatory and administrative bodies. See Section 10.3 Regulatory matters .\n\nThe following is a summary of certain significant communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings that are relevant to our telecommunications and broadcasting business and our industry. This summary is not intended to be a comprehensive legal analysis or description of all of the specific issues described. Although we have indicated those issues for which we do not currently expect the outcome of a development or proceeding to be material for us, there can be no assurance that the expected outcome will occur or that our current assessment of its likely impact on us will be accurate. See Section 10.3 Regulatory matters .\n\n## Radiocommunication licences and spectrum-related matters\n\nISED regulates, among other matters, the allocation and use of radio spectrum in Canada and licenses radio apparatus, frequency bands and/or radio channels within various frequency bands to service providers and private users. The department also establishes the terms and conditions that may attach to such radio authorizations, including restrictions on licence transfers, coverage obligations, research and development obligations, annual reporting, and obligations concerning mandated roaming and antenna site sharing with competitors.\n\n## Spectrum transfer moratorium and review of the spectrum transfer framework\n\nOn March 31, 2023, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry announced a moratorium on high-impact transfers of spectrum licences in commercial mobile bands. 'High-impact' transfers are those that would have a significant effect on the ability of telecommunications service providers to offer wireless services in Canada. The Minister also directed ISED to launch a comprehensive review of Canada's spectrum transfer framework, with the moratorium expiring once a new framework comes into effect. No details were released about when the framework review would take place or when a new framework will be implemented. There is a risk that this moratorium could have a material impact on us depending on how long it remains in place.\n\n## Millimetre Wave (mmWave) spectrum auction to support 5G\n\nOn June 5, 2019, ISED released its Decision on Releasing Millimetre Wave Spectrum to Support 5G , repurposing several tranches of mmWave spectrum for mobile use. On June 6, 2022, ISED issued its Consultation on a Policy and Licensing Framework for Spectrum in the 26, 28 and 38 GHz bands , which is the first step in setting the auction framework rules, including competitive measures for these mmWave bands. There is a risk that the auction rules will favour certain carriers over us and impact our ability to acquire an adequate quantity of mmWave spectrum. ISED maintains its projection that the mmWave auction will commence in 2024.\n\n## Consultation on conditions of licence relating to the provision of service within the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) subway system\n\nOn September 11, 2023, ISED released new conditions of licence relating to the provision of service within the TTC subway system. These conditions of licence apply to all wireless service providers that hold mobile wireless spectrum that cover the Toronto tier 5-282 service area. These conditions of licence require all applicable licensees to provide wireless services in the TTC subway by October 3, 2023. They also set requirements upon licensees to finalize network agreements with Rogers Communications Inc., the licensee that operates the wireless antenna system in the TTC subway, and to meet stated deployment requirements over the next three years. We satisfied the October 3, 2023 date to deploy wireless services in the TTC subway. On December 11, 2023, we finalized a network agreement with Rogers which ensures access for TELUS to the TTC network and will further ensure we meet stated deployment and other conditions of licence.\n\n## Regulatory and federal government reviews\n\nThe CRTC and the federal government have initiated public proceedings to review various matters. A number of key proceedings are discussed below.\n\n## Review of the wholesale high-speed access service framework\n\nOn March 8, 2023, the CRTC issued Review of the wholesale high-speed access service framework , Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2023-56. The Notice of Consultation first creates a rate reduction by requiring incumbent carriers to revise their rates to reflect a 10% decrease in the costs of traffic-sensitive components. The Notice of Consultation then seeks comment on a number of issues, including whether wholesale access to fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) service should be offered on an aggregated basis and whether any further regulation, including retail regulation, is warranted. The Notice of Consultation further expresses the CRTC's preliminary view that incumbents should be required to provide an interim aggregated wholesale FTTP service pending the disposition of the consultation. In November 2023, the CRTC issued its decision imposing an interim wholesale mandate pending the final disposition of the proceeding. The interim order requires Bell to provide aggregated wholesale FTTP access in its incumbent Ontario and Quebec serving territories and requires us to provide the same service in our incumbent serving territory in Quebec. The CRTC did not make any similar order with respect to our incumbent serving territories in British Columbia or Alberta. Bell has sought leave to appeal the interim order to the Federal Court of Appeal and has sought a stay of the interim order pending the disposition of its leave application and appeal, if granted. Bell has also brought a petition to Cabinet to rescind the interim order and has sought alternative relief that would apply the decision nationwide and could exclude larger carriers from accessing the mandated service. The leave and stay applications",

        "page_content": "as well as the petition remain under reserve. The remainder of the CRTC proceeding, including the issue of whether to impose a permanent mandate, is scheduled to conclude shortly after an oral hearing scheduled for February 2024. Until the CRTC releases its decisions in this matter, it is too early to determine the impact of this proceeding on us.\n\n## Review of mobile wireless services\n\nOn April 15, 2021, the CRTC released its decision in the Wireless Regulatory Framework Review . The CRTC determined that TELUS, Bell, Rogers and SaskTel must provide wholesale mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) access to facilities-based regional wireless providers in areas where those providers hold a mobile wireless spectrum licence. MVNO access is based on commercially negotiated rates and will be phased out after seven years. On October 25, 2022, the CRTC released Telecom Decision CRTC 2022-288, where it made determinations on the draft terms and conditions of the MVNO tariffs of TELUS, Bell, Rogers and SaskTel. The carriers updated their tariffs based on this decision and the Commission granted final approval on May 9, 2023 in Telecom Order 2023-133. TELUS, Bell, Rogers and SaskTel now have the MVNO service operational and available for use. Eligible wireless providers desiring MVNO access are entitled to commence negotiations. The Commission also issued Telecom Order 2023-171, where it approved updates to the domestic roaming tariffs of TELUS, Bell and Rogers to take into account the availability of seamless roaming and 5G services as part of mandated domestic roaming.\n\nWe appealed two determinations from this decision to the Federal Court of Appeal: (i) the requirement for the national mobile carriers, including us, to offer seamless roaming as an additional condition under which the existing mandated wholesale roaming service must be offered; and (ii) the ruling that sections 43 and 44 of the Telecommunications Act do not provide the CRTC with jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes involving mobile wireless transmission facilities. The appeal was heard in December 2022 and was dismissed on April 13, 2023. In December 2023, the Supreme Court of Canada granted us leave to appeal the issue of CRTC jurisdiction over mobile wireless transmission facilities. We anticipate the Supreme Court will hear the matter in late 2024 or in 2025.\n\nOn July 24, 2023, the CRTC issued its first arbitration decision related to the MVNO framework, in the context of a final offer arbitration between Rogers and Quebecor. The CRTC selected Quebecor's offer for the MVNO data access rate, but the rate remains confidential. Rogers has now filed an application with the Federal Court of Appeal seeking leave to appeal the CRTC's decision. In addition, on October 10, 2023, the CRTC issued an arbitration decision about access to MVNO services by Quebecor from Bell. The CRTC selected the data rate as proposed by Bell. The impact of these decisions on us will be dependent on the commercial rates that we negotiate for MVNO access or are otherwise imposed by the CRTC through the final offer arbitration process, as well as the outcome of the Federal Court of Appeal process.\n\n## Consultation on amending the CRTC MVNO mandate to include additional retail market segments\n\nOn March 1, 2023, the CRTC issued Facilities-based wholesale mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) access tariffs - Considering the inclusion of additional retail market segments , Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2023-48. In this consultation, the CRTC is soliciting comments on whether the wholesale MVNO framework should be broadened to include enterprise, IoT and M2M service. The record of this proceeding is now closed. Until the CRTC issues a decision in this consultation, it is too early to determine its impact on us.\n\n## Application to seek a review of domestic wholesale roaming rates\n\nOn May 19, 2022, Bragg Communications Inc., Cogeco Communications Inc., Videotron Ltd., Xplornet Communications Inc. and Xplore Mobile Inc. filed a joint application to the CRTC seeking a review of the tariffed rates currently charged by TELUS, Bell and Rogers for domestic wholesale roaming, claiming that the current rates are no longer just and reasonable. We have filed an answer to this application demonstrating why such a review is not warranted at this time and the CRTC has since issued requests for information to wireless services providers. The impact of this application is dependent upon whether the CRTC decides to undertake a review of mandated roaming rates and to what extent there are any changes for current tariffed rates.\n\n## New draft cybersecurity legislation\n\nOn June 14, 2022, the federal government introduced Bill C-26, An Act respecting cyber security, amending the Telecommunications Act and making consequential amendments to other Acts . The legislation would amend the Telecommunications Act , among other things, to allow the Governor in Council to prohibit telecommunications service providers from using equipment from designated companies in their networks. In practice, this will allow the federal government to ban the use of Huawei and ZTE equipment in our network and impose penalties for non-compliance. The Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry stated that the government intends to use its powers under Bill C-26, if passed, to, among other things, require the removal of existing Huawei and ZTE 5G equipment by June 28, 2024. The legislation would also create a new statute, the Critical Cyber Systems Protection Act (CCSPA). The CCSPA would require designated federally regulated corporations to maintain cybersecurity plans, impose reporting requirements and impose penalties for non-compliance. Bill C-26 received second reading on March 27, 2023 and is now undergoing committee review. If we are ultimately subject to an order requiring us to remove a significant amount of equipment from our network, the effect could be material.\n\n## Government of Canada and CRTC activities to improve Canadian network resiliency\n\nOn February 22, 2023, the CRTC issued Call for comments - Development of a regulatory framework to improve network reliability and resiliency - Mandatory notification and reporting about major telecommunications service outages , Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2023-39, in which it sought comments on a notification and reporting regime for major service outages. In addition, the Commission mandated the implementation of an interim notification and reporting regime for major service outages while the consultation is ongoing. We implemented the interim regime on March 8, 2023 and are participating in the consultation. ISED is also conducting further steps via the Canadian Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (CSTAC) to examine network resiliency. We continue to participate in all follow-up initiatives as required. It is too early to determine if these initiatives will have a material impact until they are concluded.\n\n## Nova Scotia 911 legislation\n\nIn November 2022, Nova Scotia passed amendments to the Emergency 911 Act and the Emergency Management Act that, among other things, require telecommunications service providers to take certain actions to prevent certain outages, to inform stakeholders, and to refund customers in the case of certain outages. These amendments have received royal assent but have not been proclaimed into force.",

        "page_content": "Most of the obligations of telecommunications service providers are to be set out in regulations, which have yet to be made by the Governor in Council. Until the regulations are made, it is too early to determine the impact of this legislation on us.\n\n## CRTC proceeding regarding potential barriers to the deployment of broadband-capable networks in underserved areas in Canada\n\nOn December 10, 2019, the CRTC issued Call for comments regarding potential barriers to the deployment of broadband-capable networks in underserved areas in Canada , Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2019-406. In this proceeding, the CRTC sought comment on barriers that service providers and communities face in building new facilities, or interconnecting to or accessing existing facilities, and in extending networks into underserved areas in order to offer universal service objective-level services. The CRTC has specifically identified access to affordable transport services and efficient use of support structures as potential barriers. The record of the proceeding is now closed and we anticipate a decision this year. It is too early to determine the impact of the proceeding on us.\n\n## Implementation of next-generation 9-1-1 service\n\nOn June 14, 2021, the CRTC issued Telecom Decision CRTC 2021-199, Establishment of new deadlines for Canada's transition to next-generation 9-1-1 (NG9-1-1), where the CRTC stipulated revised implementation for NG9-1-1 service in Canada. Consistent with the CRTC's requirements, we are now transiting live NG9-1-1 traffic over our NG9-1-1 network, but full implementation of NG9-1-1 in our NG9-1-1 territory is contingent on interconnections with 9-1-1 call centres and such implementation is dependent upon local government authorities. We continue our work to fully implement NG9-1-1.\n\nOn October 4, 2023, a group of public safety answering points (PSAPs), which are the entities that receive 9-1-1 calls and dispatch emergency services, filed an application to the CRTC asking that NG9-1-1 network providers, including us, make available a NG9-1-1 network testing environment for PSAPs. We are reviewing this application and plan to intervene as part of this process. The outcome of this application is not expected to be material and will not affect our ability to meet our regulatory mandate to implement NG9-1-1.\n\n## Development of a network-level blocking framework to limit botnet traffic\n\nOn June 23, 2022, the CRTC released Development of a network-level blocking framework to limit botnet traffic and strengthen Canadians' online safety , Compliance and Enforcement and Telecom Decision CRTC 2022-170. The technical working group, the CRTC Interconnection Steering Committee, has examined the issue and filed a report about how ISPs can implement network blocking of malicious botnet traffic. A Commission decision on that report is pending. The outcome is not expected to be material.\n\n## Federal private sector privacy bill proposes to repeal and replace the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act\n\nThe Digital Charter Implementation Act, 2022 (C-27) proposes to enact the Consumer Privacy Protection Act (replacing the existing private sector privacy legislation and implementing new consumer privacy rights, enhanced enforcement powers and a private right of action), the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal Act (a new adjudicative body to provide independent\n\noversight on enforcement activities by the regulator) and the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (a new regulatory regime for the use of AI in the private sector, supported by extensive enforcement powers). C-27 is currently before the INDU Committee of the House of Commons. The Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry has proposed extensive amendments to all elements of C-27. The bill proposes significant changes to federal privacy legislation in Canada; however, until the bill is passed in its final form, we are unable to determine the materiality of the proposed changes.\n\n## Amendments to Quebec's public and private sector privacy law\n\nOn September 22, 2021, the Quebec National Assembly passed An Act to modernize legislative provisions as regards the protection of personal information , which received assent the same day. Extensive new requirements governing the collection, use and disclosure of the personal information of individuals in Quebec will be phased in over three years. The Act also creates a new enforcement regime with significant criminal fines and administrative monetary penalties for certain infractions and a private right of action with minimum statutory punitive damages. We are continuing to implement compliance for products, services and processes that are within the Act's jurisdiction, as additional guidance is issued by the Quebec government and the provincial regulator.\n\n## CRTC review of telecommunications services to the Far North\n\nOn November 2, 2020, the CRTC initiated the first phase of a review of its regulatory framework for Northwestel Inc. and the state of telecommunications services in Canada's North in Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2020-367. On January 20, 2021, a number of interveners proposed large subsidy increases to Northwestel and other companies providing service in Canada's North. On June 8, 2022, the CRTC released Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2022-147, initiating the second phase of this review, leaving open the potential for subsidy increases. A hearing was held in Whitehorse, Yukon, from April 17 to 21, 2023. The CRTC has since issued some requests for information that suggested a subsidy of up to $55 million per year, of which we would pay approximately 25%, and we have transferred incumbency in Atlin, British Columbia to Northwestel (along with associated obligations). The proceeding is now closed. A decision is expected in 2024.\n\n## Amendments to the Competition Act\n\nIn February 2022, ISED announced its intention to undertake a review of the Competition Act , beginning with immediate, targeted amendments to the Act. The targeted amendments received royal assent on June 23, 2022 and included: (i) addition of a new provision to protect workers from agreements between employers that fix wages and restrict job mobility; (ii) addition of a new provision regarding 'drip pricing' to both the civil and criminal prohibition on false or misleading representations; (iii) addition of an expanded list of factors to be considered when assessing the competitive impact of mergers, business practices and competitor collaborations; (iv) amendments to clarify an 'anti-competitive act' for abuse of dominance; (v) amendments to provide access by private parties to the Competition Tribunal if they are directly and substantially affected by the conduct of another party; and (vi) introduction of an anti-avoidance provision to the notifiable transactions provisions of the Competition Act .\n\nIn November 2022, ISED commenced a consultation seeking input on further amendments to the Competition Act . The further consultations were commenced by the issuance of a discussion paper entitled The Future of Competition Policy in Canada , released in November 2022. ISED has outlined five areas of focus for the consultation: (i) merger review; (ii) unilateral conduct;",

        "page_content": "(iii) competitor collaborations; (iv) deceptive marketing; and (v) administration and enforcement of the law. We filed comments setting out our views on these topics in response.\n\nIn December 2023, Bill C-56 received royal assent. The bill amends the Competition Act to, among other things, repeal the efficiencies defence in respect of mergers; enhance the powers of the Commissioner of Competition with respect to market studies; extend the civil competitor collaboration provisions to include certain agreements between non-competitors; and expand the abuse of dominance provisions.\n\nAlso in December 2023, the government introduced Bill C-59, which includes further amendments to the Competition Act . If passed, the Bill will, among other things, increase the rights of private parties and enhance merger enforcement powers regarding competitor collaborations and mergers.\n\n## Rogers application to attach small cell antennas to TELUS and Bell support structures\n\nOn July 4, 2023, Rogers brought an application to the CRTC alleging that TELUS and Bell have an obligation to process Rogers' applications to attach small cell antennas to support structures and that TELUS and Bell have failed to meet this obligation. We filed answers to the application on August 11, 2023. In our submission, we denied Rogers' allegations vigorously. On February 5, 2024, the CRTC denied Rogers' application. Simultaneously, the CRTC initiated a proceeding, Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2024-25, Call for comments - Attachment of wireless facilities on support structures owned or controlled by incumbent local exchange carriers (ILEC) , in order to examine the broader public policy issues before ruling on the placement of wireless facilities on ILEC-owned or -controlled support structures. Comments are to be submitted by April 5, 2024. Until the CRTC issues a determination in this proceeding, it is too early to determine its impact on us.\n\n## Proceeding regarding support structure relocation compensation\n\nOn January 16, 2023, we filed a proposed revision to our support structure tariff that allows support structure licensees to negotiate relocation terms and compensation directly with the party forcing the relocation, pursuant to the CRTC's direction in Telecom Decision CRTC 2022-311, Rogers Communications Canada Inc. and Shaw Cablesystems G.P. - Application regarding compensation for transmission line relocation in British Columbia . Concurrent with the tariff application proceeding, which included requests for information and replies to interventions, on February 28, 2023, British Columbia's Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MOTI) filed an application with the CRTC to stay the Commission's directives in the decision, as well as to review and rescind or vary the decision. We responded on March 30, 2023, asking the Commission to dismiss MOTI's review and vary application (R&V) and on May 16, 2023, the Commission denied MOTI's request for a stay of the directives but has yet to conclude on the R&V. The R&V ruling is outstanding and is not expected to be material.\n\n## Legislation to ban the use of replacement workers during strikes and lockouts\n\nIn November 2023, the federal government introduced Bill C-58, which would, in certain circumstances, and with exceptions and limitations, prohibit employers in federally regulated industries from hiring replacement workers during work stoppages related to collective bargaining. If this Bill becomes law, it could affect how we continue to provide our services during strikes or lockouts, subject to the applicability of exceptions and limitations currently included in the bill.\n\n## Broadcasting and content-related issues\n\n## Regulatory plan to modernize Canada's broadcasting system\n\nBill C-11, An Act to amend the Broadcasting Act and to make related and consequential amendments to other Acts , which brings streaming services that operate over the internet expressly within the scope of the Broadcasting Act , was passed by Parliament and received royal assent on April 27, 2023. On May 12, 2023, the CRTC issued three notices of consultation for Phase 1 of the regulatory plan, including notices of consultation concerning the contribution framework that will apply to traditional and online broadcasting undertakings, the registration of online undertakings, and a review of exemption orders and basic conditions of service that will apply to online undertakings. We have participated in all three consultations. On September 29, 2023, the CRTC released policies relating to which online undertakings are required to register with the CRTC and the conditions of service that will apply to those undertakings. We participated in the CRTC's hearing, which began on November 20, 2023, to consider the initial contribution regime that will apply to online undertakings. It is too early to determine the impact on us.\n\n## TELUS receives renewals for its broadcasting undertaking licences\n\nOn August 8, 2023, the CRTC issued administrative licence renewals for various broadcasting undertakings, including our terrestrial broadcasting distribution undertakings (BDUs) serving areas of Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec, and our terrestrial pay-per-view (PPV) service. As a result of these administrative licence renewals, our BDUs and PPV service will continue to operate under their existing conditions of licence until August 31, 2026. On November 9, 2023, the CRTC issued TELUS a licence renewal for our national video-on-demand (VOD) undertaking, for the period of January 1, 2024 to August 31, 2028.\n\n## Review of the Copyright Act and consultations on copyright reform to address specific issues\n\nThe Copyright Act 's last statutorily mandated review was launched in 2017 and resulted in reports from the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage being presented to the House of Commons in the summer of 2019. The parliamentary review led to further government consultations (described below) launched in 2021 to explore specific issues raised during the review, such as how to modernize the copyright framework for online intermediary liability, AI and IoT. The timeline for potential changes to the Copyright Act is uncertain, although the next statutorily mandated review was supposed to be launched in 2022, and it is unclear whether or how this might impact the timeline for comprehensive copyright reform legislation. In the meantime, the federal government has made smaller changes to the Copyright Act , such as the inclusion in the 2022 budget of proposed amendments to extend the term of copyright by 20 years, which was required to satisfy Canada's obligations under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement . The policy approach for copyright has traditionally been based on a balance between the rights of copyright owners and user rights, and as a result, the impact of this proceeding is not expected to be material.",

        "page_content": "On April 14, 2021, ISED announced the launch of a consultation to modernize the copyright framework for online intermediaries. The consultation builds on the work done in 2018 and 2019 as part of the parliamentary review of the Copyright Act . ISED sought comments on a broad range of issues, including the role of intermediaries in policing online copyright infringement, how to remunerate rights holders for the use of their content on online platforms, and what types of enforcement tools (such as website-blocking orders) should be available against intermediaries. We participated in this consultation and filed joint comments with other ISPs on May 31, 2021. Among other things, the comments advocated for a continuation of existing government policy that provides ISPs with unconditional safe harbour protection for the potentially infringing activities of their customers. It is too early to tell whether this consultation will have a material impact on us.\n\nOn July 19, 2021, the government announced a consultation to modernize the copyright framework applicable to AI and IoT. The government's objectives were to support innovation and investment in AI and other digital and emerging technologies, support Canada's cultural industries and preserve the incentive to create and invest provided by the economic rights set out in the Act, and support competition and marketplace needs regarding IoT devices and other softwareenabled products. We participated in this consultation and filed joint comments with other ISPs on September 17, 2021. Among other things, the joint comments advocated that no changes should be made to the Copyright Act that would unduly burden or create potential liability risks for ISPs. Similar to the broader Copyright Act review, the impact of this proceeding is not expected to be material.\n\n## Consultation on the government's proposed approach to address harmful content online\n\nOn July 29, 2021, the government launched a consultation on its proposed approach to address harmful content online. The government's proposals largely target social media and content platforms, but a few proposals would also have impacted ISPs. Accordingly, we participated in this consultation and filed joint comments with other ISPs on September 25, 2021. Among other things, the joint comments advocated that the legal framework for addressing harmful online content should not create undue obligations or liability for telecommunications carriers, and that requirements to block access to content online or to provide subscriber information should continue to require judicial orders. In March 2022, the government established an expert advisory group on online safety, with a mandate to provide the Minister of Canadian Heritage with advice on how to design the legislative and regulatory framework to address harmful content online and how to best incorporate the feedback received during the national consultation held from July to September 2021. Following the publication of the group's report, the government conducted further consultations with stakeholder groups regarding the advice it received from the expert advisory group. The government has indicated it hopes to bring forward a bill to address online harms in 2024. The impact of this consultation is not expected to be material.",

Risk oversight and management processes are integral to our risk governance and strategic planning practices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk governance, oversight and culture\n\nWe have in place robust risk governance and oversight practices, with risk oversight responsibilities outlined in the policy manual for our Board of Directors (Board). Our Board is responsible for ensuring that material risks to our business are identified, and for overseeing the implementation of systems and processes that effectively identify, monitor and manage material risks.\n\nOur risk governance culture starts with clear risk management leadership and transparent communications, supported by our Board and Executive Team. In our approach to risk governance, accountability for managing and reporting on risk exposures is clearly defined. Training and awareness programs, appropriate resources and risk champions help to ensure that we have the risk management competencies necessary to support effective decision-making across the organization. Ethics are integral to our risk governance culture, and our code of ethics and conduct directs team members to meet the highest standards of integrity in all business decisions and actions.\n\n## Responsibilities for risk management\n\nWe take a multi-level approach to managing risks, sharing responsibility across the organization and recognizing that agile and effective risk management is integral to the achievement of our strategic and operational objectives. The first line of assurance is executive and operating management, and these team members are expected to integrate risk management into core decision-making processes (including strategic planning processes) and day-to-day operations. We have risk management and compliance functions across the organization, in areas that include Finance, Legal, Data and Trust (which includes Privacy), Security and other operational business areas, and these form the second line of assurance. These teams establish policies, provide guidance and expertise, and work collaboratively with management to monitor the design and operation of controls. Internal Audit is the third line of assurance, providing independent assessments of the effectiveness and efficiency of risk management and controls across all areas of our business.\n\n## Risk and control assessment process\n\nEvents within and outside of TELUS present both risks and opportunities. We strive to avoid taking on undue risk and we work to ensure alignment of risks with business strategies, objectives, values and risk tolerances; we also seek to take advantage of opportunities that may emerge and, in so doing, we consider the impacts of our decisions on our many stakeholders. We strive to proactively mitigate our risk exposures through performance planning, operational management and risk response strategies, which can include mitigating, transferring, retaining and/or avoiding risks.",

        "page_content": "We have in place multi-level enterprise risk and control assessment processes that solicit and incorporate insights from leaders across all areas of TELUS, enabling us to track multi-year trends in key and emerging risks and our control environment. A comprehensive annual risk and control assessment is conducted with senior leaders and an annual assessment is also completed by the members of our Board, which provides a high-level perspective on key enterprise risks. Results of the assessments are shared with senior management, our Board and Audit Committee,\n\nand inform the development of our risk-focused internal audit program. These risk assessments are also incorporated into our strategic planning, operational risk management and performance management processes. In addition, key enterprise risks are reviewed with the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis in order to capture and communicate any changes, and detailed risk assessments are conducted for various risk management, strategic and operational initiatives throughout the year.\n\n## 10.2 Principal risks and opportunities\n\nThis section describes our principal risks and the related opportunities. The significance of these risks is such that they, alone or in combination, may have material impacts on our operations, results, reputation and brand, as well as the approaches taken by investment analysts when evaluating TELUS as an investment. These risks and the associated risk mitigation measures are addressed in the following sections.\n\nAlthough we believe the measures we take to identify and mitigate risks are reasonable, there can be no expectation or assurance that they will effectively mitigate or fully address the risks described, or that new developments and risk exposures will not materially affect our operations or financial results. Despite our efforts to implement controls in our domestic and international operations, there can be no assurance that these controls will prove to be effective in all instances. Forward-looking statements in this section and elsewhere in this MD&A are based on the assumption that our risk mitigation and control measures will be effective. See Caution regarding forward-looking statements . We consider our exposure to risk in four categories: strategic, operational, financial and compliance.\n\n## Strategic risks and opportunities\n\nThese strategic risks arise from uncertainties that may affect the nature and focus of our enterprise strategic objectives and our ability to sustain profitable revenue growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Risk                    | Potential impact                                                                                                                                                                                         | Mitigations                                                                                            |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Regulatory matters      | We operate in a number of highly regulated industries and are therefore subject to a wide variety  of laws and regulations domestically and internationally.

The regulatory regime sets out, among other matters, rates, terms and conditions for the provision of telecommunications services, licensing of broadcast services, licensing of spectrum and radio apparatus, and restrictions on ownership and control by non-Canadians.\n\nThe allocation and use of spectrum in Canada are governed by ISED, which establishes spectrum allocation policies, determines spectrum auction frameworks, issues licences for use and sets radio authorization conditions.\n\nCanadian ownership and control requirements, including restrictions on the ownership of the common shares of TELUS Corporation (Common Shares) by non-Canadians, are imposed by the Canadian Telecommunications Common Carrier Ownership and Control Regulations under the Telecommunications Act (collectively, the Telecommunications Regulations) and the Direction to the CRTC (Ineligibility of Non-Canadians) , as ordered by the Governor in Council pursuant to the Broadcasting Act (the Broadcasting Direction).\n\nWe have multiple businesses that, in addition to operating in Canada, also operate in other countries and jurisdictions, such as our digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International (DLCX) segment, and our TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods businesses, and must comply with the laws, regulations and decisions in all of the jurisdictions in which they operate. These jurisdictions, as well as the contracts that we enter into (particularly those of our DLCX segment and our TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods businesses), require us to comply with, or facilitate our customers' and clients' compliance with, numerous complex, rapidly changing - and sometimes conflicting - legal regimes, both domestic and international. These laws and regulations address many aspects of our business operations,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n108 \u00b7\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nincluding, but not limited to, anti-corruption measures, internal financial control and disclosure obligations, data privacy and protection, standards for wages and hours of work, employment and labour relations, trade protections and restrictions, import and export controls, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, data and transaction processing security, payment card industry data security standards, records management, user-generated content hosted on websites we operate, data residency, corporate governance, anti-trust and competition measures, team member and thirdparty complaints, telemarketing regulations, consumer telephone service regulations, nuisance and fraud call regulations, government affairs and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. Our customers and clients are also located around the world, and the laws and regulations that apply to their business operations include, among others, U.S. federal laws and regulations; state laws that apply to data privacy and protection, third-party administration services, utilization review services and telemarketing services; and state laws that apply to debt collection in the United States, collectively enforced by numerous federal and state government agencies and attorneys general; as well as similar consumer protection laws in other countries in which our subsidiaries' clients are based. Failure to provide services in a manner that complies with any such requirements could result in breaches of contracts with our subsidiaries' clients. The application of these laws and regulations to our subsidiaries' clients is often unclear, and the laws and regulations of different jurisdictions may at times conflict. The global nature of our operations adds to the difficulty of compliance. For example, business practices that are prohibited by regulations, including the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act in Canada and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States, are not uncommon in many countries, particularly in those with developing economies, where we or our subsidiaries' clients operate. We cannot provide assurance that the actions of our subsidiaries' clients or their customers will not violate our internal policies or Canadian or U.S. laws.\n\nChanges in privacy laws and regulations, both domestic and international, involve stringent requirements that can have a significant impact on our operations. Regulatory authorities may have greater enforcement powers, including the ability to impose fines, sanctions and restrictions on our operations. Canadian privacy regulators, such as the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, are placing a greater emphasis on privacy concerns in the provisions of digital health",

        "page_content": "services, secondary marketing and digital tracking. Non-compliance with these laws could result in financial penalties, reputational damage and erosion of customer trust.\n\nWe have acquired a number of businesses and entered into areas in the Canadian and global health services sector that are highly regulated and also expose us to risks related to the quality of care and provision of insured/uninsured services. The operations of our health business in Canada are subject to various federal and provincial laws and regulations, as well as policies, guidelines and directives issued by regulatory and administrative bodies, such as medical associations, provincial colleges of physicians and other associations governing the practice of health professionals (the holders of licences and permits to provide healthcare services) that we engage for the delivery of our services. In the case of virtual care, the related laws, regulations, policies, guidelines and directives are evolving and thus are subject to differences in interpretation and application, and we may not be able to enter into agreements with governments in certain provinces that will allow us to provide services on an economical basis or at all.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nSignificant regulatory developments and proceedings involving the Government of Canada and its various agencies, as well as governments and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, continued through 2023. Certain significant regulatory developments and proceedings relevant to our business and industry are highlighted in Section 9.4 . In addition, other significant developments include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- \u00b7 With the adoption of Bill 3 in April 2023, Quebec is joining other provinces and territories in establishing privacy legislation that regulates the processing of personal health information as the new law comes into force. TELUS Health may incur costs in order to ensure it meets numerous new legal obligations, notably privacy impact assessments for new projects, products and services and for transfers of health information outside of Quebec and restrictions on the use of identification, localization and profiling technologies, mobile and web applications and automated decision-making systems. TELUS Health will also have to navigate a new, prescribed consent regime heavily dependent on expressed consent in order to optimize data use.\n- \u00b7 TELUS Health reached a settlement with the British Columbia Medical Services Commission regarding our LifePlus program. This agreement establishes a clear distinction between insured and uninsured care delivery, while maintaining continuity of care for clients.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nChanges to the regulatory regime under which we operate as a telecommunications carrier in Canada, including changes to laws and regulations and ownership rules or the enactment of laws or regulations by provinces or municipalities that threaten unitary federal regulatory authority over telecommunications in Canada, could materially and adversely affect our business. These changes may increase our costs, restrict or impede the way we provide our services, limit the range of services we provide, and otherwise cause us to reduce our capital and operational expenditures, including our investments in network technologies, and alter customer perceptions of our operations. The further regulation of our broadband, mobile and other operations and any related regulatory decisions could also restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to realize on past and future investments in our network. Such changes may not be anticipated or, when they are anticipated, our assessment of their impact on us and our business operations may not prove to be accurate.\n\nOur ability to provide competitive services, including our ability to enhance our current services and offer new services on a timely basis, is also dependent on our ability to obtain access to new spectrum licences at a reasonable cost as they are made available. The revocation of, or a material limitation on obtaining, spectrum licences could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, including the quality and reliability of our network and service offerings, as well as our financial condition.\n\nGovernment or regulatory actions with respect to certain countries or suppliers may also impact us, and other Canadian telecommunications carriers generally, and may have material non-recurring incremental cost consequences for us.\n\nOverall, compliance with laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions globally may involve significant costs, consume significant time and resources or require changes in our business practices that reduce our revenue and profitability. We may also face burdensome and expensive governmental investigations or enforcement actions regarding our compliance. Non-compliance could result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our team members, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, damage to our reputation, restrictions on our ability to process information, allegations by our customers that we have not fulfilled our contractual obligations, or other unforeseen consequences. In addition, we are required under various laws to obtain and maintain accreditations, permits and/or licences for the conduct of our business in all regions in which we have operations and, in some cases, in which our customers receive our services, including Canada, the United States, Europe and Asia. If we do not maintain our accreditations, licences or other qualifications to provide our services, or if we do not adapt to changes in legislation or regulation, we may be compelled to cease operations in the relevant regions and may not be able to provide services to existing customers or attract new customers. Our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nIf Bill C-27 becomes law in its current form and is enacted by the Canadian federal government, it could materially expand prescriptive privacy requirements, significantly raise our risk profile in light of greater enforcement powers, and broaden most of the current transparency requirements and rights of access to information. The availability of implied consent and the ability to use anonymized data may also be curtailed. If Bill C-27 does not become law, Canada may not be able to maintain adequacy with European Union (EU) privacy legislation, adding to the challenges involved with cross-border transfers of personal information related to our customers, employees and suppliers between Canada and EU member states. The EU assessment of the adequacy of Canada's privacy regime is in its preliminary stages. The specific impact of the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA) component of Bill C-27 remains uncertain, given the vagueness of the provisions of the Act and the uncertainty that it will be passed in its current form. In Quebec, Law 25 continues to have an effect on many business processes and documents, imposing new obligations in relation to plain language disclosures and transparency (especially with respect to profiling technologies, automated decision systems and minors' data). The Quebec privacy regulator has released guidance on notice and consent under Law 25 and will release guidance on other interpretations in the future that may impact our operations and expose us to new risks in Quebec. Our compliance program is on track to address these impacts, and we continuously monitor the evolution of the law and regulatory guidance.",

        "page_content": "The amendments to the Competition Act made through Bill C-56, and set out in greater detail in Section 9.4 could make our business environment more challenging because they expand the civil competitor collaboration and abuse of dominance provisions, and repeal the efficiency defence in respect of mergers challenged by the Commissioner of Competition. The amendments to the Competition Act proposed in Bill C-59 could, among other things, increase the risk of litigation because they enhance the ability of private parties to seek recourse under the statute.\n\nChanges to the regulatory regimes under which we operate our health business, including enactment of laws, regulations and policies, guidelines or directives issued by regulatory and administrative bodies, such as medical associations, colleges of physicians and other associations governing health professionals, could adversely affect the reputation, brand, financial results and operations of this business. As it relates to our virtual care business, uncertainty regarding regulatory regimes and the anticipated regulatory changes that may be enacted by governments could have adverse effects on our business if they result in the revocation of, or significant limitations on, our ability to provide virtual care services to our customers and charge for the provision of those services.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe advocate at all levels of government, including: our participation in CRTC and federal government proceedings, studies, reviews and other consultations; representations before provincial and municipal governments pertaining to telecommunications issues; legal proceedings impacting our operations at all levels of the courts; and other relevant inquiries (such as those relating to the exclusive federal jurisdiction over telecommunications), as described in Section 9.4 Communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings . We also work with industry associations to promote a pragmatic and balanced approach to privacy legislation and interpretations by regulators at all levels of government that protects privacy, builds trust and supports innovation.\n\nWe will continue to monitor regulatory developments and may reconsider our investment decisions with a view to realizing an appropriate return on capital. Our risk mitigation strategies for investment decisions may include, but are not limited to, reducing capital and operational expenditures and introducing new efficiency initiatives, which could include reducing the size of our workforce.\n\nWe continue to strive to comply with all radio authorization and spectrum licence and renewal conditions, and we plan to participate in future spectrum auctions. We continue to advocate with the federal government for fair spectrum auction rules, so that companies like TELUS can bid on an equal footing with other competitors for spectrum blocks available at auction and can purchase spectrum licences offered for sale by competitors. We also continue to strongly advise that preferential treatment is not required and is not in the best interests of Canadians, especially rural Canadians. It is also not in the best interests of regional carriers, including for 5G services, most notably carriers that are currently part of established, sophisticated and well-financed cable companies.\n\nThe Canadian Telecommunications Common Carrier Ownership and Control Regulations require us to monitor and control the level of non-Canadian ownership of our Common Shares. These powers have been incorporated into our Articles and extended to ensure compliance under the Broadcasting Act .\n\nWe continue to advocate for amendments to Bill C-27 that will reduce unnecessary burdens on our operations, continue to protect the privacy of Canadians and support a positive finding on the adequacy of Canada's privacy regime by the EU in the future. We have implemented best practices and processes, such as our data enablement plan, that will facilitate compliance with privacy law reform, including record-keeping to enable us to demonstrate compliance and due diligence if necessary. With respect to AI, the uncertainty around AIDA has been partially mitigated by the introduction of the ISED voluntary Code of Conduct . Because of our proactive early preparations for the responsible management and governance of AI, TELUS was the first company in the telecommunications sector in Canada to sign the voluntary Code of Conduct. We also continue to host consultations with diverse Canadian communities to inform our practices and advocacy in the development of formal AI regulations. With respect to Quebec's Law 25, we are working to implement compliance with its provisions and we continue to monitor the evolution of the law and regulatory guidance.\n\nAs it relates to our health business, we monitor new and amended regulations, policies, guidelines and directives in order to stay ahead of, and plan for, new and evolving requirements. In addition, we have put in place internal governance to ensure oversight of clinical practice across all healthcare operations, to manage compliance with licensing requirements and contractual agreements, and to ensure quality of care. A credential verification audit of our clinical team members is conducted periodically to ensure compliance with standards, provincial professional regulatory bodies and all other relevant applicable regulations. We also advocate with the federal and provincial governments for reasonable regulations, in part by participating in market studies and other consultations. Furthermore, we continue to evaluate the current business model and strategic growth areas for our health business.\n\n## 10.4 Competitive environment\n\n## Risk category: Strategic\n\nAs the telecommunications industry continues to evolve, we have expanded our offerings beyond the delivery of voice and data services for consumer and business customers. We offer services in the areas of security and home automation, next-generation digitally-led customer experiences, healthcare, and agriculture and supply chain optimization, both inside and outside Canada (see Principal markets addressed and competition in Section 4.1 ). We face intense competition in our provision of voice and data services, as well as in all sectors of our business operations and in all geographic markets.\n\nIn the mobile market, our competitors have been employing aggressive promotional offers and device financing strategies to attract and retain customers. In the consumer market, cable companies and other competitors are offering bundled services at discounted monthly rates that include residential local and long distance voice, security solutions, internet access and mobile voice and data services. These developments are contributing to a more challenging environment for us to maintain our market share and customer base.\n\nFurthermore, some competitors have acquired broadcast content assets that are providing content for their services. As a result, we rely on these competitors as a source of content for our services.",

        "page_content": "In addition to traditional TV services, over-the-top (OTT) services such as Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Discovery+, Disney+, Netflix, Crave and YouTube, are also competing for viewership. This additional competition may lead to a higher rate of disconnection for current paid TV services and could adversely impact the growth of our subscriber base and revenue from our TV and entertainment services.\n\nIn the business market, incumbent facilities-based competitors continue to compete based on network footprint and reliability, while hyperscalers such as Microsoft (Teams, Skype) and other IP voice/collaborative service providers such as Zoom emphasize price, flexibility and convenience. These service providers do not invest in, or own, networks or other infrastructure but compete directly with video, voice and messaging services across both the consumer and business markets segment.\n\nTI competes with professional services companies that offer consulting services, information technology companies with digital capabilities, AI and data labelling service providers, and contact centre and business process outsourcing companies that are expanding their capabilities to offer higher-margin and higher-growth digital services. In addition, the continued growth and evolution of the digital services offered by TI and the markets in which it operates will also expose our subsidiary to new and different competitors, many of which may have significantly greater market recognition than TI in the markets it enters, as well as additional competition from existing competitors that are also expanding their services to include digital and AI capabilities. From time to time, clients of TI that are currently using its services may determine that they can provision these services in-house. Our client contracts typically range from three to five years and can be terminated by clients with limited notice and without penalty or termination fees, which permits clients to make service adjustments that could adversely impact our revenue. As a result, TI faces sustained competitive pressure to offer services in a manner that will be viewed by its clients as better and more cost-effective than the in-house provision of those services.\n\nTELUS Health competes with providers of employee family assistance and mental health programs, virtual and clinical care, electronic medical records (EMR) and pharmacy management products, claims adjudicators, systems integrators and other providers of health services, including those that own a vertically integrated mix of health services delivery, IT solutions and related lines of business, as well as global health services providers. With consumer-facing health products, we compete in the provision of virtual care services (with access to general practitioners, nurse practitioners, mental health therapists and dieticians through virtual consultations), preventative health services and personal emergency response services.\n\nTELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods is a global digital technology and data science business leveraging technology innovation, ingenuity and AI to optimize agricultural production and global and local food and consumer goods supply chains. While we maintain a broad solution set compared to other agriculture and consumer goods technology providers, we compete with focused software and IoT competitors, while also facing competitive pressure from recent investments by select customers in their supply chains and vertical integration.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nOn April 3, 2023, Rogers completed its acquisition of Shaw. Under the agreement, the majority of Shaw's wireless business, Freedom Mobile, was sold to Videotron. These events have significantly changed the competitive environment within the Canadian telecommunications industry.\n\nSince the close of the transaction, aggressive price competition has continued to intensify for both mobile and fixed products and services, as Rogers and Videotron attempt to gain market share. However, we continue to welcome innovation-based competition that benefits customers and we have confidence in our competitive advantages, including our diverse offerings of products and services, world-leading networks, differentiated delivery channels, customer service excellence, and the social purpose and culture of our world-class team.\n\nDue to recent regulatory intervention, the Canadian telecommunications industry is facing significant new challenges. The mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) and FTTP wholesale access regulations, as outlined in CRTC 2021-130 and CRTC 2023-56 and discussed in Section 9.4 Communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings , have the greatest and most imminent significance for our business operations. These regulations could have a substantial impact on the future of our network operations.\n\nVirtual broadcast distribution undertakings pose a threat to our TV service offerings intensifying competitive pressure, disrupting the market structure and changing consumer behaviors. Consumers now have more options to choose from, driving current TV service providers to differentiate their offerings to attract and retain customers. In addition, these platforms operate on a direct-to-consumer model, eliminating the need for an intermediate delivery channel, adversely impacting the position of current TV service providers and reducing their control over content distribution. As a result, it may become more difficult for us to protect and grow our TV subscriber base.\n\nSince the CRTC's 2020 approval of SpaceX Starlink's application to provide low-earth orbit satellite internet service to rural Canadians, competitors, such as Amazon (Kuiper Project), Lynk and Telesat, have accelerated their efforts in this space. However, many of these satellite service providers are still awaiting approval to offer their services in Canada. Our Canadian competitors have also started exploring this market, seeking to provide satellite-to-phone services in remote areas by announcing partnerships with some satellite providers.\n\nErosion of our customer base for residential voice service and the decline of higher-margin legacy voice revenues are expected to continue, due to ongoing technological substitution by mobile and voice-over-IP (VoIP) services and other competitive pressures. This decline has been partially offset by incremental growth in overall demand and migration of customers to IP-based platforms and cloud-based solutions.\n\nAs a result of the pandemic, there has been a shift from legacy operational solutions to next-generation technologies, as businesses adopted solutions that enable remote working arrangements.\n\nNon-traditional competitors such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft are entering the business market, leveraging their global scale to offer low-cost data storage and cloud computing services. In addition, rapidly evolving technologies, such as software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV), enable the layering of new services in cloud-centric solutions.\n\nIn the markets in which TI competes, competitors are actively building scale through consolidation and enhancing digital capabilities through niche acquisitions. There has also been a sustained upward trend in the rate of employee attrition and labour costs in 2023, in particular at global IT companies, with demand for skilled talent generally driving higher wages worldwide. In the markets in which TELUS Health competes, overall market trends show competitors expanding their product and service offerings with new digital solutions, as well as physical clinic",

        "page_content": "openings, partnerships and acquisitions, in order to offer clients comprehensive and integrated wellness solutions. However, we believe that our clinical and digital wellness service offerings give us a competitive advantage in these markets.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nOur customers' loyalty and their likelihood to recommend TELUS both depend on our ability to provide a customer experience that meets or exceeds their expectations, a range of relevant products and services, and reliable state-of-the-art networks.\n\nIntense competition from mobile competitors, telephony, data, IP and IT service providers and VoIP-focused competitors in both the consumer and business markets, along with various promotional offers, inclusive bundles and rate plans, has been placing more pressure on average revenue per subscriber per month (ARPU), churn rates and costs of acquisition and retention. In addition, technological substitution and technological advances across all key business and market segments have blurred the boundaries between broadcasting, internet services and telecommunications (see Section 10.5 Technology ).\n\nIf one or more regional operators, meeting the related requirements, choose to leverage the MVNO and FTTP wholesale access regulations (discussed in Section 9.4 ) in order to launch wireless or wireline services, new participants will enter the market. This will significantly transform the competitive environment and the market dynamics within the Canadian telecom industry. In addition, it is important to consider the potential impact of the wholesale rates set by the CRTC for FTTP access and the commercially negotiated rates for MVNO access. If these rates are too low, facilities-based carriers, such as TELUS, may face challenges in the timely recovery of the costs associated with investing in wireless and FTTP infrastructure. This could put pressure on in-market rates, impacting the overall profitability of our wireline and wireless lines of business.\n\nIn the short term, low-earth orbit satellite internet services may not have a significant impact on mobile network operators, as these services are primarily being offered in underserved regions. In addition, satellite internet service providers are also facing challenges in managing network resources and ensuring reliable service delivery as a result of higher infrastructure costs, regulatory barriers and spectrum constraints. However, in the long term, if these services were to become available in urban areas, our business operations could be adversely affected. Hyperscalers such as Amazon may offer bundled services, including free or below-market cost products, which could potentially erode our market share.\n\nIf TI is unable to compete successfully against companies that offer similar services, or to offer its clients a compelling alternative to the in-house provision of services, the results could include lower business volumes, higher client churn rates, service price reductions, revenue loss, pressures on recruitment and retention of team members, an increase in marketing and promotional expenses, and lower operating margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nWe also face intense competition in the provision of health, agriculture and digital technologies and services from companies that offer similar technologies and services. If we are unable to effectively differentiate our offerings in these sectors, our business operations, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows could experience materially adverse impacts, and we may not realize the benefits of the significant investments we have made in acquiring, integrating and growing businesses in these sectors.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nOur top corporate priority is putting our customers first and earning industry leadership in their likelihood to recommend. To enhance the customer experience, we continue to invest in our products and services, system and network reliability, team members, and system and process improvements, including digitization. Additionally, in our product life cycle management processes, we endeavour to add new and innovative products and services through research and development, partnerships and acquisitions, while also enhancing our current services with integrated bundled offerings and investing in customer-focused initiatives that provide more transparency and simplicity for our customers, all to differentiate ourselves from our competition. In 2023, we implemented a significant cost efficiency program across our global footprint, including TI, which involved workforce reductions, in response to the evolving regulatory, competitive and macroeconomic environment we currently face. The efficiency program is expected to meaningfully streamline our operating costs and offset competitive pressures impacting revenue.\n\nOur 4G network technology covers approximately 99% of Canada's population, which has enabled us to establish and maintain a strong position in smartphone and data device selection and expand roaming access to more than 225 global destinations. To compete effectively across all segments of the consumer markets, we offer a wide range of services through our TELUS, Koodo and Public Mobile brands. Each brand has a unique value proposition and web-based channel (see Our capabilities in Section 4.1 and Our major brands and distribution channels in Section 4.2 ). We continue to build out our 5G network across Canada, including major cities, and it now covers approximately 86% of Canada's population as at December 31, 2023. As we expand our 5G coverage, including operationalizing spectrum, we will continue to offer a network that is fast, reliable and built in full compliance with Health Canada safety guidelines, in order to provide our customers with faster speeds, higher capacity and near-instantaneous responsiveness, while also powering smarter cities, supporting the work of first responders, and transforming key verticals such as healthcare and agriculture (see Our technology, systems and properties in Section 4.2 ).\n\nWe are continuing to make significant investments in our broadband infrastructure, including connecting more homes and businesses directly to our fibre-optic network and migrating customers from copper-based to fibre-optic services. As at December 31, 2023, approximately 3.2 million households and businesses in B.C., Alberta and Eastern Quebec were connected with fibre-optic cable, providing these premises with immediate access to our fibre-optic infrastructure. This is up from approximately 3.0 million households and businesses at December 31, 2022. Our broadband investments extend the reach and functionality of our IP TV services and business and healthcare solutions (see Our technology, systems and properties in Section 4.2 ).\n\nOur IP TV and OTT multimedia initiatives (including Optik TV and Stream+) support the next generation of IP TV and, importantly, tie our OTT environment to a single platform, which allows us to be agile in the delivery of OTT services, such as Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Discovery+, Disney+, Netflix, Crave and YouTube, while also reinforcing our leadership position in Western Canada in the provision of high-definition linear channels, video-on-demand services and ultrahigh definition 4K HDR content. Our strategy is to aggregate and integrate content and applications and make them accessible for our customers' enjoyment, on a timely basis across multiple devices. We have demonstrated that it is not necessary to own content in order to make it accessible to customers on an economically attractive basis, provided there is timely and strict enforcement of the CRTC's regulatory safeguards. In addition, as more OTT service providers launch new",

It is essential for us to adapt and respond effectively to any changes in the competitive landscape that may arise from the implementation of these regulations. As such, we remain committed to safeguarding our business interests and capitalizing on emerging opportunities.\n\nWe continue to add to our capabilities in the business market through product development, acquisitions and partnerships and investments in SD-WAN, unified communications, IoT and digital services. We created GoCo, an organization that quickly became one of Canada's leading providers of some of the fastest-growing solutions in this market, such as SD-WAN and unified communications.\n\nTo meet client expectations, TI provides an experience that is not only personalized and empathetic, but also consistent and integrated across omni-channel touchpoints. To quickly capture, evaluate and adapt to customer feedback on a global scale, it has built a team with expertise in advanced analytics, AI, machine learning and data management, together with leading digital technologies. Where TI experiences pressure on its profitability as a result of a challenging competitive environment and, consequently, sees a volume decline, it actions cost efficiency efforts aimed at optimizing the alignment of its support costs with current demand to drive improvements to its bottom line. On an ongoing basis, it strives to continuously iterate and improve upon its operations to optimize the overall efficiency of its organization, enhance operating leverage and margins and better serve its clients. It has also built an agile delivery model on a global scale, with substantially all of its delivery locations connected through a carrier-grade infrastructure backed by cloud-based technologies, enabling globally distributed and virtualized teams. In 2023, TI implemented a focused review of its sales organization and strategy, with support from TELUS, to align with its established best practices. The review focused on a number of key strategic and operational improvements, including aligning TI's organizational structure and skill sets with its go-to-market strategy, looking for opportunities to improve client diversification, enhancing its revenue forecasting and reporting capabilities, implementing sales process improvements and augmenting them through the use of technology and AI and implementing practices to better leverage its customer relationships and cross-selling opportunities. In October 2023, TI announced the launch of Fuel iX, its solution incorporating GenAI to deliver end-to-end CX innovation and AI-fuelled intelligent experiences (iX). With Fuel iX, TI is providing a comprehensive suite of services, combining digital consulting, data services and analytics, web and mobile application development, and an AI-fuelled platform. The solution enables companies to overcome disjointed data and organization silos, and embeds AI in day-to-day CX operations and workflows. However, TI's primary competitive differentiator is its unique workplace culture, which makes people and a shared set of values a priority in everything it does. It continues to build on this culture of care, ensuring the full engagement of the individuals it chooses to join its team - and the clients and suppliers it chooses to work with - as it builds and runs its business. TI's focus includes organic growth, accelerating digital adoption for all solutions and service offerings, with an emphasis on collaborative innovation. It also continues to consider mergers and acquisitions, such as its acquisition of WillowTree, as described in Section 10.10 , in executing its growth strategy,\n\nadding scale and digital capabilities. In the current evolving labour market, the ability to attract and retain talent is key to operational success. It continues to adapt models and practices by assessing the regional conditions of the markets it operates in and by offering proactive compensation and talent programs.\n\nTELUS Health has continued to leverage our systems, proprietary solutions and third-party solutions to extend our growing footprint in healthcare and capture the benefits of investments in health and wellness by governments and employers. Through the launch of new services and the ongoing enhancement of our portfolio of clinical and digital health offerings, we are entering new markets and further differentiating ourselves from our competitors.\n\nTELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods has continued to help companies improve the reliability of their supply chains, protect their brands and drive efficiency and profitability. As one of the few service providers with a perspective that spans the complete value chain, we expect to be able to differentiate our offerings from those of more narrowly focused competitors.\n\nWe continue to execute our disciplined long-term strategy of investing in our growth areas and delivering on our customers first priority. We intend to continue to market and distribute innovative and differentiated services; offer bundled services across our consumer and business portfolios; invest in our extensive network and systems to support customer service; evolve technologies; invest in our distribution channels, including our digital capabilities; and acquire the use of spectrum to support the development of our service offerings and the expansion of our subscriber base, as well as to address the accelerating growth in demand for data.\n\n## 10.5 Technology\n\n## Risk category: Strategic\n\nWe are a technology-enabled company and we maintain short-term and long-term strategies to optimize our selection, costs and deployment of technology, minimize risks and uncertainties and diversify our product and service offerings. Our 5G technology, 4G LTE technology, LTE advanced (LTE-A) and TELUS PureFibre infrastructure are foundational to our future growth (see Our technology, systems and properties in Section 4.2 ).\n\nAny acceleration in the paradigm shift involving customer adoption of alternative technologies, such as video and voice OTT offerings, IP voice and collaboration services, network-as-a-service (NaaS), supported by a widely distributed and accessible Wi-Fi network, could negatively affect our revenue streams. OTT technology may also impact the business environment by enabling capabilities that in the past were associated with telecommunications service providers (e.g. cloudbased services and roaming). The proliferation of low-power wide-area (LPWA) IoT networks and services also presents challenges arising from low bandwidth usage, which may put additional pressure on our revenue streams. The implementation of low-earth orbit satellite and wireless connectivity over non-terrestrial networks will present new challenges for our product and service offerings. However, this non-terrestrial connectivity can also be leveraged in remote networks, which will generate new revenue opportunities and enhance network resiliency. In addition, we are constantly focused on advances in cybersecurity, in order to identify any opportunities they may offer.",

        "page_content": "Our open radio access network (ORAN) deployments, combined with core network and cloud-based initiatives, demonstrate our strategic intent to remain at the forefront of 5G network innovation, as well as driving long-term total cost-of-ownership benefits. The risks involved in new ORAN technology deployment are being mitigated by leveraging key strategic partnerships and by recruiting leading subject-matter experts to our development and support roles. ORAN technology is also offsetting our exposure to a significant supply chain risk associated with the traditional radio access network supplier ecosystem by expanding the pool of suppliers, offering a much wider range of choices. In addition, ORAN technology eliminates the risk associated with having to replace all radio access network components when upgrading a single component sourced from a different supplier.\n\nAs a global organization, our success relies on the effective utilization and management of advanced technologies. The rapid evolution of the technology landscape, including incremental technology sprawl and the introduction of new, non-standard technologies, presents both opportunities and risks that can significantly impact our operations, financial performance and competitive position.\n\nTI constantly strives to develop and adopt new technologies to expand its existing offerings, proactively identify new revenue streams and improve cost efficiencies in its operations, all while meeting rapidly evolving client expectations. Recent and rapid developments with respect to the popularization and commercialization of AI have created additional opportunities for and pressures on TI. These opportunities and pressures include the need to develop AI-related offerings to meet customer expectations and remain competitive, as well as the integration of AI into its business processes and tools to create cost efficiencies.\n\nTechnology risks to TELUS Health are specific to addressing data residency requirements to align with customer contractual and governmental expectations, alleviating technology debt acquired through numerous acquisitions, and bolstering our security posture through a targeted program to identify and remediate deficiencies. Technology debt includes end-of-life hardware and software, inadequate customer and team member identity capabilities, and a lack of a holistic view of our technology footprint to address business continuity, reliability and integrationspecific requirements.\n\nOur innovative TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods technology offers value chain participants with powerful solutions that leverage advanced data systems and AI to drive valuable insights at various stages of production. While we are dedicated to maintaining and expanding our product and service offerings, some solutions are still in the early stages of development and implementation, which may not effectively respond to or meet our clients' expectations. Future advancements in technologies or alternative solutions could surpass or outperform our current offerings, which may reduce our clients' interest and our ability to attract new clients.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nOver the course of 2023, we continued to make significant investments in advancing and deploying our next-generation technologies, which will support and enhance our delivery of a superior customer experience (see Our technology, systems and properties in Section 4.2 ).\n\n## Potential impact\n\nOur mobile business depends on deploying technology and maintaining sufficient access to spectrum to support the delivery of our services. Rising levels of data traffic and the rapid pace of data device innovation present challenges to providing adequate capacity and maintaining high service levels with competitive cost structures.\n\nOur growth and profitability and the diversity of our revenue sources will depend on our ability to develop and deploy new technologies that help us expand our existing offerings, as well as proactively identifying new revenue streams and driving cost efficiencies across our operations, while also meeting rapidly evolving customer expectations. We may not continue to be successful in anticipating or responding to our customers' expectations and interests when we adopt evolving technology solutions and integrate these solutions into our offerings, and we may not achieve the intended enhancements or cost reductions in our operations. New services and technologies offered by our competitors may make our service offerings uncompetitive. Failure to innovate, maintain technological advantages or respond effectively and in a timely manner to changes in technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nAny failure to refresh critical infrastructure or remain up to date with advanced new technology may cause our products, services and IT infrastructure to become obsolete, given the rapid pace of technological evolution. Emerging technologies such as AI involve uncertainties, and failure to successfully integrate these technologies may impact our competitive position, cost structure and market share.\n\nThe successful integration of new technologies and systems, whether through acquisitions or internal development, is essential to deliver reliable products and services seamlessly. Integration challenges, such as interoperability issues and inconsistent technology standards, may lead to higher IT costs, operational disruptions, customer dissatisfaction and exposure to new cybersecurity risks.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nOur ongoing investments in 4G LTE technology, including LTE-A technology and new 5G capabilities, allow us to manage new demands for data capacity by more effectively utilizing our spectrum holdings. The evolution to 5G technologies is supported by our investments in our core network, IP network and IP/fibre back-haul to cell sites, including our small-cell infrastructure, as well as our software-upgradeable radio infrastructure. The 5G expansion is expected to further increase network capacity and speed, reduce delivery costs per megabyte, deliver a superior subscriber experience, and enable innovative new applications for consumers and businesses.\n\nMobile network investments are increasingly being directed to virtualized infrastructure and cloud-native systems, which offer greater capacity for computing and storage, higher levels of resiliency and more flexible software design. Our large-scale move to national, geographically distributed private cloud-based facilities that use commercial off-the-shelf computing and storage solutions enables the deployment of broad-scale SDN and NFV technologies. This will allow us to virtualize much of our network infrastructure. The distributed smaller-scale computing power and storage deliver services faster while accommodating the need to continually scale the IP/fibre core network infrastructure.",

We have begun deploying 5G spectrum, including spectrum in the 600 MHz and 3500 MHz bands, while recently acquired spectrum in the 3800 MHz band will be vacated by its current users between 2025 and 2027. Our deployment of small-cell technology is helping us achieve a more efficient utilization of our spectrum holdings and offset any potential speed and capacity disadvantages created by 3500 MHz availability.\n\nBy leveraging our seamless global IoT connectivity across more than 200 countries and networks, we continue to add to our IoT portfolio, expanding our offerings with a wide variety of solutions that support the management of assets on the move, such as fleet telematics, and solutions that are enabling the evolution of smarter, more sustainable buildings, including security and energy management applications. We are also capitalizing on advanced self-learning technologies and automation (e.g. AI and robotic process automation), which will change the way we manage our operations and support customer experience innovation, as well as presenting new revenue opportunities. Refer to Section 10.7 Generative AI for more information. In addition, we are continuing to focus on cybersecurity solutions, recognizing that cybersecurity, as an ecosystem of technologies and processes working together, may raise the visibility of enterprise risk and inform better security decisions for organizations across Canada.\n\nOngoing investments in FTTP, along with the decommissioning of our legacy copper network within our fibre footprint, should enable cost efficiencies as we move services to a single fibre network, as well as opportunities for real estate monetization of select central offices. The transition will also support the further evolution of IP-based telephony, and as those services evolve, we continue to assess opportunities to consolidate separate technologies within a single voice service environment. The overall convergence of mobile and fixed services provides opportunities for cost savings and for the rapid development and deployment of advanced new services. To support this convergence within a common IP-based application environment, we are leveraging modular architectures, lab investments and employee trials. We are partnering with system integrators where appropriate, purchasing hardware that is common to most other North American IP-based technology deployments, and introducing virtualization and cloud-native technologies where feasible. We are also active in a number of standard-setting bodies, such as the Metro Ethernet Forum, in order to advocate for new IP infrastructure governance that leverages standardsbased functionality, which could allow us to further simplify our network.\n\nTo ensure our solutions remain innovative, competitive, reliable and secure, and align with industry standards, we maintain a comprehensive technology road map, with ongoing investments in refreshed technology, research and development, and product innovation through partnerships with select global hyperscalers. In addition, we have implemented a robust post-acquisition technology program, aligned with our technology road map, to mitigate the risks associated with technology sprawl and non-standard technologies.\n\nWe continue to focus on growing our product and service portfolios in health and agriculture and supply chain technology in sectors where TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods have leading market positions, a robust brand profile and superior product technologies.\n\n## 10.6 Security and data protection\n\n## Risk category: Strategic\n\nAs a national provider of data, information and communications services, we have a perspective extending beyond that of individual organizations. We leverage this insight and understanding to monitor and identify security-related trends as they evolve across the wider threat landscape. The risks outlined below reflect both our experience and the trends we have observed in that wider landscape.\n\nA number of our assets may be exposed to risks involving intentional threats. These include physical assets that may be vulnerable to terrorist attacks, vandalism and/or theft, including, but not limited to, cellular towers, distributive fibre and copper cable, corporate stores, network and telephone switch centres, and elements of corporate infrastructure.\n\nCyberattacks that penetrate the network security of our data centres, products and systems, or any unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, the personal information or confidential data of our customers and clients or their end customers, could have a negative impact on our brand and reputation and customer confidence, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and legal liability, as well as our financial performance. TELUS Health operates data centres and cloud infrastructure that collect and manage data on behalf of customers, including sensitive personal health information, which may move across our interconnected operational and business support systems and networks. Personal health information is known to be a prime target for these forms of attack. Breaches involving personal health information may have significant financial implications, while also damaging our reputation and the trust of our customers, and may adversely impact future health outcomes. In addition to data security risk, the use of sensitive personal information by our businesses in all jurisdictions in which we operate may expose us to the risk of non-compliance with the law where such use is unauthorized, or may compromise perceptions of our brand or ethical standards where such use is seen as inconsistent with customer expectations or social norms.\n\nA number of TI's service contracts provide for high or unlimited liability for the benefit of its clients in relation to any damages resulting from breaches of privacy or data security associated with TI's provision of services.\n\nAlthough our network security measures and our procedures for the authentication of customer credentials are designed to protect against unauthorized disclosure, alteration and destruction of, and access to, data on our networks, it is not possible for such security measures to be perfectly effective. There can be no assurance that such measures will function as expected or will be sufficient to protect our network infrastructure against specific attacks, and there can also be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent or mitigate service interruptions or other security-related incidents. All network infrastructure is vulnerable to rapidly evolving cyberattacks, and our user data and corporate systems and security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties (including malicious cyberattacks), team member error, malfeasance, internal bad actors, a combination of these, or other circumstances. A breach may allow an unauthorized party to obtain access to or exfiltrate our data or the data of our customers or clients. In addition, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our team members, users, customers or clients to install malicious software, disclose sensitive information, access credentials or take other actions that may provide access to our data or the data of our users, customers or clients.",

If an actual or perceived breach of our security measures occurs (or a breach of the security measures of a third-party vendor, customer or client that can be attributed to our failure or is perceived to be our fault), the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be negatively affected and we could lose users, customers and clients. Security breaches also expose us to risk involving loss of information, as well as class action or other litigation brought by both customers and clients and by individuals whose information may have been compromised, or to risk involving remediation costs, increased costs of security measures, loss of revenue, damage to our reputation and potential liability.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nThe cybersecurity threat landscape in 2023 has been marked by a significant increase in social engineering attacks directly targeting our team members and employees of our third-party vendors. These attacks, often perpetrated by organized cybercriminal groups, involve persuading the targeted individuals to share their access credentials, which are then used to exfiltrate data or carry out unauthorized changes in our customers' accounts. While the method is neither new nor sophisticated, the number of these attacks has been rising rapidly since mid-2022, when the trend was first identified.\n\nAnother emerging threat in 2023 involves the popularization of generative AI. As the technology becomes more sophisticated and accessible, threat actors are beginning to leverage it as a powerful new social engineering tactic to create attack campaigns that are more efficient and much harder to identify than in the past. In particular, advances in 'deep fake' videos and voice recordings generated by AI may make it more difficult for us to equip our team members to recognize them.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nPhysical security threats can expose both our team members and our infrastructure, systems and networks to the risk of significant harm, which could include personal injury, destruction of property and loss of service and/or data.\n\nAlong with the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, we and our partners may also experience malfunctions or deficiencies in software or equipment or other systems or network assets that could result in unauthorized access to, or change, loss or destruction of, our data. These malfunctions could compromise the privacy of individuals, including our customers, team members and suppliers, and could expose other sensitive information.\n\nA successful disruption of our systems, networks and infrastructure, or those of third parties, including our suppliers, vendors and partners, may prevent us from providing reliable service, impact the operations of our networks, or lead to the unauthorized interception, destruction, use or dissemination of our information or our customers' information. Such disruption, whether physical or digital, or unauthorized access to our data could cause us to lose customers or revenue, incur expenses or experience damage to our goodwill and reputation. In addition, such damages could result in costs arising from investigative efforts, replacement or restoration of assets and potential civil lawsuits or fines imposed by regulatory bodies.\n\nWhile we believe our team members receive appropriate training, if any person, including any of our team members, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches any controls or procedures with which we are required to comply in relation to a customer's data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, or if unauthorized access to or disclosure of data in our possession or control occurs, we could be exposed to significant liability. This would include liability to our customers and the clients of TI, or the customers of those clients, as a result of breaching contractual confidentiality and security provisions or permitting access to personal information protected by privacy laws, as well as liabilities and penalties in connection with any violation of applicable privacy laws or criminal prosecution. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer, client or team member data, whether through breach of computer systems, systems failure, team member negligence, fraud or misappropriation or otherwise, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers and clients and result in liability to individuals whose personal information has been compromised.\n\nSimilarly, unauthorized access to our information systems and networks, or those we develop or manage for our customers and clients, whether by our team members or third parties, could result in negative publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of customers, clients or business, class action or other litigation, costly regulatory investigations and other potential liability.\n\nOur operations, including the business operations of TI, TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods, are increasingly conducted across a wide range of locations in a number of jurisdictions. Global business activities are associated with a more complex regulatory privacy environment and an elevated exposure to compliance risk. The European Union has comprehensive data governance laws with significant enforcement powers, such as penalties based on a percentage of gross global revenues. For example, non-compliance with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation could result in a fine of up to 4% of our annual global revenues and orders requiring us to stop processing certain personal data. Other jurisdictions in which we operate may also expose us to different regulatory and liability risks related to data security issues, such as data breaches. Shifting social perceptions also increase brand risk, as customer expectations in relation to transparency and ethical practices in the management of data and personal information are heightened.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nOur security program addresses risk through a number of measures, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Security reviews of third-party connections, identifying risks and developing plans for remediation\n- \u00b7 Added security due diligence for new business acquisitions to ensure their security measures meet the standards and level of risk mitigation we have in place for our existing infrastructure and applications\n- \u00b7 Security awareness programs\n- \u00b7 Critical controls based on policies, standards and methodologies that are aligned with recognized industry frameworks and practices\n- \u00b7 Monitoring of external activities by potential attackers\n- \u00b7 Rapid security incident response\n- \u00b7 Recurring security evaluations of our higher-risk assets\n- \u00b7 Identification and regular re-evaluation of our exposure to known security risks",

Our technical capabilities help us identify security-related events, respond to potential threats and adjust our security posture appropriately. In addition, our approach to cyber-hygiene includes regular vulnerability assessments and the prioritization and remediation of any identified exposure through patching or other mechanisms. Our security office also works with law enforcement and other agencies to address ongoing threats and disruptions, and provides awareness training to our team members to help them better recognize and report threats.\n\nOur Data and Trust program addresses data privacy and data governance risks through a number of mechanisms, including:\n\n- \u00b7 The TELUS privacy commitment and code (additional information can be found at: telus.com/en/about/privacy/commitment-code )\n- \u00b7 The TELUS Health privacy commitments (additional information can be found at: telus.com/en/health/about-telus-health/privacy )\n- \u00b7 The TELUS privacy management program, which includes a framework for the identification, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of privacy risk. This framework has been made available to all of our team members, as well as our customers (additional information can be found at: telus.com/en/about/privacy/management-framework )\n- \u00b7 Our robust data governance model, which addresses the operational risks associated with the use and management of personal data, with guidance on the risks associated with data, the importance of respecting the confidential nature of customer data and the essential objective of maintaining customer trust\n- \u00b7 Our data enablement plan process and data risk management process, which supplement the existing mechanisms for the early identification, assessment, treatment and monitoring of data privacy risks. These processes are supported by a growing network of trained business data stewards deployed across our operating units. The business data stewards provide more informed practical insight and monitoring for data governance.\n\n## 10.7 Generative AI\n\n## Risk category: Strategic\n\nThe advent of widely available GenAI presents promising opportunities for more advanced automation and improved communication, but may also involve risks to our strategy, security and brand. GenAI refers to a subset of AI that is focused on the generation of new and original content, such as images, text or music, based on patterns and examples from existing data. Its deep learning algorithms generate content that has not been explicitly programmed. Other applications of machine learning that analyze big data are outside the scope of this definition; however,\n\nGenAI poses an unusual risk due to its accessibility and its rapid adoption outside of TELUS. Recent and rapid developments with respect to the popularization and commercialization of AI have created additional opportunities for and pressures on TELUS.\n\nPart of TI's business strategy for future growth is based on the assumption that a significant portion of its services will continue to be delivered through automation, including through the use of AI. It may face negative public reaction to increased automation, for example, because its use may result in the reduction of employment positions. Further, the use of AI or the other technologies by TI or by its clients could reduce the demand for many of its service offerings. This may be particularly true with respect to revenue derived from its customer experience (CX) business, which may be negatively impacted by the introduction of AI capabilities into its marketplace. TI also uses tools for content moderation that are based on machine learning and predictive analytics, which can create accuracy issues, unintended biases and discrimination outcomes that could lead to errors in content moderation decisions, which could potentially, in turn, harm TIAI and its clients' brands and otherwise adversely affect its business.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nWhile GenAI existed prior to 2023, its diversity and accessibility have grown exponentially in the past 12 months. Over that time, we have launched and frequently iterated, a secure internal GenAI tool that incorporates many compelling features and is intended to offer our team members a safe alternative to external and publicly available applications like Midjourney and ChatGPT.\n\nIn October 2023, TI launched Fuel intelligent experiences (iX), an enhanced client solution that leverages the power of GenAI to deliver innovative end-to-end customer experiences and AI-driven intelligent interactions.\n\nRefer to Regulatory matters in Section 10.3 for more information on the proposed changes to federal and provincial privacy legislation with respect to the use of AI.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nToday, organizations are being exposed to new and heightened risks arising from rapid technological advances, particularly in the realm of GenAI. GenAI can produce false or irrelevant information due to its ability to generate novel and unpredictable outputs. The utilization of GenAI also raises significant concerns related to the privacy of sensitive data, including the potential dissemination of confidential information or the misuse of personal data, as well as the generation of content that may infringe upon copyright or intellectual property rights. Any breaches of our internal data management and security measures could result in the dissemination of sensitive information, leading to reputational damage and possible legal consequences (see Section 10.18 Litigation and legal matters ).\n\nGenAI may incorporate or amplify biases that are inherent in its underlying training data. Any biases in those datasets subsequently prompt the application to produce content that is also biased. Biases inherent in training data may result in inaccurate, missing, misleading or potentially offensive content, which in turn, may give rise to risks related to our decision-making, privacy and brand.\n\nThe use of AI or other automation technologies for our TIAI business may have negative perceptions by public and private companies and related legislative efforts in economies around the world could have adverse impacts on the demand of our services.",

        "page_content": "## Mitigation\n\nAI has the potential to transform business and society, but only if stakeholders continue to have confidence in the technology and trust in its use and users. Our approach to using AI is grounded in our customers first commitment. TELUS has established a Trust Model, which advocates for the responsible use of data in a way that builds trust by creating value, promoting respect and ensuring data security. Our responsible AI program sets out principles and guidelines for the ethical and responsible development, implementation and management of AI technologies within our organization. We believe that the responsible use of AI will help us serve our customers better, and will also support a friendly future.\n\nAs a world-leading communications technology company, we have established a GenAI Board. This board provides governance and oversight for the commercialization of GenAI opportunities and fosters sustainable proficiency in GenAI across all TELUS teams. Our responsible AI program provides a framework that supports the human-centric adoption of GenAI, including adversarial testing practices and guidance on prompt engineering.\n\nWe have taken a national leadership position in responsible AI, proactively consulting with our ecosystem of stakeholders regarding the development of AI regulations. TELUS is the first company in the Canadian telecommunications industry to sign the ISED voluntary Code of Conduct , enabling us to demonstrate leading practices in our industry while formal regulations are still in development. See Section 10.3 Regulatory matters for more details.\n\nAt TI, to support changes and developments in the regulatory landscape with respect to AI, we have increased and enhanced our specialized resources to track these developments and help guide our employee training, customer communications and strategic planning. These resources focus on aligning with industry best practices and helping us keep pace with, and in some cases ahead of, regulatory requirements. Further, by keeping apprised of developments in the AI space, these resources help us to continue to innovate, support technological advantages and enable us to respond effectively and timely to changes in technology, all while keeping pace with regulatory changes. Where customers are looking to other vendors to deploy AI-based technologies, we distinguish ourselves by providing what we believe to be higher quality, more comprehensive and expertise-backed services. There is concern amongst our team members, potential candidates for employment with us, our suppliers and customers and the public in general regarding the use of AI and the potential impact its use might have on employment opportunities with TI. To counteract this, we are taking the opportunity to upskill our employees. Through this initiative, we provide our employees with more value-added and challenging work, while also offering them development opportunities, higher job satisfaction, and maintaining our caring culture.\n\n## 10.8 Climate and the environment\n\n## Risk category: Strategic\n\nOur operations, infrastructure, team members, suppliers, customers and communities are exposed to climate-related physical risks, which include extreme weather events and other natural hazards. We may also be exposed to transition risks related to climate change, such as the impact of changes in legislation or regulatory policies, or the deployment of lower-emission technology.\n\nOur data and voice communications infrastructure, including TI delivery locations in Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Americas, may be damaged or disrupted by natural disasters or extreme weather events, including those resulting from, or exacerbated by, climate change, such as earthquakes, floods, volcano eruptions, heavy rains, winter storms, extreme heat waves, tsunamis and cyclones; epidemics or pandemics; technical disruptions and infrastructure breakdowns, including damage to, or interruption of, electrical grids, transportation systems, communication systems or telecommunication cables; issues affecting information technology systems and networks; accidents and other events, such as fires and floods, as well as the failure of fire suppression and detection, heating, ventilation or air conditioning systems; or other events, such as protests, riots, labour unrest, security threats and terrorist attacks. Any of these events may lead to the disruption of information systems and telecommunications services for sustained periods, cause delays and inefficiencies in providing services to clients and potentially result in the closure of our operating sites. They also may make it difficult or impossible for team members to travel to, or work in, our business locations. Some locations may not be well-suited for our team members to work from home due to insufficient connectivity, gaps in external infrastructure or the nature of the work itself.\n\nCertain areas of our operations are subject to environmental considerations, such as the construction of telecommunications infrastructure, handling and disposing of waste, electronic waste or other residual materials, managing our water use, and responding to spills and releases. The pace at which we can reduce emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) depends on a variety of factors that can change over time. Our most significant sources of scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions include, but are not limited to, the direct and indirect supply of energy use at our owned and leased real estate properties in Canada, cell tower sites and vehicle fleets, as well as the supply of fuel to remote generator sites, which is within our operational control but involves other risks. Some areas of our operations are also subject to evolving and increasingly stringent federal, provincial and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose requirements with respect to matters such as the release of certain substances into the environment, corrective and remedial action concerning such releases, protection of sensitive ecosystems and associated wildlife habitat, and the proper handling and management of certain substances, including wastes.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nAlong with the continued and widely shared concerns regarding the effects of climate change and other environmental impacts on our business operations, there are growing expectations and evolving global regulatory regimes for the disclosure of environmental and sustainability governance, strategies, metrics and targets and risk management practices, including climaterelated scenario analysis. In its 2023 Status Report, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) stated that the number of organizations expressing support for TCFD had grown to more than 4,800 globally, and many companies had begun to implement the TCFD recommendations. With the release of this report on October 12, 2023, TCFD has fulfilled its remit and disbanded. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has asked the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation to take over the monitoring of the progress of companies' climate-related disclosures. Our disclosure aligning with these recommendations can be found in our 2023 AIF.",

        "page_content": "Potential impacts associated with low levels of non-ionizing radio frequency (RF) emissions from mobile phones and cell towers have been a matter of public concern, and we anticipate that they will continue to be a public concern as we deploy 5G network technology, with the number of small cells in our infrastructure expected to increase as we continue to upgrade our network. There have also been concerns raised regarding the lead-sheathed cables in the networks of telecommunications companies.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nEvolving public expectations and increasingly stringent laws and regulations could increase the costs of compliance, while failure to recognize and adequately respond to them could lead to penalties, regulatory scrutiny or damage to our reputation and brand. We may not be able to achieve our targets and objectives with respect to reducing GHG emissions, which may result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation. Regarding the sustainability-linked bonds we have issued to date (between 2021 and through 2023), failure to achieve our sustainability performance target - a reduction of 46% in our absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2030 from a base year of 2019 - would trigger higher interest payments associated with these bonds through an interest rate step-up.\n\nDamage or destruction that interrupts our provision of services could adversely affect our brand, our reputation and our relationships with our customers, clients, suppliers and stakeholders, and could also cause us to incur additional costs to repair or replace damaged network infrastructure, equipment or sites. Our resiliency provisions and disaster recovery plans may not be sufficient to support continuity and reliability of service during disruptions, or to limit the duration and impact of service outages. While we currently have commercial liability insurance, our insurance coverage may be insufficient or may not provide coverage at all for certain events. Furthermore, we may be unable to secure such insurance coverage at premiums acceptable to us in the future, or such insurance may become unavailable or unaffordable, as the insurance industry grapples with the impacts of climate change on its business models. Prolonged disruption of our services could also entitle our customers and clients to terminate their contracts with us or require us to pay penalties or damages. Any of the above factors may materially adversely affect our business operations, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe have established a comprehensive emergency management and business continuity program that encompasses provisions for monitoring and preparedness, as well as mitigation, response and recovery. These programs enhance the safety of our team members, minimize the potential impact of threats to our facilities, infrastructure, business operations and our brand, support the maintenance of service to our customers, and help keep our communities and first responders connected.\n\nThe Corporate Business Continuity Office convened the Emergency Management Operating Committee (EMOC) to manage the impacts of a number of events in 2023, including the Quebec and Ontario ice storms and Hurricane Lee (Eastern seaboard, including Canada), and it remained activated from May through August to respond to the unprecedented wildfire season in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and the Northwest Territories. Several other weather-related incidents, including flooding, wind storms and more regional wildfires, required enhanced preparation, monitoring and coordination, but were successfully managed by specialized operational teams without the need for an EMOC activation.\n\nNew TELUS community-based emergency management liaisons (emergency management primes) were trained and activated this year, facilitating exceptional community support and connecting with local Indigenous communities and governments, ISED, provincial emergency operations centres and evacuation centres, and communities affected by natural disasters. Teams provided technology and hardware to support emergency response with the rapid deployment of advanced temporary networks (portable cell towers) in isolated corridors, enhancing connectivity for emergency operations centres and evacuation centres. We donated essential supplies, food, disaster kits, consumables and assets where requested by our emergency management organization partners, as well as health services provided through TELUS Health.\n\nWe have continued our proactive mitigation efforts across the enterprise to address climate change-related events governed by our Climate Change Council. This forward-looking program helps prepare our teams through readiness checks and risk reviews to proactively fortify our network infrastructure and ensure operational resilience.\n\nSpecific initiatives include the launch of emergency response assets, structural mitigation, vegetation management, climate risk forecasting and mapping, and evolving standards for network build-out to address the rapidly changing environment. These efforts are ongoing, with clearly identified objectives and outcomes that extend several years into the future.\n\nWe continue to move forward on a number of projects and programs to reduce energy use the primary source of our GHG emissions - such as lighting retrofits and network equipment upgrades, along with longer-term initiatives such as our vehicle fleet electrification program, which includes a fit-for-purpose component, as well as the installation of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and real estate optimization.\n\nWe are committed to following sustainable and responsible business practices and making decisions that balance economic growth with social and environmental benefits. We have implemented award-winning sustainability and environmental governance practices and related disclosure. The review and monitoring of our approach to environmental, governance and sustainability matters is the responsibility of the Audit Committee and Corporate Governance Committee, acting on behalf of our Board of Directors. This includes our strategic plans and objectives, as well as our reporting on exposures to climate-related risks. Our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Team exercise oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities and provide approval of the overall strategic direction of our sustainability programs. Our Sustainability and Environmental Compliance team prepares quarterly reports for the Corporate Governance Committee, as well as other updates for the Board as required, on risks, targets and other key performance metrics related to climate change and the environment.\n\nDisclosure in our sustainability and ESG report and other filings contains information pertaining to the governance and management of climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nAn ISO 14001:2015 certified environmental management system is in place to identify and limit environmental impacts associated with our operations and to support compliance with regulatory requirements. The system is audited annually by a third party. We are continuing to identify new ways to reduce our environmental impact.\n\nThe federal government is responsible for establishing safe limits for human exposure to RF electromagnetic fields in Canada. We are confident that the mobile handsets and devices we sell, and our cell towers and other associated devices, comply, in all material respects, with all applicable Canadian and U.S. government safety standards. We continue to monitor",

Stakeholder engagement is also ongoing as part of the regulatory process involved in the installation of new cell towers.\n\nWe have a very small number of lead-sheathed cables, representing less than 0.3% of our remaining legacy copper network. A large percentage of lead-sheathed cables have been removed, and more will be removed as we continue to implement our copper retirement strategy. The majority of the remaining lead-sheathed cables are underground, within a contained conduit structure (vault) that is inaccessible to the public.\n\n## 10.9 Operational performance and business combination\n\n## Risk category: Strategic\n\nWe will partner, acquire and divest as necessary to accelerate the implementation of our growth strategy. In our pursuit of certain partnerships and acquisitions, we may seek opportunities to expand the scope of our existing services, add new customers or enter new markets around the world. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify suitable candidates in the future for partnerships, for strategic transactions at acceptable prices or at all, or be able to complete any such transactions.\n\nAs we implement this strategy, we continue to experience rapid growth. We have significantly expanded our operations across new business sectors and geographic markets, and our workforce has grown significantly over the past several years. We expect to develop and improve our internal systems in the locations in which we operate in order to address the anticipated ongoing growth of our business. We are also continuing to look for delivery locations, service offerings and organizations outside of our current geographic operating regions in order to minimize the risks of operating in a limited number of countries and/or to expand our capabilities and customer value propositions. To deliver on this strategy, we must effectively manage our infrastructure and the expansion of our workforce, establish additional delivery locations or hire skilled team members as and when they are required to meet the ongoing needs of our customers and clients and to maintain our current growth trajectory, and we may need to extend or improve our internal systems. We must also manage cultural differences among our team members, including workers' council and trade unions, which may heighten our exposure to the risk of employment law claims and add to the complexity of our operations. Our inability to execute our growth strategy, to ensure the continued adequacy of our current systems or to manage our expansion, capital and other resources effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nWe have assets and operations located outside of Canada and the United States. In addition, the business strategies of TI, TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods may involve further expansion or development of their business operations in Europe or in emerging market regions, including Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America. The international nature of our business operations exposes us to various economic, political and other risks associated with doing business globally.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nOver the course of 2023, we made a number of acquisitions to support our growth strategy. Please refer to Note 18 of the Consolidated financial statements for more information.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nBusiness combination transactions may add to the complexity of our corporate structure, product and service offerings, and operational systems and processes. Robust due diligence and timely post-acquisition integration are necessary to ensure we realize potential synergies and achieve strategic growth.\n\nWe may be unable to successfully identify key risks during due diligence, complete the related transaction or successfully integrate our current or future acquisitions into our operations and culture within the expected timelines, or at all. We therefore may not realize the benefits of our current or future acquisitions and may be unable to manage the associated risks. Consequently, any acquisition we complete may not deliver the long-term benefits or synergies we had anticipated, and we may not be able to develop the acquired business in the manner we had planned.\n\nThe risks associated with doing business globally - and in particularly challenging emerging markets - may impede the execution of our strategy by limiting the countries and regions in which we are able to expand. The impacts of these risks may also emerge only after we have made investments and begun preparations to provide services in a new country or region. Our exposure to such risks may cause us to incur additional costs to mitigate the potential impact of these risks on our business. As we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on the nature and extent of any such impacts and our ability to anticipate, respond to, and manage these impacts effectively. Finally, international trade and political disputes can adversely affect the operations of multinational corporations like TELUS by limiting or disrupting trade and business activity between countries or regions. For example, we may be required to limit or halt operations, terminate customer or client relationships or forgo profitable opportunities in countries which may, in the future, be subject to sanctions or other restrictions on the business activity of corporations such as TELUS, by Canadian or U.S. legislation, executive order or otherwise. Some TI clients have been targeted by, and may in the future be subject to, such sanctions. Trade disputes between countries may also lead to unexpected operating difficulties in certain countries, including heightened regulatory scrutiny, new complications involving the repatriation of funds or negative impacts on currency exchanges. All of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance, financial condition and prospects.\n\nGiven the rapid rate of technological change, we may also look to partner and invest in emerging opportunities that may not yet be completely viable and established. These investments may require large levels of initial funding and experience low levels of initial adoption, growth and returns, all of which could impact our financial position in the short term.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nTo support ongoing investment in leading-edge and innovative technology, we have diversified our approach to allow for differing levels of investment, which we determine based on the relative maturity of a technology in its life cycle, its alignment with our strategy and its linkage with our value proposition. Through TELUS Ventures, we invest in line with our commitment to help develop exciting new technologies with the potential to deliver benefits for our customers, stakeholders and shareholders while minimizing risks. In addition, we continue to engage in partnerships that",

When a larger-scale business combination is contemplated, our teams follow a wellestablished and collaborative due diligence review process, with oversight provided by our senior leadership and Board. In addition, post-acquisition plans are developed to support onboarding, engagement and cultural alignment, as well as operational integration with our risk monitoring and management practices.\n\n## 10.10 Customer service\n\n## Risk category: Operational\n\nOur customers' loyalty, their likelihood to add to the services they engage us for, and their likelihood to recommend us all depend on our ability to provide a service experience that meets or exceeds their expectations and is differentiated from our competitors. Our service delivery teams focus on operational excellence and efficiency, implementing radical simplification, investing in digitization to enhance the customer experience and becoming best-in-class solution advisors, with the objective of safely minimizing the effort involved for our customers when they interact with us. Having our DLCX segment team members assist with the provision of customer service further strengthens our ability to continue delivering exceptional customer service.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nCustomer expectations and preferences have changed as a result of the pandemic, affecting many areas of our service delivery. These include a major acceleration of our transformation into a digital-first organization and the proliferation of self-serve capabilities to help our customers. The related impacts have affected our teams around the world, requiring us to be agile in enabling team members to work with customers virtually through our virtual technician model (VTM) and do-it-yourself (DIY) capabilities.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nDelivering sub-optimal experiences when our customers engage with us for the provision of services or support may negatively impact customer satisfaction, our portfolio of brands and our ability to grow our customer base, including customers of our telecom businesses, our DLCX segment, TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods. Inadequate or inefficient customer interactions (e.g. order taking, support contact, service delivery, billing accuracy, and network and services reliability) may result in incremental customer dissatisfaction and rising churn rates. Failure to continue to execute effectively on organizational initiatives, such as our solutions advisor support, digitization and simplification, or our customers first priority, may lead to a deterioration in the customer experience we provide. Any significant or prolonged systems and service disruptions or outages may negatively impact customer satisfaction and our brands.\n\nOur corporate sustainability and social purpose initiatives are an important part of our organizational culture and are key factors in attracting and retaining customers and employees\n\nand differentiating us from our competitors. If we are unable to meet or exceed the evolving expectations of our customers in these areas or implement our ambitious corporate sustainability and social purpose initiatives on a timely basis, and communicate them to our customers effectively, our reputation may suffer, which may negatively impact our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers.\n\nOur DLCX segment has realized a significant portion of its revenue from a limited number of large clients, and we believe this will continue in the near term. Google was our DLCX segment's largest external client for the year ended December 31, 2023, which accounted for 13% of its revenue, while a leading social media company was our DLCX segment's largest external client for the year ended December 31, 2023, which accounted for approximately 11% of its revenue. Additionally, the volume of work performed for specific DLCX segment clients or the revenue that generates can vary from year to year. For example, in the second quarter of 2023, our DLCX segment experienced a reduction in service volume demand from some larger clients that was more significant than expected. In addition, several key clients also began to aggressively reduce their costs, which has resulted in delays and near-term reductions in spending commitments. Any significant reduction in, or elimination of, the volume of services our DLCX segment provides as a result of client consolidation or our removal from a key client's provider network would reduce our DLCX segment's revenue and could negatively affect our business. In addition, such consolidation may encourage clients of our DLCX segment to apply more pressure to lower the prices it charges for its solutions.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nContinued simplification and digitization, including our ongoing development of conversational interactive voice response and enhanced call-back capabilities, have improved first-time interaction experiences for our customers by reducing the number of call transfers and shortening wait times. We continue to enhance the reliability and functionality of our websites and applications, while promoting digital engagement to further simplify interactions for our customers and reduce the volume of calls related to basic transactions and other concerns.\n\nWe continue to build on our innovative capabilities to enhance our customers' experience. Harnessing the capabilities of AI, we have developed virtual conversational agents, or chatbots, that can provide automated responses to user queries, and implemented network business analytics to identify network issues, optimize performance and improve customer satisfaction. In addition, our field teams are focused on reducing the time they spend in each customer's home by retrofitting customer premises with DIY equipment and by updating our customers' understanding of billable professional services. This is in conjunction with the development of more advanced DIY installation and repair programs, as well as our VTM, which will drive further cost savings and offer more options for our customers. Our customers first commitment ensures that we consistently deliver an industry-leading customer experience, as our frontline team members provide better service and offer multiple transaction options. We prioritize first-call resolutions to resolve customers' concerns more efficiently, without the need for additional calls or service visits, enhancing both the customer experience and cost efficiency. We have worked diligently to minimize Commission for Complaints for Telecom-television Services (CCTS) by identifying patterns and providing more informed and personalized coaching to our customer experience agents, enabling them to effectively address our customers' underlying concerns.",

        "page_content": "TI was founded with an intensive focus on customer service excellence, continuous improvement and a values-driven culture with the strategic objective of better serving a growing portfolio of global clients. Through TI, customer care and business services are delivered from within a unified TELUS-wide culture by a flexible team with more than 75,000 team members in 32 countries, minimizing business disruptions. We acquired WillowTree in early 2023, which augmented the premium front-end design and build capabilities that TI offers to its clients.\n\nThrough TELUS Health, we deliver healthcare technology solutions, health and well-being services, and financial and administrative products and services to our customers. TELUS Health's employee and family assistance programs (EFAPs), which include mental health and well-being solutions, present a significant global growth opportunity that we are introducing to our customers. We have also developed a hybrid approach to the implementation of our software solutions to better facilitate the delivery of healthcare services to our customers. During 2023, 610.3 million digital health transactions (service utilization) were recorded.\n\nWe are committed to making a difference by building stronger, healthier communities, as described further in Section 3 Corporate priorities .\n\n## 10.11 Our systems and processes\n\n## Risk category: Operational\n\nWe are a key provider of essential telecommunications and security services in Canada. Through TI, we provide digital customer experience services to global brands, and through TELUS Health, we ensure optimal care is made possible by combining the power of technology and data with the provision of market-leading experiences. Within TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods, we leverage technology and data to improve the flow of information across the agricultural, food and consumer goods production industries in Canada and internationally. Our success depends on our ability to deliver reliable and continuous services to all of our customers.\n\nWe have a large number of interconnected operational and business support systems. Acquisitions and the development and launch of new services typically require significant systems development and integration efforts. If these activities are not effectively managed, they could expose us to potential cybersecurity, privacy and brand risks. As leading-edge services are introduced, they must work with next-generation systems, frameworks and IT infrastructures, while also being compatible with legacy services and support systems. In addition, our large enterprise deals may involve complex and multi-faceted customer-specific enterprise requirements. These requirements may include customized systems and reporting needs to support service delivery, which may delay or lengthen the implementation cycle and further delay revenue recognition. For TI, the contracts it enters into with its clients may have prolonged contract negotiation periods, some clients may require a pilot program or there may be prolonged ramp-up periods, which may also delay its ability to recognize revenue.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nLike other organizations, we rely on third-party cloud-based computing services to deliver our IT services through either software-as-a-service (SaaS) or infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solutions. While this can result in benefits in terms of our speed to market, reliability, performance and agility, it requires adjustments to our operations and may increase the potential for service\n\ndisruptions. Operational support processes and vendor negotiations must take into account that the delivery of hardware and software services may occur beyond our infrastructure, and therefore controls need to be incorporated into our operational support processes and tools.\n\nIn addition, we routinely have numerous integration activities, development projects and complex system and process change initiatives underway.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nOur network, technology, infrastructure, supply chains, team members and operations may be materially impacted by disruptions in the functioning of critical infrastructure due to intentional threats (see Section 10.6 Security and data protection ), labour disruptions (see Section 10.12 Our team ), climate-related risks and natural hazards or unintentional threats (see Section 10.8 Climate and the environment ), health threats (such as epidemics or pandemics), competitive threats and geopolitical pressures. Any of these risks or hazards may adversely affect our ability to deliver services to our customers and may also make it difficult or impossible for team members to travel to, or work in, our business locations. We may also be liable to our customers for any service disruption resulting from such damage or destruction. Core expertise and competencies in all areas of our organization are in high demand worldwide and our operations and continued growth depend on our ability to hire, retain and develop skilled leaders and key team members. Any of the above factors may adversely affect our business operations.\n\nAs the complexity of our systems increases, our system stability and availability may be affected. There can be no assurance that any of our proposed IT systems or process change initiatives will be implemented successfully, that they will be implemented in accordance with anticipated timelines, or that sufficient numbers of skilled team members will be available to complete such initiatives and maintain our competitive position in the marketplace. If we fail to deploy and maintain functional and reliable IT systems on a timely basis, fail to create and maintain an effective governance and operating framework to support the management of our teams, or fail to understand and streamline our numerous legacy systems and proactively meet constantly evolving business requirements, we could experience an adverse impact on our business and financial performance.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe have established a next-generation business support systems (BSS)/operational support systems (OSS) framework, based on the telecommunications industry's TeleManagement Forum standards, which separates BSS and OSS from underlying network technologies. This decouples the introduction and ongoing evolution of new network technologies from the provision of customer services, so both can evolve independently, enabling us to optimize network investments while limiting any impact on customer services. For example, we can deploy vendor technologies and SaaS and IaaS capabilities to avoid custom development where possible. We deployed this BSS/OSS framework concurrently with our fibre roll-out and legacy copper migration, and we are also using the framework for our 5G roll-out. As we make significant investments in system resiliency and network reliability in support of our ongoing customers first initiatives, the framework will allow us to refresh and extend these systems and networks independently and more rapidly than we were able to in the past.\n\nAs we added to our VPN capacity in order to ensure stability, productivity and security for team members working from home and from alternative locations, we also accelerated our timing for the purchase and deployment of a new VPN system, improving connection capacity and reliability",

        "page_content": "while enhancing security measures. To the extent possible, we equipped some of our DLCX segment customer service team members to provide remote support to its clients. In addition, the TI AI Data Solutions (TIAI) business utilizes the services of a crowdsourced provider base that is geographically dispersed in countries around the world.\n\nConsistent with best practice, we continue to invest in mitigating the risks inherent in older technology, modernizing key platforms and capabilities for greater flexibility and reliability, and securing the benefits and capabilities that cloud-based operations can provide. We continue to make progress in modernizing and improving our systems and critical applications by leveraging proven, state-of-the-art, cloud-based technologies and capabilities. We also continue to equip our teams with advanced digitization and cloud expertise and skills, so that they are able to play a leading role, today and into the future. We are leveraging our partnership with Google from 2021 through to 2031, to supplement our in-house expertise and experience as we extend the digitization of our business operations by harnessing the capabilities of Google Cloud Platform, as well as other partners and cloud-based service providers.\n\nWe have release and change management policies, processes and controls in place that are based on industry best practices. In general, we strive to ensure that system development and process changes are prioritized, and we apply a project management approach to such initiatives that includes appropriate risk identification and contingency planning, scope and change control, and resource and quality management. We conduct reasonable functional, performance and revenue assurance testing, as well as capturing and applying any lessons learned. Where a change involves major system and process conversions, we often shift our business continuity planning and emergency management operations centre to a heightened state of readiness in advance of the change.\n\nFor each new large enterprise deal, we look to leverage systems and processes developed for previous contracts while incorporating other elements as required, using a controlled methodology to draft a new custom solution and following standard industry practices for project management and systems support.\n\nWe conduct ongoing monitoring of our systems and critical applications. Risk-based disaster recovery capabilities are leveraged to help prevent outages and limit impacts on our customers and operations. In addition, enterprise-wide business continuity programs are in place to support monitoring, preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery.\n\n## 10.12 Our team\n\n## Risk category: Operational\n\nOur success depends on the well-being and engagement of our team members and their diverse abilities and experiences, as well as our ability to attract, retain and advance the skilled and talented employees upon which our service offerings depend.\n\nWe believe that our unique customers first focus and our inclusive culture have contributed to our ability to attract and retain a highly skilled, diverse, engaged and motivated workforce, which in turn has driven strong customer and client retention. It may become more difficult for us to maintain a culture that supports our success as we continue to evolve our products and services, enter new geographic and regional markets, open new delivery locations, add to our workforce\n\nand acquire new businesses. If our unique culture is not maintained, our ability to attract and retain highly skilled team members across our core verticals, as well as our customers and clients, may be negatively impacted, and our operational and financial results may be adversely affected.\n\nOur business could also be adversely affected if individuals providing their data annotation services through TIAI's crowdsourcing solutions were to be classified as employees. The classification of certain individuals who provide their services through third-party digital platforms as independent contractors is currently being challenged by legislators and government agencies in the United States and Europe, as well as many other countries in which our TIAI business relies on the services of independent contractors. Similarly, some of the healthcare practitioners who are supporting our virtual care business in TELUS Health, as well as some of the engineers who are supporting our development of technology solutions in TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods, may be classified as employees instead of independent contractors by decision-makers in certain jurisdictions. We generally believe that most of those individuals who provide their data annotation services through TIAI's crowdsourcing solutions, those healthcare practitioners who support our virtual care business and those engineers who support our development of technology solutions are independent contractors. Independent contractors can choose whether, when and where to provide services, while data annotation professionals can choose to provide services on competitors' platforms, and they use their own equipment. In the case of healthcare practitioners, they can choose to provide services in other non-virtual healthcare settings. We may not be successful in defending the independent contractor classification in the jurisdictions in which we operate or when such classification is challenged. The costs associated with defending, settling or resolving any future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) that address the independent contractor classification could be material to our business.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nPersistent global, macroeconomic, social and environmental uncertainties, as well as with internal restructuring initiatives, including efficiency programs, may raise the level of stress for our team members.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nLost work time resulting from team member illness or injury can negatively affect organizational productivity and employee benefits expense. The potential loss of key team members due to disability, attrition or retirement or difficulty in retaining skilled team members, could negatively affect our growth, business operations and profitability, as well as the experience we provide for our customers.\n\nTechnological advances are changing the skill sets needed for team member roles across our workforce, leading to increased global competition for resources.\n\nOur failure to meet our team members' evolving expectations in the areas of corporate sustainability and social purpose could impair our ability to attract and retain team members.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nOur People and Culture team drives a multi-pronged strategy to amplify the best culture for our team members that is safe, empowering and engaging. Our culture is anchored in our TELUS values. Those values have been the cornerstone of our high-performance culture, defining TELUS as both an organization and a team, and guiding our interactions with each other, our customers",

They encompass our unwavering customers first mindset, our commitment to diversity and inclusion, and our support for communities:\n\n- \u00b7 We passionately put our customers and communities first\n- \u00b7 We embrace change and innovate courageously\n- \u00b7 We grow together through spirited teamwork.\n\nOur objective is to attract, develop and retain talented employees. We achieve this objective by investing in our people throughout their careers, and by offering diverse and inclusive employment prospects and development opportunities, as well as a unique and progressive culture.\n\nTo support team members' overall well-being and achieve a positive change in absenteeism in the workplace, we take a holistic and proactive approach that involves risk prevention, early intervention, team member and family assistance, mental health training, engaging social and educational well-being initiatives, assessment and support services, disability management, and accommodation and return-to-work services. Our well-being strategy aligns with best-in-class frameworks, including the National Standard for Psychological Health and Safety, and encourages our team members to develop optimal personal health across five dimensions of well-being: physical, psychological, financial, social and environmental. To promote safe work practices, we offer training and orientation programs for team members and contractors who have access to our facilities.\n\nThrough our annual Pulsecheck engagement surveys, we continue to assess our team's health and well-being and gather their insights about our work environment. We continue to see a strong positive response to TELUS as a socially and environmentally responsible organization, and our inclusion index remains unchanged at 85%, from the previous year, further reinforcing the inclusive and welcoming culture we have created at TELUS. According to Kincentric, our survey provider, TELUS is the most engaged organization globally among organizations of our size and composition.\n\nOur collective effort to embrace ethical, transparent, inclusive and respectful behaviour helps us continue to deliver on our customers first promise, while further elevating our world-leading culture and our global leadership in social capitalism. In 2023, we continued to advance our equitable workplace culture through our multi-year diversity and inclusion (D&I) evolution strategy, which is focused on both behavioural and structural changes.\n\nWe appreciate and celebrate every team member's unique talents, voice and abilities, and we encourage them to always bring their best selves to work. As noted above, in 2023, we achieved a score of 85% on our inclusion index, an indicator of the strength of our inclusive culture - where team members experience a strong sense of connection and belonging, find opportunities to learn and grow through meaningful work and develop a strong sense of being valued for their contributions and the ability to challenge the status quo and be part of building a better future.\n\nWe continue to advance the implementation of our Indigenous Reconciliation Action Plan (IRAP) from 2021 through to 2026, remaining steadfast in our accountability and commitments to reconciliation. We believe that innovation and creativity are essential in responding to the needs of Indigenous communities. Additional information can be found at telus.com/reconciliation .\n\nWe strive to attract and retain key team members through both monetary and non-monetary approaches. Our compensation and benefits program supports our high-performance culture and is both market-driven and performance-based. Where required, we implement targeted retention solutions for employees with critical skills or talents that are scarce in the marketplace, and we have a succession planning process in place to identify top talent for senior-level positions.\n\nWe focus on and manage organizational change through a formal business transformation function that leverages the expertise, key learnings and successful practices developed in previous years during the implementation of mergers, business integrations and efficiencyrelated reorganizations.\n\nWe have a post-acquisition integration process that works with our business units and the operations they acquire, applying an integration model based on learnings from previous integrations, while also focusing on the unique attributes and workplace cultures of the acquired companies, which advances the standardization of our business processes and is intended to preserve the unique qualities of each acquired operation. In 2023, we developed a global cultural blueprint that we are planning to apply in our future acquisitions. The blueprint identifies the core characteristics of our winning culture and can be shared across our lines of business and our diverse geographic and operational locations.\n\nWith respect to collective bargaining, business unit leaders and our Labour Relations team share joint leadership accountability to ensure the financial and operational impacts of any collective agreement settlements are assessed and the outcomes are cost-effective, affordable and aligned with our strategic direction.\n\nWe continuously strive to raise the level of our team members' engagement. We believe that our strong team member engagement is driven by our focus on the customer and team member experience, our success in the marketplace and our social purpose. We continue to focus on other non-monetary factors that support team member engagement, including performance development, career opportunities, learning and development, recognition, D&I, well-being resources and programs, our leading-edge Work Styles program (enabling team members to work where, when and how they will be most effective, providing them with the flexibility to manage their professional and personal activities every day and equipping them with robust digital collaboration tools to stay connected), and our community volunteerism, including TELUS Days of Giving. Additional information on our programs can be found in our sustainability and ESG report at telus.com/sustainability .\n\n## 10.13 Suppliers\n\n## Risk category: Operational\n\nWe rely on our relationships with multiple vendors, including large suppliers such as Amazon, Apple, Cisco, Ericsson, Google, Microsoft, Nokia and Samsung, which are important in supporting our network and service evolution plans and our delivery of services to our customers. Our suppliers and vendors may experience business difficulties or privacy and/or security incidents, and may face external challenges, such as epidemics or pandemics, global supply chain shortages or shipping and port disruptions, as well as government or regulatory pressures. They may restructure their operations, be consolidated with other suppliers, discontinue or cease to provide support or updates for certain products, or sell their operations or products to other vendors. In addition, various suppliers may sell products or services directly to our customers, rather than selling those products and services through us.\n\nIn certain cases, the number of suppliers of a product, service or technology that we use is limited. In addition, government or regulatory actions with respect to certain countries or suppliers may affect our relationship with certain vendors and our future use of their products and services.",

        "page_content": "## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nThe constraints on international shipping caused by the pandemic have been alleviated, with capacity and availability returning to pre-pandemic levels. Most freight surcharges have been eliminated, although base pricing remains elevated. The widely reported global supply chain shortages have had a notable impact on technology products, which began with a shortage of silicon wafers and extended to the chipsets and circuit boards that are embedded in almost all of the products that we purchase. While these shortages have become less pronounced during 2023 and some products are now available with pre-pandemic lead times, the availability of some others is still limited, with lead times that are twice as long as previously. While most of the combined logistical and supply chain challenges have been remedied, the extent to which they will continue to adversely impact our operations and financial performance is uncertain.\n\nAs part of our ongoing 5G network build, we have also chosen to replace many Huawei products in other layers of our network with enhanced equipment from the suppliers of our 5G network (either Ericsson, Nokia or Samsung). During the transition phase, from 2022 through to June 2024, components removed from the network will be used as replacements, as required, thus ensuring a continuous supply of necessary materials.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nOur agility in the delivery of products and services is directly linked to our ability to engage or replace a supplier or vendor on a timely basis and without incurring additional cost. Reliance on certain manufacturers may reinforce their market power and adversely affect our ability to purchase certain products at an affordable price. Consequently, the success of upgrades and the evolution of technology that we offer our customers may be impacted, as well as the cost of acquisition or the time required to deploy certain technologies and systems (see Section 10.5 Technology for further details).\n\nThere is no guarantee that our vendor strategies and agreements will not be impacted by operational difficulties or government/regulatory pressures experienced by vendors, or that we will not incur additional costs or delays in the provision of our services or in the deployment of our technologies and systems.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe value our relationships with our suppliers because they help us achieve our business objectives and contribute to our success. We work closely with key strategic suppliers to ensure appropriate timing in the manufacturing, delivery and warehousing of their products, so that our needs can be met regardless of changing conditions. We strive to direct our business to suppliers that have demonstrated a strong commitment to sustainable development by adopting ethical, labour, health and safety, and environmental principles and compliance practices that align with our expectations and support the well-being of their employees, contractors and communities.\n\nOur supply operations, in collaboration with our product development and marketing teams, develop long-term forecasts and adjust purchase order quantities to support our fulfillment capabilities in the context of longer lead times. In addition, we continue to seek alternative devices or sources of supply, and where possible, we refurbish certain devices and certify them for resale as pre-owned devices, including smartphones from our Bring-it-Back program and our professional device repair businesses, such as Mobile Klinik and uBreakiFix, to support sustainability.\n\nAs a leading network aggregator, we partner with several network equipment suppliers and work with numerous international and domestic vendors to deliver the best possible experience for our customers across our lines of business. We consider possible vendor strategies and/or restructuring outcomes when planning for our future growth, as well as the support and maintenance of our existing equipment and services. We have reasonable contingency plans that address various scenarios, including working with multiple vendors, maintaining reliable ongoing vendor relationships with periodic reviews of vendor performance, and working closely with other product and service users to influence vendors' product or service development plans. With the current international focus on telecom suppliers, our business continuity plans have been formalized to ensure availability of supply in compliance with U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) Entity List restrictions. For our 5G network build, we entered into partnerships with Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung, consistent with our multi-vendor strategy of limiting the risk that single-vendor dependence may lead to a single point of failure, which could be triggered by adverse economic conditions, geopolitical tensions, natural disasters or other significant events or developments.\n\nIn addition, we regularly monitor the risk profiles of our key vendors and review the applicable terms and conditions of our agreements to determine whether additional contractual safeguards are required. We also promote our supplier code of conduct, which is based on generally accepted standards of ethical business conduct.\n\nIn order to offset the risks associated with a dominant supplier's market power, we offer and promote alternative devices, providing more choices for consumers and helping us limit our reliance on a few key suppliers.\n\nAdditional information on supply chain sustainability can be found in our sustainability and ESG report at telus.com/sustainability .\n\n## 10.14 Real estate matters\n\n## Risk category: Operational\n\nOur real estate properties (owned or leased) include administrative office spaces and mixed-use office, commercial and residential properties, all of which may be developed through joint ventures, as well as work centres, spaces for the location of our telecommunications equipment and other real estate development projects that advance our social purpose. Some buildings are constructed on leasehold land, and the majority of wireless radio antennae are located either on towers situated on lands that we hold under leases, or on buildings that are held under leases or licences with varying terms. We are currently participating in real estate joint ventures focused on the strategic redevelopment and monetization of our surplus real estate holdings (see Section 7.11 for further information).\n\nInvestments in real estate property development, including return on investment and the realization of related benefits, may be impacted by local economic conditions, changes in construction costs and timelines, financing costs and partnership agreements. Our current and future investments in real estate may also continue to experience the effects of the pandemic, and we are monitoring the evolving return-to-office models.",

There can be no assurance that future real estate developments will be completed on budget or on time or will obtain lease commitments as planned. Accordingly, we are exposed to the risk of loss in relation to our loans and investments should the business plan of a real estate development project not be successfully realized.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nFor our construction projects (residential and commercial) in progress, our exposure to the risk of budget overruns is limited by fixed-price supply contracts and expert project management oversight. Costs for the real estate projects are monitored through our capital gating and approval processes, and we plan to mitigate any risks related to leasing vacant space by entering into prelease agreements with prospective tenants prior to completion of construction.\n\nOn new projects, joint venture partners and developers are compensated in part on a performance basis that encourages projects to meet timing and budget objectives, and we engage independent third-party consultants to verify key assumptions such as market rental rates, construction costs and management expenditures. We also rely on our internal and external legal teams to ensure that the terms of any contracts, partnerships and procurement arrangements with third parties represent our interests.\n\nWe plan our lease strategy in advance for properties that we do not directly own, including quarterly reviews of current market demand and requirements, as well as any related exposure to lease expiry risk, rental rate risk, landlord risk and physical risk (such as poor building condition or flooding).\n\n## 10.15 Financing, debt and dividends\n\n## Risk category: Financial\n\nRisk factors, such as fluctuations in capital markets, the economic environment or regulatory requirements pertaining to bank capitalization, lending activity or changes in the number of Canadian chartered banks, may impact the availability of capital and the cost of capital for investment-grade corporate issuers, including us.\n\nThe market price of our Common Shares may be affected by various factors, such as TELUS Corporation's continued access to bank credit facilities, securitization programs and public debt markets, as well as the continuation of the dividend growth plan outlined in our multi-year objectives.\n\nThe market price may also be affected by TI factors, including, but not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 The market price of TI subordinate voting shares\n- \u00b7 TI's access to banks, investors and public markets\n- \u00b7 Actions taken or statements made by TELUS, TI or others concerning our relationship with TI\n- \u00b7 Changes to TI's financial and operational guidance\n- \u00b7 Factors affecting the operating performance of TI, which may impact TI's financial performance and subsequently our financial performance.\n\nOur financial instruments, and the nature of the credit risks, liquidity risks and market risks to which they may be subject, are described in Section 7.9 Financial instruments, commitments and contingent liabilities .\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nAt December 31, 2023, our senior unsecured debt was approximately $22.8 billion (see Section 4.3 ). We operate a commercial paper program (maximum of US$1.5 billion) that currently provides access to funding at a cost lower than our revolving credit facility. As at December 31, 2023, we had $1.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was denominated in U.S. dollars (US$0.8 billion). When we issue commercial paper, it must be refinanced on an ongoing basis in order to realize the cost savings relative to borrowing on the $2.75 billion credit facility.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nOur business plans and growth could be negatively affected if current financing is not sufficient to cover funding requirements. External capital market conditions could potentially affect our ability to make strategic investments or meet ongoing capital funding requirements, and may prohibit the roll-over of commercial paper at current rates.\n\nThere can be no assurance that we will maintain or improve our current credit ratings. Given the cash demands of the 3800 MHz spectrum auction held in 2023 and the upcoming millimeter wave spectrum auction, we may be unable to lower our net debt to EBITDA ratio to our objective range in the medium term, which could eventually have a negative impact on our credit ratings. In addition, our cost of capital could increase and our access to capital could be affected by a reduction in the credit ratings of TELUS and/or TELUS Communications Inc. (TCI). A reduction in our ratings from the current investment grade could result in an increase in our cost of capital.\n\nWhile future free cash flows and sources of capital are expected to be sufficient to meet current requirements, our intention to return capital to shareholders could constrain our ability to invest in our operations for future growth.",

We have a shelf prospectus in effect until September 2024, under which we can offer an unlimited amount of securities qualified thereunder in Canada and up to $3.5 billion of securities qualified thereunder in the United States as of the date of this MD&A. We believe that our investment-grade credit ratings, coupled with our efforts to maintain constructive relationships with banks, investors and credit rating agencies, continue to provide reasonable access to capital markets.\n\nTo enable us to meet our financial objective of generally maintaining $1.0 billion of available liquidity, we have a $2.75 billion credit facility that expires on July 14, 2028, as well as availability under other bank credit facilities (see Section 7.6 Credit facilities ). At December 31, 2023, we had an unsecured non-revolving $1.1 billion bank credit facility, maturing July 9, 2024, with a syndicate of financial institutions, which is to be used for general corporate purposes. In addition, our TCI subsidiary has an agreement with an arm's-length securitization trust, ending December 31, 2024, under which it is able to sell an interest in certain of its trade receivables up to a maximum of $600 million, of which $500 million was available at December 31, 2023 (see Section 7.7 Sale of trade receivables ).\n\nWe successfully completed a number of debt transactions in 2022 and 2023 (see Section 7.4 ). Additionally, our TELUS Corporation senior notes have a laddered maturity schedule, including $1.1 billion maturing in April 2024 and $800 million maturing in January 2025. Foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are used to manage currency risk arising from the issuance of commercial paper and substantially all long-term, fixed-term debt denominated in U.S. dollars. Our commercial paper program is fully backstopped by our $2.75 billion credit facility.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, TI had a credit facility consisting of US$800 million of revolving components and US$1.2 billion of amortizing term loan components. For further details on the TI credit facility, see Section 7.6 Credit facilities .\n\nWe manage our financial capital structure and adjust it in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of our business. We have financial policies in place that are reviewed annually and are intended to help maintain our existing investment-grade credit ratings. All credit rating agencies currently have ratings that are in line with this target. Access to our $2.75 billion credit facility would be maintained, even if our ratings were reduced to below investment grade.\n\nFunding for future spectrum licence purchases, defined benefit pension plan obligations and any increases in corporate income tax rates will reduce the after-tax cash flow otherwise available to return to our shareholders. Should actual results differ from our expectations, there can be no assurance that we will not change our financing plans, including our intention to pay dividends according to our payout policy guidelines and to maintain our multi-year dividend growth program. No shares were purchased under the normal course issuer bid (NCIB) program approved in June 2022, which concluded on June 5, 2023. For further details on our multi-year dividend growth program and NCIB program, see Section 4.3 Liquidity and capital resources .\n\nOur Board of Directors reviews and approves the declaration of a dividend each quarter, and the amount of the dividend, based on a number of factors, including our financial position and outlook. This assessment is subject to various assumptions and the impact of various risks and uncertainties, including those described here in Section 10 .\n\n## 10.16 Tax matters\n\n## Risk category: Financial\n\nWe collect and pay significant amounts of indirect taxes, such as goods and services taxes, harmonized sales taxes, provincial sales taxes, sales and use taxes and value-added taxes, to various tax authorities. As our operations are complex and the related tax interpretations, regulations, legislation and jurisprudence that pertain to our activities are subject to continual change and evolving interpretation, the final determination of the taxation of many transactions is uncertain. Moreover, the implementation of measures that are compliant with new legislation has its own complexities, including those of execution where multiple systems are involved, and the interpretation of new rules as they apply to specific transactions, products and services.\n\nTELUS, along with TI, TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods, operates in a number of foreign jurisdictions, including Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Costa Rica, Czechia, Denmark, El Salvador, Finland, France, Germany, Guatemala, Hungary, India, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, Mexico, Morocco, Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States, which increases our exposure to multiple forms of taxation. Generally, each jurisdiction has certain peculiarities in the forms of taxation imposed (e.g. value-added tax, gross receipts tax, stamp and transfer tax, and income tax), and differences in the applicable tax base and tax rates, legislation and tax treaties, as well as currency and language differences. In addition, the telecommunications industry faces unique issues that lead to uncertainty in the application of tax laws and the division of tax between domestic and foreign jurisdictions.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nGlobal and local tax policies are subject to continual change, which increases the complexity of taxation.\n\nIn 2021, Canada, together with approximately 140 other countries comprising the OECD/G20 inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), approved in principle model global anti-base erosion rules. These new rules introduced a form of 15% global minimum tax, otherwise known as Pillar Two, which is now being implemented and will apply to multinational companies in 2024. Similar proposals were introduced by the European Commission in December 2021. In August 2022, the President of the United States signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act , a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax starting in 2023. These policies, together with related changes to domestic laws and tax treaties, may result in an increase to our effective tax rate in certain jurisdictions.",

        "page_content": "## Potential impact\n\nWe are subject to the risk that income and indirect tax amounts, including tax expense, may be materially different than anticipated, and that a general tendency by domestic and foreign tax collection authorities to adopt more stringent interpretations and aggressive auditing practices could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe have significant current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax expenses and cash tax payments. Income tax amounts are based on our estimates, applying accounting principles that recognize the benefit of income tax positions only when it is more likely than not that the ultimate determination of the tax treatment of a position will result in the related benefit being realized. The assessment of the likelihood and amount of income tax benefits, as well as the timing of realization of such amounts, can materially affect the determination of net income or cash flows. We expect the income taxes calculated at applicable statutory rates to range between 24.5 to 25.1% in 2024 (compared to 23.5% in 2023). These expectations can change as a result of changes in interpretations, regulations, legislation or jurisprudence.\n\nThe timing of the monetization of deferred income tax amounts is uncertain, as it is dependent upon our future earnings and other events. The amounts of deferred income tax liabilities are also uncertain, as the amounts are based on substantively enacted future income tax rates that were in effect at the time of deferral, which can be changed by tax authorities. As well, the amounts of cash tax payments and current and deferred income tax liabilities are also based on an anticipated mix of revenues among the jurisdictions in which we operate, which is also subject to change.\n\nThe audit and review activities of tax authorities affect the ultimate determination of the actual amounts of indirect taxes payable or receivable, income taxes payable or receivable, deferred income tax liabilities, taxes on certain items included within capital and income tax expense. Therefore, there can be no assurance that taxes will be payable as anticipated and/or that the amount and timing of receipt or use of the tax-related assets will be as currently expected.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe follow a comprehensive tax strategy that has been adopted by our Board of Directors. This strategy sets out the principles underlying and guiding the roles of team members, their responsibilities and personal conduct, the method of conducting business in relation to tax law and the approaches to working relationships with external tax authorities and external advisors. This strategy recognizes the requirement to comply with all relevant tax laws. The components necessary to manage tax risk are outlined in the strategy.\n\nIn giving effect to this strategy, we maintain an internal Taxation department composed of professionals who stay current on domestic and foreign tax obligations, supplemented where appropriate with external advisors. This team reviews systems and process changes for compliance with applicable domestic and international taxation laws and regulations. Its members are also responsible for the specialized accounting required for income taxes.\n\nMaterial transactions are reviewed by our Taxation department so that transactions of an unusual or non-recurring nature are assessed from multiple risk-based perspectives. As a matter of regular practice, large transactions are reviewed by external tax advisors, while other thirdparty advisors may also be engaged to express their views as to the potential for tax liability. We continue to review and monitor our activities, so that we can take action to comply with any related regulatory, legal and tax obligations. In some cases, we also engage external advisors\n\nto review our systems and processes for tax-related compliance. The advice provided and tax returns prepared by such advisors and counsel are reviewed for reasonableness by our Taxation department.\n\n## 10.17 The economy\n\n## Risk category: Financial\n\nOur business operations are impacted by broad economic conditions. Unfavourable economic conditions, such as a recession, an economic slowdown, or rising rates of inflation in the markets in which we operate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. It is difficult to predict the impact that these factors may have on our business operations in the future. Inflation-related impacts were evident in 2023, but the duration and future impacts of current inflationary pressures remain unknown.\n\nThe Canadian economy faces notable risks, encompassing oil price fluctuations, potential interest rate hikes, escalating levels of consumer and mortgage debt, a surge in inflation, immigration levels, housing market volatility, and uncertainties linked to trade issues, including persistent tariffs, supply chain disruptions and the impacts of climate change. Furthermore, as we extend our global footprint through acquisitions, exemplified by those within our TI, TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods businesses, our exposure to global market conditions becomes more significant. Simultaneously, international trade conflicts and geopolitical conflicts, as well as other economic and political uncertainties beyond Canada's borders, could have global repercussions, given the notable integration of supply chains.\n\nOur ability to successfully implement cost reduction initiatives and realize planned savings, net of restructuring and other costs, may affect our business operations and customer experiences. Those initiatives include, but are not limited to, our operating efficiency and effectiveness program to drive improvements in financial results, business integrations, business product simplification, business process automation and outsourcing, offshoring and reorganizations, as well as procurement initiatives.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nIn 2023, both the Canadian economy and the global economy proved resilient despite challenges from rising inflation, higher interest rates and the conflicts occurring between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East. Central banks have raised interest rates on several occasions throughout 2023 in an attempt to slow inflation but the economic impacts are not yet measurable because of the time lag between interest rate increases and the effects they have on interest rate-sensitive sectors in the economy. Higher interest rates may impact the housing market and the economy more broadly as households cut back on spending in order to manage higher debt service costs. As inflationary pressures persist, the input costs of goods and labour are increasing, which may impact margins and overall profitability.\n\nInterest rates are anticipated to be stable in 2024 and possibly decline as the impacts of past rate increases continue to work their way through the economy and slow demand and inflation. There continues to be a risk that the Canadian economy and the global economy may slide into recession.",

        "page_content": "## Potential impact\n\nEconomic uncertainty may cause consumers and business customers to reduce or delay discretionary spending, impacting new service purchases or volumes of use, and consider substitution by lower-priced alternatives.\n\nGlobally, some countries may require financial support, sovereign credit ratings may continue to decline, and there may be a default on the sovereign debt obligations of certain countries. Any of these economic outcomes may increase the cost of borrowing and cause our access to credit to become more limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, financial performance and cash flows. Economic and political uncertainty could undermine business confidence. Unfavourable economic conditions could cause our business clients to reduce, defer or eliminate spending on our services in order to reduce their operating costs.\n\nFluctuations in the Canadian economy could adversely impact growth in our revenue, profitability and free cash flow, and could potentially require us to record impairments in the carrying values of our assets, including, but not limited to, our intangible assets with indefinite lives (spectrum licences and goodwill). Impairments in the carrying values of our assets would result in a charge to earnings and a reduction in owners' equity, but would not affect cash flow. Continued inflationary pressures could lead to increases in input costs such as labour, which may not be offset by revenue growth and may impact margins. In addition, ongoing international supply chain disruptions may make it difficult to source key components (such as handsets) in sufficient quantities and at reasonable prices.\n\nFluctuations in the global economy could affect different industry verticals in different ways. Counter-cyclical industries such as consumer goods, utilities and healthcare would continue to operate. Specifically in healthcare, products and services related to logistics or vaccines should remain buoyant, and hospitals and healthcare providers in certain countries could also perform well.\n\nBecause certain acquisitions, operating costs and revenues, including TI's revenues, are denominated in U.S. dollars or other non-Canadian dollar currencies, fluctuations in the Canadian dollar exchange rate may impact our financial and operating results.\n\nEconomic and capital market fluctuations could also adversely affect the investment performance, funding and expense associated with our defined benefit pension plans, as obligations are based on specific actuarial assumptions related to expected plan asset returns, salary escalation, life expectancy, the performance of financial markets and future interest rates.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWhile economic risks cannot be completely mitigated, our top priority of putting customers first and pursuing global leadership in the likelihood of our customers recommending our products, services and people also supports our efforts to acquire and retain customers in every phase of the economic cycle, including periods of high volatility. The performance of our telecommunications services is resilient during recessionary periods, which allows us to navigate through changing market dynamics. We also continue to pursue cost reduction and efficiency initiatives across our business operations, such as labour arbitrage through our DLCX segment. See Section 4.3 Liquidity and capital resources for our capital structure financial policies and plans.\n\nForeign currency forward contracts and currency options are leveraged to fix the exchange rates on U.S. dollar-denominated transactions, commitments, commercial paper and U.S. Dollar Notes in order to mitigate risks related to exchange rate fluctuations, and we seek to mitigate\n\npension risk through the application of policies and procedures for managing exposure to investment risk and through ongoing monitoring of our funding position. Our best estimate of cash contributions to our registered defined benefit pension plans in 2024 is $10 million ($19 million in 2023). Virtual power purchase agreements with renewable energy projects that develop solar and wind power facilities are being leveraged to manage our exposure to electrical power purchase price risk.\n\n## 10.18 Litigation and legal matters\n\n## Risk category: Compliance\n\nGiven the size of our organization, investigations, claims and lawsuits seeking damages and other relief are regularly threatened or pending against us. The continued expansion of our product and service offerings in managed services, security, healthcare, and agriculture and supply chain technology, as well as the initial public offering of subordinate voting shares by TI in February 2021, have added to our compliance requirements and increased our exposure to the risk of litigation and the possibility of damages, sanctions and fines. We may also be the target of class actions due to our millions of customer relationships. In addition, like other public companies, we may be subject to civil liability for misrepresentations in written disclosure and oral statements, and liability for fraud and market manipulation.\n\nThe intellectual property and proprietary rights of owners and developers of hardware, software, business processes and other technologies may be protected under statute, such as patent, copyright and industrial design legislation, or under common law, such as trade secrets. Significant damages may be awarded in intellectual property infringement claims and defendants may incur significant costs to defend or settle such claims.\n\nPotentially material certified and uncertified class actions, intellectual property litigation and other claims against us are detailed in Note 29(a) of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nWith business operations in a number of jurisdictions, we are required to comply not only with Canadian laws and regulations, but also with local laws and regulations in other jurisdictions. These laws and regulations may differ substantially from Canadian laws and add to our regulatory, legal and tax exposures. We continue to extend our business operations into additional jurisdictions and expand our product and service offerings in such jurisdictions, and this may increase our exposure to regulatory, legal and tax risks, including potentially substantial fines and penalties (e.g. 4% of global revenues under EU data protection laws). In certain cases, laws with extraterritorial application may also impose obligations on us. See Section 10.3 Regulatory matters .\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nWith the growth and development of technology-based industries, the value of intellectual property and proprietary rights has increased. Trends in awards for damages, costs to defend and the likelihood of settlements may encourage property rights holders to aggressively pursue infringement claims. Given the vast array of technologies and systems that we use to deliver products and services, and the rapid change and complexity characteristic of such technologies, the number of disputes over intellectual property and proprietary rights can reasonably be expected to increase.",

        "page_content": "In Canada, the proposed Bill C-27 Digital Charter Implementation Act , contains a private right of action that, if it becomes law, could add to the risk of litigation and class actions. The Province of Quebec has made amendments to the Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector , as noted in Section 10.3 . The majority of these amendments have been in effect as of September 2023.\n\nAs set out in Section 9.4 , Bill C-56 amended the Competition Act to, among other things, repeal the efficiencies defence in respect of mergers; enhance the powers of the Commissioner of Competition with respect to market studies; extend the civil competitor collaboration provisions to include certain agreements between non-competitors; and expand the abuse of dominance provisions. Bill C-59, which was introduced in December 2023 but has not yet passed, would further amend the Competition Act to, among other things, increase the rights of private parties and enhance merger enforcement powers regarding competitor collaborations and mergers.\n\nThe EU Commission announced the adoption of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) in April 2021 and July 2023, respectively, both of which are aligned with the commitment made under the European Green Deal. We may be subject to these EU standards and requirements for sustainability reporting in the future. In September 2023, California passed two Senate bills requiring climate-related disclosures, including S.B. 253 the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (U.S.) and S.B. 261 the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act (U.S.), which we may also be subject to in the future.\n\nAs we extend our offerings in agriculture and supply chain technology (such as animal health and management) and add to the jurisdictions in which we offer them, we also increase our exposure to litigation risks in the event of data and security breaches.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nIt is not currently possible to predict the outcome of such legal matters due to various factors, including: the preliminary nature of some claims; uncertain damage theories and demands; incomplete factual records; the uncertain nature of legal theories and procedures and their resolution by the courts, at both the trial and appellate levels; and the unpredictable nature of opposing parties and their demands.\n\nWe are typically required to process, and sometimes collect and/or store sensitive data, including, but not limited to, personal data regulated by data protection and privacy legislation, where applicable, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU and U.K.), the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and proposed Bill C-27 (Canada), and the California Consumer Privacy Act , California Invasion of Privacy Act , Personal Data Protection\n\nBill of 2018 and Data Privacy Act of 2012 (U.S.). The adoption and enforcement by governments of increasingly stringent privacy legislation may increase our exposure to risks related to compliance and liability. A successful class action lawsuit or intellectual property infringement claim, by its nature, could result in an award of sizeable damages that could negatively affect a defendant's financial or operating results.\n\nThere can be no assurance that our financial or operating results will not be negatively impacted by any of these factors.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe believe that we have in place reasonable policies, controls, processes and contractual arrangements, as well as insurance coverage, all of which are intended to support compliance and reduce our exposure to any related risks. Our designated Chief Legal Officer is responsible for ensuring that we have in place appropriate processes and controls across the enterprise in order to facilitate legal compliance, and for reporting on compliance to the Audit Committee.\n\nOur team of internal and external legal professionals advise on and manage risks related to claims and possible claims, vigorously defend class actions and other claims, pursue settlements in appropriate cases, regularly assess our business practices, and monitor legal developments that may impact risk. They seek and obtain contractual protections consistent with standard industry practices to help mitigate the risks of intellectual property infringements, and they work to protect our intellectual property rights through litigation and other means.\n\nOur corporate disclosure policy restricts disclosure by team members, defines the role of Company spokesperson, provides a protocol for communicating with investment analysts, investors and others, and outlines our communications approach.\n\nWe rely on our team members, officers, Board of Directors, key suppliers and other business partners to demonstrate behaviour consistent with applicable legal and ethical standards in all jurisdictions within which we operate. We have an anti-bribery and corruption policy, a comprehensive code of ethics and conduct for our team members and the members of our Board, and mandatory annual integrity training for all team members and identified contractors.\n\nSubject to the foregoing limitations, management is of the opinion, based upon legal assessments and the information presently available, that it is unlikely that any liability related to existing investigations, claims and lawsuits, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, would have a material effect on our financial position and the results of our operations, excepting the items disclosed herein and in Note 29(a) of the Consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## 11 Definitions and reconciliations\n\n## 11.1 Non-GAAP and other specified financial measures\n\nWe have issued guidance on and report certain non-GAAP measures that are used to evaluate the performance of TELUS, as well as to determine compliance with debt covenants and to manage our capital structure. As non-GAAP measures generally do not have a standardized meaning, they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. For certain financial metrics, there are definitional differences between TELUS and TELUS International reporting. These differences largely arise from TELUS International adopting definitions consistent with practice in its industry. Securities regulations require such measures to be clearly defined, qualified and reconciled with their nearest GAAP measure. Certain of the metrics do not have generally accepted industry definitions.\n\nAdjusted Net income and adjusted basic earnings per share (EPS): These are non-GAAP measures that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS-IASB and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Adjusted Net income excludes the effects of restructuring and other costs, income tax-related adjustments, other equity (income) losses related to real estate joint ventures, long-term debt prepayment premium, unrealized changes in virtual power purchase agreements forward element, and other adjustments (identified in the following tables). Adjusted basic EPS is calculated as adjusted net income divided by the basic weighted-average number of Common Shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate performance at a consolidated level and exclude items that, in management's view, may obscure underlying trends in business performance or items of an unusual nature that do not reflect our ongoing operations. They should not be considered alternatives to Net income and basic EPS in measuring TELUS' performance.\n\n## Reconciliation of adjusted Net income\n\n|                                                                                       | Three-month periods ended December 31   | Three-month periods ended December 31   | Years ended December 31   | Years ended December 31   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| ($ millions)                                                                          | 2023                                    | 2022                                    | 2023                      | 2022                      |\n| Net income attributable to Common Shares                                              | 288                                     | 248                                     | 841                       | 1,615                     |\n| Add (deduct) amounts net of amount attributable to non-controlling interests:         |                                         |                                         |                           |                           |\n| Restructuring and other costs                                                         | 138                                     | 82                                      | 691                       | 219                       |\n| Tax effect of restructuring and other costs                                           | (37)                                    | (21)                                    | ( 1 66)                   | (55)                      |\n| Real estate rationalization-related restructuring impairments                         | 8                                       | 8                                       | 73                        | 9                         |\n| Tax effect of real estate rationalization-related restructuring impairments           | (2)                                     | (2)                                     | (19)                      | (2)                       |\n| Income tax-related adjustments                                                        | (13)                                    | (1)                                     | (48)                      | 6                         |\n| Other equity losses (income) related to real estate joint ventures                    | 2                                       | (3)                                     | 1                         | (3)                       |\n| Unrealized changes in virtual power purchase agreements forward element               | (59)                                    | 38                                      | -                         | ( 1 93)                   |\n| Tax effect of unrealized changes in virtual power purchase agreements forward element | 16                                      | (10)                                    | -                         | 51                        |\n| Adjusted Net income                                                                   | 341                                     | 339                                     | 1,373                     | 1,647                     |",

EBITDA is commonly reported and widely used by investors and lending institutions as an indicator of a company's operating performance and ability to incur and service debt, and as a valuation metric. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net income in measuring TELUS' performance, nor should it be used as a measure of cash flow. EBITDA as calculated by TELUS is equivalent to Operating revenues and other income less the total of Goods and services purchased expense and Employee benefits expense.\n\nWe calculate EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs, as it is a component of the EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs interest coverage ratio and the Net debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs ratio .\n\nWe also calculate Adjusted EBITDA to exclude items of an unusual nature that do not reflect our ongoing operations and should not, in our opinion, be considered in a long-term valuation metric or should not be included in an assessment of our ability to service or incur debt.\n\nEBIT (earnings before interest and income taxes) is calculated for our reportable segments because we believe it is a meaningful indicator of our operating performance, as it represents our earnings from operations before costs of capital structure and income taxes.",

It provides an indication of how much cash generated by operations is available after capital expenditures that may be used to, among other things, pay dividends, repay debt, purchase shares or make other investments. We exclude impacts of accounting standards that do not impact cash, such as IFRS 15 and IFRS 16. Free cash flow may be supplemented from time to time by proceeds from divested assets or financing activities.",

The nearest IFRS measure to net debt is Long-term debt, including Current maturities of Long-term debt. Net debt is a component of the Net debt to EBITDA excluding restructuring and other costs ratio .\n\nNet debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs: This measure is defined as net debt at the end of the period divided by 12-month trailing EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs.

Mobile phone churn refers to the aggregate average of both prepaid and postpaid mobile phone churn. A TELUS, Koodo or Public Mobile brand prepaid mobile phone subscriber is deactivated when the subscriber has no usage for 90 days following expiry of the prepaid credits.\n\nConnected device subscriber means a subscriber on an active TELUS service plan with a recurring revenue-generating portable unit (e.g. tablets, internet keys, Internet of Things, wearables and connected cars) that is supported by TELUS and is intended for limited or no cellular voice capability.\n\nMobile phone subscriber means a subscriber on an active TELUS service plan with a recurring revenue-generating portable unit (e.g. feature phones and smartphones) where TELUS provides voice, text and/or data connectivity.\n\nInternet subscriber means a subscriber on an active TELUS internet plan with a recurring revenue-generating unit where TELUS provides internet connectivity.\n\nResidential voice subscriber means a subscriber on an active TELUS phone plan with a recurring revenue-generating unit where TELUS provides voice service.\n\nSecurity subscriber means a subscriber on an active TELUS security plan with a recurring revenue-generating unit that is connected to the TELUS security and automation platform.\n\nTV subscriber means a subscriber on an active TELUS TV plan with a recurring revenuegenerating subscription for video services from a TELUS TV platform.\n\nHealthcare lives covered means the number of users (primary members and their dependents) enrolled in various health programs supported by TELUS Health services (e.g. virtual care, health benefits management, preventative care, personal health security, and employee and family assistance programs). It is probable that some members and their dependents will be a user of multiple TELUS Health services.\n\nVirtual care member means primary enrolment to receive services on an active TELUS Health virtual care plan.\n\nDigital health transactions mean the total number of health claims, dental claims, consultations or other transactions facilitated by TELUS Health products and services.",

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice-president and Chief Financial Officer and effected by the Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nDue to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Based on the assessment referenced in the preceding paragraph, management has determined that the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2023. In connection with this assessment, no material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting were identified by management as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company acquired WillowTree on January 3, 2023, as set out in Note 18(b) of the consolidated financial statements, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, WillowTree's internal control over financial reporting associated with 1%, 1%, 3% and 5% of the Company's consolidated current assets, consolidated current liabilities, consolidated non-current assets and consolidated non-current liabilities, respectively, and total revenue of $254 million and net loss of $127 million included in the Consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nDeloitte LLP, an Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, audited the Company's Consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, and as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, they have expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExecutive Vice-president and Chief Financial Officer February 9, 2024 Doug French\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer February 9, 2024 Darren Entwistle\n\n<!-- image -->",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and its financial performance and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 9, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\n\nThe communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nValuation of Intangible Assets Acquired in Business Acquisitions - Refer to Note 1(b) and 18(b) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nOn January 3, 2023, the Company acquired 86% of the equity of WillowTree and recognized the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at fair value including intangible assets related to customer relationships and other ('intangible assets').\n\nWhile there are several estimates and assumptions that are required to determine the fair value of the intangible assets, the estimates and assumptions with the highest degree of subjectivity are forecasted revenue growth, forecasted profit margins, discount rate, and customer attrition rate. As a result, performing audit procedures required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort, including the involvement of fair value specialists.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the forecasted revenue growth, forecasted profit margins, discount rate and customer attrition rate used to determine the fair value of the intangible assets included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the effectiveness of controls over management's determination of forecasted revenue growth, forecasted profit margins, discount rate and customer attrition rate used to value intangible assets.\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the reasonableness of management's forecasts of revenue growth and profit margins by comparing the forecasts to historical results, third-party industry forecasts, and comparable entities.\n- \u00b7 With the assistance of fair value specialists, evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rate and customer attrition rate by testing the source information underlying the determination of the rates and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate and customer attrition rate selected by management.\n\n## /s/ Deloitte LLP\n\nChartered Professional Accountants Vancouver, Canada February 9, 2024\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Company and our report dated February 9, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\nAs described in the report of management on internal control over financial reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at WillowTree, which was acquired on January 3, 2023, and whose financial statements constitute 1%, 1%, 3% and 5% of the Company's consolidated current assets, consolidated current liabilities, consolidated non-current assets and consolidated non-current liabilities, respectively, and total revenue of $254 million and net loss of $127 million included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended December 31, 2023. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at WillowTree.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying report of management on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## /s/ Deloitte LLP\n\nChartered Professional Accountants Vancouver, Canada February 9, 2024",

Data services include: internet protocol; television; hosting, managed information technology and cloud-based services; and home and business security.\n\nTELUS Corporation was incorporated under the Company Act (British Columbia) on October 26, 1998, under the name BCT.TELUS Communications Inc. (BCT). On January 31, 1999, pursuant to a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act among BCT, BC TELECOM Inc. and the former Alberta-based TELUS Corporation (TC), BCT acquired all of the shares of BC TELECOM Inc. and TC in exchange for Common Shares and Non-Voting Shares of BCT, and BC TELECOM Inc. was dissolved. On May 3, 2000, BCT changed its name to TELUS Corporation and in February 2005, TELUS Corporation transitioned under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia), successor to the Company Act (British Columbia). TELUS Corporation maintains its registered office at Floor 7, 510 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6B 0M3.\n\nThe terms 'TELUS', 'we', 'us', 'our' or 'ourselves' refer to TELUS Corporation and, where the context of the narrative permits or requires, its subsidiaries. Our principal subsidiaries are: TELUS Communications Inc., in which, as at December 31, 2023, we have a 100% equity interest; and TELUS International (Cda) Inc., in which, as at December 31, 2023, we have a 56.0% equity interest, as discussed further in Note 28(c) , and which completed its initial public offering in February 2021. Although it has not had any effect on our current determination of which of our subsidiaries are our principal subsidiaries, we also made a material business acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2023, as set out in Note 18(b) .\n\n| Notes to consolidated financial statements   | Notes to consolidated financial statements                    | Page     |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| General application                          | General application                                           |          |\n| 1.                                           | Summary of significant accounting policies                    | 147      |\n| 2.                                           | Accounting policy developments                                | 154      |\n| 3.                                           | Capital structure financial policies                          | 155      |\n| 4.

The generally accepted accounting principles that we apply are International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS-IASB), and Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nGenerally accepted accounting principles require that we disclose the accounting policies we have selected in those instances in which we have been obligated to choose from among various accounting policies that comply with generally accepted accounting principles. In certain other instances, including those in which no selection among policies is allowed, we are also required to disclose how we have applied certain accounting policies. In the selection and application of accounting policies, we consider, among other factors, the fundamental qualitative characteristics of useful financial information, namely relevance and faithful representation. In our assessment, the accounting policy disclosures we are required to make are not all equally significant for us, as set out in the accompanying table; their relative significance for us will evolve over time, as we do.\n\nThese consolidated financial statements for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, were authorized by our Board of Directors for issue on February 9, 2024.\n\n## (a) Consolidation\n\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of all of our subsidiaries, of which the principal ones are: TELUS Communications Inc. and TELUS International (Cda) Inc. TELUS Communications Inc. includes substantially all of our mobile and fixed operations, excluding the digitally-led customer experience and digital enablement transformation provided through the customer care and business services business of TELUS International (Cda) Inc.\n\nOur financing arrangements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries do not impose restrictions on inter-corporate dividends.\n\nOn a continuing basis, we review our corporate organization and effect changes as appropriate so as to enhance the value of TELUS Corporation. This process can, and does, affect which of our subsidiaries are considered principal subsidiaries at any particular point in time.\n\n|                                                          | Accounting policy requiring   a more significant choice among  policies and/or a more significant  application of judgment   | Accounting policy requiring   a more significant choice among  policies and/or a more significant  application of judgment   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Accounting policy                                        | Yes                                                                                                                          | No                                                                                                                           |\n| General application                                      |                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                              |\n| (a)  Consolidation                                       |                                                                                                                              | X                                                                                                                            |\n| (b)  Use of estimates and judgments                      | X                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                              |\n| (c)  Financial instruments -

In the normal course, we make changes to our assessments regarding materiality for presentation so that they reflect current economic conditions. Due consideration is given to the view that it is reasonable to expect differing opinions of what is, and is not, material.\n- \u00b7 In respect of revenue-generating transactions, we must make judgments that affect the timing of the recognition of revenue, as set out following:\n- \u00b7 We have millions of multi-year contracts with our customers and we must make judgments about when we have satisfied our performance obligations to our customers, either over a period of time or at a point in time. Service revenues are recognized based on customers' access to, or usage of, our telecommunications infrastructure; we believe this method faithfully depicts the transfer of the services, and thus the revenues are recognized as the services are made available and/or rendered. We consider our performance obligations arising from the sale of equipment to have been satisfied when the equipment has been delivered to, and accepted by, the end-user customers (see (e) following).\n- \u00b7 Principally in the context of revenue-generating transactions involving mobile handsets, we must make judgments as to whether third-party re-sellers that deliver equipment to our customers are acting in the transactions as principals or as our agents. Upon due consideration of the relevant indicators, we have concluded that considering the re-sellers to be acting, solely for accounting purposes, as our agents is more representative of the economic substance of the transactions, as we are the primary obligor to the end-user customers. The effect of this judgment is that no equipment revenue is recognized upon the transfer of inventory to third-party re-sellers.\n- \u00b7 We compensate third-party re-sellers and our employees for generating revenues, and we must make judgments as to whether such sales-based compensation amounts are costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers that should be capitalized (see Note 20 ). We believe that compensation amounts tangentially attributable to obtaining a contract with a customer, because the amount of such compensation could be affected in ways other than by simply obtaining that contract, should be expensed as incurred; compensation amounts directly attributable to obtaining a contract with a customer should be capitalized and subsequently amortized on a systematic basis, consistent with the satisfaction of our associated performance obligations.\n\nWe must also exercise judgment in the capitalization of costs incurred to fulfill revenue-generating contracts with customers. Such fulfilment costs are those incurred to set up, activate or otherwise implement services involving access to, or usage of, our telecommunications infrastructure that would not otherwise be capitalized as property, plant, equipment and/or intangible assets (see Note 20 ).\n\n- \u00b7 The decision to depreciate and amortize any property, plant, equipment (including right-of-use lease assets) and intangible assets that are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis, as we believe that this method reflects the consumption of resources related to the economic lifespan of those assets more faithfully than an accelerated method and is more representative of the economic substance of the underlying use of those assets.\n- \u00b7 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments which affect the financial statement disclosure of information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision-maker that is used to make resource allocation decisions and to assess performance (segment information, Note 5 ).",

        "page_content": "A significant judgment we have historically made is the distinction between the operations and cash flows of our business units (which extends to allocations of both direct and indirect expenses and capital expenditures). It is often difficult and impractical to objectively and clearly distinguish between the operations and cash flows of our business units, and the assets from which those cash flows arise. This impracticality is evidence of the interdependence of our business units. As our business continues to evolve, new cash-generating units may also develop.\n\n- \u00b7 The view that our spectrum licences granted by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (including spectrum licences that have been subordinated to us) will likely be renewed; that we intend to renew them; that we believe we have the financial and operational ability to renew them; and thus, that they have indefinite lives, as discussed further in Note 18(e) .\n- \u00b7 In connection with the annual impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, there may be instances in which we must exercise judgment in allocating our net assets (including shared corporate and administrative assets) to our cash-generating units when determining their carrying amounts.\n- \u00b7 In respect of claims and lawsuits, as discussed further in Note 29(a) , the determination of whether an item is a contingent liability or whether an outflow of resources is probable and thus is to be accounted for as a provision.\n\n## (c) Financial instruments - recognition and measurement\n\nIn respect of the recognition and measurement of financial instruments, we have adopted the following policies:\n\n- \u00b7 Regular-way purchases or sales of financial assets or financial liabilities (purchases or sales that require actual delivery of financial assets or financial liabilities) are recognized on the settlement date. We have selected this method, as the benefits of using the trade date method were not expected to exceed the costs of selecting and implementing that method.\n- \u00b7 Transaction costs, other than in respect of items held for trading, are added to the initial fair value of the acquired financial asset or financial liability. We have selected this method, as we believe that it results in a better matching of the transaction costs with the periods in which we benefit from those costs.\n- \u00b7 A contract to receive renewable energy credits and the associated virtual power purchase agreement (which we enter into as part of our commitment to reduce our carbon footprint) are distinct units of account. We have selected this method, as we believe the receipt of the renewable energy credits is an executory contract and the virtual power purchase agreement meets the definition of a derivative.\n\n## (d) Hedge accounting\n\n## General\n\nWe apply hedge accounting to the financial instruments used to establish designated currency hedging relationships for certain U.S. dollar-denominated future purchase commitments and debt repayments, as set out in Note 4(a) and (d) .\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe purpose of hedge accounting, in respect of our designated hedging relationships, is to ensure that counterbalancing gains and losses are recognized in the same periods. We have chosen to apply hedge accounting, as we believe that it more faithfully depicts the economic substance of the underlying transactions.\n\nIn order to apply hedge accounting, there must be a high correlation (indicating effectiveness) in the offsetting changes in the risk-associated values of the financial instruments (the hedging items) used to establish the designated hedging relationships and all, or a part, of the asset, liability or transaction having an identified risk exposure that we have taken steps to modify (the hedged items). We assess the anticipated effectiveness of designated hedging relationships at inception and their actual effectiveness for each reporting period thereafter. We consider a designated hedging relationship to be effective if the following critical terms match between the hedging item and the hedged item: the notional amount of the hedging item and the principal amount of the hedged item; maturity dates; payment dates; and interest rate index (if, and as, applicable). As set out in Note 4(i) , any ineffectiveness, such as would result from a difference between the notional amount of the hedging item and the principal amount of the hedged item, or from a previously effective designated hedging relationship becoming ineffective, is reflected in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as Financing costs if in respect of long-term debt and as Goods and services purchased if in respect of U.S. dollardenominated future purchase commitments.\n\n## Hedging assets and liabilities\n\nIn the application of hedge accounting, an amount (the hedge value) is recorded in the Consolidated statements of financial position in respect of the fair value of the hedging items. The net difference, if any, between the amounts recognized in the determination of net income and the amounts necessary to reflect the fair value of the designated cash flow hedging items recorded in the Consolidated statements of financial position is recognized as a component of Other comprehensive income, as set out in Note 11 .\n\n## (e) Revenue recognition\n\n## General\n\nWe earn the majority of our TELUS technology solutions service revenues from access to, and usage of, our telecommunications infrastructure, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Mobile network (voice and data);\n- \u00b7 Fixed data services (which include: internet protocol; television; hosting, managed information technology and cloud-based services; and home and business security);\n- \u00b7 Fixed voice services; and\n- \u00b7 Health services.\n\nThe majority of the balance of our TELUS technology solutions revenues (mobile equipment and other service; fixed equipment and other service; agriculture and consumer goods services (which include: software, data management and data analytics-driven smart-food chain and consumer goods technologies)) arises from providing services and products facilitating access",

        "page_content": "to, and usage of, telecommunications infrastructure. Service revenues from our digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International segment arise from the provision of digital customer experience solutions, including artificial intelligence and content management solutions.\n\nWe offer complete and integrated solutions to meet our customers' needs. These solutions may involve deliveries of multiple services and products (our performance obligations) that occur at different points in time and/or over different periods of time; as referred to in (b) , this is a significant judgment for us. As required, the performance obligations of these multiple-element arrangements are identified and the transaction price for the entire multiple-element arrangement is determined and allocated among the performance obligations based upon our relative standalone selling prices for each of them; our relevant revenue recognition policies are then applied, so that revenue is recognized when, or as, we satisfy the performance obligations. To the extent that variable consideration is included in determining the minimum transaction price, it is constrained to the 'minimum spend' amount required in a contract with a customer. Service revenues arising from contracts with customers typically have variable consideration, because customers have the ongoing ability to both add and remove features and services, and because customer usage of our telecommunications infrastructure may exceed the base amounts provided for in their contracts.\n\nFor the purposes of IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , our contracts with customers are not considered to have a significant financing component. With the exception of both equipment-related upfront payments that may be required under the terms of contracts with customers and in-store 'cash and carry' sales of equipment and accessories, payments are typically due 30 days from the billing date. Billings are typically rendered on a monthly basis.\n\nMultiple contracts with a single customer are normally accounted for as separate arrangements. When we enter into multiple contracts with a customer in a short period of time, the contracts are reviewed as a group to ensure that, as with multiple-element arrangements, their relative transaction prices are appropriate.\n\nLease accounting is applied to an accounting unit if it conveys to a customer the right to use a specific asset but does not convey the risks and/or benefits of ownership.\n\nOur revenues are recorded net of any value-added and/or sales taxes billed to the customer concurrent with a revenue-generating transaction.\n\nWe use the following revenue accounting practical expedients provided for in IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers :\n\n- \u00b7 No adjustment of the contracted amount of consideration for the effects of financing components when, at the inception of a contract, we expect that the effect of the financing component is not significant at the individual contract level.\n- \u00b7 No deferral of contract acquisition costs when the amortization period for such costs would be one year or less.\n\n## Contract assets\n\nMany of our multiple-element arrangements arise from bundling the sale of equipment (e.g. a mobile handset) with a contracted service period. Although the customer receives the equipment at contract inception and the revenue from the associated completed performance obligation is recognized at that time, the customer's payment for the equipment will effectively be received rateably over the contracted service period to the extent it is not received as a lumpsum amount at contract inception. The difference between the equipment revenue recognized and the associated amount cumulatively billed to the customer is recognized on the Consolidated statements of financial position as a contract asset and/or an unbilled customer finance receivable, depending upon the form of the contract.\n\nContract assets may also arise when we give consideration to a customer. When we receive no identifiable, separable benefit for consideration given to a customer, the amount of the consideration is recognized as a reduction of revenue rather than as an expense. Such amounts are included in the determination of transaction prices for allocation purposes in multiple-element arrangements.\n\n- \u00b7 Some forms of consideration given to a customer, effectively at contract inception, such as rebates (including prepaid non-bank cards) and/or equipment, are considered to be performance obligations in a multiple-element arrangement. Although the performance obligation is satisfied at contract inception, the customer's payment associated with the performance obligation will effectively be received rateably over the associated contracted service period. The difference between the revenue arising from the satisfied performance obligation and the associated amount cumulatively billed to the customer is recognized on the Consolidated statements of financial position as a contract asset.\n- \u00b7 Other forms of consideration given to a customer, either at contract inception or over a period of time, such as discounts (including prepaid bank cards), may result in us receiving no identifiable, separable benefit and thus are not considered performance obligations. Such consideration is recognized as a reduction of revenue rateably over the term of the contract. The difference between the consideration provided and the associated amount recognized as a reduction of revenue is recognized on the Consolidated statements of financial position as a contract asset.\n\n## Contract liabilities\n\nAdvance billings are recorded when billing occurs prior to our provision of the associated services; such advance billings are recognized as revenue in the period in which the services and/or equipment are provided (see Note 24 ). Similarly, and as appropriate, upfront customer activation and connection fees are deferred and recognized over the average expected term of the customer relationship.\n\n- \u00b7 When estimating minimum transaction prices allocated to any remaining unfulfilled, or partially unfulfilled, performance obligations, exclusion of amounts arising from contracts originally expected to have a duration of one year or less, as well as amounts arising from contracts under which we may recognize and bill revenue in an amount that corresponds directly with our completed performance obligations.",

        "page_content": "## Costs of contract acquisition and contract fulfilment\n\nCosts of contract acquisition (typically commissions) and costs of contract fulfilment are capitalized and recognized as an expense, generally over the life of the contract on a systematic and rational basis consistent with the pattern of the transfer of goods or services to which the contract asset relates. The amortization of such costs is included in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as a component of Goods and services purchased, with the exception of amounts paid to our employees, which are included as Employee benefits expense.\n\nThe total cost of mobile equipment sold to customers and advertising and promotion costs related to initial customer acquisition are expensed as incurred; the cost of equipment we own that is situated at customers' premises and associated installation costs are capitalized as incurred. Costs of advertising production, advertising airtime and advertising space are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Voice and data\n\nWe recognize revenues on an accrual basis and include an estimate of revenues earned but unbilled. Mobile and fixed service revenues are recognized based upon access to, and usage of, our telecommunications infrastructure and upon contract fees.\n\nAdvance billings are recorded when billing occurs prior to our provision of the associated services; such advance billings are recognized as revenue in the period in which the services are provided. Similarly, and as appropriate, upfront customer activation and connection fees are deferred and recognized over the average expected term of the customer relationship.\n\nWe use the liability method of accounting for the amounts of our quality of service rate rebates that arise from the jurisdiction of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).\n\n## Other and mobile equipment\n\nWe recognize product revenues, including amounts related to mobile handsets sold to re-sellers and customer premises equipment, when the products are both delivered to, and accepted by, the end-user customers, irrespective of which supply channel delivers the product. With respect to mobile handsets sold to re-sellers, we consider ourselves to be the principal and primary obligor to the end-user customers. Revenues from operating leases of equipment are recognized on a systematic and rational basis (normally a straight-line basis) over the term of the lease. We recognize revenues that arise from employee and family assistance programs and from software solutions (including benefits administration) in the accounting period in which they are provided.\n\nWe recognize revenues that arise from our provision of digital customer experience solutions, including artificial intelligence and content management solutions, in the accounting period in which they are provided, typically on a per-productive hour or per-transaction basis.\n\n## (f) Depreciation, amortization and impairment\n\n## Depreciation and amortization\n\nProperty, plant and equipment (including right-of-use lease assets) are depreciated on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives (lease terms for right-of-use lease assets), as determined by a continuing program of asset life studies. Depreciation includes amortization of leasehold improvements, which are normally amortized over the lesser of their expected average service lives or the terms of the associated leases. Intangible assets with finite lives (intangible assets subject to amortization) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are reviewed at least annually and adjusted as appropriate. As referred to in (b) , the use of a straight-line basis of depreciation and amortization is a significant judgment for us.\n\nEstimated useful lives for the majority of our property, plant and equipment (including right-ofuse lease assets) and intangible assets subject to depreciation and amortization are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                               | Estimated useful lives   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Property, plant and equipment (including right-of-use lease assets)   subject to depreciation |                          |\n| Network assets                                                                                |                          |\n| Outside plant                                                                                 | 17 to 40 years           |\n| Inside plant                                                                                  | 4 to 25 years            |\n| Mobile site equipment                                                                         | 5 to 7 years             |\n| Real estate right-of-use lease assets                                                         | 5 to 20 years            |\n| Balance of depreciable property, plant and equipment and right-of-use lease assets            | 3 to 40 years            |\n| Intangible assets subject to amortization                                                     |                          |\n| Customer contracts and related customer relationships                                         | 4 to 15 years            |\n| Fixed subscriber base                                                                         | 25 years                 |\n| Software                                                                                      | 3 to 10 years            |\n| Access to rights-of-way, crowdsource assets and other                                         | 5 to 30 years            |\n\n## Impairment - general\n\nImpairment testing compares the carrying values of the assets or cash-generating units being tested with their recoverable amounts (the recoverable amount being the greater of an asset's or a cash-generating unit's value in use or its fair value less costs of disposal); as referred to in (b) , this is a significant estimate for us. Impairment losses are immediately recognized to the extent that the carrying value of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Should the recoverable amounts for impaired assets or cash-generating units subsequently increase, the impairment losses previously recognized (other than in respect of goodwill) may be reversed to the extent that the reversal is not a result of 'unwinding of the discount' and that the resulting carrying values do not exceed the carrying values which would have been the result if no impairment losses had been recognized previously.",

        "page_content": "## Impairment - property, plant and equipment; intangible assets subject to amortization\n\nThe continuing program of asset life studies considers such factors as the timing of technological obsolescence, competitive pressures, future infrastructure utilization plans, and climate; these considerations could also indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, in which case an impairment loss is recognized.\n\n## Impairment - intangible assets with indefinite lives; goodwill\n\nThe carrying values of intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill are periodically tested for impairment. The frequency of impairment testing is generally the reciprocal of the stability of any relevant events and circumstances, but intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill must, at a minimum, be tested annually; we have selected December as the time of our annual test.\n\nWe assess our intangible assets with indefinite lives by comparing the recoverable amounts of our cash-generating units to their carrying values (including the intangible assets with indefinite lives allocated to a cash-generating unit, but excluding any goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit). To the extent that the carrying value of a cash-generating unit (including the intangible assets with indefinite lives allocated to the cash-generating unit, but excluding any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit) exceeds its recoverable amount, the excess amount would be recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of intangible assets with indefinite lives.\n\nSubsequent to assessing intangible assets with indefinite lives, we assess goodwill by comparing the recoverable amounts of our cash-generating units (or group of cash-generating units) to their carrying values (including the intangible assets with indefinite lives and any goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units). To the extent that the carrying value of a cash-generating unit (including the intangible assets with indefinite lives and the goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit) exceeds its recoverable amount, the excess amount would first be recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of goodwill and any remainder would be recorded as a reduction of the carrying values of the assets of the cash-generating unit on a pro-rated basis.\n\n## (g) Translation of foreign currencies\n\nTrade transactions completed in foreign currencies are translated into Canadian dollars at the rates of exchange prevailing at the time of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Canadian dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the statement of financial position date, with any resulting gain or loss recorded in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as a component of Financing costs, as set out in Note 9 . Hedge accounting is applied in specific instances, as discussed further in (d) preceding.\n\nCertain of our subsidiaries and associates do not have the Canadian dollar as their functional currency. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from translation of the accounts of these subsidiaries and associates into Canadian dollars are reported as a component of other comprehensive income, as set out in Note 11 .\n\n## (h) Income and other taxes\n\nWe follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes; as referred to in (b) , this is a significant estimate for us. Under this method, current income taxes are recognized for the estimated income taxes payable for the current year. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the tax and accounting bases of assets and liabilities, and also for any benefits of losses and Investment Tax Credits available to be carried forward to future years for tax purposes that are more likely than not to be realized. The amounts recognized in respect of deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based upon the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences or the usage of tax losses and the application of the substantively enacted tax rates at the time of reversal or usage.\n\nWe account for any changes in substantively enacted income tax rates affecting deferred income tax assets and liabilities in full in the period in which the changes are substantively enacted. We account for changes in the estimates of tax balances for prior years as estimate revisions in the period in which changes in the estimates arise; we have selected this approach, as its emphasis on the statement of financial position is more consistent with the liability method of accounting for income taxes.\n\nOur operations are complex and the related domestic and foreign tax interpretations, regulations, legislation and jurisprudence are continually changing. As a result, there are usually some tax matters in question that result in uncertain tax positions. We recognize the income tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only when it is more likely than not that the ultimate determination of the tax treatment of the position will result in that benefit being realized; however, this does not mean that tax authorities cannot challenge these positions. We accrue an amount for interest charges on current tax liabilities that have not been funded, which would include interest and penalties arising from uncertain tax positions. We include such charges in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as a component of Financing costs.\n\nOur research and development activities may be eligible to earn Investment Tax Credits, for which the determination of eligibility is a complex matter. We recognize Investment Tax Credits only when there is reasonable assurance that the ultimate determination of the eligibility of our research and development activities will result in the Investment Tax Credits being received, at which time they are accounted for using the cost reduction method, whereby such credits are deducted from the expenditures or assets to which they relate, as set out in Note 10(c) .\n\n## (i) Share-based compensation\n\n## General\n\nWhen share-based compensation vests in its entirety at one future point in time (cliff-vesting), we recognize the expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. When share-based compensation vests in tranches (graded-vesting), we recognize the expense using the accelerated attribution method. An estimate of forfeitures during the vesting period is made at the date of grant of such share-based compensation; this estimate is adjusted to reflect actual experience.",

        "page_content": "## Restricted share units\n\nIn respect of restricted share units with neither an equity settlement feature nor market performance conditions, as set out in Note 14(b) , we accrue a liability equal to the product of the number of vesting restricted share units multiplied by the fair market value of the corresponding Common Shares at the end of the reporting period. Similarly, we accrue a liability for the notional subset of our restricted share units without an equity settlement feature and with market performance conditions, using a fair value determined from a Monte Carlo simulation. Restricted share units that have an equity settlement feature are accounted for as equity instruments. The expense for restricted share units that do not ultimately vest is reversed against the expense that was previously recorded in their respect.\n\n## Share option awards\n\nA fair value for share option awards is determined at the date of grant and is recognized in the financial statements. Proceeds from the exercise of share option awards are credited to share capital, as are the recognized grant-date fair values of the share option awards exercised.\n\nShare option awards that have a net-equity settlement feature, as set out in Note 14(d) , are accounted for as equity instruments. We have selected the equity instrument fair value method of accounting for the net-equity settlement feature, as it is consistent with the accounting treatment applied to the associated share option awards.\n\n## (j) Employee future benefit plans\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nWe accrue amounts for our obligations under employee defined benefit plans and the related costs, net of plan assets. The cost of pensions and other retirement benefits earned by employees is actuarially determined using the accrued benefit method pro-rated on service and management's best estimates of both salary escalation and the retirement ages of employees. In the determination of net income, net interest for each plan, which is the product of the plan's surplus (deficit) multiplied by the discount rate, is included as a component of Financing costs, as set out in Note 9 .\n\nAn amount reflecting the effect of differences between the discount rate and the actual rate of return on plan assets is included as a component of employee defined benefit plan re-measurements within Other comprehensive income, as set out in Note 11 and Note 15 . We determine the maximum economic benefit available from the plans' assets on the basis of reductions in future contributions to the plans.\n\nOn an annual basis, at a minimum, the defined benefit plan key assumptions are assessed and revised as appropriate; as referred to in (b) , these are significant estimates for us.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nWe use defined contribution accounting for the Telecommunication Workers Pension Plan and the British Columbia Public Service Pension Plan, which cover certain of our employees and provide defined benefits to their members. In the absence of any regulations governing the calculation of the share of the underlying financial position and plan performance attributable to each employer-participant, and in the absence of contractual agreements between the plans and\n\nthe employer-participants related to the financing of any shortfall (or distribution of any surplus), we account for these plans as defined contribution plans, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 19, Employee Benefits .\n\n## (k) Cash and temporary investments, net\n\nCash and temporary investments, which may include investments in money market instruments that are purchased three months or less from maturity, are presented net of outstanding items, including cheques written but not cleared by the related banks as at the statement of financial position date. Cash and temporary investments, net, is classified as a liability in the statement of financial position when the total amount of all cheques written but not cleared by the related banks exceeds the amount of cash and temporary investments. When cash and temporary investments, net, is classified as a liability, this may also include overdraft amounts drawn on our bilateral bank facilities, which revolve daily and are discussed further in Note 22 .\n\n## (l) Inventories\n\nOur inventories primarily consist of mobile handsets, parts and accessories totalling $369 million as at December 31, 2023 (2022 - $414 million), and communications equipment held for resale. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost being determined on an average cost basis. Costs of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2023, totalled $2.4 billion (2022 - $2.3 billion).\n\n## (m) Property, plant and equipment; intangible assets\n\n## General\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets are recorded at historical cost, which for self-constructed property, plant and equipment includes materials, direct labour and applicable overhead costs. For internally developed internal-use software, the historical cost recorded includes materials, direct labour and direct labour-related costs. Where property, plant and equipment construction projects are of sufficient size and duration, an amount is capitalized for the cost of funds used to finance construction, as set out in Note 9 . The rate for calculating the capitalized financing cost is based on the weighted average cost of borrowing that we experience during the reporting period.\n\nWhen we sell property, plant and/or equipment, the net book value is netted against the sale proceeds and the difference, as set out in Note 7 , is included in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as a component of Other income.\n\n## Asset retirement obligations\n\nProvisions for liabilities, as set out in Note 25 , are recognized for statutory, contractual or legal obligations, normally when incurred, associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment (primarily certain items of outside plant and mobile site equipment) when those obligations result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal operation of the assets; as referred to in (b) , this is a significant estimate for us. The obligations are measured initially at fair value, which is determined using present value methodology, and the resulting costs",

In subsequent periods, the provisions for these liabilities are adjusted for the accretion of discount, for any changes in the market-based discount rate and for any changes in the amount or timing of the underlying future cash flows. The capitalized asset retirement cost is depreciated on the same basis as the related asset and the discount accretion, as set out in Note 9 , is included in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as a component of Financing costs.\n\n## (n) Investments\n\nWe account for our investments in companies over which we have significant influence, as discussed further in Note 21 , using the equity method of accounting, whereby the investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted to recognize our share of earnings or losses of the investee companies and any earnings distributions received. The excess of the cost of an equity investment over its underlying book value at the initial date of investment, except for goodwill, is amortized over the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets to which the excess cost is attributed; subsequent investments in associates do not attribute excess cost.\n\n## 2 Accounting policy developments\n\n## (a)  Initial application of standards, interpretations and amendments to standards and interpretations in the reporting period\n\n- \u00b7 In February 2021, the International Accounting Standards Board issued narrow-scope amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements , IFRS Practice Statement 2, Making Materiality Judgements , and IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors . The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, although earlier application was permitted. The amendments require the disclosure of material accounting policy information rather than disclosing significant accounting policies, and clarify how to distinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. Our financial disclosure is currently not materially affected by the application of the amendments.\n- \u00b7 In May 2021, the International Accounting Standards Board issued targeted amendments to IAS 12, Income Taxes . The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, although earlier application was permitted. With a view to reducing diversity in reporting, the amendments clarify that companies are required to recognize deferred taxes on transactions where both assets and liabilities are recognized, such as with leases and asset retirement (decommissioning) obligations. Our financial performance and disclosure are currently not materially affected by the application of the amendments.\n- \u00b7 In May 2023, the International Accounting Standards Board issued International Tax Reform Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments to IAS 12) , which amended IAS 12, Income Taxes . The amendments provide, and we use, temporary relief from accounting for deferred income\n\nSimilarly, we account for our interests in the real estate joint ventures, as discussed further in Note 21 , using the equity method of accounting. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from transactions with (including contributions to) the real estate joint ventures are deferred in proportion to our remaining interest in the real estate joint ventures.\n\nWe account for our other long-term investments at their fair values unless they are investment securities that do not have either quoted market prices in an active market or other clear and objective evidence of fair value. When we do not account for our other long-term investments at their fair values, we use the cost basis of accounting, whereby the investments are initially recorded at cost, and earnings from those investments are recognized only to the extent received or receivable. When there is a significant or prolonged decline in the value of an investment that is classified as one of our other long-term investments, its carrying value is adjusted to its estimated fair value.\n\ntaxes arising from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Pillar Two model rules (such rules ensuring that large multinational corporations would be subject to a minimum 15% income tax rate in every jurisdiction in which they operate). As different jurisdictions are expected to implement the OECD rules at different speeds and at different points in time, the amendments are intended to help ensure consistency within, and comparability across, financial statements. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. We are currently assessing the impacts of the amended standard, but do not expect that our financial disclosure will be materially affected by the application of the amendments.\n\n## (b) Standards, interpretations and amendments to standards and interpretations in the reporting period not yet effective and not yet applied\n\n- In May 2023, the International Accounting Standards Board issued Supplier Finance Arrangements , which amended IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures , and requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosure about supplier finance arrangements. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, although earlier application is permitted; comparative prior-period information is not required in the year of initial application. We are currently assessing the impacts of the amended standards, but do not expect that our financial disclosure, set out in Note 23 , will be materially affected by the application of the amendments. \u00b7",

In our definition of financial capital, we include:\n\n- \u00b7 Common equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income);\n- \u00b7 Non-controlling interests;\n- \u00b7 Long-term debt (including long-term credit facilities, commercial paper backstopped by long-term credit facilities and any hedging assets or liabilities associated with long-term debt items, net of amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income);\n- \u00b7 Cash and temporary investments;\n- \u00b7 Short-term borrowings (including those arising from securitized receivables); and\n- \u00b7 Other long-term debts (including those arising from securitized receivables).\n\nWe manage our financial capital structure and make adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of our business. In order to maintain or adjust our financial capital structure, we may:\n\n- \u00b7 Adjust the amount of dividends paid to holders of Common Shares;\n- \u00b7 Purchase Common Shares for cancellation pursuant to normal course issuer bids;\n- \u00b7 Issue new shares (including Common Shares and TELUS International (Cda) Inc. subordinate voting shares);\n- \u00b7 Issue new debt, issue new debt to replace existing debt with different characteristics;\n- \u00b7 Increase or decrease the amount of receivables sold to an arm's-length securitization trust; and/or\n- \u00b7 Enter into a new arm's-length securitization trust to replace an existing arm's-length securitization trust with different characteristics.\n\nDuring 2023, our financial objectives, which are reviewed annually, were unchanged from 2022. We believe that our financial objectives support our long-term strategy.\n\nWe monitor financial capital utilizing a number of measures, including: net debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA*) - excluding restructuring and other costs ratio; coverage ratios; and dividend payout ratios.\n\n## Debt and coverage ratios\n\nNet debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs is calculated as net debt at the end of the period, divided by 12-month trailing EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs. Historically, this measure is substantially similar to the leverage ratio covenant in our credit facilities. Net debt and EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs are measures that\n\ndo not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS-IASB and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. The calculation of these measures is set out in the following table. Net debt is one component of a ratio used to determine compliance with certain debt covenants.\n\n| As at, or for the 12-month periods ended, December 31  ($ in millions)   | Objective    | 2023      | 2022        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Components of debt and coverage ratios                                   |              |           |             |\n| Net debt1                                                                |              | $  26,494 | $  24,152   |\n| EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs2                        |              | $ 7,148   | $ 6,646     |\n| Net interest cost3  (Note 9)                                             |              | $ 1,272   | $       847 |\n| Debt ratio                                                               |              |           |             |\n| Net debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring   and other costs           | 2.20 - 2.704 | 3.71      | 3.63        |\n| Coverage ratios                                                          |              |           |             |\n| Earnings coverage5                                                       |              | 1.9       | 3.6         |\n| EBITDA - excluding restructuring   and other costs interest coverage6    |              | 5.6       | 7.8         |\n\n- 1 Net debt and total managed capitalization are calculated as follows:\n\n| As at December 31                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Note   | 2023      | 2022      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|\n| Long-term debt                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 26     | $  27,349 | $  25,037 |\n| Debt issuance costs netted against long-term debt                                                                                                                                                                     |        | 118       | 118       |\n| Derivative (assets) liabilities used to manage interest rate   and currency risks associated with U.S. dollar-denominated  long-term debt, net                                                                        |        | 13        | (80)      |\n| Accumulated other comprehensive income amounts arising   from financial instruments used to manage interest rate   and currency risks associated with U.S. dollar-denominated  long-term debt - excluding tax effects |        | (226)     | (53)      |\n| Cash and temporary investments, net                                                                                                                                                                                   |        | (864)     | (974)     |\n| Short-term borrowings                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 22     | 104       | 104       |\n| Net debt                                                                                                                                                                                                              |        | 26,494    | 24,152    |\n| Common equity                                                                                                                                                                                                         |        | 16,112    | 16,569    |\n| Non-controlling interests                                                                                                                                                                                             |        | 1,190     | 1,089     |\n| Less: accumulated other comprehensive income   amounts included above in common equity   and non-controlling interests                                                                                                |        | 46        | ( 1 33)   |\n| Total managed capitalization                                                                                                                                                                                          |        | $  43,842 | $  41,677 |",

The effect of the increase, primarily due to business acquisitions, in net debt levels (which were already elevated in the current and comparative periods due to our spectrum acquisitions) exceeded the effect of growth in EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs.\n\nThe earnings coverage ratio for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023, was 1.9 times, down from 3.6 times one year earlier. A decrease in income before borrowing costs and income taxes lowered the ratio by 0.9 and an increase in borrowing costs lowered the ratio by 0.8. The EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs interest coverage ratio for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023, was 5.6 times, down from 7.8 times one year earlier. Growth in EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs increased the ratio by 0.6 and an increase of $425 million in net interest costs decreased the ratio by 2.8.\n\n## TELUS Corporation Common Share dividend payout ratio\n\nSo as to be consistent with the way we manage our business, our TELUS Corporation Common Share dividend payout ratio is presented as a historical measure calculated as the sum of the dividends declared in the most recent four quarters for TELUS Corporation Common Shares, as recorded in the financial statements, net of dividend reinvestment plan effects (see Note 13 ), divided by the sum of free cash flow* amounts for the most recent four quarters for interim reporting periods (divided by annual free cash flow if the reported amount is in respect of a fiscal

We believe that classification as held for hedging results in a better matching of the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument with the risk exposure being hedged.\n\nIn respect of hedges of anticipated transactions, hedge gains/losses are included with the related expenditure and are expensed when the transaction is recognized in our results of operations. We have selected this method as we believe that it results in a better matching of the hedge gains/losses with the risk exposure being hedged. Derivatives that are not part of a documented cash flow hedging relationship are accounted for as held for\n\ntrading and thus are measured at fair value through net income.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nWe apply hedge accounting to financial instruments used to establish hedge accounting relationships for U.S. dollar-denominated transactions. We believe that our use of derivative financial instruments for hedging or arbitrage assists us in managing our financing costs and/or reducing the uncertainty associated with our financing or other business activities. Uncertainty associated with currency risk and other price risk is reduced through our use of foreign exchange derivatives that effectively swap floating currency exchange rates for fixed rates. When entering into derivative financial instrument contracts, we seek to align the cash flow timing of the hedging items with that of the hedged items. The effects of this risk management strategy and its application are set out in (i) following.\n\n## (b) Credit risk\n\nExcluding credit risk, if any, arising from currency swaps settled on a gross basis, the best representation of our maximum exposure (excluding income tax effects) to credit risk, which is a worst-case scenario and does not reflect results we expect, is set out in the following table.\n\n| As at December 31 (millions)        | 2023     | 2022     |\n|-------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Cash and temporary investments, net | $  864   | $  974   |\n| Accounts receivable                 | 4,234    | 3,887    |\n| Contract assets                     | 748      | 761      |\n| Derivative assets                   | 215      | 333      |\n|                                     | $  6,061 | $  5,955 |\n\n## Cash and temporary investments, net\n\nCredit risk associated with cash and temporary investments is managed by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with: governments; major financial institutions that have been accorded strong investment grade ratings by a primary rating agency; and/or other creditworthy counterparties. An ongoing review evaluates changes in the status of counterparties.\n\n## Accounts receivable\n\nCredit risk associated with accounts receivable is inherently managed by the size and diversity of our large customer base, which includes substantially all consumer and business sectors in Canada. We follow a program of credit evaluations of customers and limit the amount of credit extended when we deem it to be necessary. Accounts are considered to be past due (in default) when customers have failed to make the contractually required payments when due, which is generally within 30 days of the billing date. Any late payment charges are levied at an industrybased market rate or a negotiated rate on outstanding non-current customer account balances.",

Current economic conditions (including forward-looking macroeconomic data), historical information (including credit agency reports, if available), reasons for the accounts being past due and the line of business from which the customer accounts receivable arose are all considered when determining whether to make allowances for past-due accounts.

The doubtful accounts expense is calculated on a specific-identification basis for customer accounts receivable balances above a specific threshold and on a statistically derived allowance basis for the remainder.

The total dollar amount of credit exposure under contracts with any one financial institution is limited and counterparties' credit ratings are monitored. We do not give or receive collateral on swap agreements and hedging items due to our credit rating and those of our counterparties. While we are exposed to the risk of credit losses due to the potential non-performance of our counterparties, we consider this risk remote. Our derivative liabilities do not have credit risk-related contingent features.",

The U.S. dollar is the only foreign currency to which we have significant exposure as at the statement of financial position date.\n\nOur currency risk management includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts and currency options to fix the exchange rates on a varying percentage, typically in the range of 50% to 75%, of our domestic short-term U.S. dollar-denominated transactions and commitments and all U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper. Other than in respect of U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper, we designate only the spot element of these instruments as the hedging item, as the forward element is wholly immaterial; in respect of U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper, we designate the forward rate.\n\nAs discussed further in Note 26(b) and Note 26(f) , we are also exposed to currency risk in that the fair values or future cash flows of our U.S. Dollar Notes and our TELUS International (Cda) Inc. credit facility U.S. dollar borrowings could fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Currency hedging relationships have been established for the related semi-annual interest payments and the principal payment at maturity in respect of the U.S. Dollar Notes; we designate only the spot element of these instruments as the hedging item, as the forward element is wholly immaterial. As the functional currency of our TELUS International (Cda) Inc. subsidiary is the U.S. dollar, changes in foreign exchange rates affecting its borrowings are reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income.\n\n## (e) Interest rate risk\n\nChanges in market interest rates will cause fluctuations in the fair values or future cash flows of temporary investments, construction credit facility advances made to the real estate joint venture, short-term obligations, long-term debt and interest rate swap derivatives.\n\nWhen we have temporary investments, they have short maturities and fixed interest rates and, as a result, their fair values will fluctuate with changes in market interest rates; absent monetization prior to maturity, the related future cash flows will not change due to changes in market interest rates.\n\nIf the balance of temporary investments or short-term investments includes dividend-paying equity instruments, we could be exposed to interest rate risk.\n\nDue to the short-term nature of the applicable rates of interest charged, the fair value of the construction credit facility advances made to the real estate joint venture is not materially affected by changes in market interest rates; the associated cash flows representing interest payments will be affected until such advances are repaid.\n\nAs short-term obligations arising from bilateral bank facilities, which typically have variable interest rates, are rarely outstanding for periods that exceed one calendar week, interest rate risk associated with this item is not material.\n\nBorrowings arising from the sales of trade receivables to an arm's-length securitization trust are fixed-rate debts. Due to the short maturities of these borrowings, interest rate risk associated with this item is not material.\n\nAll of our currently outstanding long-term debt, other than commercial paper and amounts drawn on our credit facilities ( Note 26(c)-(d) , (f) ), is fixed-rate debt. The fair value of fixed-rate debt fluctuates with changes in market interest rates; absent early redemption, the related future cash flows will not change. Due to the short maturities of commercial paper, its fair value is not materially",

The fair value of the virtual power purchase agreement forward element and the associated future cash flows will vary depending upon actual and estimated changes in the electricity spot price, and the electrical power to be produced in the future under each agreement, referenced in the underlying cash-settled contracts for differences.\n\n## Long-term investments\n\nWe are exposed to equity price risk arising from investments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income. Such investments are held for strategic purposes rather than for trading.\n\n## (g) Market risks\n\nNet income and other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, could have varied if the Canadian dollar: U.S. dollar exchange rate, the U.S. dollar: European euro exchange rate, market interest rates and virtual power purchase agreement forward element valuation varied by reasonably possible amounts from their actual statement of financial position date amounts.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis of our exposure to currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based upon a hypothetical change taking place at the relevant statement of financial position date. The U.S. dollar-denominated and European euro-denominated balances and the notional amounts of our derivative financial instruments as at the relevant statement of financial position dates have been used in the calculations.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis of our exposure to interest rate risk at the reporting date has been determined based upon a hypothetical change taking place at the beginning of the relevant fiscal year and being held constant through to the statement of financial position date. The principal and notional amounts as at the relevant statement of financial position dates have been used in the calculations.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis of our exposure to wind discount risk and solar premium risk at the reporting date has been determined based upon a hypothetical change taking place at the relevant statement of financial position date. The notional amounts of the virtual power purchase agreements as at the relevant statement of financial position dates have been used in the calculations.\n\nIncome tax expense, which is reflected net in the sensitivity analysis, was determined using the applicable statutory income tax rates for the reporting periods.\n\n|                                                             | Net   income       | Net   income       | Other comprehensive  income   | Other comprehensive  income   | Comprehensive   income   | Comprehensive   income   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Years ended December 31   (increase (decrease) in millions) | 2023               | 2022               | 2023                          | 2022                          | 2023                     | 2022                     |\n| Reasonably possible changes   in market risks1              |                    |                    |                               |                               |                          |                          |\n| 10% change in C$: US$  exchange rate                        |                    |                    |                               |                               |                          |                          |\n| Canadian dollar appreciates                                 | $ (6)              | $ (6)              | $   /thinspace110             | $    19                       | $   /thinspace104        | $    13                  |\n| Canadian dollar depreciates                                 | $   /thinspace  6  | $     6            | $  (110)                      | $  (19)                       | $  ( 1 04)               | $  (13)                  |\n| 10% change in US$: \u20ac   exchange rate                        |                    |                    |                               |                               |                          |                          |\n| U.S. dollar appreciates                                     | $   /thinspace12   | $    16            | $ (68)                        | $  (60)                       | $ (56)                   | $  (44)                  |\n| U.S. dollar depreciates                                     | $  (12)            | $  (16)            | $   /thinspace  68            | $   60                        | $   /thinspace  56       | $   44                   |\n| 25 basis point change   in interest rates                   |                    |                    |                               |                               |                          |                          |\n| Interest rates increase                                     |                    |                    |                               |                               |                          |                          |\n| Canadian interest rate                                      | $ (9)              | $ (8)              | $   /thinspace  79            | $   76                        | $   /thinspace  70       | $   68                   |\n| U.S. interest rate                                          | $   -

The fair values are determined directly by reference to quoted market prices in active markets.\n\nThe fair values of our investment financial assets are based on quoted market prices in active markets or other clear and objective evidence of fair value.\n\nThe fair value of our long-term debt, excluding leases, is based on quoted market prices in active markets.\n\nThe fair values of the derivative financial instruments we use to manage our exposure to currency risk are estimated based on either quoted market prices in active markets for the same or similar financial instruments or the current rates offered to us for financial instruments of the same maturity, as well as discounted future cash flows determined using current rates for similar financial instruments of similar maturities subject to similar risks (such fair value estimates being largely based on the Canadian dollar: U.S. dollar forward exchange rate as at the statements of financial position dates). The fair values of the derivative financial instruments we use to manage our exposure to price risk associated with the purchase of electrical power are currently estimated using a discounted cash flow approach and are based on industry standard forecasts from EDC Associates Ltd. utilizing observable market data. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Level 3 derivative financial instruments were wind discount, reflecting 77% (2022 - 78%) of the electrical power pool price, and solar premium, reflecting 125% (2022 - 125%) of the electrical power pool price.",

Segment information\n\n## General\n\nOperating segments are components of an entity that engage in business activities from which they earn revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses related to transactions with the other component(s)), the operations of which can be clearly distinguished and for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by a chief operating decision-maker to make resource allocation decisions and to assess performance. Effective September 1, 2022, we embarked upon the modification of our internal and external reporting processes, systems and internal controls concurrent with the acquisition and integration of LifeWorks Inc. and correspondingly we are assessing our segmented reporting structure.\n\nThe TELUS technology solutions segment includes: network revenues and equipment sales arising from mobile technologies; data revenues (which include internet protocol; television; hosting, managed information technology and cloud-based services; and home and business security); healthcare services, software and technology solutions (including employee and family assistance programs and benefits administration); agriculture and consumer goods services (software, data management and data analytics-driven smart-food chain and consumer goods technologies); voice and other telecommunications services revenues; and equipment sales.\n\nThe digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International (DLCX) segment, which has the U.S. dollar as its primary functional currency, is comprised of digital customer experience and digital-enablement transformation solutions, including artificial intelligence and content management, provided by our TELUS International (Cda) Inc. subsidiary.\n\nIntersegment sales are recorded at the exchange value, which is the amount agreed to by the parties.",

In our specific instance, this is relevant to our investments in Canadian subsidiaries and Canadian partnerships. We are not required to recognize such deferred income tax liabilities, as we are in a position to control the timing and manner of the reversal of the temporary differences, which would not be expected to be exigible to income tax, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. We are in a position to control the timing and manner of the reversal of the temporary differences in respect of our non-Canadian subsidiaries, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n## (c) Other\n\nWe conduct research and development activities, which may be eligible to earn Investment Tax Credits. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded Investment Tax Credits of $25 million (2022 - $11 million). Of this amount, $19 million (2022 - $9 million) was recorded as a reduction of property, plant and equipment and/or intangible assets and the balance was recorded as a reduction of goods and services

Each restricted share unit is nominally equal in value to one equity share and is nominally entitled to the dividends that would arise thereon if it were an issued and outstanding equity share. Notional dividends are recorded as additional issuances of restricted share units during the life of the restricted share unit. Due to the notional dividend mechanism, the grant-date fair value of restricted share units equals the fair market value of the corresponding equity shares at the grant date, other than for the notional subset of our restricted share units affected by the relative total shareholder return performance condition (for which a grant-date fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation). Restricted share units generally become payable when vesting is complete; TELUS Corporation restricted share units typically vest over a period of 33 months (the requisite service period) and TELUS International (Cda) Inc. restricted share units typically vest over a period of 48 months (the requisite service period). The vesting method of restricted share units, which is determined on or before the date of grant, may be either cliff or graded; the majority of TELUS Corporation restricted share units outstanding are cliff-vesting and the majority of TELUS International (Cda) Inc. restricted share units outstanding are graded-vesting. Accounting for restricted share units, either as equity instruments or as liability instruments, is based upon\n\nthe expected manner of their settlement when they are granted. Grants of TELUS Corporation restricted share units prior to fiscal 2019, and grants of TELUS International (Cda) Inc. restricted share units prior to fiscal 2021, were accounted for as liability instruments, as the associated obligations were normally expected to be cash-settled when granted.\n\n## TELUS Corporation restricted share units\n\nWe also award restricted share units that largely have the same features as our general restricted share units, but have a variable payout (0% - 200%) that depends upon the achievement of our total customer connections performance condition (with a weighting of 25%) and the total shareholder return on TELUS Corporation Common Shares relative to an international peer group of telecommunications companies (with a weighting of 75%). The grant-date fair value of the notional subset of our restricted share units affected by the total customer connections performance condition equals the fair market value of the corresponding TELUS Corporation Common Shares at the grant date, and thus the notional subset has been included in the presentation of our restricted share units with only service conditions. Reflecting a variable payout, we estimate the fair value of the notional subset of our restricted share units affected by the relative total shareholder return performance condition using a Monte Carlo simulation. Grants of restricted share units in 2023 and 2022 are accounted for as equity-settled, as that was the expected manner of their settlement when granted.",

We apply the fair value method of accounting for share-based compensation awards granted to officers and other employees. Share option awards typically have a three-year vesting period (the requisite service period). The vesting method of share option awards, which is determined on or before the date of grant, may be either cliff or graded; all TELUS Corporation share option awards granted subsequent to 2004 have been cliff-vesting.\n\nThe weighted average fair value of share option awards granted is calculated by using the Black-Scholes model (a closed-form option pricing model). The risk-free interest rate used in determining the fair value of the share option awards is based on a Government of Canada yield curve that is current at the time of grant. The expected lives of the share option awards are based on our historical share option award exercise data. Similarly, expected volatility considers the historical volatility in the price of our Common Shares in respect of TELUS Corporation share options and the average historical volatility in the prices of a peer group's shares, and in the price of TELUS International (Cda) Inc.'s shares in respect of TELUS International (Cda) Inc. share options. The dividend yield is the annualized dividend current at the time of grant divided by the share option award exercise price. Dividends are not paid on unexercised share option awards and are not subject to vesting.\n\n## TELUS Corporation share options\n\nEmployees may be granted share option awards to purchase TELUS Corporation Common Shares at an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the time of grant. Share option awards granted under the plan may be exercised over specific periods not to exceed seven years from the date of grant.\n\nThese share option awards have a net-equity settlement feature. The optionee does not have the choice of exercising the net-equity settlement feature; it is at our option whether the exercise of a share option award is settled as a share option or settled using the net-equity settlement feature.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the activity related to the TELUS Corporation share option plan.\n\n| Years ended December 31          | 2023                     | 2023                                   | 2022                      | 2022                                  |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                  | Number of  share options | Weighted  average share  option price1 | Number of   share options | Weighted  average share  option price |\n| Outstanding, beginning of period | 2,755,300                | $  22.05                               | 3,050,300                 | $  22.04                              |\n| Exercised2                       | (774,899)                | $  21.35                               | -                         | $         -                           |\n| Forfeited                        | (201,500)                | $  22.1 1                              | (295,000)                 | $  21.93                              |\n| Outstanding, end of period       | 1,778,901                | $  22.35                               | 2,755,300                 | $  22.05                              |\n| Exercisable, end of period       | 1,518,901                | $  21.73                               | -                         | $         -                           |\n\n- 1 The weighted average remaining contractual life is 3.3 years.\n- 2 For the year ended December 31, 2023, the weighted average price at the dates of exercise was $24.67.\n\n## TELUS International (Cda) Inc. share options\n\nEmployees may be granted equity share options (equity-settled) to purchase TELUS International (Cda) Inc. subordinate voting shares at a price equal to, or a multiple of, the fair market value at the time of grant and/or phantom share options (cash-settled) that provide them with exposure to appreciation in the TELUS International (Cda) Inc. subordinate voting share price.

overview\n\nWe have a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans that provide pension and other retirement and post-employment benefits to most of our employees. As at December 31, 2023 and 2022, all registered defined benefit pension plans were closed to substantially all new participants and substantially all benefits had vested. The benefit plans in which our employees are participants reflect developments in our corporate history.\n\nInterim estimated solvency ratios as at December 31, 2023, ranged from 117% to 131% (2022 - updated estimate is 115% to 129%; interim estimate was 117% to 126%) and the estimated three-year average solvency ratios, adjusted as required by the PBSR, ranged from 112% to 126% (2022 - updated estimate is 102% to 118%; interim estimate was 104% to 118%).\n\nThe solvency valuation effectively uses the fair value (excluding any asset ceiling limit effects) of the funded defined benefit pension plan assets (adjusted for theoretical wind-up expenses) to measure the solvency valuation assets. Although the defined benefit obligations accrued and the solvency valuation liabilities are calculated similarly, the assumptions used for each differ, primarily in respect of retirement ages and discount rates, and the solvency valuation liabilities, due to the required assumption that each plan is terminated on the valuation date, do not reflect assumptions about future compensation levels. Relative to the experience-based estimates of retirement ages used for purposes of determining the defined benefit obligations accrued, the minimum no-consent retirement age used for solvency valuation purposes may result in either a greater or lesser pension liability, depending upon the provisions of each plan. The solvency positions in this table reflect composite weighted average discount rates of 4.7% (2022 - 4.9%). A hypothetical decrease of 25 basis points in the composite weighted average discount rate would result in a $207 decrease in the PBSR solvency position as at December 31, 2023 (2022 - $182); these sensitivities are hypothetical, should be used with caution, are calculated without changing any other assumption and generally cannot be extrapolated because changes in amounts may not be linear.\n\n## TELUS Corporation Pension Plan\n\nManagement and professional employees in Alberta who joined us prior to January 1, 2001, and certain unionized employees who joined us prior to June 9, 2011, are covered by this contributory defined benefit pension plan, which comprises slightly more than one-half of our total defined benefit obligation accrued. The plan contains a supplemental benefit account that may provide indexation of up to 70% of the annual increase in a specified cost-of-living index. Pensionable remuneration is determined by the average of the best five years of remuneration in the last ten consecutive years preceding retirement.",

        "page_content": "## Pension Plan for Management and Professional Employees of TELUS Corporation\n\nThis defined benefit pension plan, which with certain limited exceptions ceased accepting new participants on January 1, 2006, and which comprises approximately one-quarter of our total defined benefit obligation accrued, provides a non-contributory base level of pension benefits. Additionally, on a contributory basis, employees annually can choose increased and/or enhanced levels of pension benefits above the base level. At an enhanced level of pension benefits, the plan has indexation of 100% of the annual increase in a specified cost-of-living index, to an annual maximum of 2%. Pensionable remuneration is determined by the annualized average of the best 60 consecutive months of remuneration.\n\n## TELUS Qu\u00e9bec Defined Benefit Pension Plan\n\nThis contributory defined benefit pension plan, which ceased accepting new participants on April 14, 2009, covers any employee not governed by a collective agreement in Quebec who joined us prior to April 1, 2006, any non-supervisory employee governed by a collective agreement who joined us prior to September 6, 2006, and certain other unionized employees. The plan comprises approximately one-tenth of our total defined benefit obligation accrued. The plan has no indexation and pensionable remuneration is determined by the average of the best four years of remuneration.\n\n## TELUS Edmonton Pension Plan\n\nThis contributory defined benefit pension plan ceased accepting new participants on January 1, 1998. Indexation is 60% of the annual increase in a specified cost-of-living index and pensionable remuneration is determined by the annualized average of the best 60 consecutive months of remuneration. The plan comprises less than one-tenth of our total defined benefit obligation accrued.\n\n## Other defined benefit pension plans\n\nIn addition to the foregoing plans, we have non-registered, non-contributory supplementary defined benefit pension plans, which have the effect of maintaining the pension benefit earned once the allowable maximums in the registered plans are attained. As is common with non-registered plans of this nature, these plans are typically funded only as benefits are paid. These plans comprise less than 5% of our total defined benefit obligation accrued.\n\n## Telecommunication Workers Pension Plan\n\nCertain employees in British Columbia are covered by a negotiated-cost, target-benefit union pension plan. Our contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labour contracts, and are generally based on employee gross earnings. We are not required to guarantee the benefits or assure the solvency of the plan, and we are not liable to the plan for other participating employers' obligations. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our contributions comprised a significant proportion of the employer contributions to this union pension plan; similarly, our active and retired employees represented a significant proportion of the plan participants.\n\n## British Columbia Public Service Pension Plan\n\nCertain employees in British Columbia are covered by a public service pension plan. Contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of labour contracts negotiated by the Province of British Columbia and are generally based on employee gross earnings.\n\n## Defined contribution pension plans\n\nWe primarily offer and sponsor three defined contribution pension plans, which are contributory, that are available to our non-unionized and certain of our unionized employees. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, employees could generally choose to contribute to the plans at a rate of between 3% and 10% of their pensionable earnings; generally, we match 100% of contributions of employees up to 5% of their pensionable earnings and 80% of contributions of employees between 5% and 6% of their pensionable earnings. Membership in a defined contribution pension plan is generally voluntary until an employee's third-year service anniversary. In the event that annual contributions exceed allowable maximums, excess amounts are in certain cases contributed to a non-registered supplementary defined contribution savings plan.\n\n## Other defined benefit plans\n\nOther defined benefit plans, all of which are non-contributory and, as at December 31, 2023 and 2022, non-funded, included a healthcare plan for retired employees and a life insurance plan, both of which ceased accepting new participants on January 1, 1997.\n\n## (c) Plan investment strategies and policies\n\nOur primary goal for the defined benefit pension plans is to ensure the security of the retirement income and other benefits of the plan members and their beneficiaries. A secondary goal is to maximize the long-term rate of return on the defined benefit plans' assets within a level of risk acceptable to us.\n\n## Risk management\n\nWe consider absolute risk (the risk of contribution increases, inadequate plan surplus and unfunded obligations) to be more important than relative return risk. Accordingly, the defined benefit plans' designs, the nature and maturity of defined benefit obligations and the characteristics of the plans' memberships significantly influence investment strategies and policies. We manage risk by specifying allowable and prohibited investment types, setting diversification strategies and determining target asset allocations.\n\n## Allowable and prohibited investment types\n\nAllowable and prohibited investment types, along with associated guidelines and limits, are set out in each plan's required Statement of Investment Policies and Procedures (SIP&P), which is reviewed and approved annually by the designated governing body. The SIP&P guidelines and limits are further governed by the permitted investments and lending limits set out in the Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985 . As well as conventional investments, each fund's SIP&P may provide for the use of derivative financial instruments to facilitate investment operations and to manage risk, provided that no short position is taken and no guidelines and limits established in the SIP&P are violated. Internally and externally managed funds are not permitted to invest directly in our securities or those of our subsidiaries.\n\n## Diversification\n\nOur strategy for investments in equity securities is to be broadly diversified across individual securities, industry sectors and geographical regions. A meaningful portion (20% - 30% of total plan assets) of the plans' investments in equity securities is allocated to foreign equity securities, with the intent of further diversifying plan assets. Investments in debt securities may include a",

Debt securities may also include real return bonds to provide inflation protection, consistent with the indexed nature of some defined benefit obligations. Real estate investments are used to provide diversification of plan assets, hedging of potential long-term inflation and comparatively stable investment income.\n\n## Relationship between plan assets and benefit obligations\n\nWith the objective of lowering the long-term costs of our defined benefit pension plans, we purposely mismatch plan assets and benefit obligations. This mismatching is effected by\n\nincluding equity investments in the long-term asset mix, as well as fixed income securities and mortgages with durations that differ from those of the benefit obligations.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the present value-weighted average timing of estimated cash flows for the obligations (duration) of the defined benefit pension plans was 12.0 years (2022 - 11.4 years). Compensation for liquidity issues that may otherwise have arisen from the mismatching of plan assets and benefit obligations is provided by broadly diversified investment holdings (including cash and

These significant estimates are of a long-term nature, consistent with the nature of employee future benefits.\n\n## Demographic assumptions\n\nIn determining the defined benefit pension expense recognized in net income for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we utilized the Canadian Institute of Actuaries CPM 2014 mortality tables.\n\n## Financial assumptions\n\nThe discount rate, which is used to determine a plan's defined benefit obligations accrued, is based upon the yield on long-term, high-quality, fixed-term investments, and is set annually. The rate of future increases in compensation is based upon current benefits policies and economic forecasts.\n\nThe significant weighted average actuarial assumptions arising from these estimates and used to determine our defined benefit obligations accrued are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                 | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Mortality assumptions used to determine defined benefit obligations   accrued as at December 31 |        |        |\n| Life expectancy at 65 for a member currently at age 65 (years)                                  | 24.2   | 24.2   |\n| Discount rate1 used to determine:                                                               |        |        |\n| Net benefit costs for the year ended December 31                                                | 5.05 % | 2.95 % |\n| Defined benefit obligations accrued as at December 31                                           | 4.65 % | 5.05 % |\n| Current service cost in subsequent fiscal year                                                  | 4.65 % | 5.05 % |\n| Rate of future increases in compensation used to determine:                                     |        |        |\n| Net benefit costs for the year ended December 31                                                | 3.00 % | 3.00 % |\n| Defined benefit obligations accrued as at December 31                                           | 3.00 % | 3.00 % |\n\n## Sensitivity of key assumptions\n\nThe sensitivity of our key assumptions for our defined benefit pension plans was as follows:\n\n/thinspace(3 )\n\n| Years ended, or as at, December 31                                                          |                        | 2023                | 2022                   | 2022                |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------|\n| Increase (decrease) (millions)                                                              | Change in  obligations | Change in  expenses | Change in  obligations | Change in  expenses |\n| Sensitivity of key demographic assumptions   to an increase of one year1 in life expectancy | $  238                 | $ 8                 | $  213                 | $  1 1              |\n| Sensitivity of key financial assumptions   to a decrease of 25 basis points1 in:            |                        |                     |                        |                     |\n| Discount rate                                                                               | $  256                 | $  10               | $  238                 | $  16               |\n| Rate of future increases in compensation                                                    | $   /thinspace(23)     | $   /thinspace(2)   | $   (20)               | $                   |\n\n- 1 These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. Favourable hypothetical changes in the assumptions result in decreased amounts, and unfavourable hypothetical changes in the assumptions result in increased amounts, of obligations and expenses (both employee benefit expense and financing cost). Changes in amounts based on a variation in assumptions of one year or 25 basis points generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in an assumption to the change in amounts may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the change in obligations or change in expenses is calculated without changing any other assumption; in reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, an increase in the discount rate may result in changes in expectations about the rate of future increases in compensation), which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.\n\n## (e) Employer contributions\n\nThe determination of the minimum funding amounts necessary for substantially all of our registered defined benefit pension plans is governed by the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 , which requires that current service costs be funded, and that both going-concern and solvency valuations be performed on a specified periodic basis.\n\n- \u00b7 Any excess of plan assets over plan liabilities determined in the going-concern valuation reduces our minimum funding requirement for current service costs, but may not reduce the requirement to an amount less than the employees' contributions. The going-concern valuation generally determines the excess (if any) of a plan's assets over its liabilities on a projected benefit basis.\n- \u00b7 As of the date of these consolidated financial statements, the solvency valuation generally requires that a plan's average solvency valuation liabilities (determined on the basis that the plan is terminated on the valuation date) in excess of its assets (if any) be funded, at a minimum, in equal annual amounts over a period not exceeding five years. So as to manage the risk of overfunding the plans, which results from the solvency valuation utilizing average solvency ratios for funding purposes, our funding may include the provision of letters of credit. As at December 31, 2023, undrawn letters of credit in the amount of $NIL (2022 - $49 million) secured certain obligations of the defined benefit pension plans.\n\nOur best estimate of fiscal 2024 employer contributions to our defined benefit plans is approximately $10 million for registered defined benefit pension plans. This estimate is based upon the mid-year 2023 annual funding valuations that were prepared by actuaries using December 31, 2022, actuarial valuations. The funding reports are based on the pension plans' fiscal years, which are calendar years. The next annual funding valuations are expected to be prepared mid-year 2024.\n\n## Future benefit payments\n\nEstimated future benefit payments from our funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans, calculated as at December 31, 2023, are as follows:\n\n| Years ending December 31 (millions)   | Funded   | Unfunded   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| 2024                                  | $  477   | $  12      | $  489  |\n| 2025                                  | 489      | 12         | 501     |\n| 2026                                  | 496      | 13         | 509     |\n| 2027                                  | 501      | 13         | 514     |\n| 2028                                  | 507      | 13         | 520     |\n| 2029 - 2033                           | 2,613    | 74         | 2,687   |",

We may also incur atypical charges when undertaking major or transformational changes to our business or operating models or post-acquisition business integration. In other costs, we include incremental atypical external costs incurred in connection with business acquisition or disposition activity; significant litigation costs in respect of losses or settlements; and adverse retrospective regulatory decisions.\n\nRestructuring and other costs are presented in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income, as set out in the accompanying table.\n\n| Years ended December 31 (millions)   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Restructuring1  (b)                  |        |        |\n| Goods and services purchased         | $  178 | $  118 |\n| Employee benefits expense            | 440    | 81     |\n|                                      | 618    | 199    |\n| Other  (c)                           |        |        |\n| Goods and services purchased         | 12     | 41     |\n| Employee benefits expense            | 87     | -      |\n|                                      | 99     | 41     |\n| Total                                |        |        |\n| Goods and services purchased         | 190    | 159    |\n| Employee benefits expense            | 527    | 81     |\n|                                      | $  717 | $  240 |\n\n## (g) Other defined benefit plans\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, other defined benefit plan current service cost was $10 million (2022 - $9 million) and employee defined benefit plan remeasurements in other comprehensive income were $(2) million (2022 - $NIL). Estimated future benefit payments from our other defined benefit plans, calculated as at December 31, 2023, are $1 million annually for the five-year period from 2024 to 2028 and $4 million for the five-year period from 2029 to 2033.\n\n## (b) Restructuring provisions\n\nEmployee-related provisions and other provisions, as presented in Note 25 , include amounts in respect of restructuring activities. In 2023, restructuring activities included ongoing and incremental efficiency initiatives, some of which involved personnel-related costs and rationalization of real estate. These initiatives were intended to improve our long-term operating productivity and competitiveness.\n\n## (c) Other\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, incremental external costs were incurred in connection with business acquisitions and collective bargaining activities. In connection with business acquisitions, non-recurring atypical business integration expenditures that would be considered neither restructuring costs nor part of the fair value of the net assets acquired have been included in other costs. Employee benefits expense is in respect of lump sum payments to substantially all of our existing unionized members of Telecommunications Workers Union, United Steelworkers Local 1944 (TWU), for the ratification of the new collective agreement, as discussed in Note 29(c) , and a lump sum past service cost defined benefit pension payment made in connection with collective commitments.",

We were the successful auction participant for 1,430 spectrum licences with a total purchase price of $620 million. In accordance with the auction terms, 20% ($124 million) was remitted to Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada on its due date, January 17, 2024, while the remaining balance will be paid on, or before, May 29, 2024. Until such time as Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada determines that we qualify as a radio communications carrier and comply with the Canadian Ownership and Control rules, we may not commercially use the licences.\n\n## (b) Business acquisitions\n\n## WillowTree\n\nOn October 27, 2022, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire WillowTree, a full-service digital product provider focused on end-user experiences, such as native mobile applications and unified web interfaces. On January 3, 2023, subsequent to the satisfaction of the closing conditions, WillowTree was acquired through our TELUS International (Cda) Inc. subsidiary and has been consolidated within our digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International segment.\n\nThe acquisition brings key talent and diversity to our segment's portfolio of next-generation solutions, and further augments its digital consulting and client-centric software development capabilities. The primary factor that gave rise to the recognition of goodwill was the earnings capacity of the acquired business in excess of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired (such excess arising from the low level of tangible assets relative to the earnings capacity of the business). A portion of the amounts assigned to goodwill may be deductible for income tax purposes.\n\nIn respect of the acquired business, we concurrently provided written put options to the remaining selling shareholders for their approximate 14% economic interest, which will be settled subject to certain performance-based criteria and will become exercisable in tranches over a three-year period starting in 2026. The acquisition-date fair value of the puttable shares held by the non-controlling shareholders has been recorded as a provision in the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. The provision may be settled in cash or, at our option, in a combination of cash and up to 70% in TELUS International (Cda) Inc. subordinate voting shares. Concurrent with this acquisition, the non-controlling shareholders provided us with purchased call options, which substantially mirror the written put options.\n\nAs is customary in a business acquisition transaction, until the time of acquisition of control, we did not have full access to the books and records of WillowTree. Upon having sufficient time to review the books and records of WillowTree, as well as obtaining new and additional information about the related facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date, we will adjust provisional amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and thus finalize our purchase price allocation.\n\n## Individually immaterial transactions\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we acquired 100% ownership of businesses that were complementary to our existing lines of business. The primary factor that gave rise to the recognition of goodwill was the earnings capacity of the acquired businesses in excess of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired (such excess arising from the low level of tangible assets relative to the earnings capacity of the businesses). A portion of the amounts assigned to goodwill may be deductible for income tax purposes.\n\n## Acquisition-date fair values\n\nAcquisition-date fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the following table:\n\n5\n\n2\n\n5\n\n7\n\n| (millions)                                 | WillowTree1   | Individually  immaterial  transactions1   | Total    |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Assets                                     |               |                                           |          |\n| Current assets                             |               |                                           |          |\n| Cash                                       | $         7   | $      6                                  | $ 13     |\n| Accounts receivable2                       | 84            | 14                                        | 98       |\n| Other                                      | 3             | 2                                         |          |\n|                                            | 94            | 22                                        | 116      |\n| Non-current assets                         |               |                                           |          |\n| Property, plant and equipment              |               |                                           |          |\n| Owned assets                               | 20            | 32                                        | 52       |\n| Right-of-use lease assets                  | 27            | 1                                         | 28       |\n| Intangible assets subject to amortization3 | 947           | 50                                        | 997      |\n|                                            | 994           | 83                                        | 1,077    |\n| Total identifiable assets acquired         | 1,088         | 105                                       | 1,193    |\n| Liabilities                                |               |                                           |          |\n| Current liabilities                        |               |                                           |          |\n| Short-term borrowings                      | -             | 2                                         |          |\n| Accounts payable and accrued liabilities   | 50            | 17                                        | 67       |\n| Income and other taxes payable             | 4             | 1                                         |          |\n| Advance billings and customer deposits     | 5             | 2                                         |          |\n| Current maturities of long-term debt       | 126           | 1                                         | 127      |\n|                                            | 185           | 23                                        | 208      |\n| Non-current liabilities                    |               |                                           |          |\n| Long-term debt                             | 22            | 28                                        | 50       |\n| Deferred income taxes                      | 94            | 8                                         | 102      |\n|                                            | 116           | 36                                        | 152      |\n| Total liabilities assumed                  | 301           | 59                                        | 360      |\n| Net identifiable assets acquired           | 787           | 46                                        | 833      |\n| Goodwill                                   | 819           | 156                                       | 975      |\n| Net assets acquired                        | $  1,606      | $  202                                    | $  1,808 |",

The pro forma supplemental information is not necessarily indicative of our consolidated financial results in future periods or the actual results that would have been realized had the business acquisitions been completed at the beginning of the period presented. The pro forma supplemental information includes incremental depreciation of property, plant and equipment, amortization of intangible assets, financing and other charges incurred as a result of the acquisitions, net of the related tax effects.\n\n## (c) Business acquisitions - prior period\n\nIn 2022, we acquired businesses that were complementary to our existing lines of business. As at December 31, 2022, purchase price allocations had not been finalized. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the preliminary acquisition-date fair values for accounts receivable, income and other taxes receivable, customer relationships, software, goodwill, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and deferred income tax liabilities were increased by $19 million, decreased by $19 million, decreased by $118 million, increased by $179 million, decreased by $38 million, increased by $5 million, and increased by $18 million, respectively; as required by IFRS-IASB, comparative amounts have been adjusted so as to reflect those increases (decreases) effective the dates of acquisition.\n\n## (d) Intangible assets with indefinite lives - spectrum licences\n\nOur intangible assets with indefinite lives include spectrum licences granted by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, which are used for the provision of both mobile and fixed wireless services. The spectrum licence policy terms indicate that the licences will likely be renewed. We expect our spectrum licences to be renewed every 20 years following a review of our compliance with licence terms. In addition to current usage, our licensed spectrum can be used for planned and new technologies. As a result of our assessment of the combination of these significant factors, we currently consider our spectrum licences to have indefinite lives and, as referred to in Note 1(b) , this represents a significant judgment for us.\n\n## (e) Impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill\n\n## General\n\nAs referred to in Note 1(f) , the carrying values of intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill are periodically tested for impairment and, as referred to in Note 1(b) , this test represents a significant estimate for us, while also requiring significant judgments to be made.\n\nThe carrying values allocated to the cash-generating units' intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill are set out in the following table.\n\n| As at December 31 (millions)                             | 2023      | 2022      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Intangible assets with indefinite lives                  |           |           |\n| TELUS technology solutions                               | $  12,250 | $  12,215 |\n| Goodwill                                                 |           |           |\n| TELUS technology solutions                               | 7,296     | 7,137     |\n| Digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International | 2,762     | 1,994     |\n|                                                          | 10,058    | 9,131     |\n|                                                          | $  22,308 | $  21,346 |\n\nThe recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units' assets have been determined based on a fair value less costs of disposal calculation. There is a material degree of uncertainty with respect to the estimates of the recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units' assets, given the necessity of making key economic assumptions about the future. Recoverable amounts based on fair value less costs of disposal calculations are categorized as Level 3 fair value measures.",

        "page_content": "We validate the results of our recoverable amounts calculations through a market-comparable approach and an analytical review of industry facts and facts that are specific to us. The marketcomparable approach uses current (at time of test) market consensus estimates and equity trading prices for U.S. and Canadian firms in the same industry. In addition, we ensure that the combination of the valuations of the cash-generating units is reasonable based on our current (at time of test) market value.\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nThe fair value less costs of disposal calculation uses discounted cash flow projections that employ the following key assumptions: future cash flows and growth projections (including judgments about the allocation of future capital expenditures to support both mobile and fixed operations); associated economic risk assumptions and estimates of the likelihood of achieving key operating metrics and drivers; estimates of future generational infrastructure capital expenditures; and the future weighted average cost of capital. We consider a range of reasonably possible amounts for use as key assumptions and decide upon amounts that represent management's best estimates of market amounts. In the normal course, we make changes to key assumptions so that they reflect current (at time of test) economic conditions, updates of historical information used to develop the key assumptions and changes (if any) in our debt ratings.\n\nThe key assumptions for cash flow projections are based upon our approved financial forecasts, which span a period of three years and are discounted, for December 2023 annual\n\n## 19 Leases\n\nWe have the right of use of land, buildings and equipment under leases. Most of our leases for real estate that we use for office, retail or network (including mobile site) purposes typically have options to extend the lease terms, which we use to protect our investments in leasehold improvements (including mobile site equipment) and to mitigate relocation risk, and/or which reflect the importance of the underlying real estate right-of-use lease assets to our operations. Judgments about lease terms are determinative of the measurement of right-of-use lease assets and the associated lease liabilities. Our judgment in respect of lease terms for leased real estate utilized in connection with our telecommunications infrastructure, more so than for any other right-of-use lease assets, routinely includes periods covered by options to extend the lease terms, as we are reasonably certain that we will choose to extend such leases.\n\nIn the normal course of operations, there are future non-executory cash outflows in respect of leases to which we are potentially exposed and which are not included in our lease liabilities as at the reporting date. A significant portion (approximately one-third) of our mobile site lease payments have consumer price index-based price adjustments and such adjustments will result in future periodic re-measurements of the lease liabilities, with commensurate adjustments to the associated real estate right-of-use lease assets (and associated future depreciation amounts); these adjustments would represent our current variable lease payments. As well, we routinely and necessarily commit to leases that have not yet commenced.\n\nimpairment test purposes, at a consolidated post-tax notional rate of 6.6% (2022 - 6.6%) and 9.8% (2022 - 9.5%) for the TELUS technology solutions and the digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International cash-generating units, respectively. These cash flow projections incorporate established corporate targets with respect to operational net carbon neutrality, renewable energy, energy efficiency and waste reduction. For impairment testing valuations, cash flows subsequent to the three-year projection period are extrapolated, for December 2023 annual impairment test purposes, generally using perpetual growth rates of 1.95% (2022 1.95%) and 3.0% (2022 - 3.0%) for the TELUS technology solutions cash-generating unit and the digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International cash-generating unit, respectively; these growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rates observed in the markets in which we operate.\n\nWe believe that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which our calculation of the recoverable amounts of our cash-generating units is based would not cause the cash-generating units' carrying values (including the intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill allocated to each cash-generating unit) to exceed their recoverable amounts. If the future were to adversely differ from management's best estimates for the key assumptions and associated cash flows were to be materially adversely affected, we could potentially experience future material impairment charges in respect of our intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill.\n\nAs mandated by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, telecommunications companies are obligated to allow, on their real estate assets owned, on their real estate right-of-use lease assets and/or on equipment they own that is situated on real estate right-of-use lease assets, competitors to co-locate telecommunications infrastructure equipment. Of the real estate right-ofuse lease assets we use for the purpose of situating telecommunications infrastructure equipment, less than one-fifth have co-location subleases that we, as lessor, account for as operating leases.\n\nMaturity analyses of lease liabilities are set out in Note 4(c) and Note 26(i) ; the period interest expense in respect thereof is set out in Note 9 . The additions to, the depreciation charges for, and the carrying amounts of, right-of-use lease assets are set out in Note 17 . We have not currently elected to exclude low-value and short-term leases from lease accounting.\n\n| Years ended December 31 (millions)                                | Note   | 2023   | 2022     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Income from subleasing right-of-use lease assets                  |        |        |          |\n| Co-location sublet revenue included in operating service revenues |        | $ 17   | $ 18     |\n| Other sublet revenue included in other income                     | 7      | $   5  | $      5 |\n| Lease payments                                                    |        | $  671 | $  571   |",

The new-build tower, completed in 2020, was to be built to the LEED Platinum standard for the commercial portion and the Gold standard for the residential portion; activities to obtain LEED certification are underway. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the TELUS Sky real estate joint venture entered into an agreement to sell the income-producing properties and the related net assets to the venture partners; the two arm's-length parties will purchase the residential parcel and we will purchase the commercial parcel. Timing for the closing of these sales and purchases is dependent upon timing for the subdivision of the parcels, as well as other customary closing conditions.\n\n## Summarized financial information\n\n| Years ended December 31 (millions)                 | 2023              | 2022    |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------|\n| Revenue                                            | $   /thinspace26  | $   20  |\n| Depreciation and amortization1                     | $   /thinspace  7 | $     8 |\n| Interest expense                                   | $   /thinspace  9 | $     8 |\n| Net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss)2 | $  (20)           | $  (16) |\n\nIn 2023, we partnered, as equals, with an arm's-length party in residential real estate redevelopment projects in Vancouver, British Columbia.",

        "page_content": "We have entered into lease agreements with the TELUS Sky real estate joint venture. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the TELUS Sky real estate joint venture recognized $9 million (2022 - $8 million) of revenue from our office tenancy; of this amount, as at the statement of financial position date, one-third was due to our economic interest and two-thirds was due to our partners' economic interests.\n\n## Construction credit facilities\n\nThe TELUS Sky real estate joint venture has a credit agreement, maturing July 12, 2024 (2022 July 15, 2023), with Canadian financial institutions and others (as 662/3% lenders) and TELUS Corporation (as 331/3% lender), that provides $282 million (2022 - $342 million) of construction financing for the project. The construction credit facilities contain customary real estate construction financing representations, warranties and covenants and are secured by demand debentures constituting first fixed and floating charge mortgages over the underlying real estate assets.\n\n## 22 Short-term borrowings\n\nOn July 26, 2002, one of our subsidiaries, TELUS Communications Inc., entered into an agreement with an arm's-length securitization trust associated with a major Schedule I bank under which it is currently able to sell an interest in certain trade receivables up to a maximum of $600 million (unchanged from December 31, 2022). The term of this revolving-period securitization agreement ends December 31, 2024 (unchanged from December 31, 2022), and it requires minimum cash proceeds of $100 million from monthly sales of interests in certain trade receivables. TELUS Communications Inc. is required to maintain a credit rating of at least BB (unchanged from December 31, 2022) from DBRS Limited or the securitization trust may require that the sale program be wound down prior to the end of the term.\n\n## 23 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities\n\n| As at December 31 (millions)                   | 2023     | 2022     |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Accrued liabilities                            | $  1,342 | $  1,593 |\n| Payroll and other employee-related liabilities | 674      | 656      |\n| Restricted share units liability               | -        | 1        |\n|                                                | 2,016    | 2,250    |\n| Trade accounts payable1                        | 996      | 1,382    |\n| Interest payable                               | 235      | 206      |\n| Indirect taxes payable and other               | 144      | 114      |\n|                                                | $  3,391 | $  3,952 |\n\nThe construction credit facilities are available by way of bankers' acceptance or prime loan and bear interest at rates in line with similar construction financing facilities.\n\n## (b) Investments in associates\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, we had a 43% (2022 - 32%) equity interest in Miovision Technologies Incorporated, an associate that is incorporated in Canada and is complementary to, and is viewed to grow, our existing Internet of Things business; our judgment is that we obtained significant influence over the associate concurrent with acquiring our initial equity interest. Miovision Technologies Incorporated is developing a suite of hardware and cloud-based solutions that provide cities with the data and tools they need to reduce traffic congestion, make better urban planning decisions and improve safety on their roads. Our aggregate interests in Miovision Technologies Incorporated and in other individually immaterial associates as at December 31, 2023, totalled $184 million (2022 - $75 million) and $48 million (2022 - $45 million), respectively.\n\nSales of trade receivables in securitization transactions are recognized as collateralized short-term borrowings and thus do not result in our de-recognition of the trade receivables sold. When we sell our trade receivables, we retain reserve accounts, which are retained interests in the securitized trade receivables, and servicing rights. As at December 31, 2023, we had sold to the trust (but continued to recognize) trade receivables of $121 million (2022 - $118 million). Short-term borrowings of $100 million (2022 - $100 million) are comprised of amounts advanced to us by the arm's-length securitization trust pursuant to the sale of trade receivables.\n\nThe balance of short-term borrowings (if any) is comprised of amounts drawn on bilateral bank facilities and/or other.\n\n- 1 The composition of trade accounts payable varies due to factors that include suppliers' invoice timing, data processing cycle timing and the seasonal nature of some business activities, as well as whether the statement of financial position date is a business day. Trade accounts payable represent future payments for invoices received in respect of both operating and capital activities, and may include amounts for assessed and self-assessed government remittances.\n\nInitiated in 2023, we have a supply chain financing program that allows suppliers of qualifying trade accounts payable to choose to be paid in advance of industry-standard payment terms by an arm's-length third party; in turn, we reimburse the arm's-length third party for those payments when the trade accounts payable would otherwise have been due.",

Provisions for some written put options are determined based on the net present value of estimated future earnings, and such provisions require us to make key economic assumptions about the future. Similarly, we have established provisions for contingent consideration. No cash outflows in respect of the written put options are expected prior to their initial exercisability, and no cash outflows in respect of contingent consideration are expected prior to completion of the periods during which the contingent consideration can be earned; in some instances, settlement of the provision for written put options may include the use of equity instruments.\n\n## 26 Long-term debt\n\n## (a) Details of long-term debt\n\n| As at December 31 (millions)                   | Note   | 2023      | 2022      |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|\n| Senior unsecured                               |        |           |           |\n| TELUS Corporation senior notes                 | (b)    | $  20,301 | $  18,660 |\n| TELUS Corporation commercial paper             | (c)    | 1,021     | 1,458     |\n| TELUS Corporation credit facilities            | (d)    | 1,144     | 1,145     |\n| TELUS Communications Inc. debentures           | (e)    | 200       | 199       |\n| Secured                                        |        |           |           |\n| TELUS International (Cda) Inc. credit facility | (f)    | 1,781     | 914       |\n| Other                                          | (g)    | 288       | 321       |\n|                                                |        | 24,735    | 22,697    |\n| Lease liabilities                              | (h)    | 2,614     | 2,340     |\n| Long-term debt                                 |        | $  27,349 | $  25,037 |\n| Current                                        |        | $ 3,994   | $ 2,541   |\n| Non-current                                    |        | 23,355    | 22,496    |\n| Long-term debt                                 |        | $  27,349 | $  25,037 |\n\n## Other\n\nThe provisions for other include: legal claims; non-employee-related restructuring activities; and contract termination costs and onerous contracts related to business acquisitions.

In respect of legal claims, we establish provisions, when warranted, after taking into account legal assessments, information presently available, and the expected availability of recourse. The timing of cash outflows associated with legal claims cannot be reasonably determined.\n\nIn connection with business acquisitions, we have established provisions for contract termination costs and onerous contracts acquired.\n\n## (b) TELUS Corporation senior notes\n\nThe notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated obligations, are senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness, and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future obligations of, or guaranteed by, our subsidiaries. The indentures governing the notes contain covenants that, among other things, place limitations on our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to: grant security in respect of indebtedness; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; and incur new indebtedness.\n\nInterest is payable semi-annually. The notes require us to make an offer to repurchase them at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase upon the occurrence of a change in control triggering event, as defined in the supplemental trust indenture.\n\nAt any time prior to the respective maturity dates set out in the table below, the notes issued prior to September 2023 are redeemable at our option, in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, on not fewer than 30 days' and not more than 60 days' prior notice; for notes issued subsequent to August 2023, the notice period is not fewer than 10 days' and not more than 60 days' prior notice. On or after the respective redemption present value spread cessation dates set out in the table below, the notes issued prior to September 2023 are redeemable at our option, in whole but not in part, on not fewer than 30 days' and not more than 60 days' prior notice, at redemption prices equal to 100% of the principal amounts thereof; for notes issued subsequent to August 2023, the notice period is not fewer than 10 days' and not more than 60 days' prior notice. In addition, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid to the date fixed for redemption.",

This program enables us to issue commercial paper, subject to conditions related to debt ratings, up to a maximum aggregate equivalent amount at any one time of $2.0 billion (US$1.5 billion maximum). Foreign currency forward contracts are used to manage currency risk arising from issuing commercial paper denominated in U.S. dollars. Commercial paper debt is due within one year and is classified as a current portion of long-term debt, as the amounts are fully supported, and we expect that they will continue to be supported, by the revolving credit facility, which has no repayment requirements within the next year. As at December 31, 2023, we had $1.0 billion (2022 - $1.5 billion) of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was denominated in U.S. dollars (US$0.8 billion; 2022 - US$1.1 billion), with an effective average interest rate of 5.8%, maturing through June 2024.\n\n## (d) TELUS Corporation credit facilities\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, TELUS Corporation had an unsecured revolving $2.75 billion bank credit facility, expiring on July 14, 2028 (2022 - April 6, 2026), with a syndicate of financial institutions, which is to be used for general corporate purposes, including the backstopping of commercial paper.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, TELUS Corporation had an unsecured non-revolving $1.1 billion bank credit facility, maturing July 9, 2024, with a syndicate of financial institutions, which is to be used for general corporate purposes. As at December 31, 2023, we had drawn $1.1 billion on the non-revolving bank credit facility, with an effective average interest rate of 6.0% through January 2024.\n\nThe TELUS Corporation credit facilities bear interest at prime rate, U.S. Dollar Base Rate, a bankers' acceptance rate or term secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) (as such terms are used or defined in the credit facilities), plus applicable margins. The credit facilities contain customary representations, warranties and covenants, including two financial quarter-end ratio tests. These tests are that our leverage ratio must not exceed 4.25:1.00 and our operating cash flow to interest expense ratio must not be less than 2.00:1.00, all as defined in the credit facilities.\n\nContinued access to the TELUS Corporation credit facilities is not contingent upon TELUS Corporation maintaining a specific credit rating.\n\n| As at December 31 (millions)                                 | 2023     | 2022     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Net available                                                | $  1,729 | $  1,292 |\n| Backstop of commercial paper                                 | 1,021    | 1,458    |\n| Gross available revolving $2.75 billion bank credit facility | $  2,750 | $  2,750 |\n\nWe had $60 million of letters of credit outstanding as at December 31, 2023 (2022 - $119 million), issued under various uncommitted facilities; such letter of credit facilities are in addition to the ability to provide letters of credit pursuant to our committed revolving bank credit facility.\n\nWe had arranged $338 million of incremental letters of credit to allow us to participate in the Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada 3800 MHz band spectrum auction that was held in October-November 2023, as discussed further in Note 18(a) .\n\n## (e) TELUS Communications Inc. debentures\n\nThe 8.80% Series B Debentures were issued in the amount of $200 million in September 1995 at a price of $995.10 by a predecessor corporation of TELUS Communications Inc., AGT Limited, under a Trust Indenture dated August 24, 1994, and a supplemental trust indenture dated September 22, 1995. Interest is payable semi-annually. At any time prior to maturity in September 2025, the debentures are redeemable at our option, in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, on not fewer than 30 days' prior notice. The redemption price is equal to the greater of (i) the present value of the debentures discounted at the Government of Canada yield plus the redemption present value spread of 15 basis points, or (ii) 100% of the principal amount thereof. In addition, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid to the date fixed for redemption.\n\nThe debentures became obligations of TELUS Communications Inc. pursuant to an amalgamation on January 1, 2001, are not secured by any mortgage, pledge or other charge, and are governed by certain covenants, including a negative pledge and a limitation on issues of additional debt, subject to a debt to capitalization ratio and an interest coverage test. Effective June 12, 2009, TELUS Corporation guaranteed the payment of the debentures' principal and interest.\n\n## (f) TELUS International (Cda) Inc. credit facility\n\nAs at December 31, 2023 and 2022, TELUS International (Cda) Inc. had a credit facility, secured by its assets, expiring on January 3, 2028, with a syndicate of financial institutions, including TELUS Corporation. The credit facility is comprised of revolving components totalling US$800 million, with TELUS Corporation as approximately 7.2% lender, and amortizing term loan components totalling US$1.2 billion, with TELUS Corporation as approximately 7.2% lender. The credit facility is non-recourse to TELUS Corporation. The outstanding revolving components and term loan components had a weighted average interest rate of 7.5% as at December 31, 2023.\n\n| As at December 31  (millions)   | 2023                  | 2023                   | 2023   | 2023     | 2023                  | 2023                   | 2023                   | 2022        |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------|----------|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------|\n|                                 | Revolving  components | Term loan  components1 |        | Total    | Revolving  components | Term loan  components1 | Term loan  components1 | Total       |\n| Available2                      | US $  492             | US $                   | -  US  | $  492   | US $  658             | US $                   | 600                    | US $  1,258 |\n| Outstanding                     |                       |                        |        |          |                       |                        |                        |             |\n| Due to other                    | 286                   | 1,072                  |        | 1,358    | 132                   |                        | 557                    | 689         |\n| Due to TELUS                    |                       |                        |        |          |                       |                        |                        |             |\n| Corporation                     | 22                    |                        | 83     | 105      | 10                    |                        | 43                     | 53          |\n|                                 | US $  800             | US $  1,155            | US     | $  1,955 | US $  800             | US $                   | 1,200                  | US $  2,000 |\n\nThe TELUS International (Cda) Inc. credit facility bears interest at prime rate, U.S. Dollar Base Rate, a bankers' acceptance rate or term secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) (all such terms as",

        "page_content": "## Certified class actions\n\nCertified class actions against us include the following:\n\n## Per minute billing class action\n\nIn 2008, a class action was brought in Ontario against us alleging breach of contract, breach of the Ontario Consumer Protection Act , breach of the Competition Act and unjust enrichment, in connection with our practice of 'rounding up' mobile airtime to the nearest minute and charging for the full minute. The action sought certification of a national class. In November 2014, an Ontario class only was certified by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in relation to the breach of contract, breach of Consumer Protection Act , and unjust enrichment claims; all appeals of the certification decision have now been exhausted. At the same time, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice declined to stay the claims of our business customers, notwithstanding an arbitration clause in our customer service agreements with those customers. This latter decision was appealed and on May 31, 2017, the Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed our appeal. The Supreme Court of Canada granted us leave to appeal this decision and on April 4, 2019, granted our appeal and stayed the claims of business customers. Notice of this certified class action was provided to potential class members in 2022.\n\n## Call set-up time class actions\n\nIn 2005, a class action was brought against us in British Columbia alleging that we have engaged in deceptive trade practices in charging for incoming calls from the moment the caller connects to the network, and not from the moment the incoming call is connected to the recipient. In 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld a stay of all of the causes of action advanced by the plaintiff in this class action, with one exception, based on the arbitration clause that was included in our customer service agreements. The sole exception was the cause of action based on deceptive or unconscionable practices under the British Columbia Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act , which the Supreme Court of Canada declined to stay. In January 2016, the British Columbia Supreme Court certified this class action in relation to the claim under the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act . The class is limited to residents of British Columbia who contracted mobile services with us in the period from January 21, 1999, to April 2010. We have appealed the certification decision. A companion class action was brought against us in Alberta at the same time as the British Columbia class action. The Alberta class action duplicates the allegations in the British Columbia action, but has not proceeded to date and is not certified. Subject to a number of conditions, including court approval, we have now settled both the British Columbia and the Alberta class actions.\n\n## Uncertified class actions\n\nUncertified class actions against us include:\n\n## 9-1-1 class actions\n\nIn 2008, a class action was brought in Saskatchewan against us and other Canadian telecommunications carriers alleging that, among other matters, we failed to provide proper notice of 9-1-1 charges to the public, have been deceitfully passing them off as government charges, and have charged 9-1-1 fees to customers who reside in areas where 9-1-1 service is not available. The plaintiffs advance causes of action in breach of contract, misrepresentation and false advertising and seek certification of a national class. A virtually identical class action was filed\n\nin Alberta at the same time, but the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench declared that class action expired against us as of 2009. No steps have been taken in this proceeding since 2016.\n\n## Public Mobile class actions\n\nIn 2014, class actions were brought against us in Quebec and Ontario on behalf of Public Mobile's customers, alleging that changes to the technology, services and rate plans made by us contravene our statutory and common law obligations. In particular, the Quebec action alleges that our actions constitute a breach of the Quebec Consumer Protection Act , the Quebec Civil Code , and the Ontario Consumer Protection Act . On June 28, 2021, the Quebec Superior Court approved the discontinuance of this claim against TELUS. The Ontario class action alleges negligence, breach of express and implied warranty, breach of the Competition Act , unjust enrichment, and waiver of tort. No steps have been taken in this proceeding since it was filed and served.\n\n## Summary\n\nWe believe that we have good defences to the above matters. Should the ultimate resolution of these matters differ from management's assessments and assumptions, a material adjustment to our financial position and the results of our operations, including cash flows, could result. Management's assessments and assumptions include that reliable estimates of any such exposure cannot be made considering the continued uncertainty about: the nature of the damages that may be sought by the plaintiffs; the causes of action that are being, or may ultimately be, pursued; and, in the case of the uncertified class actions, the causes of action that may ultimately be certified.\n\n## (b) Indemnification obligations\n\nIn the normal course of operations, we provide indemnification in conjunction with certain transactions. The terms of these indemnification obligations range in duration. These indemnifications would require us to compensate the indemnified parties for costs incurred as a result of failure to comply with contractual obligations, or litigation claims or statutory sanctions, or damages that may be suffered by an indemnified party. In some cases, there is no maximum limit on these indemnification obligations. The overall maximum amount of an indemnification obligation will depend on future events and conditions and therefore cannot be reasonably estimated. Where appropriate, an indemnification obligation is recorded as a liability. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of the related transactions, historically we have not made significant payments under these indemnifications. As at December 31, 2023, we had no liability recorded in respect of our indemnification obligations.\n\nSee Note 21(a) for details regarding our guarantees to the real estate joint ventures.\n\n## (c) Concentration of labour\n\nIn October 2021, we commenced collective bargaining with the Telecommunications Workers Union, United Steelworkers Local 1944 (TWU), to renew the collective agreement that expired on December 31, 2021. In early March 2023, the TWU and ourselves reached a tentative fouryear collective agreement which would be subject to ratification by members of the TWU. On March 17, 2023, the TWU and ourselves announced that the ratification process was completed with a majority of the TWU members who cast their ballots voting to accept the tentative agreement. The new collective agreement with the TWU is effective from April 16, 2023, to March 31, 2027, and currently covers less than 4,500 team members nationally.",

Deferred share units are settled when a director ceases to be a director, for any reason, at a time elected by the director in accordance with the Directors' Deferred Share Unit Plan ; during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, no amounts were paid out in respect of deferred share units accounted for as liabilities and 534,420 (2022 - NIL) deferred share units accounted for as equity, with a weighted average grant-date fair value of $23.56 (2022 - N/A) were settled in equity.

Generative AI (GenAI) is a type of AI that can produce a wide variety of data, such as images, videos, audio, text and 3D models. It detects patterns in existing data, then applies those patterns to generate unique new outputs.\n\nFibre-optic network: Hair-thin glass fibres along which light pulses are transmitted. Optical fibre networks are used to transmit large amounts of data between locations at high upload and download speeds.\n\nFibre to the x (FTTx): A collective term for any broadband network architecture using optical fibre to replace all or part of the existing copper local loops. FTTH denotes fibre to the home, FTTP denotes fibre to the premises and FTTN denotes fibre to the node or neighbourhood.\n\nHSPA+ (high-speed packet access plus): A 4G technology capable of delivering manufacturerrated wireless data download speeds of up to 21 Mbps (typical speeds of 4 to 6 Mbps). HSPA+ dual-cell technology can double those download speeds.\n\nIncumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC): An established telecommunications company providing local telephone service. Non-ILEC refers to the telecommunications operations of TELUS outside its traditional ILEC operating territories, where TELUS competes with the incumbent telephone company (e.g. Ontario and most of Quebec).\n\nInternet of Things (IoT): A network of uniquely identifiable end points (or things) that interact without human intervention, most commonly over a wireless network. These systems collect, analyze and act on data in real time and can be deployed to enable the creation of smart connected businesses, homes, vehicles and cities.\n\nInternet protocol (IP): A packet-based protocol for sending and receiving data across networks.\n\n- IP-based network: A network designed using IP and QoS (quality of service) technology to reliably and efficiently support all types of customer traffic, including voice, data and video. In an IP-based network, a variety of IP devices and advanced applications can communicate over a single common network.\n- IP TV (internet protocol television): A television service (offered as Optik TV at TELUS) that uses a two-way digital broadcast signal sent through a network by way of a streamed broadband connection to a dedicated set-top box.\n\nLTE (long-term evolution): The leading global 4G wireless technology standard. LTE advanced (LTE-A) and LTE advanced pro offer higher speeds and greater capacity, bringing networks closer to 5G. LTE is capable of delivering manufacturer-rated wireless data download speeds of up to 150 Mbps (typical speeds of 12 to 45 Mbps), and LTE-A can offer speeds nearly 10 times higher (in select regions).\n\nMachine-to-machine (M2M): Technologies and networked devices that are able to exchange data and interact without human intervention.\n\nMobile virtual network operator (MVNO): A mobile service operator that leases access to a wireless network from other carriers in order to resell services to end customers.\n\nOver-the-top (OTT): Content, services and applications in a video format, for which delivery occurs through a medium other than the established video delivery infrastructure.\n\nPassive optical network (PON): A fibre-based transmission technology that enables broadband network access. GPON (gigabit-capable passive optical network) can deliver data download speeds of up to 2.4 Gbps and upload speeds of up to 1.2 Gbps; XGS-PON (10-gigabit-capable symmetrical passive optical network) can deliver data download and upload speeds of up to 2.5 Gbps.\n\nPrivate wireless network: A stand-alone network that is dedicated to the use of a single enterprise or organization and delivers enhanced reliability, coverage and security required to support new levels of quality, efficiency and productivity in the connected world.\n\nSmall cell: Low-powered radio access nodes that can operate in licensed and unlicensed spectrum within a limited range to provide additional densification and capacity to a macro wireless network.\n\nSpectrum: The range of electromagnetic radio frequencies used in the transmission of voice, data and video. The capacity of a wireless network is in part a function of the amount of spectrum licensed and utilized by the carrier.\n\nSustainability-linked bond (SLB): A debt financing instrument the terms of which are aligned with the borrower's performance in relation to predetermined sustainability performance targets and principles.\n\nThird-party internet access (TPIA): Access to the services of an established internet service provider (ISP), typically obtained at wholesale rates by an independent ISP for the purpose of reselling access to customers under its own brand.\n\nVirtual power purchase agreement (VPPA): A long-term renewable energy contract that does not involve the physical delivery of energy from the generator to the customer. The customer receives renewable energy certificates that can be used to offset greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nVoice over internet protocol (VoIP): The transmission of voice signals over the internet or IP network.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor financial definitions, see Section 11 of Management's discussion and analysis",

The Canadian Depository for Securities (CDS) represents one registration and holds securities for many non-registered shareholders. We estimate that TELUS had more than 1,207,000 non-registered shareholders at year-end.\n\n## Dividend policy and dividend growth programs\n\nDividends declared per share in 2023 were $1.4544, representing a 7.3% increase over the previous year.\n\nOur long-term dividend payout ratio guideline is calculated as 60 to 75% of prospective free cash flow. In May 2022, we announced our intention to target ongoing semi-annual dividend increases, with the increase to be 7 to 10% annually, through to the end of 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis further extends our multi-year dividend growth program originally announced in May 2011 and extended for three-year periods in May 2013, May 2016 and May 2019, and provides investors with ongoing clarity with respect to our intentions regarding our dividend growth program. Since 2011, we have raised our dividend 25 times, bringing the total number of our dividend increases to 32 since 2004.\n\nNotwithstanding this, dividend decisions will continue to be dependent on earnings and free cash flow and subject to the Board's assessment and determination of TELUS' financial situation, capital requirements and economic outlook on a quarterly basis. There can be no assurance that TELUS will maintain its dividend growth program through 2025.\n\nTELUS advises that, unless noted otherwise, all quarterly dividends paid since January 2006 are eligible dividends under the Income Tax Act . Under this legislation, Canadian residents may be entitled to enhanced dividend tax credits that reduce the income tax otherwise payable. For more information, visit telus.com/dividends .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan\n\nInvestors may take advantage of the automatic dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan to acquire additional common shares without fees. Under this plan, eligible shareholders can have their dividends reinvested automatically into additional shares. TELUS may elect to purchase common shares in the open market or by issuance from treasury (less a discount, if any, of up to 5%). TELUS will provide advance notification to participants if and when an election is made to change the method of purchasing common shares, and if by treasury issuance, any discount offered or any change in the rate of discount. Effective October 1, 2019, until TELUS elects otherwise, TELUS offers shares from treasury at a 2% discount from the average market price.\n\nWe also offer a share purchase feature, under which eligible shareholders can, on a monthly basis, buy TELUS shares (maximum $20,000 per calendar year and minimum $100 per transaction) without brokerage commissions or service charges.\n\nThis plan is managed by Computershare Trust Company of Canada.\n\nVisit telus.com/ drisp or contact Computershare for information and enrolment forms",
