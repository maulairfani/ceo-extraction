In 2023, our teams around the world sought opportunities to reduce our carbon footprint, to partner to develop technologies to decarbonise steel and aluminium production, to find more efficient ways to supply copper and critical minerals essential for the energy transition, and to create new products from waste. We explore, we mine, we process, and our ambition continues to be a business with a commodity mix aligned with evolving customer demand in a decarbonising world. But we cannot do it on our own. So we strive to create partnerships that solve problems and create solutions with lower societal and environmental impact. The approach applies as much to large-scale, transformational innovation as it does to incremental everyday progress, such as our safety and operational performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2023 Addendum Scope 1, 2 and 3 Emissions Calculation Methodology\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll-injury frequency rate\n\nConsolidated sales revenue\n\n0.37\n\n## $54.0bn\n\n(2022: 0.40)\n\n(2022: $55.6bn)\n\nWomen in our workforce\n\nProfit after tax attributable to owners of Rio Tinto\n\n24.3%\n\n## $10.1bn\n\n(2022: 22.9%)\n\nScope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities\n\n32.6Mt\n\n$15.2bn\n\n(equity CO 2 e) (2022: 32.7Mt) 2\n\nIncrease in spend with Indigenous businesses in Australia\n\n28%\n\n$23.9bn\n\n(2023 A$725 million increased from A$565 million in 2022)\n\nCompletion rate of 'Building Everyday Respect' employee learning module\n\n## 83.5%\n\n435 cents\n\n(2022 comparative dataset is not available due to new program)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance see page 43.\n\n(2022: 492 cents)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our financial review see page 24.\n\n- 1. Comparative information has been restated to reflect the adoption of narrow scope amendments to IAS12 'Income Taxes'. Refer to page 166 for details.\n- 2. In 2023, we improved our carbon emissions reporting and now use the market-based method as our primary measure for assessing performance against our targets. We have restated prior year numbers and our 2018 baseline accordingly. We exclude reductions achieved by divesting assets and increases associated with acquisitions from our target and so also adjust our 2018 baseline to take this into account. For comparison purposes, we have disclosed our 2022 emissions on the same basis. Our adjusted 2022 figures are 32.7Mt CO2e and our actual 2022 emissions (unadjusted for acquisitions) are 32.3Mt CO2e.\n- 3. Underlying EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure.

Our focus is on growing our business while decarbonising, providing products to our customers that support the transition to a low-carbon economy, and delivering attractive returns to our shareholders.\n\nMany of our products are essential for the energy transition: we expect this new source of demand, combined with traditional sources, to drive significant volume growth in our products over the coming decades. In developed markets, customer demand for low-carbon and recycled materials is growing with supply security top of mind. In developing economies, reliable access to raw materials for domestic processing is critical. We have the people, orebodies, technology, processing capabilities, access to capital and relationships to meet these diversifying needs.\n\n## Copper\n\n## Minerals\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Chair's statement\n\nVery sadly, I must begin by acknowledging the tragic deaths of our four Diavik colleagues and two airline crew members in a plane crash near Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories, Canada, on 23 January 2024. They will all be dearly missed, and our thoughts are very much with their loved ones, everyone in Fort Smith, and our team at Diavik.\n\nOur focus in 2023, and as we move into 2024, has been on embedding an empowering culture and on delivering consistent operational performance to progress our four key strategic objectives.\n\nWe recognise that creating and maintaining a culture where everyone can be at their best requires constant effort but, two years since we started learning from the findings of the Everyday Respect Report , there is positive momentum. Our executive team is driving this change, with the full support of the Board, reinforcing the importance of mindsets and behaviours that ensure everyone, everywhere in our operations feels safe, valued and empowered.\n\nThe Group has also made progress on our four key objectives of becoming best operator, excelling in development, having impeccable environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials and strengthening Rio Tinto's social licence. There have been real improvements in our Pilbara iron ore operations; we are ramping up underground copper production at Oyu Tolgoi; we are significantly closer to unlocking the Simandou project; and we have made strategic and exciting investments in our aluminium business, such as the Matalco recycling joint venture.\n\nOur strong results in 2023 demonstrate our continued progress towards our four objectives, with a continued focus on financial discipline. This discipline has enabled us to invest in the future health of our business while at the same time delivering attractive returns to investors, with the Board recommending a final dividend of 258 US cents, taking total dividends declared to $7.1 billion.\n\n## Growing and deepening connections\n\nWe are committed to deepening connections with our stakeholders to earn trust, resolve conflicts, and strengthen our social licence. This is constant work in progress, but there were many bright spots in the way our relationships with governments, communities and Indigenous Peoples evolved in 2023.\n\nOur partnership with the Mongolian Government highlights the mutual benefits when we get this right. We are now deepening our connection to Mongolia, most recently forming a partnership with UNESCO to support its sustainable development. In Canada, we are growing our aluminium business, including expanding the use of AP60 low-carbon smelting technology, with the continued support of the national and local governments.\n\nMore broadly, we are embedding and replicating the learnings from a shift to comanagement and co-development at our operations, such as working closely with the Nyiyaparli and Ngarlawangga people as we progress the Rhodes Ridge project in the Pilbara. As we get closer to unlocking Simandou in Guinea, we are doing so in close partnership with communities, in a way that will support further economic development beyond the mine.\n\nThis commitment to ESG and a stronger social licence does not end with the life of a mine. At Le Thoronet in south-east France, a rehabilitated former bauxite mine we have handed back to the French authorities, I saw evidence of how we are thinking about the full lifecycle of our assets, beyond our time as their custodians.\n\nAn important part of our engagement is with non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Taking part in our civil society roundtables in the US, UK and Australia provided opportunities to listen to the concerns of leading civil society voices, what we can learn to do better, and understand how we can better work with these groups. They encouraged us to forge ahead on establishing nature and biodiversity targets and helped me understand further how we can better engage with our communities.\n\nSince becoming Chair almost two years ago, I have been fortunate to spend a lot of time with our talented people across the organisation. In our 150 th anniversary year, we reflected together on how we can reinvigorate the core parts of our DNA and be successful in the 150 years to come. With every person I meet and every site I visit, I grow in confidence that we are heading in the right direction. This was clearly illustrated when the Board saw our four objectives in action at Oyu Tolgoi. We were deeply impressed by the productivity, the use of cutting-edge technology and the connection to the community; a blueprint for what we can achieve everywhere.\n\nMeetings with stakeholders have also reinforced the important societal role we have to play. As a Board, we spent time in China with our customers, partners, and government to better understand how combining our knowledge and technology can create win-win opportunities and help address the climate challenge. Similarly, in conversations with officials in Washington D.C., Canberra, Ottawa, London, Brussels, Ulaanbaatar and more, we have discussed the critical role of mining for energy security, in addition to providing the basis for resurgent manufacturing.\n\nWhat is very clear to me, is Rio Tinto's strategic importance in helping societies resolve their most urgent challenges. Rio Tinto can be fundamental to the energy transition. Our industry has been and will continue to be relied upon to provide the vast quantities of metals and minerals needed to build the infrastructure for the generation, transmission, and storage of renewable power. The need to repower our own assets with renewable power can also support investment in renewables - our Gladstone aluminium operations being a recent example of this.",

There is real momentum in our project pipeline and our Chief Scientist's office is steering us towards more breakthroughs in sustainable mining and processing, including BlueSmelting TM , ELYSIS TM and BioIron TM .\n\nWe are also working towards our ambitious targets of a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 and achieving net zero by 2050. This is a physically challenging task that will require great imagination, collaboration, and technological advances that do not yet exist. However, we have now progressed to a disciplined and detailed roll-out program, providing greater definition to what an economical pathway to decarbonisation looks like. At the same time, we are exploring more ways to help our customers accelerate their own decarbonisation to tackle our Scope 3 emissions.\n\nWe are also seeking to further embed these targets by introducing a decarbonisation scorecard into our long-term incentive plan as part of our 2024 Remuneration Policy proposals. More detail on these proposals is set out on page 135.\n\nOur partnerships are key to how we are developing the technologies to grow and reduce emissions. Highlights include working with China Baowu to explore projects to decarbonise the steel value chain, a multiyear supply agreement between Iron Ore Company of Canada and H2 Green Steel in Sweden, and teaming up with Sumitomo at our Aluminium Pacific Operations to build a first-of-a-kind hydrogen plant in Gladstone to trial lower-carbon alumina refining, with support from the Australian Government.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board changes\n\nIn the summer of 2022, we evaluated the mix of skills and experience on the Board and concluded that we needed to refresh our composition, with a particular focus on deepening our mining, operations and projects experience, as well as our renewable energy and sustainability capabilities. We also needed to prepare for future transitions in our Audit and Risk Committee. I am pleased that we have made significant progress in this, with the announcement of six new NonExecutive Directors.\n\nDean Dalla Valle, who joined the Board in June, has vast operational and technical expertise, and wide experience developing complex mining projects. Susan LloydHurwitz, who also joined in June, is a highly respected leader and brings deep CEO experience across large projects, cultural change, diversity and inclusion, and sustainability. Joc O'Rourke joined the Board in October and brings 25 years of mining industry experience and a passion for improving operational performance. In December, we announced the appointments of Martina Merz, who joined the Board on 1 February 2024, and Sharon Thorne, who will join the Board in July 2024. Both are exceptional leaders, Martina with deep CEO experience in handling cyclical businesses, research and development and decarbonisation initiatives, and Sharon with deep industry knowledge gained over 30 years of auditing and advising multinational companies.\n\nAs part of that phased transition, Simon McKeon has agreed to step down as a Director at the conclusion of our annual general meetings in 2024, and will not therefore seek re-election by shareholders. I am extremely grateful to Simon for his invaluable contribution. Having regard for his roles as Rio Tinto Limited's Senior Independent Director and the Designated Director for workforce engagement, Simon has taken a particular interest in Rio Tinto's revitalised approach to engagement with the broader Australian community as well as the\n\ncompany's cultural reset. On behalf of the Board, I wish him well for the future.\n\nIn December, we also said goodbye to a colleague who will be greatly missed. Dr Megan Clark stepped down after 9 years on the Board. Her experience and wise counsel were invaluable, and we wish her well for the future.\n\nI am excited to lead a Board with such depth and breadth of insight, who I know share a commitment to help Rio Tinto capture opportunities and achieve its full potential. For more information on the Board, please see the Directors' report on pages 90 to 145.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nThere is no doubt we are living through turbulent times. Politics is becoming increasingly polarised, the geopolitical landscape has become more complex and volatile, and the economic backdrop remains challenging.\n\nNevertheless, our purpose, 'Finding better ways to provide the materials the world needs', drives everything your company does.\n\nI look to the future with optimism - there has never been greater demand for what we do, and the capability of our people, and the quality of our partnerships, assets, technology, and innovation give me great confidence we can deliver for all of our stakeholders.\n\nOnce again, I want to thank the leadership team and the thousands of employees, contractors and partners around the world who are bringing Rio Tinto's purpose and values to life.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dominic Barton\n\nChair\n\n21 February 2024",

        "page_content": "## From the Chief Executive\n\n## Q&A with Jakob Stausholm\n\n2023 highlights\n\nAll-injury frequency rate\n\n0.37 (2022: 0.40)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nnet cash generated from operating activities (2022: $16.1bn)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprofit after tax attributable to owners of Rio Tinto\n\n(2022: $12.4bn)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntotal dividend declared\n\n(2022: $8bn)\n\n## What are your reflections on 2023?\n\nWe approached the year with confidence in our strategy, a deep commitment to safety and financial discipline, and a continuous improvement mindset. By continuing to focus on our four objectives, we have put Rio Tinto in a stronger position to capture traditional and emerging opportunities. In 2023, we returned to investing in profitable growth with an eye to the future. Of course, we have a lot more to do. But that is the best part; there is so much ahead of us.\n\nWhile we had zero fatalities at our managed operations in 2023, four team members from our Diavik Diamond Mine in the Northwest Territories in Canada and two crew members lost their lives when a charter flight crashed on its way to the mine in January 2024.\n\nWe are devastated by this tragic incident and are working with the authorities to understand the full facts of what happened. Nothing is more important than the safety of our employees, contractors and communities and we remain committed to evolving our culture and processes to ensure everyone goes home safely every day.\n\nWe made encouraging progress improving our operations, including the Pilbara, where we achieved guidance for iron ore shipments. We also hit project milestones including first underground copper production at Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia. Despite continued uncertainty in the operating environment, we delivered another set of robust financial results. We generated underlying earnings of $11.8 billion (2022: $13.4 billion) and net cash generated from operating activities of $15.2 billion (2022: $16.1 billion). Profit after tax attributable to owners of Rio Tinto was $10.1 billion (2022: $12.4 billion) and our balance sheet remains strong with net debt of $4.2 billion (2022: net debt of $4.2 billion). As a result, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 258 US cents per share, resulting in total shareholder returns declared this year of $7.1 billion. This represents a pay-out ratio of 60%, in line with our policy.\n\n2023 was another year of extreme weather and broken temperature records. In December, I attended the UN climate summit (COP28) and came away concerned the world is not on track with the Paris Agreement goal to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C by 2100. National targets are not in line with the overall goal, and current climate policies in many countries are not yet aligned with their stated ambitions.\n\nMany 1.5\u00b0C scenarios now overshoot the long term temperature goal and rely on significant deployment of carbon dioxide removals to get to net zero that may not be plausible. No single company or country can halt the course of climate change alone, so partnering to reduce emissions is vital. This is why we put the low-carbon transition at the heart of our business strategy and are working with governments, customers, communities and others to decarbonise our operations and value chains.\n\n## Rio celebrated its 150 th anniversary in 2023. What did reaching this milestone mean to you?\n\nRio Tinto's strength is built upon its rich history, and it has been important to explore our past in our anniversary year to inform our future. Our story is full of achievements and failures we must learn from, but there is one consistent theme: the spirit of innovation and continuous improvement. This is what our purpose - finding better ways to provide the materials the world needs - is all about. Our people have been doing this from the beginning, and reaching this milestone has reinvigorated our commitment to our purpose. It has also been a reminder that we are a long-term business. We are laying the groundwork to ensure Rio Tinto is successful not just today but for another 150 years.\n\n## We remained focused on our four objectives in 2023. How are we doing on our journey to best operator?\n\nWe need to be in the best shape possible to capture the opportunities ahead of us, which is why we are investing in the long-term health of our people, assets, and ore bodies. By prioritising these areas, we are creating the conditions for consistent operational and financial performance.\n\nEvolving our culture is fundamental to how we unlock performance. We have continued to implement the 26 recommendations of the Everyday Respect Report , and we are embedding best practices and empowering our people by deepening the rollout of the Safe Production System (SPS). This is a multi-year process, but it is already having a profound impact. SPS has delivered real improvements in our Pilbara iron ore operations, realising a 5 million tonne production uplift in 2023 and on target to deliver another 5 million tonnes in 2024. At the same time, Oyu Tolgoi is an example of what becoming best operator looks like. Less than a year since we started underground production, we are well on track to ramp up to 500,000 tonnes of copper per annum, from 2028 to 2036 from this world-class operation.",

        "page_content": "'Nothing is more important than the safety of our employees, contractors and communities. We remain committed to evolving our culture and processes to ensure everyone goes home safely every day.'\n\nOur Chief Operating Officer Arnaud Soirat was instrumental to the success of SPS and Oyu Tolgoi. Arnaud stepped down at the end of January 2024 ahead of his retirement, and I want to thank him for his incredible contribution and dedication to Rio Tinto for more than a decade.\n\n## How is striving for impeccable ESG helping us meet customer expectations?\n\nOur customers increasingly tell us they want sustainable, traceable, and transparent low-carbon materials, as well as help decarbonising their own value chains. Our strategy and commitment to the highest environmental, societal and governance standards positions us to meet these aims.\n\nOur Boron operation became the first open pit mine to fully transition its heavy machinery to renewable diesel, and we had breakthroughs including piloting our BlueSmelting TM technology, which reduces emissions from processing ilmenite into titanium dioxide.\n\nMore broadly, our approach to environmental, social and governance (ESG) is informing our decision-making as we develop projects including Oyu Tolgoi and Simandou. We are working closely with communities in areas such as biodiversity and water management, and to help realise the full opportunities for economic development at a national and local level. By working to the highest ESG standards and utilising our START TM blockchain technology, we are providing customers with the sustainable and traceable products they expect.\n\n## How is progress on excelling in development positioning the business for the future?\n\nExcelling in development is all about shaping our portfolio for the future. We have an attractive pipeline and considerable momentum to grow in the materials essential for the energy transition. We are further strengthening our Iron Ore business with key projects in the Pilbara, and in Guinea we hit major milestones to help us unlock Simandou, the world's largest known untapped source of high-grade iron ore. I visited Guinea in October and was impressed by how quickly early works are progressing as we move closer to full sanction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn our Aluminium business, we announced an investment of $1.1 billion to expand our stateof-the-art AP60 smelter, replacing the Arvida smelter. We also launched into the rapidly growing North American market for recycled aluminium with Matalco, a joint venture that develops our position further along the value chain. We remain on track to deliver 1 million tonnes of copper per annum by the end of the decade, with considerable progress at Oyu Tolgoi underground, expansion pathways at Kennecott, the continued development of Resolution, and further options with La Granja and Winu. Further down the pipeline, we have finalised Nuevo Cobre, a joint venture with Codelco, to actively explore for copper in Chile.\n\nCritical minerals are vital to achieving a net zero future, and we continue to explore opportunities in this area. Highlights from 2023 include steadily advancing the Rincon lithium project in Argentina, and the acquisition of the Burra TM Scandium Project in New South Wales, Australia, a high-grade scalable resource that could produce up to 40 tonnes per annum of scandium oxide.\n\n## How have we strengthened our social licence this year?\n\nOur social licence underpins all our objectives we cannot function as a business without it and our understanding of this is deepening across our teams. My conversations with stakeholders this year suggest we have come a long way to rebuild trust. However, this is an ongoing journey, and it is ultimately up to others to judge how we are performing. We need to continue to listen to voices from the communities where we operate and engage with civil society organisations to understand what we can do better.\n\nPart of this development is having greater transparency. In March we published an independent report based on an audit of our Cultural Heritage Management performance. The report helped us identify target areas for improvement, such as a sustained focus on community engagement throughout the life of our operations. We have started taking a more community-led approach, with co-management and co-development\n\nof sites becoming an embedded part of our process from the beginning.\n\nWe continued to work closely with Indigenous Peoples this year to ensure better outcomes for all stakeholders. This has involved partnering for economic prosperity, such as increasing opportunities for Pilbara Aboriginal Businesses as construction progresses at Western Range. Other highlights include working with the Yindjibarndi Energy Corporation to explore opportunities for renewable energy projects and signing the Aganow agreement to enable greater participation by the Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach in Iron Ore Company of Canada activities.\n\n## What are your main focus areas for 2024?\n\nRio Tinto is at the heart of the energy transition and facing an opportunity-rich world. At the same time, we are still seeing powerful traditional drivers of demand and our core markets are growing. Global trends such as reindustrialisation and a renewed emphasis on supply-chain security are presenting even more opportunities. As both a mining company and a processing company with a global footprint and a portfolio built for the future, we are wellpositioned to capture these over the long-term.\n\nOur focus will remain on securing the enduring health and success of the business, with an emphasis on disciplined growth, improving operational performance, exploring options along the value chain, and investing in the technologies that will allow us to reach our decarbonisation targets.\n\nWe'll continue our journey of culture change, building an environment of trust where everyone feels safe, respected and empowered to deliver results. This is what will drive our performance and enable us to keep delivering for all our stakeholders in 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJakob Stausholm\n\nChief Executive\n\n21 February 2024",

        "page_content": "## Strategic context\n\nOur strategy is informed by a deep analysis of the interplay of global megatrends, explored through the lens of plausible scenarios. These set the context for our industry and underpin our portfolio choices and how we operate. Our success relies on our ability to strengthen our resilience while building partnerships and capabilities that enable us to grow profitably.\n\n## Our scenario approach\n\nWe use global scenarios in our strategy and capital allocation processes to stress test our portfolio and investment decisions under alternative macroeconomic settings. Our scenario framework focuses on two prevailing forces: the speed of global economic growth and the trajectory of climate action, each heavily influenced by global geopolitics and governance.\n\nOur central reference case commodity forecasts and valuations are informed by a blend of our two core scenarios (Competitive Leadership and Fragmented Leadership). These are used to derive critical accounting estimates and are included as inputs for impairment testing; estimating remaining economic life for units of production, depreciation and discounting; and closure and rehabilitation provisions. Further detail is provided in the 'Impact of climate change on the Group' section to the financial statements on pages 162-165.\n\nWe use additional scenarios (including our Aspirational Leadership scenario, which provides our view of a pathway aligned with 1.5\u00b0C by 2100) to further stress test decisions and assess potential risks to our portfolio.\n\n## Our two core scenarios\n\nCompetitive Leadership reflects a world of high growth and stronger climate action, particularly after 2030, with change driven by policy and competitive innovation. A proactive reform environment encourages business innovation and helps boost investment and productivity. This allows global GDP to continue growing at near recent historical levels with an increasing contribution from India and other developing countries.\n\nFragmented Leadership represents a world where economic growth and climate action are constrained by ineffective policy and rising social and geopolitical tensions. In this world, investment in new technologies slows and their global adoption is highly inconsistent. This, combined with more significant climate damage, results in weaker long-term productivity growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our scenarios, methodology and portfolio implications see pages 47-48.\n\n## New industrial policies and regional competition\n\nIn the last two years, we have entered a new era of industrial policies characterised by increasing government intervention in the market and unprecedented levels of subsidies and policy support, specifically tailored towards de-risking supply chains and supporting the energy transition.\n\nFaced with inflationary pressures and macroeconomic uncertainty, regional and national governments are attempting to balance different societal choices, from accelerating decarbonisation to strengthening local manufacturing and enhancing supply security. This has created an increasingly fragmented and competitive industrial and climate policy landscape.\n\nIndustrial policies are becoming an increasingly important determinant of commodity prices, regional premiums and project economics.\n\nPolicies designed to accelerate the energy transition are bolstering demand growth for essential materials such as aluminium, copper and lithium. To mitigate supply bottleneck risks and support reindustrialisation, governments are also promoting the development of new mining and processing (smelting and refining) projects via financing or regulatory support. While this is creating new growth opportunities for existing producers, it is also incentivising competition and could result in increasing risks, such as tighter trade barriers and resource nationalisation, as value chains reconfigure.\n\nOyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine, Mongolia.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Energy transition and climate action\n\nWhile global efforts to tackle climate change have continued, the long-term pledges made by governments and companies still fall short of what is required to reach net zero emissions by 2050, to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nIn response, new government policies and initiatives, such as the US's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and Australia's Safeguard Mechanism , have been implemented to support decarbonisation and tackle climate change.\n\nWhile these policies are helping accelerate regional deployment of renewables and fossil fuel alternatives, several industries still face significant technology and capital constraints. This is particularly apparent for continuous, energy-intensive processes requiring both large-scale renewables and grid-scale firming solutions.\n\nAs the energy transition progresses, long-standing materials supply chains will be reconfigured, creating opportunities and risks for metals and mining participants. Given current technology and regulatory hurdles, processes requiring firm power, such as aluminium and steel production, will prize access to hydroelectricity or continue to rely on nuclear or fossil fuel-based electricity to offset variability in wind and solar energy. Existing operations with access to hydropower could see significant cost advantages, particularly if carbon penalties increase. By contrast, industries that can use intermittent power or green hydrogen 1 will have an advantage in areas rich in solar and wind resources.\n\n## ESG priorities and evolving customer needs\n\nConsumers are becoming more ESG-conscious in their purchasing behaviours, taking into consideration a range of themes beyond carbon, including biodiversity, water, supplier ethics and integrity, transparency and impacts of operations and broader value chains on local communities and society.\n\nWith the technology challenges and long development timelines associated with decarbonising large-scale processes, customers in developed markets are increasingly focusing on securing recycled materials as they look to reduce their value chain emissions as well as their environmental and social footprints.\n\nThis trend is being further supported by new industrial policies that have set recycled content targets and ESG performance hurdles to access government support.\n\nWhile recycling presents a direct risk to primary metal demand growth, it also offers unique growth and commercial opportunities for mining companies that have downstream processing capabilities. These companies can meet customers' diverse needs by providing both high-quality primary products (essential for some applications) and recycled products with reduced footprints.\n\n- 1.

We aim to strengthen our resilience to the physical effects of climate change and secure new opportunities and partnerships created by changing market fundamentals. Our strategy is designed to deliver strong returns and growth options while reducing the environmental and social impacts of our business and broader value chains.\n\n## Our strategy has three pillars\n\n## Grow in materials essential for the energy transition\n\nThe energy transition will create significant additional demand for copper, aluminium, lithium and a range of other critical minerals. We aim to grow in these commodities as well as in the supply of high-grade, high-quality iron ore, essential for low-carbon steel production.\n\n- 1. Excluding the purchase of offsets.\n\n## Our four objectives\n\nOur strategy is centred around our four objectives: to be the best operator, to achieve impeccable ESG credentials, to excel in development and to strengthen our social licence. These essential components will help improve our productivity, reduce capital intensity and assist us in becoming a partner of choice for a range of stakeholders globally.\n\nOur culture is a key enabler of our strategic ambitions. It guides us on the journey to best operator, makes us a better partner and helps us solve problems as we work towards net zero.\n\nBy building an environment of trust where everyone feels safe, respected and empowered, we can attract and retain curious people who care about their work and colleagues and are courageous about finding better ways to do things. This is how we will deliver on our purpose.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Best operator\n\nWe aim to improve our operational performance by identifying and replicating best practices across our portfolio and empowering our people to make positive changes.\n\n## Impeccable ESG\n\nWe will strive to align our business priorities with society's expectations and ensure sustainability considerations are at the core of every decision we make.\n\n## Excel in development\n\nWe will expand and progress our pipeline of growth opportunities and build capabilities and partnerships to execute projects and establish a strong track record of capital-efficient delivery.\n\n## Social licence\n\nWe will build meaningful and enduring relationships and partnerships with our stakeholders by listening, learning and respecting diverse perspectives.\n\n## Accelerate the decarbonisation of our assets\n\nDue to the scale of our mining and processing activities, we have significant Scope 1 and 2 emissions (32.6Mt CO 2 e). We are working with stakeholders to find commercial and technological solutions to reduce these by 50% (relative to 2018 levels) by 2030. We anticipate a total capital spend on decarbonisation of $5-6 billion by 2030 1 .\n\n## Develop products and technologies that help our customers decarbonise\n\nOur Scope 3 emissions were 578Mt CO 2 e in 2023, over 94% of which was from the downstream processing of our products. We are partnering with our customers and suppliers and investing in research and development to decarbonise our broader value chains and bring forward their targets, to achieve net zero processing emissions by 2050.",

Our focus is on eliminating fatalities, preventing catastrophic events and reducing injuries. While we had zero fatalities at our managed operations in 2023, tragically four colleagues died in a plane crash while travelling to our Diavik mine in January 2024. Our all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) was 0.37 in 2023  (compared to 0.40 in 2022). We are strengthening our safety maturity model (SMM) by including health and environment risks, and we are gaining greater insight into the culture at each site so we can take actions to improve.\n\n## Operational performance\n\nWe continued rolling out the Safe Production System (SPS) across our assets, engaging our people to identify issues and improvement opportunities and develop and share best practices across the Group.\n\nWe have deployed SPS at ~60% of our sites to date, with implementation at various stages of maturity. Key performance highlights include a 5 million tonne uplift in iron ore production and a 25% improvement in AIFR globally in the second half of 2023 (when compared to the first half), at sites where SPS has been deployed.\n\n## Impeccable ESG\n\n## Focus\n\nDecarbonisation, nature, water and waste management, closure, communities, workforce diversity, culture and leadership.\n\n## Progress in 2023\n\n## Environment\n\nWe continued to progress our six large carbon abatement programs focused on repowering our Pacific Aluminium operations, renewables, ELYSIS TM , alumina process heat, minerals processing and diesel transition. We also formed new partnerships with our customers to reduce value chain emissions.\n\nWe also identified several opportunities for investment in large-scale nature-based solutions with the potential to halt and reverse nature loss, support positive, sustainable change for communities and address climate change.\n\nIn 2023, we progressed a number of innovative projects designed to reduce our environmental footprint and create new revenue streams through the adoption of more circular practices. These spanned the extraction of by-products, recycling and finding new life for our closure sites.\n\n## Social\n\nOur work in 2023 focused on delivering our new communities and social performance strategy, underpinned by updated standards, targets and vision for the business. We continued to work on improving our approach to engage and partner\n\nIn 2023, we announced plans to increase annual iron ore capacity at Gudai-Darri in Australia by seven million tonnes to 50 million tonnes at a cost of $70 million through incremental productivity gains.\n\nWe also initiated a number of projects designed to improve the Group's asset management performance. These included building up capabilities in our Asset Management Centre of Excellence, improving critical risk maintenance plans and spare parts programs and bolstering shutdown support.\n\n## Future priorities\n\n## Safety\n\nIn 2024, we will strengthen the way we manage our critical risks, our primary fatality elimination tool which helps ensure that controls are in place and working where there is a fatal risk. We will continue to enhance the understanding and impact of critical risk management by focusing on quality conversations and verifications at our global operations.\n\nWe have strong standards and processes to approve air operators, including regular audits and engagements to make sure aviation safety systems match our expectations of safety and care for our people. In 2024, we will continue to work with all our sites to actively review compliance with aviation safety tools and controls to provide further assurance on top of our existing processes.\n\nwith our host communities and better manage cultural heritage. In 2023, we completed an independent Cultural Heritage Audit, providing a systematic review of all the heritage sites that we manage worldwide.\n\n## Governance\n\nIn 2023, we continued to drive leadership, management and ethics and compliance improvements, with a focus on building a thriving culture, implementing the learnings from the Everyday Respect Report , and improving our transparency and practices.\n\nIn 2023, the Business Conduct Office (BCO) launched Care Hub, an independent care unit providing support, care and resolution options to anyone affected by harmful behaviours. Care Hub currently supports matters reported through myVoice.\n\n72% of senior leaders have now completed Voyager, our senior leadership program. We also increased the offering of the Leading Sustainable Corporations and Leader as Coach programs to further support development and our cultural journey.\n\n## Future priorities\n\n## Environment\n\nWe will define our next round of climate and nature targets in 2024, drawing on knowledge and experience from across the business and from our external partners, to develop more holistic commitments across these key areas.\n\nWe will also evolve SMM and evaluate its impact on individuals' mindsets, rather than simply verifying safety systems and processes. This will be strengthened through assessor training, and how we perform SMM assessments at our sites.\n\n## Operational performance\n\nThe rollout of the SPS will continue in 2024. Our focus will be on working with our product groups to double down on impacts at existing high-value sites, rather than new deployment launches. We will also work on significant maturity uplift of best practices, specifically problem solving, and completion of site-wide deployment and end-to-end systems. We will continue to work with asset management to integrate efforts to rapidly bring assets back to health so they can deliver industry-best performance.\n\n## Relevant KPIs\n\nAll-injury frequency rate\n\nUnderlying earnings & underlying EBITDA\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities\n\nUnderlying return on capital employed\n\nFree cash flow\n\nNet (debt)/cash\n\nScope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions\n\nGender diversity\n\nTotal shareholder return\n\nWe will continue to progress our emissions reduction targets to build upon those currently in place, considering learnings from the approach we have taken with our water targets.\n\n## Social\n\nGuided by our 2026 Communities and Social Performance Targets, a core 2024 focus is for our people in high human rights risk roles to complete job-specific and general human rights training. We will also continue to work together with communities to manage and protect heritage and find ways to deepen the impact of our social investment through strategic, outcomes-focused partnerships.\n\n## Governance\n\nWe will continue our cultural journey towards an inclusive and diverse workplace led by our values of care, courage and curiosity focusing in particular on safety, leadership and employee listening.

Underlying ROCE measures how efficiently we generate profits from investment in our portfolio of assets.\n\n## Link to executive remuneration\n\nUnderlying earnings, as a component of underlying ROCE, is included in the STIP. In the longer term, underlying ROCE also influences TSR, which is included in the LTIP (see pages 134-135).\n\n## Our performance in 2023 and forward plan\n\nUnderlying ROCE decreased five percentage points to 20% in 2023, reflecting the decrease in underlying earnings driven by lower commodity prices, and an increase in capital employed due to capital expenditure and acquisitions.\n\nWe will continue to focus on maximising returns from our assets over the short, medium and long term. We will invest with discipline to strengthen our operations while delivering growth in a decarbonising world.\n\nWe will renew focus on our critical risk management program.

Rio Tinto significantly outperformed both the EMIX Global Mining Index and the MSCI World Index over the five-year period.\n\nWe will continue to focus on generating free cash flow from our operations. This allows us to return cash to shareholders (short-term returns) while investing in the business (long-term returns).",

        "page_content": "## Chief Financial Officer's statement\n\n\"In 2023, our financial results were resilient, driven by an improvement in our operational performance. As we shape our portfolio for the future, we will continue to allocate capital with discipline.\"\n\n## Uplift in operational performance drives resilient financial results\n\nIn 2023, the Group's total copper equivalent production increased by just over 3% from 2022. This reflected the Gudai-Darri mine in the Pilbara reaching its nameplate capacity and deployment of our Safe Production System. In addition, we benefited from our increased ownership in Oyu Tolgoi as the underground ramps up and the Kitimat aluminium smelter returned to full capacity. In a year in which average commodity prices declined compared to the prior period, we maintained our discipline on cost and capital, leading to net cash generated from operating activities of $15.2 billion, underlying earnings of $11.8 billion and profit after tax attributable to owners of Rio Tinto of $10.1 billion.\n\nWe maintained our financial strength, ending the year with net debt of $4.2 billion, just 1% higher than the position at the start of the year. Our balance sheet strength enables us to run our business consistently and maintain investment, regardless of where we are in the cycle. We have chosen not to have a net debt target, but have a principles-based approach to anchor the balance sheet around a single A credit rating.\n\n## Consistent capital allocation, balancing essential capex with shareholder returns and growth\n\nWe will continue to allocate the capital generated by our operations with discipline and remain committed to attractive shareholder returns. We have consistently applied our financial framework, which has been in place for more than a decade. It is straightforward and serves us well, underpinned by our three priorities. Essential capex remains the first priority - sustaining capex to ensure the integrity of our assets, high-returning replacement projects and investment for decarbonisation. The second priority is the ordinary dividend within our well-established returns policy, where we now have an eight-year track record of paying\n\nout at 60% of underlying earnings. The third involves testing investment in compelling growth against debt management and further cash returns to shareholders.\n\nIn 2023, capital expenditure rose by 5% to $7.1 billion, reflecting the impact of inflation, in particular on our sustaining capital. We foresee a disciplined increase in capital expenditure over the coming years as our growth projects accelerate and decarbonisation advances. This is critical to ensure we have the right portfolio to keep creating value for decades to come, so we can benefit from increased demand from both traditional sources and from the energy transition. And we have more to come: exploration and evaluation spend increased to $1.2 billion, with greenfield spend mainly focused on copper and lithium, while evaluation prioritised projects with near-term investment decisions, including the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea. We expect Simandou to become our largest capital project over the coming years. It will be constructed and funded by a codevelopment partnership that will share the risk and deliver higher returns than our cost of capital. We believe that Simandou's high grade, high quality product will position us well for the decarbonisation of the steel industry.\n\nOur financial strength means that we can reinvest for growth, accelerate our decarbonisation and continue to pay attractive dividends through the cycle. For 2023, we are returning 60% of underlying earnings to shareholders, which equates to a full-year ordinary dividend of 435 US cents per share, or $7.1 billion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Outlook underpins a strong Rio Tinto for the long term\n\nWe are well positioned in an opportunity-rich world where there has never been greater demand for what we do, from mining to processing. The work we are doing today is creating a stronger Rio Tinto for years to come.\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities\n\n## $15.2 billion\n\n(2022: $16.1 billion)\n\nProfit after tax attributable to owners of Rio Tinto (net earnings)\n\n## $10.1 billion\n\n(2022: $12.4 billion)\n\nUnderlying earnings\n\n## $11.8 billion\n\n(2022: $13.4 billion)\n\nThis is why our strategy is about growing in the materials the world needs. A strategy that will ensure Rio Tinto remains strong in the short, medium and long term with the ability to invest while always paying attractive returns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeter Cunningham\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\n21 February 2024",

This was primarily from lower pricing for our Aluminium business, driven by London Metal Exchange (LME) prices, lower premiums and lower alumina pricing. Higher realised pricing in our Iron Ore business was offset by lower pricing for copper, diamonds and industrial minerals.\n\nThe monthly average Platts index for 62% iron fines converted to a Free on Board (FOB) basis was 0.5% higher, on average, compared with 2022.\n\nThe average LME price for copper was 3% lower, the average LME aluminium price was 17% lower while the gold price was 8% higher compared with 2022.\n\nThe Midwest premium duty paid for aluminium in the US averaged $512 per tonne, 22% lower than in 2022.",

Currency movements increased underlying EBITDA by $0.6 billion relative to 2022.\n\n## Improvement in sales volumes but weaker mix\n\nHigher sales volumes across the portfolio increased underlying EBITDA by $0.7 billion compared to 2022. This was mostly attributable to a 3% increase in Pilbara iron ore shipments, with the Gudai-Darri mine reaching full capacity, partly offset by lower portside sales volumes (down 4%). Higher copper sales were driven by the ramp-up of the Oyu Tolgoi underground mine. This was partly offset by lower margins achieved due to our product mix (-$0.3 billion) mainly associated with a reduced proportion of Aluminium VAP sales and following high quality diamond sales in 2022.\n\n## Impact of inflation offset by lower energy prices\n\nWe saw a $0.4 billion benefit to underlying EBITDA on the easing of energy prices compared to 2022, mainly related to lower diesel prices at our Pilbara iron ore operations, lower energy prices at our alumina refineries and aluminium smelters, along with lower fuel prices in our Marine business. General price inflation across our global operations resulted in a net $0.4 billion reduction in underlying EBITDA, which includes a $0.2 billion year-on-year benefit from the impact of inflation on closure provisions.\n\n## Unit cost pressures persist due to temporary operational factors and weaker markets: some easing of market-linked raw material prices in second half\n\nWe remain focused on cost control, in particular maintaining discipline on fixed costs, which are expected to be broadly flat in 2024. While inflation has eased, we continued to see lag effects in its impact on our third party costs, such as contractor rates, consumables and some raw materials; we expect this to stabilise in 2024.\n\nIn the second half of 2023, we started to see some easing of marketlinked prices for key raw materials such as caustic, coke and pitch: these benefited underlying EBITDA by $0.2 billion.\n\nTemporary operational issues reduced underlying EBITDA by $0.6 billion. We saw a 20% rise in Copper C1 unit costs, primarily driven by lower refined volumes at Kennecott following the planned rebuild of the smelter and refinery. In Minerals, fixed unit cash costs increased at Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC), driven by lower production following the wildfires in Northern Quebec in June as well as extended plant downtime and conveyor belt failures in the third quarter.\n\nOther cost pressures and weaker market demand lowered underlying EBITDA by $1.0 billion. In Minerals, we experienced market weakness for many of our products, in particular for TiO 2 feedstock, which gave rise to lower volumes and resulting higher unit costs. In the Pilbara, a higher mine work index and investment in mine maintenance and system health were in part offset by cost efficiencies on delivering increased volumes. In Aluminium, we invested in improving the integrity across our integrated operations.\n\nOverall, we continue to experience tightness in our key labour markets, in Western Australia, Quebec and Utah, which raised costs above general inflation. We also entered into a new collective bargaining agreement at IOC and applied the new labour law in Mongolia.\n\nWe have also increased our investment in decarbonisation, research & development, technology, along with communities and social investment to deliver on our four objectives.\n\n## Increasing our global exploration and evaluation activity\n\nOur ongoing exploration and evaluation expenditure in 2023 was $0.9 billion, compared with guidance of $1.0 billion and $0.7 billion in 2022. The increase was mainly attributable to increased activity at the Rincon lithium project in Argentina and across the other product group projects. We also expensed costs associated with the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea (included in underlying EBITDA on a 100% basis): these increased from $0.2 billion to $0.5 billion, with qualifying Simandou costs being capitalised from the fourth quarter of 2023. These expenditures were partly offset by a $0.2 billion gain on disposal of 55% of our interest in the La Granja copper project in Peru to First Quantum Minerals in 2023, leading to a net charge to the Income Statement of $1.2 billion (2022: $0.9 billion).\n\n## Net earnings\n\nThe principal factors explaining the movements in underlying earnings and net earnings are set out below.\n\n|                                                                            | US$bn   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| 2022 net earnings                                                          | 12.4    |\n| Changes in underlying EBITDA (see above)                                   | (2.4)   |\n| Increase in depreciation and amortisation (pre-tax) in underlying earnings | (0.1)   |\n| Decrease in interest and finance items (pre-tax) in underlying earnings    | 0.2     |\n| Increase in tax on underlying earnings                                     | (0.2)   |\n| Decrease in underlying earnings attributable to outside interests          | 0.8     |\n| Total changes in underlying earnings                                       | (1.6)   |\n| Changes in items excluded from underlying earnings (see below)             | (0.7)   |\n| 2023 net earnings                                                          | 10.1    |\n\nFinancial figures are rounded to the nearest million, hence small differences may result in the totals. Comparative information has been restated to reflect the adoption of narrow scope amendments to IAS12 'Income Taxes'.\n\n## Increase in tax on underlying earnings\n\nThe effective tax rate on underlying earnings in 2023 was 30% compared with 26% in 2022. Consequently the tax on underlying earnings increased by $0.2 billion despite a decrease in underlying EBITDA. The rate in 2023 was in line with guidance, whereas the 2022 rate was lower due to the recognition of additional deferred tax assets in respect of Oyu Tolgoi and adjustments in respect of prior periods.\n\n## Decrease in underlying earnings attributable to outside interests\n\nWe completed the acquisition of Turquoise Hill Resources' noncontrolling interests in December 2022, which resulted in a reduction of Oyu Tolgoi's earnings being attributable to outside interests and therefore a higher share of income being attributable to Rio Tinto. The ramp-up of exploration and evaluation spend at Simandou resulted in greater charges attributable to outside interests given our 45.05% effective interest in the project.",

Comparative information has been restated to reflect the adoption of narrow scope amendments to IAS12 'Income Taxes'.\n\nOn pages 290 to 291 there is a detailed reconciliation from net earnings to underlying earnings, including pre-tax amounts and additional explanatory notes. The differences between profit after tax and underlying EBITDA are set out in the table on page 175.\n\nWe recognised net impairment charges of $0.7 billion (after tax), mainly related to our alumina refineries in Queensland, taken in the first half of 2023. This was triggered by the challenging market conditions facing these assets, together with our improved understanding of the capital requirements for decarbonisation and the recently legislated cost escalation for carbon emissions. For a detailed explanation of the impairment process, refer to note 4 to the Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Report. The signing of key agreements with the Government of Guinea and other joint venture partners for co-development of the infrastructure for the Simandou iron ore project gave rise to an impairment reversal trigger, for amounts which had been fully impaired in 2015. Previously capitalised exploration and evaluation costs associated with the mine and retained items of property, plant and equipment totalling $0.2 billion (after tax and outside interests) have therefore been reversed.\n\nWe excluded $1.1 billion of closure cost charges from underlying earnings, of which $850 million related to the closure update announced by Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) on 12 December 2023. This was considered material and was therefore aggregated with other closure study updates in the second half of 2023 which were similar in nature. These other updates were at legacy sites and at the Yarwun alumina refinery, which was expensed due to the impairment earlier in the year.\n\nWe recognised an exchange and derivative loss of $0.3 billion (2022: loss of $0.1 billion). The exchange losses are largely offset by currency translation gains recognised in equity. The quantum of US dollar debt is largely unaffected and we will repay it from US dollar sales receipts.\n\nOur Canadian aluminium business completed an internal sale of assets. This resulted in the utilisation of previously unrecognised capital losses and an uplift in the tax depreciable value of assets on which a deferred tax asset of $0.4 billion has been recognised.\n\nNet earnings and underlying earnings refer to amounts attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto. The net profit attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto in 2023 was $10.1 billion (2022: $12.4 billion). We recorded a profit after tax in 2023 of $10.0 billion (2022: $13.0 billion) of which a loss of $0.1 billion was attributable to non-controlling interests (2022 profit: $0.7 billion).\n\n## Underlying EBITDA and underlying earnings by product group\n\n|                                                                         | Underlying EBITDA   | Underlying EBITDA   |        | Underlying earnings   | Underlying earnings   |        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------|\n|                                                                         | 2023                | 2022                | Change | 2023                  | 2022                  | Change |\n| Year ended 31 December                                                  | US$bn               | US$bn               | %      | US$bn                 | US$bn                 | %      |\n| Iron Ore                                                                | 20.0                | 18.6                | 7 %    | 11.9                  | 11.2                  | 6 %    |\n| Aluminium                                                               | 2.3                 | 3.7                 | (38) % | 0.5                   | 1.5                   | (64) % |\n| Copper                                                                  | 1.9                 | 2.6                 | (26) % | 0.1                   | 0.7                   | (81) % |\n| Minerals                                                                | 1.4                 | 2.4                 | (42) % | 0.3                   | 0.9                   | (63) % |\n| Reportable segment total                                                | 25.6                | 27.3                | (6) %  | 12.9                  | 14.3                  | (10) % |\n| Simandou iron ore project                                               | (0.5)               | (0.2)               | 185 %  | (0.2)                 | (0.1)                 | 10 %   |\n| Other operations                                                        | -                   | -                   | - %    | (0.3)                 | (0.3)                 | (28) % |\n| Central pension costs, share-based payments, insurance and  derivatives | 0.2                 | 0.4                 | (55) % | -                     | 0.4                   | (87) % |\n| Restructuring, project and one-off costs                                | (0.2)               | (0.2)               | 10 %   | (0.1)                 | (0.1)                 | 32 %   |\n| Other central costs                                                     | (1.0)               | (0.8)               | 29 %   | (0.9)                 | (0.7)                 | 29 %   |\n| Central exploration and evaluation                                      | (0.1)               | (0.3)               | (60) % | (0.1)                 | (0.2)                 | (71) % |\n| Net interest                                                            |                     |                     |        | 0.3                   | 0.1                   | 130 %  |\n| Total                                                                   | 23.9                | 26.3                | (9) %  | 11.8                  | 13.4                  | (12) % |\n\nFinancial figures are rounded to the nearest million, hence small differences may result in the totals and period-on-period change.

        "page_content": "## Simandou iron ore project\n\nCosts attributable to the Simandou project in Guinea increased from $0.2 billion to $0.5 billion (100% basis at underlying EBITDA level) on ramp-up of project activity in 2023. We commenced capitalising qualifying spend on Simandou from the fourth quarter of 2023, with $0.3 billion included in capital expenditure (100% basis).\n\n## Central and other costs\n\nPre-tax central pension costs, share-based payments, insurance and derivatives were a $0.2 billion credit compared with a $0.4 billion credit in 2022, reflecting movement on derivatives in the two years.\n\nOn a pre-tax basis, restructuring, project and one-off central costs were mainly associated with corporate projects and were comparable to 2022.\n\nOther central costs of $1.0 billion were 29% higher than 2022, reflecting increased investment in decarbonisation, research & development and technology. Our core central costs increased in line with inflation.\n\nOn an underlying earnings basis, net interest was a credit of $0.3 billion (2022: credit of $0.1 billion), reflecting Rio Tinto's increased interest in Oyu Tolgoi and the related financing items following the acquisition of Turquoise Hill minorities in 2022.\n\n## Continuing to invest in greenfield exploration\n\nWe have a strong portfolio of greenfield exploration projects in early exploration and studies stages, with activity in 18 countries across eight commodities. This is reflected in our pre-tax central spend of $0.3 billion. The bulk of this expenditure in 2023 focused on copper in Australia, Chile, Colombia, Namibia, the United States and Zambia; diamonds in Canada; nickel in Brazil, Canada and Peru; heavy mineral sands in South Africa; and potash in Canada. We recently partnered with Codelco on the Nuevo Cobre copper project in the prospective Atacama region in Chile and with Charger Metals on the Lake Johnston lithium project in the Yilgarn, Western Australia. This spend is offset by the gain recognised on disposal of 55% of our interest in the La Granja copper project ($0.2 billion, pre-tax).\n\n## Cash flow\n\n| Year ended 31 December                                            | 2023  US$bn   | 2022  US$bn   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Net cash generated from operating activities                      | 15.2          | 16.1          |\n| Purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets  | (7.1)         | (6.8)         |\n| Lease principal payments                                          | (0.4)         | (0.4)         |\n| Free cash flow\u00b9                                                   | 7.7           | 9.0           |\n| Dividends paid to equity shareholders                             | (6.5)         | (11.7)        |\n| Acquisitions                                                      | (0.8)         | (0.9)         |\n| Purchase of the minority interest in Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd | -             | (3.0)         |\n| Disposals                                                         | -             | 0.1           |\n| Cash receipt from sale of Cortez royalty                          | -             | 0.5           |\n| Other                                                             | (0.4)         | 0.2           |\n| Movement in net debt/cash\u00b9                                        | -             | (5.8)         |\n\nFinancial figures are rounded to the nearest million, hence small differences may result in the totals.\n\n- - $15.2 billion in net cash generated from operating activities, 6% lower than 2022, primarily driven by price movements for our major commodities and a $0.9 billion rise in working capital, partly offset by lower taxes paid. The cash outflow from the working capital increase was driven by healthy stocks in the Pilbara, still elevated in-process inventory at Kennecott following the extended smelter rebuild and higher working capital at Iron & Titanium, reflective of weaker market conditions. Receivables also reflected a 20% higher iron ore price at 2023 year end (vs 2022) that will be monetised in 2024. Operating cash flow was also impacted by lower dividends, primarily from Escondida ($0.6 billion in 2023; $0.9 billion in 2022).\n- - Taking into account the timing of payments in Australia, taxes paid of $4.6 billion in 2023 were at a similar level to 2022, which included around $1.5 billion of payments related to prior years.\n- - Our capital expenditure of $7.1 billion was comprised of $1.0 billion of growth ($0.9 billion on a Rio Tinto share basis), $1.6 billion of replacement, $4.3 billion of sustaining and $0.2 billion of decarbonisation capital (in addition to $0.2 billion of decarbonisation spend in operating costs). We expect to spend around $4.0 billion each year on sustaining capital; spend in 2023 included the smelter and refinery rebuild at Kennecott ($0.3 billion) and targeted investment in asset health in Iron Ore and Aluminium. We funded our capital expenditure from operating activities and generally expect to continue funding our capital program from internal sources.\n- - $6.5 billion of dividends paid in 2023, being the 2022 final ordinary and the 2023 interim ordinary dividends.\n- - $0.8 billion of acquisitions related to the Matalco recycling joint venture and the Nuevo Cobre exploration joint venture with Codelco.\n- - The above movements, together with $0.4 billion of other movements, resulted in net debt 1 remaining stable year-on-year at $4.2 billion at 31 December 2023.",

See page 294.\n\nOur total financing liabilities excluding net debt derivatives at 31 December 2023 (see page 205) were $14.4 billion (31 December 2022: $12.3 billion) and the weighted average maturity was around 12 years. At 31 December 2023, approximately 68% of these liabilities were at floating interest rates (75% excluding leases). The maximum amount within non-current borrowings maturing in any one calendar year is $1.65 billion, which matures in 2033.\n\nOn 7 March 2023, we priced $650 million of 10-year fixed rate SECregistered debt securities and $1.1 billion of 30-year fixed rate SECregistered debt securities. The 10-year notes will pay a coupon of 5.000 per cent and will mature 9 March 2033 and the 30-year notes will pay a coupon of 5.125 per cent and will mature 9 March 2053.\n\nWe had $10.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents plus other shortterm cash investments at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: $8.8 billion).\n\n## Provision for closure costs\n\nAt 31 December 2023, provisions for close-down and restoration costs and environmental clean-up obligations were $17.2 billion (31 December 2022: $15.8 billion). The increase was largely due to revised closure estimates following new studies at certain operations and legacy sites, including ERA, together with the amortisation of discount ($1.0 billion), which includes the effect of elevated inflation for the year. This was partly offset by a revision of the closure discount rate to 2.0% (from 1.5%), reflecting expectations of higher yields from long-dated bonds, which resulted in a $1.1 billion decrease in the provision. $0.8 billion of the provision was also utilised through spend in 2023.",

This takes into account the results for the financial year, the outlook for our major commodities, the Board's view of the long-term growth prospects of the business and the company's objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet. The intention is that the balance between the interim and final dividend be weighted to the final dividend.\n\nThe Board expects total cash returns to shareholders over the longer term to be in a range of 40% to 60% of underlying earnings in aggregate through the cycle. Acknowledging the cyclical nature of the industry, it is the Board's intention to supplement the ordinary dividend with additional returns to shareholders in periods of strong earnings and cash generation.\n\n## 60% payout ratio on the ordinary dividend delivers an eight-year track record\n\n|                                   | 2023 US$bn   | 2022 US$bn   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Ordinary dividend                 |              |              |\n| Interim 1                         | 2.9          | 4.3          |\n| Final 1                           | 4.2          | 3.7          |\n| Full-year ordinary dividend       | 7.1          | 8.0          |\n| Payout ratio on ordinary dividend | 60%          | 60%          |\n\nWe determine dividends in US dollars.

Our all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) decreased 10% to 0.61, compared to 0.68 in 2022.\n\nThese improvements are the result of consistently using the safety maturity model (SMM) for the past four years across our operations. SMM encourages best practices across our business in leadership, team engagement and learning to improve our safety culture. We also re-engaged our workforce on critical risk management (CRM), a safety program that makes sure frontline workers are focused on the critical safety risks in their work.\n\nWe continued our journey to mature our workplace safety culture and create an environment where our people are both physically and psychologically healthy and safe. We completed the first year in our fiveyear Mentally Healthy Iron Ore Strategy, with a focus on building capability in our leaders to manage psychosocial risks in the workplace.\n\nOur focus remains on creating a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace where our people can bring their whole selves to work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our global health and safety initiatives see pages 71-72.\n\nWe are one of the world's leading producers of iron ore, the primary raw material in steelmaking. In the Pilbara region of Western Australia, we operate a network of 17 iron ore mines, four port terminals and a rail network spanning 1,900 kilometres. Steel remains essential for ongoing urbanisation and will support the global shift to decarbonise.\n\n## Snapshot of the year\n\n0.61\n\nAIFR (2022: 0.68)\n\n## $2.6bn\n\nCapital expenditure (2022: $2.9bn)\n\n69%\n\nPilbara underlying FOB EBITDA margin (2022: 68%)\n\n## $14.0bn\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities (2022: $14.0bn)\n\nIn April 2023 the Radiological Council, an independent statutory authority, found Rio Tinto did not breach the Radiation Safety Act in relation to the loss of a radioactive capsule while in transit from our Gudai-Darri mine site. We also conducted a thorough review and identified opportunities to further improve the selection of radiation gauges, and how the items are packaged and transported.\n\n## Market Insights\n\nIron ore market fundamentals were wellsupported in 2023. Steelmakers in China maintained elevated operating rates as domestic demand rose 1.5% year-on-year. Infrastructure and other government-backed construction surpassed residential property as the largest steel consuming sectors, while manufacturing continued to contribute substantial volumes of demand.\n\nA 47% increase in net steel exports further supported China's crude steel production which exceeded one billion tonnes for the fourth consecutive year. China's steel exports also resulted in higher contestable iron ore demand globally since they in part displaced steel, which would have been produced in other regions using captive iron ore or higher scrap rates. This resulted in a 6.6% year-onyear increase in China's iron ore imports, reaching a record 1.18 billion tonnes, which helped absorb the 5% year-on-year increase in seaborne supply (to 1.5 billion tonnes). At the same time, China's port inventories declined to a three-year low.\n\n## $20.0bn\n\nUnderlying EBITDA (2022: $18.6bn)\n\n3.2Mt\n\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (equity Mt CO 2 e) (2022: 3.1Mt)\n\n$32.2bn\n\nSegmental revenue (2022: $30.9bn)\n\n16,000\n\nEmployee numbers 1 (2022: 15,000)\n\n## Enabling the low-carbon transition\n\nIn 2023, our Iron Ore business's absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were 3.2Mt CO 2 e (on an equity basis), an increase of 0.57Mt CO 2 e compared to the 2018 emissions baseline (2.64Mt CO 2 e). This was driven by an increase in production.\n\nApproximately one-quarter of Iron Ore emissions are from the gas used to generate power. To reduce our reliance on gas we are progressing development of 600 to 700MW of renewable energy capacity and preparing for early fleet electrification from 2030. We continue to progress the potential development of a Pilbara coastal solar farm and are partnering with the Yindjibarndi Energy Corporation to explore opportunities to collaborate on renewable energy projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our decarbonisation efforts in the Iron Ore product group, see our 2023 Climate Change Report at riotinto.com/ climatereport.\n\n## From customer to strategic partner\n\nIn 2023, we extended a key climate partnership with our largest customer, China Baowu, to accelerate efforts to decarbonise the steel value chain and reduce our Scope 3 emissions. This is the result of a coordinated approach across our sales, marketing, and research and development teams based on decades of deep relationship building with the world's biggest steelmaker, who is also a joint venture partner in the Western Range and Simandou projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information\n\nsee riotinto.com/baowu.",

Dampier Salt is reported within Iron Ore, reflecting management responsibility. Iron Ore Company of Canada continues to be reported within Minerals. The Simandou iron ore project in Guinea reports to the Chief Technical Officer and is reported outside the Reportable segments.\n- 2. The Pilbara underlying free on board (FOB) EBITDA margin is defined as Pilbara underlying EBITDA divided by Pilbara segmental revenue, excluding freight revenue.\n- 3. Comparative information has been restated to reflect the adoption of narrow scope amendments to IAS12 'Income Taxes'.\n- 4. Capital expenditure is the net cash outflow on purchases less sales of property, plant and equipment; capitalised evaluation costs; and purchases less sales of other intangible assets.\n- 5. Underlying return on capital employed (ROCE) is defined as underlying earnings excluding net interest divided by average capital employed.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nUnderlying EBITDA of $20.0 billion was 7% higher than 2022, with a 2% improvement in realised prices ($0.8 billion) and higher volumes, following the ramp-up of GudaiDarri.\n\nUnit costs of $21.5 per tonne were $0.2 per tonne lower than 2022. Cost escalation from inflation was offset by a weaker Australian dollar and gains on derivative contracts. Higher iron ore volumes offset a higher mine work index and mine maintenance costs.\n\nOur Pilbara operations delivered an underlying FOB EBITDA margin of 69%, compared with 68% in 2022, largely due to the iron ore price.\n\nWe price the majority of our iron ore sales (79%) by reference to the average index price for the month of shipment. In 2023, we priced approximately 10% of sales with reference to the prior quarter's average index lagged by one month with the remainder sold either on current quarter average, on the spot market or other mechanisms. We made approximately 74% of sales including freight and 26% on an FOB basis.\n\nWe achieved an average iron ore price of $99.7 per wet metric tonne on an FOB basis (2022: $97.6 per wet metric tonne) across our product suite. This equates to $108.4 per dry metric tonne, assuming 8% moisture (2022: $106.1 per dry metric tonne), which compares with the monthly average Platts index for 62% iron fines converted to an FOB basis of $110.3 per dry metric tonne (2022: $109.8 per dry metric tonne). The 2% lower realised price compared to the Platts index was mainly due to the lower average grades of our portfolio compared to the 62% index.\n\nSegmental revenue for our Pilbara operations included freight revenue of $2.1 billion (2022: $2.2 billion).\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities of $14.0 billion was on a par with 2022. Benefits from higher realised prices and higher volumes offset a build in working capital to ensure healthy stocks across the system and an increased receivables balance due to strong iron ore prices at year end. Free cash flow of $11.4 billion was $0.3 billion higher than 2022, mostly driven by a $0.4 billion reduction in capital expenditure to $2.6 billion due to lower spend on replacement capital.\n\n## Review of operations\n\nPilbara operations produced 331.5 million tonnes (100% basis) of iron ore, 2% higher than 2022. Shipments, on a 100% basis, were 3% higher (+10 million tonnes) than in 2022, making 2023 the second highest shipment year on record. Improved system performance supported by a 5 million tonne uplift from implementation of the Safe Production System, and ramp-up of GudaiDarri to its 43 million tonne nameplate capacity, offset mine depletion. SP10 volumes accounted for 47.5 million tonnes of 2023 shipments (or 14%).\n\nWe continue to see strong demand for our portside product in China, with sales totalling 23.3 million tonnes in 2023 (2022: 24.3 million tonnes). At the end of 2023, inventory levels were 6.4 million tonnes, including 3.9 million tonnes of Pilbara product. In 2023, approximately 86% of our portside sales were either screened or blended in Chinese ports.\n\nIn January 2024, Dampier Salt Limited entered into a sales agreement for the Lake MacLeod salt and gypsum operation in Carnarvon, Western Australia with privatelyowned salt company Leichhardt Industrials Group for $251 million (A$375 million). Completion of the sale is subject to certain commercial and regulatory conditions being satisfied. The transaction is subject to capital gains tax.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our capital projects and future growth options, see pages 30-31.",

        "page_content": "## Aluminium\n\n## Safety\n\nIn 2023, we continued to focus on building resilience within our safety systems and processes. We implemented actions to improve our safety culture for our employees and our contractors, by identifying areas of organisational improvement, strengthening our control environment, and leveraging our safety maturity model to analyse and address the root causes of all our potentially fatal incidents (PFIs).\n\nThe improvement in our safety maturity translated into a decrease of almost 6% in our all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) from 0.35 in 2022 to 0.33 in 2023. Increased incident identification and proactive PFI 2 reporting have been key elements in enhancing our safety culture. However, despite this improvement, five workers were injured in PFI incidents in 2023; three of these injuries occurred in vehicle-related incidents. We continue to progress our program to reduce vehicle-pedestrian risks, focusing on fatigue and work scheduling as primary factors contributing to this trend. Ongoing work will be needed in 2024 to help re-emphasise the importance of working together to build and sustain a strong safety culture.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information\n\nabout our global health and safety initiatives, see pages 71-72.\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\nAs a global leader in low-carbon aluminium, we are uniquely positioned to further decarbonise our business and support the world's transition towards a lower-carbon footprint. A critical material - lightweight and highly recyclable - aluminium is found in diverse products ranging from solar panels and transmission lines to jet engines, electric vehicles and smartphones.\n\n## Snapshot of the year\n\n0.33\n\nAIFR (2022: 0.35)\n\n$1.3bn\n\nCapital expenditure (2022: $1.4bn)\n\n21%\n\nUnderlying EBITDA margin (integrated operations) (2022: 29%)\n\n$2.0bn\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities (2022: $3.1bn)\n\n## Market Insights\n\nAluminium prices came under pressure in 2023, mainly driven by weaker demand outside of China. This impact on operating margins was partly offset by lower operating costs. Supply was volatile, with hydropowerintegrated smelters in China only able to fully resume production in the third quarter following low precipitation in the first half, yet production was curtailed once again in the fourth quarter due to the oncoming dry season. Global demand was similarly uneven through the year.\n\nWhile China's electric vehicle and solar panel manufacturers significantly increased their consumption, the US, Europe and Japan recorded historically low levels of aluminium semi-fabricated orders and shipments. Primary aluminium inventory remained low in China due to strong demand and seasonal disruptions to domestic production, which required high levels of aluminium primary imports, mainly from Russia. Meanwhile, aluminium inventories outside the Chinese market remain below average historical levels.\n\n$2.3bn\n\nUnderlying EBITDA (2022: $3.7bn)\n\n24.2Mt\n\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (equity Mt CO 2 e) (2022: 23.3Mt)\n\n$12.3bn\n\nSegmental revenue (2022: $14.1bn)\n\n15,000\n\nEmployee numbers 1\n\n(2022: 15,000)\n\n## Enabling the low-carbon transition\n\nIn 2023, our Aluminium business's absolute greenhouse gas emissions (24.2Mt CO 2 e) were 1.4% lower than the 2018 equity baseline (24.5Mt CO 2 e). This reduction includes improvements in processing efficiency, increased use of hydroelectric boilers in refining instead of natural gas boilers, and reduced aluminium production at the Kitimat smelter. Following a strike in 2021, the Kitimat smelter resumed its operations and reached full operating capacity in September 2023.\n\nThe 2023 emissions intensity of our managed Canadian smelters, powered by hydroelectricity, was 2.28Mt CO 2 e per tonne of aluminium. Our Vaudreuil alumina refinery continues to have one of the lowest carbon footprints of any metallurgical alumina refinery in the world today.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our decarbonisation efforts in the Aluminium product group, see our 2023 Climate Change Report at riotinto.com/ climatereport.",

Market-related costs for key materials such as caustic, coke and pitch moderated with some of this benefitting underlying EBITDA in the second half. Operating costs particularly in our mines and refineries increased year on year with a focus on improved operational stability and asset health. Overall there was significant margin compression for our Aluminium business with a 38% decrease in underlying EBITDA to $2.3 billion. Underlying EBITDA margin fell eight percentage points to 21%.\n\nWe achieved an average realised aluminium price of $2,738 per tonne, 18% lower than 2022.\n\nAverage realised aluminium prices comprise the LME price, a market premium and a value-added product (VAP) premium. The cash LME price averaged $2,250 per tonne, 17% lower than 2022, while in our key US market, the Midwest premium duty paid, which is 57% of our total volumes (2022: 57%), decreased by 22% to $512 per tonne (2022: $655 per tonne). Our VAP sales represented 46% of the primary metal we sold (2022: 50%) and generated product premiums averaging $354 per tonne of VAP sold (2022: $431 per tonne).\n\nOur conversion of underlying EBITDA to cash remained relatively strong, with net cash generated from operating activities of $2.0 billion. Free cash flow of $0.6 billion reflected investment in the business of $1.3 billion.\n\n## Review of operations\n\nBauxite production of 54.6 million tonnes was unchanged from 2022. Operations saw a continued improvement in the fourth quarter, following the challenges of higher-thanaverage rainfall at Weipa in the first quarter and equipment downtime at both Weipa and Gove in the first half.\n\nWe shipped 37.3 million tonnes of bauxite to third parties, 2% lower than 2022. Segmental revenue for bauxite was also unchanged at $2.4 billion. This includes freight revenue of $0.5 billion (2022: $0.6 billion).\n\nAlumina production of 7.5 million tonnes was unchanged from 2022, with the Yarwun and Queensland Alumina Limited (QAL) refineries showing improved operational stability.\n\nFor the 2023 calendar year, as the result of QAL's activation of a step-in process following sanction measures enacted by the Australian Government in 2022, we continued to take on 100% of capacity for as long as the step-in continues. We have used Rusal's 20% share of capacity under the tolling arrangement with QAL. This additional output is excluded from our production results as QAL remains 80% owned by Rio Tinto and 20% owned by Rusal. On 1 February 2024, the Federal Court of Australia rendered its decision in the litigation initiated by Rusal against Rio Tinto and QAL, dismissing Rusal's case. Rio Tinto and QAL are working to understand the impacts of the decision.\n\nAluminium production of 3.3 million tonnes was 9% higher than 2022, after we returned to full capacity at the Kitimat smelter and completed cell recovery efforts at Boyne during the third quarter. All other smelters continued to demonstrate stable performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our capital projects and future growth options, see pages 30-31.",

There were 22 PFIs in 2023 compared to 18 in the previous year. We had an overall all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) of 0.35 compared to 0.22 in 2022, an increase of 59%, with an employee AIFR of 0.31 and a contractor AIFR of 0.38.\n\nUnfortunately, in 2023, we also experienced two permanent damage injuries at our Simandou project and Kennecott Underground project, and a Process Safety Tier I event at our Kennecott smelter. Extensive action plans are being executed to ensure our people and their safety remains at the centre of everything we do, and through our critical risk management we are focusing on fatality prevention across our sites. Underpinning our strategy, we continue our journey to embed our enhanced safety maturity model to help us improve and sustain exceptional safety performance. Copper assets continue to focus on understanding and reducing their most significant health risks exposures, including heat stress, diesel particulate matter and SO 2 exposure through the Kennecott smelter rebuild.

Disruptions to mine supply in major mining countries further tightened market fundamentals in the first quarter, before loosening later in the year with the commissioning of new mining projects in South America and Africa.\n\nConcerns about the US and China's economic growth towards the middle of the year undermined sentiment. That was followed by a stabilisation in China after pro-growth measures were stepped up in the third quarter. Overall, China's demand was resilient, lending support to copper prices together with inflationary pressure, although price gains were capped by US dollar appreciation. In the final months of 2023, there were several disruptions to mine supply in Latin America that resulted in a notably tighter copper concentrates market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n42%\n\nUnderlying EBITDA margin (product group operations) (2022: 49%)\n\n$0.5bn\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities 1\n\n(2022: $1.5bn)\n\n## $1.9bn\n\nUnderlying EBITDA (2022: $2.6bn) 1\n\n1.0Mt\n\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (equity Mt CO 2 e) (2022: 1.7Mt)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSegmental revenue (2022: $6.7bn)\n\n8,000\n\nEmployee numbers 2\n\n(2022: 8,000)\n\n## Enabling the low-carbon transition\n\nIn 2023, our Copper business's absolute greenhouse gas emissions (1.0Mt CO 2 e) were 65.5% lower than the 2018 equity baseline (3.04Mt CO 2 e). The decrease in emissions was mainly driven by decarbonising power and commercial transactions in renewable energy. Rio Tinto Kennecott is fully transitioning to renewable diesel after a successful seven month trial. Kennecott's fleet of 90 haul trucks and all heavy machinery will begin to transition to renewable diesel in the first quarter of 2024, along with consumption from the concentrator, smelter, and refinery. The transition will reduce Kennecott's carbon emissions by approximately 495,000 tonnes of CO 2 equivalent per annum, comparable to eliminating the annual emissions of more than 107,000 cars 3 .\n\nNuton TM , our bioleaching technology venture, has the potential to deliver game changing ESG performance. Compared to conventional concentrating and smelting and based on our comparative environmental benchmark study with the University of Technology, Sydney, Nuton TM is projected to have a carbon intensity up to 60% lower than a global average of 5.2 tonnes per tonne of copper. Combined with opportunities for renewable energy that can further reduce emissions from Nuton TM , we're excited about the incredible outcome Nuton TM could bring.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our decarbonisation efforts in the Copper product group, see our 2023 Climate Change Report at riotinto.com/ climatereport.\n\n- 2022 has been adjusted to reflect a change in management responsibility for the Simandou iron ore project from Copper to the Chief Technical Officer.

The 500 thousand tonne per year copper production target (stated as recoverable metal) for the Oyu Tolgoi underground and open pit mines for the years 2028 to 2036 was previously reported in a release to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) dated 11 July 2023 'Investor site visit to Oyu Tolgoi copper mine, Mongolia'. All material assumptions underpinning that production target continue to apply and have not materially changed.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nWe delivered first sustainable production from the underground mine at Oyu Tolgoi, where we doubled our interest to 66% following the acquisition of Turquoise Hill Resources at the end of 2022. However, lower refined copper volumes and higher unit costs, primarily driven by the planned smelter and refinery rebuild at Kennecott, in addition to higher energy prices and an increase in exploration and evaluation expenditure, led to underlying EBITDA being down 26% to $1.9 billion. Underlying EBITDA margin remained relatively strong at 42%.\n\nOur copper unit costs, at 195 cents per pound, increased by 32 cents, or 20%, as a result of the lower shipment volumes of refined copper following the planned rebuild at Kennecott and higher input costs.\n\nWe generated $0.5 billion in net cash from operating activities, a 64% decrease on 2022, from the same drivers as underlying EBITDA, together with $0.3 billion lower dividends from Escondida.\n\nNegative free cash flow of $1.4 billion reflected the above movements and significant investment of $2.0 billion in sustaining capital and our growth projects. This mainly related to the ongoing development of the Oyu Tolgoi underground, the projects at Kennecott and evaluation costs at Resolution and Winu.\n\n## Review of operations\n\nMined copper production, at 620 thousand tonnes, was 2% higher than 2022, reflecting first sustainable production from Oyu Tolgoi underground in the first quarter. This offset challenges at Kennecott following a conveyor failure in March, with the concentrator not returning to full capacity until the third quarter. Our share of mined copper production from Escondida was flat at 300 thousand tonnes.\n\nRefined copper production decreased by 16% to 175 thousand tonnes as we undertook the largest rebuild of the smelter and refinery in Kennecott's history across the second and third quarters. The smelter rebuild was successfully completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the ramp-up is progressing.\n\n## Oyu Tolgoi underground project\n\nDuring 2023, Rio Tinto, Oyu Tolgoi and the Government of Mongolia continued to work together towards the implementation of Mongolian Parliamentary Resolution 103.\n\nWe continue to see strong performance from the underground mine, with a total of 86 drawbells opened from Panel 0, including 67 drawbells in 2023.\n\nBy the end of 2023, shafts 3 and 4 sinking had reached 923 metres and 1,013 metres below ground level, respectively. Final depths required for shafts 3 and 4 are 1,130 and 1,176 metres, respectively. Both shafts are expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2024.\n\nConstruction of the conveyor to surface works continued to plan and was 88% complete at the end of 2023. Commissioning remains on track for the second half of 2024.\n\nConstruction of primary crusher 2 commenced in December 2023 and is due to be complete by the end of 2025.\n\nConstruction works for the concentrator conversion remains on schedule. Commissioning is expected to be progressively completed from the fourth quarter of 2024 through to the second quarter of 2025. Technical studies for mine design and schedule optimisation for Panels 1 and 2 were completed during the second quarter 5 . The operation remains on track to ramp up to deliver average mined copper production of ~500 thousand tonnes per year (100% basis) between 2028 and 2036 6 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our capital projects and future growth options, see pages 30-31.\n\n## Nuevo Cobre exploration joint venture agreement\n\nWe have entered into a joint venture with Corporaci\u00f3n Nacional del Cobre de Chile (Codelco) following the acquisition of PanAmerican Silver's 57.74% stake in Agua de la Falda S.A. The new joint venture, known as Nuevo Cobre (New Copper), will allow us to explore and potentially develop Nuevo Cobre's assets in partnership with Codelco in Chile's prospective Atacama region.\n\nChile has the largest copper reserves in the world, and currently is the leading copper producer. Chile is also a leader in other critical minerals that the world needs for the energy transition and to achieve net zero carbon emissions.\n\nThe partnership builds on a collaboration agreement with Codelco, which first commenced in 2007, that encourages best practices, innovation, and technology to improve safety and productivity in underground mining.",

We are working closely with the authorities to support their efforts to understand the full facts of what happened.\n\nUnfortunately, in 2023, we also experienced a permanent damage injury at our Diavik mine. The number of potentially fatal incidents (PFIs) increased to 27, with vehicle collision and rollover, contact with electricity and lifting operations accounting for the highest number of PFIs. Two of these PFIs were also significant process safety incidents at our RTIT Quebec Operations site in Sorel-Tracy, which did not result in injuries. We have heightened our focus on managing these risks and have implemented measures in response to the investigation.\n\nOur all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) decreased to 0.24, compared to 0.38 in 2022, as we recorded fewer employee and contractor injuries. The rate of injuries in our contractor workforce reduced significantly, going from 0.42 in 2022 to 0.20 in 2023.\n\nIn 2024, we will continue our journey of improvement, enabled by the safety maturity model. Additionally, we will intensify our focus on health, environment, and security to achieve our objectives of creating a safe and productive workplace for our employees and contractor partners.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our global health and safety initiatives, see pages 71-72.\n\nOur Minerals portfolio includes a global suite of businesses producing materials essential to a low-carbon future and projects well-positioned to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles.\n\nWe produce high-grade, low-impurity iron ore pellets and concentrate, titanium dioxide, diamonds and borates from our operations in Canada, Madagascar, South Africa and the US.\n\n## Snapshot of the year\n\n## 0 0.24\n\n.

Capital expenditure (2022: $0.7bn)\n\nX\n\n## Market Insights\n\nThe titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) market saw a downturn in demand in developed regions, although there was a small improvement towards the fourth quarter. Elevated feedstock inventory also hampered TiO 2 purchases, leading to production cuts by major producers.\n\nBorates prices also came under pressure as weak construction markets globally impacted underlying demand. Higher supply from leading producers accumulated into inventory as downstream demand underperformed.\n\nThe demand for IOC pellets in the European, Japanese, and Korean markets was stable in 2023 despite weaker steel production amid inflationary pressures. Following tentative signs of stabilisation in the European steel market in the middle of the year, pellet demand and premiums came under downward pressure by the end of the third quarter, and headwinds in the Atlantic Basin persisted through to the end of the year. Nevertheless, the demand for Direct Reduction pellets remained resilient in the Middle East and North Africa on the back of firm steel production in that region.\n\nDownward pressure on lithium carbonate prices emanated from the deceleration in electric vehicle (EV) output growth and inventory accumulation along the supply chain. Supply from non-traditional regions (Africa) entered the market, incentivised by two years of elevated prices. Longer term, lithium market fundamentals remain strong as EV adoption continues to accelerate on supportive government policies and supply shortfalls requiring further investment.\n\n## 30%\n\nUnderlying EBITDA margin (product group operations) (2022: 40%)\n\n## $0.5bn\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities\n\n(2022: $1.5bn)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnderlying EBITDA (2022: $2.4bn)\n\n3.7Mt\n\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (equity Mt CO 2 e) (2022: 4.0Mt)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSegmental revenue (2022: $6.8bn)\n\n10,000\n\nEmployee numbers 1\n\n(2022: 9,500)\n\n## Enabling the low-carbon transition\n\nIn 2023, our Minerals product group's absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were 3.7Mt CO 2 e, a 6.7% decrease from 2022 levels and 0.1% lower than the 2018 equity baseline (3.7Mt CO 2 e). We started the BlueSmelting TM demonstration plant at our RTIT Quebec Operations, a new ilmenite smelting technology that, if fully implemented, has the potential to reduce the site's overall GHG emissions by up to 70%.\n\nWe announced we would build the largest solar power plant across Canada's territories at Diavik Diamond Mine, featuring over 6,600 solar panels. It is expected to be fully operational in the first half of 2024. In Boron, California, we became the first open pit mine in the world to fully transition our heavy machinery from fossil to renewable diesel, which brings an anticipated CO 2 e reduction of up to 45,000 tonnes per year. At QIT Madagascar Minerals, we commissioned the 8MW solar plant and 8.25 MWh lithium-ion battery energy storage system, and we started the construction of the 16MW wind project, scheduled for completion by 2025.\n\nWe have also opened a new battery manufacturing and testing research laboratory within our Bundoora Technical Development Centre in Melbourne, Australia, to test how our minerals and other products will perform in real-world applications, such as in EV batteries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our decarbonisation efforts in the Minerals product group, see our 2023 Climate Change Report at riotinto.com/ climatereport.",

Underlying return on capital employed (ROCE) is defined as underlying earnings (product group operations) excluding net interest divided by average capital employed.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nUnderlying EBITDA of $1.4 billion was 42% lower than 2022, primarily due to lower prices and higher costs. We experienced market weakness for many of our products, in particular for TiO 2 feedstock, where underlying demand for pigment was subdued on weak real estate activity in the Americas, Europe and China. This gave rise to lower sales volumes and, in combination with the two furnace failures at our RTIT Quebec operations, resulted in higher unit costs.\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities of $0.5 billion was 64% lower than 2022, while negative free cash flow of $0.2 billion reflected the lower underlying EBITDA, higher working capital due to market conditions and a modest rise in capital expenditure.\n\n## Review of operations\n\nProduction of iron ore pellets and concentrate at IOC of 9.7 million tonnes was 6% lower than 2022 with challenges due to the wildfires in Northern Quebec in the second quarter, as well as extended plant downtime and conveyor belt failures in the third quarter.\n\nTiO 2 slag production of 1,111 thousand tonnes was 7% lower than 2022. Two furnaces at our RTIT Quebec Operations remain offline following process safety incidents in June and July. In the fourth quarter, we decommissioned an additional furnace, which is due for reconstruction in 2024. As a result, we entered 2024 with six out of nine furnaces operating at our RTIT Quebec Operations and three out of four online at Richards Bay Minerals (RBM).\n\nBorates production was 7% lower than 2022, as we adjusted for decreased customer demand, despite improved equipment reliability.\n\nOur share of carats recovered was 28% lower than 2022, due to depleting one of three underground pipes and reaching the end of life for open pit mining.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our capital projects and future growth options, see pages 30-31.\n\n## Breakthrough technology: Scandium, a case in point\n\nScandium is a critical mineral in increasing demand for the energy transition and modern technologies such as aerospace, lasers and microelectronics due to its alloying and emerging high-tech properties. We are combining scandium with our low-carbon aluminium to produce an alloy that is stronger, more flexible and more resistant to heat and corrosion.\n\nToday, our commercial scale demonstration plant in Quebec uses an innovative process to extract and produce high-purity scandium oxide from the waste streams of the existing TiO 2 production, without any additional mining.\n\nThis will make Rio Tinto one of the largest producers of scandium in the Western world. In two years, we have gone from testing the extraction process in a laboratory, to being able to supply a large share of the global scandium market.\n\nIn 2023, we acquired a high-grade scandium resource in New South Wales, Australia. The Burra TM Scandium Project is a small, highvalue physical scandium asset, with a small environmental footprint. When operational, Burra will significantly increase, and geographically and operationally diversify, our annual scandium production.\n\nScandium is emblematic of Rio Tinto's transformation in terms of what we mine and how we mine.",

Two of our core objectives are to strengthen our social licence and achieve impeccable environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials. As part of these commitments, we align our business priorities with society's expectations and ensure sustainability considerations are at the core of every decision we make.\n\nOur shareholders, employees and host governments expect us to find better ways to lower our impact, decarbonise our operations and increase circularity, while contributing to a positive legacy for the host communities and countries where we operate.\n\nAnd we have a big role to play in the world's transition to a low-carbon future.

To do this, our priorities and performance must align with society's expectations, which are constantly evolving.\n\nEach year we complete a materiality assessment to understand what ESG issues and topics matter most to, and have the greatest impact on, our stakeholders and our business. We gather information from internal and external stakeholders via interviews, surveys and reviews of publicly available information. We ask them what is important now and what they think will be important in five to ten years. Some issues are identified as higher materiality than others. Our ESG framework describes how we manage and report externally on these issues and how we contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).\n\nThe insights we gather through this process guide our work towards achieving impeccable ESG credentials and strengthening our social licence. This includes providing people and communities with economic opportunities; safeguarding and promoting the health, wellbeing and human rights of people and communities; combating climate change; and being excellent stewards of the natural resources entrusted to us. Our commitment to running a transparent, values-based, ethical business underpins all our work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEach material topic above appears under either the environment, social or governance theme to which it primarily relates. However, there is crossover among ESG themes, meaning some material topics can be relevant to two or even all three themes. Accordingly, we work with themes and topics holistically, not in silos.\n\nTo achieve impeccable ESG credentials, we aim to:\n\n- - Provide people and communities with social and economic opportunities so they can live and grow sustainably.\n- - Play our role to advance a fair and socially inclusive energy transition.\n- - Build a healthy, diverse and inclusive workforce, support local communities to achieve their goals and aspirations, and deliver positive social outcomes.\n- - Decarbonise our operations (Scope 1 and 2) and our value chains (Scope 3) and maximise the full value of our resources.\n- - Encourage circularity and provide critical minerals that the world needs to advance.\n- - Minimise environmental and heritage impacts and act as a responsible steward of water and biodiversity, to strengthen our resilience to a changing environment.\n\n## The UN SDGs\n\nOur approach to ESG aligns with the UN SDGs, which are recognised as the global blueprint for a sustainable future. The SDGs are a useful reference point to ensure we direct our efforts where they can deliver the most impact and our focus areas reflect society's expectations. We focus on goals that we feel are most relevant to operating our business responsibly and where we can have the biggest impact. Our two lead goals are SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth).\n\nOur operations also contribute to eight supporting SDGs (3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13 and 15), while SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals) reflects our approach to sustainability and is fundamental to the way we run our business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our approach to the UN SDGs see riotinto.com/sustainabilityapproach.\n\n## What is important now\n\nOur internal and external stakeholders are broadly aligned on the four highly material ESG topics. Climate change is the most important topic and includes greenhouse gas emissions reduction, climate resilience and adaptation, and just transition. Respecting human rights; cultural and heritage site management; and health, safety and wellbeing are the other three highly material topics.\n\nFor our business, the safety and wellbeing of our people remains our highest priority. Biodiversity and ecosystems; business integrity and governance; ESG transparency and disclosure; inclusion, diversity and equity; local community relations, tailings and mineral waste management; and water management are also material topics as we strive to build a sustainable business.",

Biodiversity and ecosystems; the impact of technology; respecting human rights; risk management and cybersecurity; business integrity and governance; supply chain transparency; and end-to-end materials management will also increase in importance.\n\nWater management will continue to be an extremely important topic in the future due to the reliance of local communities and our mining operations on this increasingly scarce resource. Managing all these ESG topics well will be integral to our social licence to operate and the success of our business.\n\n## Reporting our performance\n\nOur materiality assessment records the threshold at which an issue or topic becomes important enough for us to report on externally. The importance of a topic is based on the significance of its impact on stakeholders. An ESG materiality assessment differs from financial materiality, which may use financial metrics or other quantitative analyses to determine what would be considered a significant or material impact.\n\nAs a member of ICMM, we commit to reporting on our ESG performance against the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards and implementing the ICMM Performance Expectations (PEs). The ICMM Mining Principles framework focuses on the implementation of systems and practices related to a broad range of ESG areas. In 2022, all 29 Rio Tinto managed operating and refining assets completed a self-assessment against the ICMM PEs. A self-assessment was also completed for Rio Tinto Corporate. The criteria for prioritising 26 of our 29 operating assets for validation, within the three year cycle (2023-2025), was also disclosed at this time.\n\nIn 2023, on-site third-party validations were completed for 12 of our priority operating and refining assets. The validation reports received to date demonstrate a high level of alignment between the self-assessment and validation outcomes, with identification of relevant areas for improvement. Information on the 2022 self-assessment or 2023 validation results are presented in the ICMM PE Summary tab in the 2023 Sustainability Fact Book . We have continued to improve our reporting to meet additional disclosure requirements, including the ICMM Social and Economic Reporting Framework (SERF). In 2023 we have disclosed our performance against most of the SERF indicators.\n\nThe majority of our ESG reporting is incorporated into this Annual Report and supplemented by our 2023 Sustainability Fact Book containing current and historical data on topics including health, safety, environment, climate, communities, human rights, responsible sourcing, ICMM PEs and transparency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nsee our 2023 Sustainability Fact Book at riotinto.com/sustainabilityreporting.\n\n## Governance and assurance\n\nThe Sustainability Committee oversees strategies to manage social and environmental risks, including management processes and standards.

The low-carbon transition is at the heart of our business strategy: we are focusing on growing production of the materials essential for the energy transition; decarbonising our operations; and partnering with our customers and suppliers to decarbonise our value chains.\n\n## Climate change\n\nOur operational emissions targets are ambitious - to reduce emissions by 15% by 2025 and 50% by 2030 relative to 2018 levels, reaching net zero by 2050. Our targets cover more than 95% of our reported Scope 1 and 2 emissions and are aligned with 1.5\u00b0C pathways.  We adjust our baseline to exclude reductions achieved by divesting assets and to account for acquisitions.\n\nOur definition of net zero applies to our operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions on an equity basis. To reach net zero we will need to decarbonise our operations as far as technically and commercially practical, and address all the remaining emissions with carbon dioxide removals from the atmosphere and long-term storage.\n\nTo tackle our Scope 3 emissions across our value chains we are committed to helping our customers and suppliers achieve their targets a decade earlier - reaching net zero by 2050. In particular, we continue to work with our customers to develop and scale up the technologies to decarbonise steel and aluminium production.\n\nIn this section, we comply with the requirements of Listing Rule 9.8.6(8)R by including climate-related financial disclosures consistent with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and recommended disclosures.\n\nIn determining our compliance with all 11 of the TCFD recommendations and recommended disclosures, we have considered both Section C of the TCFD Annex entitled 'Guidance for All Sectors' and Section E of the TCFD Annex entitled 'Supplemental Guidance for Non-Financial Groups'. The climate-related financial disclosures made within this section also comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as amended by the Companies (Strategic Report) (Climate-related Financial Disclosure) Regulations 2022.\n\nClimate change matters are also integrated into other parts of this report, such as the key performance indicators (KPIs), principal risks, and notes to the financial statements. Progress on our Climate Action Plan (CAP) is material to the successful implementation of our Group strategy. This is summarised in the metrics and targets area of this climate change section. For supplementary information, please see our 2023 Climate Change Report and 2023 Sustainability Fact Book . We will continually enhance our climate reporting in response to emerging standards and requirements set by the International Sustainability Standards Board and national regulators.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Many 1.5\u00b0C climate change scenarios rely on significant deployment of carbon dioxide removals to get to net zero, which may not be realistic.

Decarbonisation investment decisions are made under a dedicated evaluation framework which considers the value of the investment and impact on cost base, the level of abatement, the maturity of the technology, the competitiveness of the asset and its policy context and alternative options on the pathway to net zero. Projects are also assessed against our approach to a just transition, with consideration to the impact on employees, local communities and industry.\n\n## Chief Executive and Executive Committee\n\nThe Chief Executive is responsible for delivering the CAP, as approved by the Board, with the Executive Committee supporting this role. Risk management, portfolio reviews, capital investments, annual financial planning and our approach to government engagement integrate our approach to climate change and emissions targets. The annual plan process focuses on the short-term (up to two years). The new growth and decarbonisation strategy is part of the medium term planning process. The Chief Executive leads the strategy process with the Executive Committee each year and, in 2023, reaffirmed the decision to put the low-carbon transition at the heart of our business strategy.\n\nRemuneration: Our Chief Executive's performance objectives in the short-term incentive plan (STIP) includes delivery of the Group's strategy on climate change. These are cascaded down into the annual objectives of relevant members of the Executive Committee, including the Chief Technical Officer, and other members of senior management. Decarbonisation is also included as a performance measure in the long-term incentive plan (LTIP). See pages 119-141 for our Remuneration Policy, 2023 outcomes, and the incorporation of climate-related measures in the LTIP and STIP.\n\n## Energy and Climate Team\n\nIn 2022, we established a central team, Rio Tinto Energy and Climate (RTEC), to deliver progress on our CAP. This is led by the Chief Decarbonisation Officer, who reports to the Chief Technical Officer and is accountable for all aspects of the CAP. The RTEC team is structured according to the 6+1 programs that drive decarbonisation across our operations.\n\nTwo additional teams complete the RTEC organisation: a Decarbonisation Office that monitors and forecasts GHG emissions, tracks investment decisions and coordinates our approach to physical climate risks; and a Climate Policy and Advocacy team. Rio Tinto Commercial drives the approach to Scope 3 emissions, given its responsibility for procurement, shipping and sales to our customers. The Decarbonisation Office prepares a quarterly progress report for the Executive Committee, which includes operational emissions and progress on abatement projects across the 6+1 programs and other areas of our CAP.",

This includes six core elements that are continually reviewed to ensure that we are effectively managing current risks and preparing for emerging risks.\n\nIn 2022, we launched the physical resilience program which included a climate risk and resilience assessment methodology. This guideline provides our assets and product groups with a bottom-up assessment framework to quantify physical climate risk and focuses on the following:\n\n- - Climate modelling assumptions: to guide the selection of future emission scenarios and time horizons to support bottom-up risk assessment and analyses.\n- - A risk assessment process: to identify and evaluate climate-related risks and opportunities.\n- - A risk management framework: to plan and implement risk responses, communicate risks with stakeholders and maintain and update risk information.\n\nOur three lines of defence provide assurance that risks are effectively managed in line with our policies, standards and procedures. While risk management is the accountability of our leaders, all employees are empowered to identify and manage risks at the point that they arise in their business. For further detail regarding the Group risk management process, the principal risks and uncertainties of the Group and how ESG has been incorporated into these, see pages 78-88.\n\nWe use scenarios to identify and assess the climate-related risks and opportunities impacting our business in the, medium and long term. We use market analysis for our short-term outlook rather than the scenarios which provide a longer term view out to 2050. For climate change planning purposes, we define short term as up to two years, medium term as two to ten years and long term as beyond ten years.\n\nOur short-term time frame aligns with our annual planning process. The medium-term time frame aligns to extended planning horizons that align with our growth projects and emissions abatement projects. Our long-term time frame considers the full lifespan of our mining assets and infrastructure, the long-term extent of our operations, and the continued impact climate risks and opportunities are expected to have on the business.\n\n## Low-carbon transition strategy and risk management\n\nThrough our Group risk assessment process and climate scenario analysis, it is evident that the low-carbon transition poses numerous transitional risks and opportunities for our business.\n\nBased on our analysis of these risks and opportunities, their impact on the Group, and the role played in the transition, we have identified numerous transition-related principal risks and associated opportunities that have been incorporated into our Group risk strategy.\n\nThe materiality, and subsequent prioritisation, of each risk has been calculated through assessing the likelihood of an impact occurring as well as the effect this would have on the Group's free cash flow or business value.\n\nThe Group's climate change and the low-carbon transition uncertainties, based on our risk management process, have been assessed through the following principal risks:\n\n- 2. Preparing our Iron Ore business to meet the demand for green steel.\n- 3. Building trusted relationships with communities.\n- 4. Minimising our impact on the environments we work in and building resilience to changes in those environments, including climate change and natural disasters.\n- 7. Delivering on our growth projects.\n- 8. Achieving our decarbonisation targets competitively.\n- 9. Conducting our business with integrity, complying with all laws, regulations, and obligations.\n\nSee pages 82-88 where we have highlighted the key regions impacted by these risks, our risk management responses, and the relevant groups with oversight of each process.\n\nThe numerous risks and opportunities resulting from the low-carbon transition affect our portfolio in a variety of ways. The table on page 48 provides an overview of the varying impacts that the low-carbon transition has on our overall portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\non financial reporting considerations and sensitivities related to climate change and the low-carbon transition, see the notes to our financial statements on pages 162-165.\n\n## Capital allocation and investment framework\n\nDecarbonisation investment is derived from the Group's capital allocation framework and aligned to our 2025 and 2030 Scope 1 and 2 emissions targets.\n\nOur target to reduce emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to 2018 levels remains unchanged. However, we now believe that achieving this will require less capital investment and more operating expenditure. We originally estimated that approximately 3GW of renewable power would be needed to decarbonise our operations in the Pilbara - 1GW to replace gas-fired power generation and 2GW to decarbonise our dieselbased fleets. Carbon reduction from economically viable, large-scale fleet electrification has always been expected post-2030, however delays in the availability of this technology mean that we now do not expect to invest in the same scale of Pilbara renewables pre-2030. We remain committed to developing 1GW of renewable energy capacity in the Pilbara, however, we now estimate that 600 to 700MW capacity is required by 2030.\n\nTo accelerate our emissions abatement, we will take advantage of commercial solutions that can be ready in the market this decade and avoid lengthy project development schedules. Therefore, although our 2030 emissions target remains unchanged, we now believe that this can be met with $5bn-$6bn of capital investment, down from previous guidance of $7.5bn. This excludes capitalised RECs, voluntary offsets and compliance offset costs.\n\nThe table below shows capital and operational expenditure on decarbonisation. Group figures have been disclosed on page 173-174 and 184.\n\nDecarbonisation expenditure Capital expenditure on abatement projects\n\n## $94m\n\n(2022: $86m)\n\nCarbon credits and renewable energy certificates (RECs) (intangible assets)\n\n## $61m\n\n(2022: $33m)\n\nOperational expenditure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(2022: $138m)\n\nInvestments\n\n## $36m\n\n(2022: $42m) 1",

        "page_content": "## Climate change scenarios\n\nOur scenario approach is reviewed every year as part of our Group strategy engagement with the Board. We have not fundamentally changed the scenarios presented in 2022 or the analysis undertaken in early 2023 to evaluate the resilience of our business under different transition-related scenarios. Our scenario framework focuses on two prevailing macro-level business concerns: the rate of global economic growth and the pace of climate action, each heavily influenced by global geopolitics and governance. Our two core scenarios (Competitive Leadership and Fragmented Leadership) are used to generate a central reference case for commodity forecasts and valuations. Additional scenarios (including our Aspirational Leadership scenario) are used to further evaluate the positive and negative effects of the energy transition across our portfolio and stress test investment decisions. We have designed our\n\n## Aspirational Leadership\n\n## Competitive Leadership\n\n## Fragmented Leadership\n\nAspirational Leadership reflects our view of a world of high growth, significant social change and accelerated climate action with all countries setting new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that collectively achieve net zero emissions by mid-century. We believe that despite geopolitical differences, major economies tend to work together through multilateral frameworks and proactively work towards limiting temperature change to 1.5\u00b0C by 2100. While there may be temperature overshoot in many 1.5\u00b0C scenarios, there is limited risk of this in Aspirational Leadership. Although Aspirational and Competitive Leadership share similar GDP growth, higher carbon prices under Aspirational Leadership result in lower global emissions.\n\nCompetitive Leadership reflects a world of high growth and strong climate action post-2030, with change driven by policy and competitive innovation. A proactive reform environment encourages stronger business innovation, higher investment and improved productivity. This allows global GDP to continue growing at close to recent historical levels with a growing contribution from India and other developing countries. Carbon emissions are slightly higher than those in Fragmented Leadership by 2030 due to increased GDP growth. However, these decline over time as carbon prices continue to rise post-2030. Nations drive toward achieving their Glasgow Climate Pact commitments, resulting in global GHG emissions falling from 54Gt CO 2 e today to 21Gt in 2050.\n\nFragmented Leadership is characterised by limited progress on policy reform with volatile low growth. The business environment is defined by weak final demand and greater uncertainty, and requires close ties with governments to manage risk. It is a world defined by geopolitical and domestic tensions, spurred by populist agendas that offer leaders little opportunity to build consensus around reform and environmental agendas. Nations eventually achieve their 2030 NDCs as agreed in Paris in 2015, but abandon further progress resulting in flat global emissions post-2030. Carbon prices track alongside Competitive Leadership levels until 2030, but remain constant subsequent to this, resulting in increased global emissions.\n\n## Key scenario metrics 1\n\n| Global temperature outcome in 2100                       | Aspirational Leadership 1.5\u00b0C   | Aspirational Leadership 1.5\u00b0C   | Competitive Leadership 1.6-2.0\u00b0C   | Competitive Leadership 1.6-2.0\u00b0C   | Fragmented Leadership 2.1-2.5\u00b0C   | Fragmented Leadership 2.1-2.5\u00b0C   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                                                          | 2030 Outcome                    | 2021-2050 CAGR                  | 2030 Outcome                       | 2021-2050 CAGR                     | 2030 Outcome                      | 2021-2050 CAGR                    |\n| Global average carbon prices in 2030,  (2021 US$/t CO2e) | 59                              | 9 %                             | 42                                 | 8 %                                | 42                                | 3 %                               |\n| Global emissions, Gt CO2e                                | 40                              | -11% 2                          | 50                                 | -4 %                               | 50                                | -1 %                              |\n| Global energy demand, mtoe                               | 10,500                          | 0.3 %                           | 11,000                             | 1 %                                | 10,300                            | 0.2 %                             |\n| Global GDP growth (PPP), %                               | 4 %                             | 4 %                             | 4 %                                | 4 %                                | 3 %                               | 2 %                               |\n| Energy intensity of global GDP, toe/$1,000 2015 PPP      | 0.1                             | -3 %                            | 0.1                                | -3 %                               | 0.1                               | -2 %                              |\n| Carbon intensity of total energy, gCO2/MJ                | 40                              | -13 %                           | 45                                 | -5 %                               | 45                                | -2 %                              |\n| Global energy from electricity, mtoe                     | 2,900                           | 4 %                             | 2,900                              | 4 %                                | 2,700                             | 2 %                               |\n| Global wind and solar capacity, GW                       | 9,800                           | 11 %                            | 7,500                              | 10 %                               | 5,700                             | 7 %                               |\n| EV penetration by 2030 (%) 3                             | 70                              | 11 %                            | 60                                 | 10 %                               | 40                                | 10 %                              |\n| Finished steel demand (relative to 2021)                 | >110                            | 1 %                             | >110                               | 1 %                                | <100                              | - %                               |\n| Aluminium demand (relative to 2021)                      | >130                            | 2 %                             | >130                               | 2 %                                | >120                              | 1 %                               |\n| Copper demand (relative to 2021)                         | >150                            | 3 %                             | >150                               | 3 %                                | >130                              | 2 %                               |\n\n- 3. 2021-50 compound annual growth rate (CAGR) based on global electric vehicle (EV) sales.\n\nAspirational Leadership scenario with the aim or reaching net zero by 2050, to help us better understand the world on a 1.5\u00b0C pathway and what this would mean for our business.\n\nWe do not undertake climate modelling ourselves, but determine the approximate temperature outcomes in 2100 by comparing the emissions pathways to 2050 in each of our scenarios with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) set out in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report. We also consider the carbon budgets associated with different temperature outcomes. The emissions pathway of Aspirational Leadership is most closely aligned with the IPCC's shared socio-economic pathway 1 (SSP1-1.9) with emissions reaching net zero by 2050, which limits warming to 1.5\u00b0C. The emissions pathway in Competitive Leadership limits the global temperature increase to 1.6-2.0\u00b0C (SSP1-2.6). Fragmented\n\nLeadership's emissions pathway is between SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5, so the global temperature increase is less than 2.5\u00b0C by 2100. For physical risk, we also use the IPCC's highest emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) in our bottom-up asset-level physical risk and resilience assessments and other scenarios for our financial risk modelling (see page 163 for more information). So, when assessing risks and opportunities to the business we use a 1.5\u00b0Caligned scenario to assess a fast low-carbon transition and we use the highest emissions and high temperature outcome scenario (SSP5-8.5) to assess physical climate risks. While there are many uncertainties about how a changing climate may negatively affect gross domestic product (GDP) growth, physical impacts of climate change are integrated into the GDP growth assumptions in our three scenarios. These are most significant in Fragmented Leadership and least significant in Aspirational Leadership.",

This will come on top of the demand growth from continued urbanisation and industrialisation (particularly in emerging economies) and it will trigger a new phase of demand growth in developed economies, which have faced saturating demand over the past two decades.\n\nWhile the low-carbon transition is expected to create additional demand for our commodities (and therefore an opportunity to provide transition materials), the outlook for demand varies significantly between our scenarios as a function of GDP growth, technology uptake, and scrap supply and use. Different demand trajectories, combined with industry supply responses and global carbon policy evolution, determine the market prices for our three major\n\ncommodities and implications for our Grouplevel and asset valuations.\n\nWe aim to invest in quality assets that give robust returns under our scenarios, creating a resilient portfolio with a significant upside to the energy transition. We have continued to invest in our copper portfolio through traditional assets such as Oyu Tolgoi and Kennecott, as well as early-stage application of our Nuton TM copper leaching technology.\n\nIn aluminium, we continue to develop emissions-free smelting technology with ELYSIS\u2122 trials. Significant further research and development is needed, including to scale up the technology towards larger commercial-sized cells, before the broader implementation of ELYSIS\u2122 is possible. For this reason, we do not expect this new technology to achieve emissions abatement across our smelters before 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe believe that global iron ore demand will remain strong with a premium on higher grade ore needed for the production of green steel in Direct Reduction Iron-Electric Arc Furnace (DRI-EAF) steel processing. This includes the higher grade ores from the IOC and our Simandou project. Demand for these ores increases in our Aspirational Leadership and Competitive Leadership scenarios.\n\nIn other commodities, we are evaluating a range of opportunities to produce lithium as well as making demonstrable progress on various critical mineral developments that are essential for the energy transition.\n\nThe pace of technological development is uncertain, which could delay or increase the cost of our decarbonisation efforts as well as the ability to fully capitalise on transition opportunities.\n\nFor additional information on the resilience of our portfolio, see page 163.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As the climate continues to change, so will the frequency and magnitude of events and impacts associated with extreme events. Proactive risk management is crucial for us to operate safely, productively, and profitably, well into the future.\n\nPhysical climate risk refers to the adverse impacts that arise from extreme weather and changes in climatic conditions and are typically categorised into two main types:\n\n- -Acute climate risks involve sudden and extreme events that can lead to rapid and severe impacts. Examples include tropical cyclones, wildfires, heatwaves, extreme rainfall, flooding and hail. Acute risks can disrupt operations, damage infrastructure, impact our people and communities, and result in production downtime and increased operational costs.\n\n## Our approach\n\n- -Short (days) and medium (weeks-months) term: weather forecasting, climate outlooks and natural catastrophe models.\n- -Long term (decades): downscaled latest-generation global climate models considering a range of future emission scenarios and time horizons.\n- -Location information: exposure and vulnerability.\n- -Identify: determine location-specific physical climate risks (threats and opportunities) considering present-day and short, medium and long-term time horizons and multiple emission scenarios.\n- -Evaluate: assess identified risks in terms of their potential consequence (financial and non-financial) and likelihood.\n- -Prioritise: prioritise risks based on materiality.\n- -Options: explore and identify the most appropriate resilience and adaptation measures to mitigate risk.\n- -Consider: cost-benefit, principles of adaptive management, modularity and long-term sustainability.\n- -Prioritise: critical and high-impact measures for implementation.\n- -Decide and implement: decide and implement adaptation measures.\n- -Accountability: clearly define roles and responsibilities.\n- -Metrics: evaluate performance against established metrics and indicators to assess success and impact.\n- -Review: revisit this approach regularly, or if there is a material change to the economic, social, environmental, or physical context of the subject/risk.\n\nWeather/climate analytics and insights\n\nPhysical risk and resilience assessment\n\nResilience planning and adaptation\n\nMonitoring and evaluation\n\n- -Chronic climate risks manifest gradually over time, encompassing challenges such as rising sea levels, increasing air temperatures, and longer-term changes in precipitation patterns. Chronic risks are characterised by a slower onset and progression, requiring longer-term adaptation strategies and planning. Chronic risks can result in reduced resource availability, increased costs (such as water and energy), impacts on productivity and health and wellbeing of our workforce, and can potentially affect supply chain resilience.\n\nThe combination of these two types of climate risk can lead to a compound extreme (such as a landfalling tropical cyclone coupled with higher sea levels) and can accentuate related impacts.\n\nBuilding resilience to a changing climate means having the capacity to anticipate, adapt to, and recover from the impacts of extreme weather events, ensuring the longterm viability of our assets, our people and communities, and broader value chains.\n\n## Our strategy and approach\n\nTaking and managing risk responsibly is essential to operating and growing our business safely, effectively, and sustainably. Enhancing our resilience to physical climate risk is an important component of our approach to climate change and is embedded within our risk management and internal controls framework. Our approach to physical climate risk and resilience is centred around four pillars that guide our risk management and work on adaptation, and is summarised below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop-down\n\nassessment\n\nGroup-wide\n\nBottom-up assessment Asset level\n\nOperations Environment People Community Supply chain",

Projections are used  to inform our asset-level and Global Industry Standard  on Tailings Management (GISTM) physical risk and  resilience assessments, operations, closure planning and  execution, exploration, projects, mine water  management, and Group finance and insurance. |\n\nClimate change projections are available for every site in our portfolio (including non-managed assets). Downscaled climate change projections are available for over 60 climate change variables and future emission scenarios from the IPCC Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 and 6 (CMIP5 and CMIP6). We have completed flood risk modelling for 100% of our managed and non-managed assets considering three future emission scenarios and time horizons spanning present-day, medium and long-term time horizons.\n\n## Physical risk and resilience assessment\n\nOur approach to quantifying and assessing physical risk (threats) and resilience is both targeted and systematic, spanning from individual assets (bottom-up) to the Group level (top-down). We first identify climate risks and opportunities across varying and applicable time horizons (present day/short term, medium and long term) and emission scenarios. Next, we evaluate their potential financial and non-financial consequences and likelihood and we prioritise these risks by materiality for effective risk management and appropriate resource allocation. This process is integrated within the Rio Tinto Risk Management Information System. The scope of our assessments includes our operations and the environments in which we operate, our people, the communities that host us, and our supply chain.\n\n## Resilience planning and adaptation\n\nEach site, operating context and location is unique. Our resilience planning identifies the most appropriate resilience measures to manage climate risks and adapt to them. This can explore multiple options, weighing up cost-benefit, alongside principles of adaptive management, modularity and sustainability. An investment decision is comprehensively evaluated before funding approval. This includes prioritising projects and engaging key stakeholders to seek alignment on the investment and its implementation.\n\n## Monitoring and evaluation\n\nRisks are actively and regularly monitored with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. Adaptation is a continuous and evolving process and we continually evaluate the latest-generation of climate change data and emerging technologies to assess the risk profile of our assets and infrastructure over time. Where a material change to the economic, social, environmental or physical context of the risk has been identified, the assessment process is revisited.\n\n## Physical climate risks and impacts\n\nCombining climate insights with a top-down assessment, we have identified eight Group-level material physical climate risks. Identifying and evaluating our most material challenges and significant risks empowers us to implement targeted controls, adaptation strategies and risk management plans, to safeguard our business and ensure a safe, profitable and productive operation in a rapidly changing climate.\n\nWhile the emergence of climate-related risks varies in response to the evolving nature of the underlying hazards, many of these risks could manifest today. For example, an extreme heat event could impact the health, safety and productivity of our workforce in the short term. However, increases in future temperature means that risks may become more material. The summary table on page 51 takes into account both the short-term risk that could emerge during current operations as well as the long-term risk associated with climate change.",

For more information on the water risk framework, see  page 59. The framework covers four themes, one of which relates to water supply (water  resource). The supply theme requires us to consider whether sufficient water is available  to supply both our operational demands and the demands of other stakeholders within  the broader catchment, under the range of conditions that are likely to occur over the  asset's life.

Our decarbonisation strategy is monitored by tracking progress on our abatement projects and reporting Scope 1 and 2 emissions. On Scope 3 emissions, we track our customer engagement on decarbonisation, progress on individual projects and partnerships as well as our emissions.\n\nWe provide metrics for transition-related opportunities (the increased demand for transition materials) on page 56. Physical risks metrics include the financial exposure metric and annualised damage metric on pages 57-58.\n\nWe have also disclosed other ESG-related KPIs, metrics and targets that integrate with our objective of achieving impeccable ESG credentials within the respective Environmental, Social, and Governance performance sections of this Annual Report . A summary of these metrics is found on page 43 with other Group KPIs highlighted on pages 20-22.\n\n## Scope 1 and 2: Operational emissions targets aligned with 1.5\u00b0C\n\nIn 2023, we updated our Scope 2 emissions reporting methodology to align with improved and evolving global GHG emissions reporting standards. Our primary metric for Group emissions is a market-based methodology and we have restated our baseline and current emissions. Further detail on this change in reporting and the implications for our emissions baseline is available in our 2023 Addendum - Scope 1, 2 and 3 Emissions Methodology report.\n\nWhile there is no universal standard for determining the alignment of targets with the Paris Agreement goals, we conclude that our Scope 1 and 2 targets for 2030 are aligned with efforts to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C. In 2021, KPMG provided limited assurance over the alignment of our Scope 1 and 2 targets with efforts to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C. They also provided assurance of the roadmap to delivering those targets (as set out in our 2 021 Climate Change Report ). KPMG provide assurance over our 2023 reporting of progress on our Climate Action Plan (CAP) commitments as well as on our 2023 Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.\n\n## Current year progress and update on 2025 target\n\nOur Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 32.6Mt CO 2 e in 2023. This is 6% below our 2018 baseline of 34.5Mt CO 2 e and slightly below our adjusted 2022 emissions of 32.7Mt CO 2 e (adjusted for acquisitions). Abatement delivered by our projects in 2023 exceeded emissions growth from higher production giving a slight reduction in emissions on a like for like basis.\n\nOur 2023 emissions were slightly higher than our actual 2022 emissions total of 32.3Mt CO 2 e due to the recent acquisitions of additional equity in OT and MRN.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of rising production, the emissions reductions achieved since 2018 are mostly the result of decarbonising power. These include PPAs at Escondida and the purchase of renewable energy certificates (RECs) at our Kennecott and Oyu Tolgoi copper operations.\n\nThe scale of our commitments on abatement projects has increased rapidly since we reset our Scope 1 and 2 emissions targets in October 2021. In 2023, we have made project commitments which deliver abatement of around 2Mt CO 2 e per year, mostly in renewable energy contracts and certificates, and biofuels deployment.\n\nBy 2025 we expect to have made financial commitments to abatement projects that will achieve more than 15% of Group emissions. However, our actual emissions abatement will lag this.\n\nThese delays are the result of a range of factors including engineering and construction timelines, pace of development related to new technology and energy systems in the locations we operate, and the need to carefully integrate our ambitions with the needs of our local communities and stakeholder groups. We also need additional abatement to address underlying emissions growth as our production plans evolve.\n\n## Progress to our 2030 target\n\nBetween now and 2030, the most significant opportunities to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions are to switch the electricity we generate or purchase to renewables, and to address process heat emissions from our alumina refineries.\n\nTo reach our 2030 goals, our single largest lever - accounting for around one-quarter of our emissions - is to develop a competitive renewable energy solution for the Boyne and Tomago aluminium smelters in our Pacific Aluminium Operations (PacOps). In December 2023, we signed a PPA to buy all the electricity, and associated green products to be generated in the future, from the 1.1GW Upper Calliope Solar Farm project, which if combined with more renewable power and suitable firming, transmission and industrial policy, could provide part of a solution to repower Rio Tinto's three Gladstone production assets (Boyne aluminium smelter, Yarwun alumina refinery and the Queensland Alumina Limited (QAL) alumina refinery). Once approved and developed, this solar project has the potential to reduce operating carbon emissions by 1.8Mt per year.\n\nWe must also execute other key projects in our pipeline related to renewable electricity contracts and alumina processing heat reductions to meet our 2030 target.\n\nWe expect to make financial commitments before the end of the decade that will result in structural abatement of our portfolio beyond 2030. This demonstrates our continued commitment towards our net zero goal.\n\nIn 2023, we built a 5MW solar plant pilot project at Kennecott Copper. We approved, subject to regulatory approvals, a 12.4MW solar system and a 2.1MWh battery storage system via long-term PPAs for Amrun. There have been continued discussions on the proposed coastal Pilbara solar photovoltaic with stakeholders and we progressed studies for further solar and wind developments.\n\nIn alumina processing, we have developed a decarbonisation energy strategy for Yarwun and QAL refineries. We have progressed our double digestion pre-feasibility study at QAL which includes the construction and commissioning of a pilot plant to provide technical inputs to support the study. Electric boiler feasibility studies have progressed at Vaudreuil and we have also approved the Yarwun Hydrogen Calcination Pilot Demonstration Program. .\n\nVoltalia began Phase 1 construction of a 130MW solar farm for Richards Bay Minerals (via PPA) and construction has also commenced on the 16MW Phase 2 Wind project at QIT Madagascar Minerals.\n\nIn the Pilbara, we remain committed to building 1GW of renewable energy capacity. However, due to the extended timeline for deployment of battery electric haulage solutions, we now estimate that 600MW to 700MW capacity is required by 2030.\n\nWe have completed the commercial and technical due diligence of the submissions for supply of renewable electricity to Gladstone aluminium assets. In 2024, we aim to progress renewable energy supply for Boyne Smelter, launch a Request for Proposal for renewable energy projects for Tomago, and seek renewable energy and storage capacity for Tranche 1 of electrification at the Gladstone alumina refineries.\n\nWhile prioritising emissions reductions at our operations, we are also investing in naturebased solutions (NbS) that can bring benefits to people, nature and climate. We may retire high quality carbon credits generated by these projects towards our 2030 targets. This will complement our abatement project portfolio - which aims to reduce operational emissions by 50% by 2030 - and support our compliance with carbon pricing regulation such as the Safeguard Mechanism in Australia. Our emissions reporting will continue to transparently distinguish between our underlying operational emissions, the volume and type of carbon credits retired and net Group emissions.\n\nIn 2023, our net emissions total does not include 86,000 ACCUs retired for compliance with the Safeguard Mechanism for the period 2021-22. We expect to include ACCUs in our net emissions figure from 2024 onwards.",

Restated emissions due to Scope 2 methodology changes. Data represent gross Scope 1 and 2 emissions and direct abatement projects.\n- 2. 'Other required' will flex over time based on abatement project delivery, growth, closures and asset changes.\n\n## Scope 3: Partnering to reduce the carbon footprint of our value chains\n\nIn 2023, our Scope 3 emissions were 578.1Mt CO 2 e (equity basis), approximately 18 times higher than our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Most of these emissions (94%) stem from customer processing of our products, particularly iron ore (69%) and bauxite and alumina (22%).\n\nScope 3 processing emissions related to our iron ore rose from 386.6Mt CO 2 e in 2022 to 399.9Mt CO 2 e in 2023 primarily due to an increase in production.\n\nDownstream processing emissions from bauxite and alumina decreased from 147.3Mt CO 2 e in 2022 to 129.8Mt CO 2 e mostly as a result of reduced emission intensities related to aluminium smelting in China.\n\nWe have seen a significant increase in the number of our customers setting public targets for their Scope 1 and 2 emissions (our Scope 3). About 53% of our total iron ore sales are now to steel producers with existing public targets to reach net zero by 2050, up from about 50% in 2022 and 28% in 2021. Meanwhile, nearly 40% of our bauxite sales are to customers with net zero emissions targets, though only 13% of this is to companies aiming for net zero by 2050. As these numbers rise, we expect to enhance our ability to partner through the value chain to achieve our common sustainability objectives.\n\nAs things stand today, our analysis of our customers' targets and their governments' commitments to reduce their emissions, shows a trajectory for those processing emissions that approaches net zero by around 2060.\n\nWe are committed to partner with our customers and suppliers to find better ways to help them achieve their targets a decade earlier - reaching net zero by 2050.\n\nTo do this, we are investing in the development of breakthrough technologies aiming to help decarbonise our value chains and upgrading our ores to be suitable for these.\n\nAs the world's largest iron ore producer, we have a key role to play in decarbonising the steel industry. We are currently working with over 40 partners across 50 projects in 10 countries. Supported by research on our ore bodies, our objective is to unlock the most sustainable and economic pathways for our iron ores.\n\nTo reduce our Scope 3 emissions, we have defined 4+2 focus areas to address our Scope 3 emissions. These include our four most significant categories considering the magnitude of emissions and our ability to drive meaningful incremental impact steel, alumina refining, shipping and procurement decarbonisation. In parallel, we are also working on two transversal programs aimed at leveraging our size and scale to support collective industry and policy action and enhancing emissions transparency across our value chains.\n\nSteel value chain: We are actively working with our customers to help reduce their carbon emissions from the current blast furnace process. We have progressed the design plan of the Baowu Meishan microwave lump drying pilot plant and are also testing increased lump usage in the blast furnace with POSCO and Zenith. An economically viable carbon capture technology with Shougang that could capture blast furnace gas is also currently in development.\n\nAs part of our focus on emerging pathways, we aim to utilise our high-grade iron ores to accelerate the early proliferation of low-carbon technologies. During the year, we signed a multi-year agreement to supply high grade direct reduction iron ore pellets from IOC operations to H 2 Green Steel's integrated steel plant. We are also evaluating a portfolio of options in energy-advantaged regions (Canada, US, Europe, Australia, and the Middle East) to accelerate the build-out of natural gas and, eventually, hydrogen shaft furnace solutions.\n\nDue to the scarce availability of high-grade ore, the main focus of our research and development is on a range of new technologies that unlock competitive low-carbon pathways for low and medium-grade iron ores.\n\nWe are working to solve the key constraints to this, notably removing impurities found in low-mid grade iron ores prior to/during iron and steel making.",

        "page_content": "We are currently evaluating the extent to which impurities can be economically removed from our Pilbara blend ores prior to processing and have completed mineral resource and inventory reviews to understand how much of our future reserves are suitable for upgrading. Our detailed feasibility study related to BioIron\u2122 has been completed and we have progressed research on the pelletisation of Pilbara ores.\n\nIn 2023, we spent $28 million on steel decarbonisation initiatives, and have set specific action-oriented targets for steel decarbonisation.\n\nWe estimate that we will spend $100 million on steel decarbonisation in 2024. Approximately one third of this will be capital expenditure on BioIron\u2122 (subject to approvals and technical feasibility), with the remainder being operational expenditure on our other partnerships.\n\nAluminium value chain: The majority of our product is processed in China using coalfired refining and smelting processes, where we have little influence over the power source for these electricity grids. Because of this, our short-to-medium-term focus is to help our customers improve the alumina refining process to increase energy efficiency and optimise the use of our bauxite. This is mostly via sweetening and improved digestion and renewable energy for heat source via hydrogen calcination and electric boilers in the longer term.\n\nIn 2023 we worked with three key customers representing more than 47% of our bauxite sales, to shortlist potential areas for future collaboration and we are now developing action plans to collaborate in priority ESG areas.\n\nProcurement: Due to the nature of our businesses, many of our purchased inputs are from hard-to-abate sectors, such as caustic, coke, pitch and steel. In 2023 we completed a study to understand the sources of our procurement-related emissions. This enhanced our understanding of the sources and nature of our procurement-related emissions, including our highest emitting categories and suppliers, and potential abatement solutions.\n\nShipping: Our Scope 3 emissions from shipping and logistics are 9.2Mt CO 2 e. We have achieved a 37% emissions intensity reduction relative to 2008 by incorporating larger, more efficient vessels such as Newcastlemaxes into our fleet, implementing various design improvements and technical modifications, and by ensuring the implementation of speed and route optimisation measures.\n\nWe continue to explore opportunities for biofuels and liquid natural gas (LNG) and are focused on bringing dual fuel, net zero vessels into our portfolio by 2030.\n\nAlthough the economics of implementing these fuels remain challenging, a 12-month biofuel trial has been completed on our owned vessels which affirmed the fuel's technical viability for existing vessels.\n\n## Scope 3 near-term targets\n\nBy holding ourselves accountable on real and measurable commitments in the near term, we can help to make sure technologies are developed early enough to accelerate the transition in the long term.\n\n## 2023 Scope 3 emissions by category and source (equity basis)\n\n578.1Mt CO 2 e (2022: 583.9Mt CO 2 e)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTherefore, this year we have set specific near-term targets for steel, alumina refining, shipping and procurement decarbonisation.\n\nTo accelerate steel decarbonisation, we have set targets to support our customers to reduce blast furnace emissions by 20-30% by 2035, halve our Scope 3 emissions from IOC by 2035 1 relative to 2022 levels, commission the BioIron\u2122 continuous pilot plant (CPP) 1 , shaft furnace (DRI) and Electric Smelting Furnace pilot plant by 2026 and finalise the Pilbara beneficiation pilot plant study by 2026.\n\nIn alumina decarbonisation, we are committing to partnerships with the goal of  improving energy efficiency, specifically via implementing and validating digestion improvement technology and developing approaches to control or remove organic compounds from the refining process. We are also committing to developing technologies that reduce moisture in our bauxite.\n\nIn relation to shipping emissions, we are aiming to reach net zero by 2050, have 10% of our chartered fleet using net zero fuel by 2030 (as per our First Movers Coalition pledge), achieve a 40% emissions intensity reduction by 2025 with a 50% reduction by 2030, and improve emissions reporting accuracy using actual voyage data in 2024.\n\nTo help decarbonise our procurement, starting in 2024, we will engage with our top 50 suppliers on decarbonisation and incorporate it as a key criterion for all new sourcing in high-emission categories.\n\n- 1.

Please see page 150 of this report and our 2023 Addendum - Scope 1, 2 and 3 Emissions Calculation Methodology report for further detail on our emissions reporting methodology.\n\nChanges to our 2018 baseline include: Scope 2 update to market-based methodology, the additional equity share of the Oyu Tolgoi mine that was purchased in mid-December 2022, and the additional equity share of MRN purchased in 2023 so a like-for-like comparison can be done on progress. We have also adjusted our 2022 emissions total to compare our actual progress on abatement in 2023 relative to other changes at our operations.\n\nThe baseline value is based on the current equity in each asset, including zero equity in divested assets.This differs from the \"Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions - equity basis\" table which does not get adjusted with asset or equity changes.\n\n- 1. Rio Tinto share (equity basis) represents emissions from our benefit or economic interest in the activities resulting in the emissions.\n- 2. Scope 2 emissions in the Baseline are calculated using the market- based method.\n\n## Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions - equity basis\n\n| Equity greenhouse gas emissions (Mt CO2e)                                                         |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1 emissions                                                                                 |  23.3  |   22.7 |   22.9 |   23   | 23.1   |\n| Scope 2: Market-based emissions 1                                                                 |   9.3  |    9.6 |   10.1 |   10.4 | 9.9    |\n| Total Scope 1 and 2 emissions                                                                     |  32.6  |   32.3 |   33   |   33.4 | 33     |\n| Carbon offsets retired 2                                                                          |   0    |    0   |    0   |    0   | 0      |\n| Total net Scope 1 and 2 emissions (with offsets retired)                                          |  32.6  |   32.3 |   33   |   33.4 | 33     |\n| Scope 2: Location-based emissions 3                                                               |   7.8  |    8.2 |    8.5 |    8.6 | 8.1    |\n| Scope 3 emissions                                                                                 | 578.1  |  583.9 |  558.3 |  576.2 | -      |\n| Operational emissions intensity (tCO2e/t Cu-eq)(equity) 4                                         |   6.8  |    7   |    7.2 |    7   | 6.8    |\n| Direct CO2 emissions from biologically sequested carbon  (eg CO2 from burning biofuels/biomass) 5 |   0.03 |    0   |    0   |    0   | 0      |\n\nQueensland Alumina Limited (QAL) is 80% owned by Rio Tinto and 20% owned by Rusal. However, as a result of QAL's activation of a step-in process following the Australian Government's sanction measures, Rio Tinto is currently entitled to utilise 100% of the capacity at QAL, but paying 100% of the costs for as long as that step-in continues. Our 2023 equity emissions and our 2018 baseline include QAL emissions on the basis of Rio Tinto's 80% ownership.  In 2023, the additional emissions associated with the step-in were 0.8Mt. Rusal has commenced proceedings challenging the validity of the step-in and the sanctions regime may change over time, such that the duration of the step-in remains uncertain. Historical Scope 1 and 2 emissions have been restated to reflect improvements in data quality.\n\n- 1. Scope 2: Market-based emissions reported as zero include Escondida, Resolution Copper, Weipa and Kennecott Copper with surrendered Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and Oyu Tolgoi I-RECs from Inner Mongolia and nearby provinces. QMM has a wind and solar contract with energy attributes.\n- 2. In 2023, we did not reduce our reported net emissions by using any surrendered carbon units as eligible offsets retired. Our net emissions total does not include 86,000 ACCUs retired for compliance with the Safeguard Mechanism for the period 2021-22. We expect to include ACCUs in our net emissions figure from 2024 onwards.\n- 3. Scope 1 and 2 equity emissions total - Location-based: 31.1Mt CO2e.\n- 4. Historical information for copper equivalent intensity has been restated in line with the 2023 review of commodity pricing to allow comparability over time.\n- 5. GHG Protocol Corporate accounting and reporting standard recommends disclosure of CO2 emissions from biologically sequestered carbon for transparency. These are from biofuel use and are not classified as our Scope 1 emissions.\n\n| 2023 equity greenhouse gas emissions by location (Mt CO2e)   |   Scope 1 Emissions  (Mt CO2e) |   Scope 2 Emissions 1 (Mt CO2e) |   Total Emissions  (Mt CO2e) |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Australia                                                    |                           13   |                             6.3 |                         19.2 |\n| Canada                                                       |                            6.4 |                             0   |                          6.4 |\n| Africa                                                       |                            0.5 |                             1.3 |                          1.8 |\n| US                                                           |                            0.9 |                             0   |                          0.9 |\n| Europe                                                       |                            0.3 |                             1.7 |                          2   |\n| South America                                                |                            0.5 |                             0   |                          0.5 |\n| Mongolia                                                     |                            0.2 |                             0   |                          0.2 |\n| New Zealand                                                  |                            0.5 |                             0   |                          0.5 |\n| Other                                                        |                            0.9 |                             0.1 |                          0.9 |\n| Total                                                        |                           23.3 |                             9.3 |                         32.6 |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## Physical climate risk and resilience Modelling financial exposure to physical climate risk\n\nThroughout 2023, we advanced our climate physical risk modelling, in collaboration with our climate risk consultants Marsh, and used modelling from XDI. Our latest analysis estimates the expected financial losses for individual assets, considering various time horizons and emission scenarios caused by discrete physical climate hazards. This analysis shows the potential financial losses associated with asset damage, but excludes the losses associated with business interruption or productivity loss. The latter, while considered in the formulation of the analysis, was excluded due to the complexity of our value chain and the increased subjectivity of loss attribution. This aspect may be considered in future years and requires further analysis to fully assess financial consequences.\n\nUnderstanding and quantifying our financial exposure to these physical climate risks is important for prioritising our adaptation and investment decisions, safeguarding our assets, maintaining operational resilience, ensuring long-term profitability, and aligning with the evolving expectations of investors, regulators and stakeholders.\n\nThis modelling process and methodology considers the following:\n\n- 1. Asset portfolio: encompasses a significant breadth of assets, including mining assets and critical infrastructure components, which are integral to our operations. Our modelling has considered over 18,000 individual points, each with unique latitude and longitude coordinates, representing assets across 76 sites in 18 countries. Assets are geolocated, facilitating the assessment of climate-related risks and hazards to their specific geographic location. Each point is assigned one of 28 asset archetypes, representing our diverse asset base. These archetypes best define the engineering characteristics and specifics of that point and determine the vulnerability to damage by different climate hazards. Archetypes do not capture unique design and engineering attributes of each asset.\n\nOnly active industrial and mining facilities were modelled, including non-managed operations. Corporate offices and remote operation centres have been modelled but are not presented in this analysis. Assets in our closure portfolio have not been modelled, but are considered in bottom-up physical risk and resilience assessments.\n\n- 2. Climate scenarios, time horizons and hazards: modelling considers two future emissions scenarios - Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) - from the IPCC, including RCP4.5 (intermediate greenhouse gas emission scenario) and RCP8.5 (high greenhouse gas emission scenario).\n\n| Emission scenario                                                                   | Description and outcome                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Intermediate  emissions scenario  IPCC Representative                               | Emissions peak around  2040, then decline.  Relative to the 1986-2005  period, global mean  surface temperature  changes are likely to be  1.1\u00b0C-2.6\u00b0C by 2100.                        |\n| High emissions  scenario  IPCC Representative  Concentration  Pathway 8.5  (RCP8.5) | Emissions continue to rise  throughout the 21st century  and is considered a worst- case climate change  scenario. Relative to the  1986-2005 period, global  mean surface temperature |\n\nSource: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n\nOur physical climate risk modelling considers present day (short term) and future risks. Multiple future time horizons are modelled, including 2030 (medium term), 2040 and 2050 (long term). Eight climate hazards are modelled in this analysis, including flooding (riverine and surface water), coastal inundation, including sea level rise, extreme heat, cyclonic wind, extreme wind, forest fire and freeze-thaw.\n\n- 3. Annualised damage (AD): the output of the modelling is calculated for each asset under various climate scenarios, time horizons and hazards. AD, expressed as a percentage, represents the expected average annual damage to an asset attributable to climate-related hazards relative to a fixed value (eg $1 million). As such, an AD of 0.5% would mean that for every $1 million of exposure, $5,000 could be damaged, on average, in any given year.\n\nAsset-specific outputs have been aggregated to the site, region and Group level. Risk categorisation is based on the AD values, with thresholds set at <0.2% for low AD risk, 0.2-1% for medium AD risk, and >1% for high AD risk.\n\nEstimates consider a stationary 'do nothing' approach for our operating assets and does not consider present or future controls, adaptation/resilience projects that will likely materially impact our AD cost.\n\n## Annualised damage risk scores\n\nAt the Group level, present day AD losses fall within the initial range of the medium AD risk category (0.2-1%). Considering projected future emission scenarios by 2050, increases in AD are expected. This places the Group's AD in the intermediate range of the medium AD risk category, potentially exceeding a two-fold rise from present values.\n\nCurrently, across nine core climate geographies where we operate, the risk of AD is low in three regions, medium in five and high in two. Notably, sites located in Asia, the Middle East and Guinea are the primary contributors to the highest risk classification. In both the intermediate and high emissions scenarios, by 2050, eastern Australia and New Zealand are also expected to be classified as high risk with up to a four-fold increase in AD. This is principally due to the potential effects of coastal inundation, surface water flooding and cyclonic winds. Other notable increases in risk are in Europe and the Middle East (an approximate 60% increase). The risk trend in Asia is steady through time.\n\nIn assessing the risk of various hazards under different emissions scenarios projected for 2050, there is a notable shift in the risk profile for various perils across our operating sites. The number of sites at risk from coastal inundation, riverine flood and surface water flood increase under both future emission scenarios. Of all hazards, riverine flood sees the largest increase by 2050 under a high emissions scenario. The number of operating sites at risk from cyclonic wind, extreme wind, forest fire, freeze-thaw and soil subsidence are not expected to materially change with future emissions scenarios.",

Climate change scenarios should be regarded as representations of a plausible future (what may happen in the future) and not as forecasts or predictions (what will happen in the future). These factors contribute to a range of possible outcomes. However, despite these challenges, such models are useful for assessing potential risks and informing strategic decision-making for climate-resilient infrastructure and adaptation.\n\nFurthermore, the accuracy of our analysis is contingent upon the quality and completeness of asset data and asset operating status. We have assumed there is no change in our operating assets and their value, not accounting for potential changes in types of operations, locations or design standards over time. Each asset was assigned an appropriate archetype, which best defines its engineering characteristics and subsequent vulnerability to specific hazards. This does not fully capture the unique design and engineering attributes of each asset, which may impact the resultant risk profile.\n\nThis analysis represents our initial perspective and is iterative, evolving with new scientific insights, climate projections, and advancements in risk modelling. We plan to regularly update this analysis to reflect our dynamic asset base.\n\nThe outcomes of this work will inform our areas of focus and refine our physical resilience program for 2024.\n\n## 2023 progress on physical risk and resilience\n\nThroughout 2023, we made progress on quantifying, managing and adapting to our physical climate risks.\n\n- -Advancing our bottom-up physical resilience assessments: progress in the Pilbara centered on further validation and quantification of physical climate-related risks from the 2022 climate change assessment and progress embedding physical resilience into business-as-usual management actions. We also conducted asset-level resilience assessments across our Canadian sites, including those in Saguenay, BC Works and IOC, as well as at our Simandou Iron Ore Project in Guinea and at Weipa and Yarwun in Australia. We have completed flood risk screening for all of our managed and non-managed assets.\n- -Quantifying our top-down financial risk exposure: scenario analysis was conducted across our global portfolio to quantify the financial impacts of physical climate risk.\n- -Global Industry Standards on Tailings Management (GISTM): in accordance with GISTM guidelines, we initiated a climate resilience assessment process for our tailings storage facilities (TSFs). The approach tests the design basis of each TSF component considering future climate change. Initially focused on 14 extreme and high-risk consequence TSFs, which we completed in 2023. Assessments for all remaining facilities will be completed by August 2025.\n- -Technical adaptation and guidance: i n 2023, we developed a new internal leading practice guideline on how to incorporate climate change into mine water management planning. This guidance provides insights on when and how to model the impacts of climate change to inform hydrological design.\n- -Supply chain: this year, we operationalised analytics that provide real-time natural hazard monitoring for 50% of our supply chain (tier 1-3 goods suppliers). Being alerted of potential supply disruption in real time provides our teams with the opportunity to make informed decisions to reduce supply chain disruption.\n\nIn 2024, we will progress bottom-up physical risk and resilience assessments across our operating sites and across our TSFs, in accordance with the GISTM. Climate physical risk modelling completed in 2023 has provided us with valuable data which will be used to focus our activities in 2024 and beyond.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\non physical risk and resilience see riotinto.com/climaterisk.",

        "page_content": "## Environmental stewardship\n\nAs environmental stewards, we focus on responsibly managing shared resources to protect the health, safety and livelihoods of local communities. We manage risk to minimise adverse environmental impacts from our operations and to sustain our shared ecosystems, planet and natural resources for future generations.\n\n## 2023 progress\n\nIn 2023, we continued to strengthen our approach to environmental risk management by updating and implementing a shared language, developing a standardised set of controls and associated performance requirements and ensuring we are assessing the full breadth of potential environmental impacts in a consistent way across our business. This is evident in our Group environmental risk taxonomy and consequence descriptions for risk and incidents.\n\nAs a forum member of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), we have undertaken pilots of the prototype risk management and opportunity disclosure framework at our Simandou site in Guinea and at Greater Hope Downs in Australia. The final framework was released in September 2023. Through our membership with ICMM, we are engaging with our industry peers to develop mining sector-specific guidance for TNFD. We have also refreshed our approach to managing nature-related risk and are developing a pathway to increasing our environment-related disclosures in line with the requirements of TNFD. As part of the Health, Safety, Environment and Security Transformation Program, we continue to improve how we manage our environmental data. Access to trusted and timely environmental data across all Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean sites is supporting decision making, meeting the growing demand for transparency and enabling us to set meaningful targets for continuous improvement in environmental performance. A project is underway to optimise environmental data collection across the business, leveraging existing tools as much as possible.\n\nWe have also worked to build a more consistent approach to environmental management and embed it across our business processes throughout the lifecycle of our operations. To support our assets in managing their overall health, safety and environmental performance, we continue to evolve our approach. We recently incorporated environmental and health risk ownership and performance management into our safety maturity model (SMM).\n\n## Water\n\nWater is a shared resource critical to sustaining biodiversity, people and economic prosperity. Increasingly disrupted weather patterns and more extreme weather events due to climate change, and a growing world population, mean efficiently managing water is more important than ever.\n\nThe way we think about water and manage associated risks reflects the diversity of our operations and geographic locations. A small proportion of our assets operate in water-scarce regions, while others must remove excess water to allow safe mining operations. These are examples of the many potential risks we manage across the lifecycle of our diverse operations.\n\nWe share water with the communities and ecosystems surrounding our operations, so we aim to avoid permanent impacts on water resources by carefully managing the quality and quantity of the water we use and return to the environment. This means balancing the needs of our operations with those of the local communities and ecosystems. We do this while considering the impact of climate change, already felt in the level of rainfall and water security at some of our operations. We understand this responsibility extends beyond the life of our operations.\n\nTo address this complexity, we adopt a catchment-level approach to developing potential solutions and managing our risks and impacts within our operations. We use 2030 water stress as determined by the World Resource Institute (WRI) to identify operational catchments of most concern.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nsee www.riotinto.com/water.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## First major mining company to publish site-by-site water usage data\n\nIn 2023, on World Water Day, we became the first major mining company to release our site-by-site water usage. The interactive online map shows surface water usage across our global network of managed sites in 35 countries.\n\nFor each site included, the database shows permitted surface water allocation volumes, annual allocation usage and the associated catchment runoff from average annual rainfall estimates.\n\nThese disclosures allow us to engage closer with our stakeholders and be even more transparent, while we continue to focus on becoming better water and land stewards for future generations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nsee www.riotinto.com/watermanagement.",

        "page_content": "## Group water risk profile (percentage of managed operations)\n\nTo manage our water impacts, we first need to understand the specific risks at more than 50 operating sites, as well as our overall Group impacts. To do this, we have developed a water risk framework that considers:\n\n- - water resource\n- - quality and quantity\n- - dewatering\n- - long-term obligations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water resource\n\nIs there enough water available for both environment needs, community needs and our operational use?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water quality and quantity\n\nDoes the way we manage water on site, or discharge excess water, cause environmental impacts or operational constraints?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dewatering\n\nDoes the removal of water from the operational areas of our sites impact regional aquifers or our mine plans?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Long-term obligations\n\nDo our operational activities generate long-term or ongoing obligations related to water?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2023 progress\n\n## Our water balance\n\nOur Group water balance outlines where water was withdrawn from, discharged to, recycled or reused and consumed at our operations.\n\nThe reported categories correlate with the requirements of ICMM and global reporting initiatives.\n\nWe also report on our aggregated water balance for sites in water-stressed areas. We assess water stress using the WRI's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas mapping tool.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nsee our 2023 Sustainability Fact Book at riotinto.com/sustainabilityreporting.\n\n## Our water numbers\n\nThe water resource risk at Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia is assessed as moderate, even though it is located in the Gobi Desert. Oyu Tolgoi sources its water requirements from a deep water supply, the Gunii Hooloi aquifer, a 150-metre deep resource holding around 6.8 billion cubic metres of non-drinkable saline water. Oyu Tolgoi uses this water source efficiently with water recycling and conservation practices implemented across the operation.\n\nOur QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM) operation in Madagascar operates in a highly sensitive area from a water, broader environment and community perspective. The discharges from our operation have the potential to impact receiving water quality and, therefore, the water quality risk is assessed as high. We are working to improve management activities on site, including our ability to more accurately measure our water discharge quality, and the deployment of a dedicated water treatment plant to adjust the discharge pH.\n\nImpacts associated with dewatering and water supply activities in the Pilbara are recognised as a very high risk for our business. Returning water to the aquifers impacted by our mining activities in a controlled manner is the focus of a number of studies. We are working with Traditional Owners on water management.\n\nWe may sometimes generate impacts that we are required to manage over the long term, such as post-closure pit lakes in the Pilbara, or potential seepage from our waste rock or tailings facilities in our aluminium and copper sites. Our systems and standards aim to ensure that risks are identified early and managed appropriately and responsibly throughout the asset lifecycle.\n\n## Our 2019-2023 water targets\n\nOur total operational withdrawals for 2023 were 1,170GL (2022: 1,173GL.). Freshwater, or category 1 quality, withdrawals accounted for 424GL or 36% of this total (2022: 432GL). Freshwater is generally suitable for consumption with minimal treatment required. Where possible, we aim to minimise our extractions from water sources of this quality.\n\nTotal discharges for 2023 were 692GL (2022: 694GL). Total water recycled or reused for 2023 was 303GL (2022: 312GL).\n\nOur five-year water targets allow us to be more transparent about our water usage, risk profile, management and specific challenges. These targets, and the data required to measure progress against them, are helping us become better water stewards.\n\nOur water targets were set in 2019 and consisted of one Group target and six sitebased targets, reflecting our catchmentbased approach and recognising that we manage vastly different water-related risks across our business.\n\nThe site-based targets were chosen based on their water risk profile, our ICMM commitments, and local community and environmental interdependencies.\n\nWe use this framework to identify, assess and manage water risks. This comprehensive approach extends beyond our mandatory reporting obligations and allows us to have relevant conversations about water risks internally and with stakeholders in the communities where we operate. In 2023, we continued to embed the Group water control library, a suite of critical controls and their associated performance requirements to manage our water risks.\n\nOur Group water risk profile shows the level of exposure against each of the four risk categories. Most of our water risks sit in the low to moderate range. There are some in very high and high categories for each. Regardless of the level of risk, we apply rigorous standards and processes to manage them. Below we give examples of how the risk framework has been applied across some of our assets with site-based targets.",

They also provide important services to the communities where we operate and our business. We are committed to protecting biodiversity, and our ambition is to achieve no net loss where we operate. This means striking a balance between negative impacts on biodiversity and positive outcomes achieved through mitigation.\n\n## 2023 progress\n\nWe are active members of ICMM and other industry associations and working groups seeking to drive improvements for our industry. Our involvement in the ICMM Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) working group, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Biodiversity Technical Committee and the ICMM Nature Working Group have contributed to the development of important industry resources: the TNFD framework, the draft GRI Biodiversity Standard, and ICMM's Nature Position Statement.\n\n## Land\n\n## 2023 progress\n\nIn 2023, we rehabilitated 22 square kilometres of land, mostly at our iron ore mines and exploration areas in the Pilbara, Western Australia and our mineral sands mines in South Africa and Madagascar. Of this, we rehabilitated 4.5 square kilometres of ex-pit landforms and legacy areas across our Pilbara mines. This is part of our Iron Ore business's plan to increase rehabilitation, in partnership with Pilbara Aboriginal businesses. Since 2021, we have completed 24 square kilometres of land rehabilitation across our Pilbara mine operations.\n\nIn Mongolia, we have rehabilitated 4 square kilometres of abandoned mine workings\n\n## Waste\n\n## 2023 progress\n\nWaste and residues from our operational activities are key areas of our environmental risk management. In 2023, we continued to focus on managing potential contamination from these sources. This included work to remove all use of PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in fire-suppression systems at our sites, which will continue through to 2024 due to delays in retrofits of equipment and infrastructure and challenges sourcing alternative fluorine-free substances for use in fire-suppression systems in some jurisdictions.\n\nAt some of our long-life assets, we continue to evaluate waste management practices of the past that have led to a need for remediation in the present. We focus on finding better ways to\n\nWe continue to assess the sensitivity of our activities by using global datasets of threatened species and conservation and protected areas, developed by the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP WCMC). Together with the UNEP WCMC, we completed an updated biodiversity sensitivity study in 2023 to inform risk prioritisation across our activities, including exploration and projects, and support allocation of resources. Work will continue in 2024, to be guided by the recommendations of the TNFD framework.\n\nWe continue to innovate to help us become better environmental stewards. In 2023, in partnership with the UNEP WCMC, we piloted a standard method for efficiently identifying potential actions to deliver conservation value beyond the management of our direct impacts. Together with UNEP WCMC, we conducted TNFD pilots at two sites (Simandou in Guinea and Greater Hope Downs in Western Australia) to inform the development of the framework. This process provides us with a better understanding of our impacts, dependencies and importantly, the key environmental monitoring and management activities that will underpin future disclosure requirements.\n\nbased outside our operational footprint, along valley floors and river beds in the Selenge province. This is a part of Oyu Tolgoi's commitment to the Government of Mongolia's national movement to plant one billion trees by 2030.\n\nIn 2023, our land footprint - total disturbed area - was 3,848 square kilometres, an increase of 38 square kilometres compared to 2022. This includes all disturbances to our operating assets and activities, such as exploration activities, smelters, mines and supporting infrastructure.\n\nOur rehabilitation teams continue to partner with research centres and universities to refine our rehabilitation approaches and improve outcomes.\n\nextract maximum value and to transform waste and by-products from our operations into materials the world needs. One example is our work to sustainably extract and produce highpurity scandium oxide and tellurium from waste streams.\n\nWe also continue to look for opportunities to repurpose items we purchase at the end of useful life. For example, in 2023, we partnered with a local business to trial recycling end-oflife conveyor belts used to move iron ore across our Pilbara operations. This trial will continue into early 2024 and has the potential to divert 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes of waste from landfill every year.\n\nSome of our assets generate mineral waste with the potential to be chemically reactive, requiring\n\nIn 2023, we continued the independent review of monitoring programs at our highpriority biodiversity sites.\n\nThis involved ensuring management plans and actions adequately address biodiversity risks. We completed this review at our Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) site in 2023, with further efforts planned for 2024.\n\nWe also submitted a revised Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for our planned mine and rail activities at our Simandou project in Guinea, drawing on data collected over the last decade, and have progressed work to deliver an ESIA in 2024 for the planned development of the port.\n\nAt our Weipa operations, we continue to use machine-learning solutions to support research and monitoring of the endangered Palm Cockatoo and have partnered with the Australian National University and Australia Zoo's Wildlife Warriors to better understand the challenges faced by this species. This ensures that leading conservation science informs our decisions and helps bring balanced perspectives, innovation and best practice to responsible environmental stewardship.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our biodiversity work see riotinto.com/biodiversity.\n\nWe continue to support the Australian-led Cooperative Research Centre for Transformation in Mining Economies (CRC TiMe) through research that addresses the complex challenges underpinning mine closure and relinquishment. At our bauxite mines and refineries we have continued trials focusing on transforming stored tailing material into soils that will support plant growth. We also continued trials using satellite-derived data to test methodologies aimed at providing insights to support onground monitoring for vegetation and erosion monitoring of rehabilitation.

We conduct independent reviews every four years to assess the effectiveness of our risk management programs and identify areas for improvement. In 2023, this was done at two sites - Diavik in Canada and RBM in South Africa. The review at Diavik revealed long-term progress in managing and controlling our mineral waste risks. At RBM there were no risks of critical or high significance, and the risk posed by reactive mineral wastes at the asset was low.  Further opportunities to improve mineral waste management will continue at both sites in the short and long term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information\n\nabout tailings see page 64.",

We are working to improve air quality management, focusing on emissions of particulate matter and gases from our operational activities, including mining, materials handling, processing and transportation. The potentially hazardous emissions we monitor at operations are:\n\n- - sulphur oxides (SOx), mainly at our aluminium and copper smelters\n- - nitrogen oxides (NOx), mainly from burning fossil fuels\n- - gaseous fluoride emissions from aluminium smelters\n- - respirable particulate emissions (PM 10 and PM 2.5 ), very fine particles from mining and processing operations and from burning fossil fuels.\n\nWe focus on reducing emissions at source by upgrading equipment to use the best available technologies, adding air pollution control equipment, implementing mitigation measures and using renewable energy or alternative feed material where possible. Our air quality management programs include monitoring, sampling at source, incident tracking and risk assessments.\n\nMany of our assets have multi-year air quality improvement projects in place. For example, at Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC), there is a multidisciplinary working group focused on assessing dust abatement options. We are mitigating dust at the source by introducing new dust control technology at the induration machine stacks. The working group is also exploring biodegradable dust suppressants to limit wind erosion at IOC's tailings facilities. We have expanded our air quality monitoring network at IOC's mine in Labrador City and  at our Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec Operations Sorel-Tracy plant.\n\n## Operational environment overview\n\n|                                                               | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Significant environmental incidents 1                         | 1      | 0      | 3      | 0      | 0      |\n| Fines and prosecutions - environment ($'000) 2                | 987    | 110    | 7      | 27     | 19     |\n| Land footprint - disturbed (cumulative square kilometres)     | 3,848  | 3,810  | 3,735  | 3,630  | 3,627  |\n| Land footprint - rehabilitated (cumulative square kilometres) | 552    | 522    | 494    | 490    | 489    |\n| Mineral waste disposed or stored (million tonnes)             | 977    | 978    | 1,005  | 987    | 905    |\n| Non-mineral waste disposed or stored (million tonnes)         | 0.73   | 0.75   | 0.65   | 0.47   | 0.28   |\n| SOx emissions (thousand tonnes)                               | 72.5   | 66.2   | 70.2   | 75.7   | 76.8   |\n| NOx emissions (thousand tonnes)                               | 64.8   | 64.6   | 62.3   | 65.2   | 63.4   |\n| Fluoride emissions (thousand tonnes)                          | 2.61   | 2.36   | 2.36   | 2.27   | 2.34   |\n| Particulate (PM10) emissions (thousand tonnes)                | 146.0  | 146.3  | 142.3  | 143.2  | 130.7  |\n\n## Turning slime into solar panels\n\nTellurium is one of the rarest elements on Earth, usually found in small, sparse rock deposits, making it difficult to mine at scale. But at our Kennecott copper operations near Salt Lake City, Utah, we have discovered a way to extract tellurium from an unlikely source - slime waste material. And while we know we have more to do to eliminate waste completely, Kennecott's tellurium plant is the latest example of work we are doing globally to minimise our waste by finding a use for every material we dig from the ground or creating new products from the waste itself.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information about how we extract tellurium from slime see riotinto.com/telluriumfromwaste.\n\nIn some instances, we exceeded permissible dust levels at nearby air quality monitoring stations. We investigated all high dust concentration events. Most resulted from unusual forest fires, such as those close to our operations in Sept-\u00celes, Canada, in June, where exceedances were observed over a large region. Improving our air quality monitoring network over the coming years will help us to prevent dust incidents in the future.",

        "page_content": "## Mining and metals practices\n\n## Tailings\n\nWe engage with stakeholders throughout the lifecycle of our tailings storage facilities, from design to closure. We also collaborate closely with external bodies to improve the way tailings are managed across our industry.\n\nWe operate 98 tailings storage facilities (TSFs) across our global assets. Thirty-nine are active TSFs, 26 are inactive and 33 are closed. There have been no external wall failures at any of our TSFs for more than 20 years.\n\nWe work through technical committees and joint venture relationships to support leading practice in tailings management. Our full tailings disclosure is available on our website at riotinto.com/tailings. We periodically update the list of TSFs to reflect operational and ownership changes, including changes due to the transition to closure or remediation obligations for legacy assets and reclassification of facilities.\n\nOur facilities are regulated and permitted and have been managed for many years to comply with local laws, regulations, permits, licences and other requirements. Tailings management has been included in the Group risk register since 2010, and our Group safety standard for tailings and water storage facilities has been in place since 2015. Our internal assurance processes verify that our managed TSFs operate in accordance with this standard, which we updated in 2020.\n\nOur TSFs have emergency response plans tested through training exercises in collaboration with stakeholders such as local emergency services - and follow strict business resilience and communication protocols.\n\n## Closure and repurposing\n\nAs we mine and process metals and minerals we have an environmental and social impact. Our aspiration is to create a positive legacy, meeting our commitments to stakeholders and host communities, and deliver environmental, social and financial value. The end of an asset's life is an opportunity for a new beginning. We are finding better ways to repurpose and renew our assets.\n\n## 2023 progress\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe recognise we are often a short chapter in the long history of the land where we operate. Understanding this, our first step is to work with stakeholders to develop a shared vision for the future and a pathway to deliver that together.\n\nToday, we incorporate closure through each stage of the asset lifecycle, in the way we design, build and operate. In 2023 we made it easier for operating assets to fund progressive closure work to reduce our impact. For more information on progressive rehabilitation in 2023, see page 65.\n\n## 2023 progress\n\nWe have continued to progress our implementation of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM), which focuses on preventing tailings facility failures, reducing the social and environmental impacts of tailings facilities, and improving engagement and transparency on tailings with local communities. We have also assessed our progress on implementation through selfassessment and independent audits using ICMM's GISTM Conformance Protocols.\n\nMuch of the implementation work is already complete for the tailings facilities that have a 'very high' or 'extreme' consequence classification, and all these tailings facilities are nearing conformance with the GISTM. However, there is still work to do to complete the implementation and to embed the changes made.\n\nImplementation work programs are specific to each tailings facility, and while the timing for completion of each work program varies, we anticipate that we will deliver this work progressively and that all 'very high' and 'extreme' consequence classification tailings facilities will fully meet the requirements of the GISTM in 2024 (except where longerterm engineering works are required).\n\nIn August 2023, we disclosed detailed information for the tailings facilities we operate that are rated 'very high' or 'extreme' under the GISTM consequence classification scheme. We also disclosed information on the other tailings facilities we operate that have lower GISTM consequence classifications, based on the Investor Mining and Tailings Safety Initiative (IMTSI) request for public disclosures on tailings.\n\nWe develop asset closure strategies to identify potential future land uses and focus on opportunities to reduce closure costs and risks over the asset lifecycle. We completed eight additional asset closure strategies in 2023, and now have these in place for 59%  of our active operations. All of our operating sites have closure plans, and we are developing closure plans for assets that have an indefinite life such as some port facilities. We review these plans regularly to align with stakeholder expectations and to incorporate lessons learned from other closure projects. At operations with joint ownership structures, we endeavour to work in partnership with other asset owners to ensure closure is considered through asset design, planning and operations.\n\nTo bring greater certainty to our closure plans, we are undertaking 16 closure studies across operations and our legacy portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our closure risks see page 84.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our most recent tailings facilities disclosures see our interactive map at riotinto.com/tailings.\n\n## In 2023, we:\n\n- - Continued to regularly convene the Tailings Management Committee with our designated Accountable Executives, which provides coordinated governance of tailings management practices across the Group.\n- - Conducted multi-disciplinary risk assessments for all our 'very high' and 'extreme' consequence facilities.\n- - Continued to partner with BHP on tailings filtration solutions at very high throughputs for copper operations, which supports our goal of increasing water recovery and recycling.\n- - Continued to support the Future Tails partnership, a collaboration between Rio Tinto, BHP and the University of Western Australia (UWA). In 2023, seven students were awarded a Graduate Certificate in Tailings Management from UWA, three of whom are Rio Tinto employees. This year, the program had 91 students from 15 countries who have enrolled in 262 micro-credentialled units. Two PhD candidates also commenced their research programs in 2023.\n- - Continued to play an active role in the ICMM tailings working group, which provides guidance to support the safe, responsible management of tailings with the goal of eliminating fatalities and catastrophic events.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlegacy assets managed within our portfolio\n\n## 59%\n\nof our active operations have asset closure strategies in place\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin closure provisions on our balance sheet at the end of 2023 (2022: $15.8bn)",

We began a trial to recycle end of life tyres and belts at Argyle and we completed the first shipments of scrap steel from the Gove refinery for recycling.\n- - To identify opportunities to create value, we consider options for reprocessing. At Nevada Copper, a former copper site in McGill, Nevada, US we completed a drilling program with Regeneration Enterprises.\n- - To create long-term social and economic value from the remediation effort at Beatson, a series of former underground copper mines on Latouche Island in Prince William Sound, Alaska we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Native Village of Chenega, an Alaska Native tribe, and Chenega Corporation, an Alaska Native corporation, establishing a framework for collaboration toward achieving common goals.\n\n## Innovating\n\nWe innovate to seek lasting benefits. We partner with universities, governments and other organisations to find opportunities to repurpose and reprocess mineral and industrial waste, improve treatment and valorisation of mining-influenced waters, and explore the social aspects of mine closure.\n\n- - Our Mining Influenced Water Challenge was launched to inspire solutions for sustainable water treatment through closure. We received 98 submissions from 36 countries. We have committed to fund $15 million over three years for the 13 projects selected.\n- - We launched a crowdsourcing campaign through the Pioneer Portal to seek partners to develop a remote sensing solution for environmental monitoring and mineral waste characterisation receiving 100 concept papers.\n- - We continue to progress our partnership with the Mining Microbiome Analytics Platform to better understand the data collected about\n\nthe microbes we have at our sites and how they can support rehabilitation and recover metals from mineral waste at closed sites.\n\nWe continue to build our expertise and learn as we execute closure work and manage our legacy portfolio.\n\n## Argyle diamond mine\n\nWe continue to rehabilitate the Argyle diamond mine on Miriwoong and Gija country in Western Australia. In 2023, we completed removal of the processing plant above ground infrastructure, continued reprofiling of the alluvial mining and waste rock landforms and capping of the tailings storage facility. We have reviewed our contracting strategy to increase work awarded to Traditional Owner businesses, increasing our spend to A$33 million in 2023 (2022: A$21 million). We are engaging with Traditional Owners on how to best support and expand meaningful participation.\n\n## Gove refinery and residue disposal areas\n\nIn 2023, we began the largest demolition project in the Southern Hemisphere at the Gove refinery in the Northern Territory, Australia.  While water treatment and capping of the residue disposal areas continues, we are working closely with Gumatj and Rirratjingu Traditional Owners, and the Northern Territory Government, to plan for the future of the region beyond mining. In 2023, we spent A$94 million with Traditional Owner businesses, a decrease on the previous year due to lower global fuel prices (2022: A$101 million).\n\n## Ranger uranium mine\n\nEnergy Resources of Australia (ERA) is rehabilitating the Ranger uranium mine in the Northern Territory, Australia. We are committed to the successful rehabilitation of the Ranger Project Area to a standard that will establish an environment similar to the adjacent Kakadu National Park, a World Heritage site. We acknowledge the Traditional Owners', the Mirarr People, consistent opposition to developing the Jabiluka uranium deposit and restate our full support for ERA's commitment that the deposit would never be developed without the Mirarr People's consent. Our utmost priority and commitment is to the rehabilitation of the Ranger Project Area in a way that is consistent with the wishes of the Mirarr People.\n\nOn 4 April 2023, we announced our support for ERA's Interim Entitlement Offer (IEO), which raised approximately A$369 million to address funding requirements for the Ranger Rehabilitation Project to the end of the second quarter of 2024.  Rio Tinto, which\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nowns 86.3% of ERA's shares, subscribed for its full entitlements under the terms of the IEO, at a cost of A$319 million.\n\nIn October 2023, ERA announced that the findings of a 2022 Feasibility Study were under review. The study was undertaken on a lower technical risk rehabilitation methodology and to further refine the Ranger Project Area rehabilitation execution scope, risks, cost and schedule. In December 2023, ERA announced that they expected rehabilitation costs to materially exceed the previously estimated range and expected to increase their closure provision to approximately A$2.3 billion.\n\nRio Tinto continues to provide project support, including organisational and technical support, as requested by ERA. For more information, please visit ERA's website.\n\n## Legacy assets\n\nWe manage over 90 legacy assets in nine countries and 28 tailings storage facilities, for more information on tailings management see page 64.\n\nIn 2023, we donated over 28 acres of land to the Southwestern Oregon Community College in Brookings, Oregon, US to support the expansion of their Curry Campus. The donation triples the size of the Curry Campus providing additional education opportunities in the region.\n\nIn France we opened an eco-park in partnership with the French Ministry of ecological transition at Le Thoronet, a former bauxite mine. The park features hiking trails and diverse habitat areas to support local wildlife.\n\nWe completed relinquishments at Lochacker Schreiber, a former landfill in Switzerland returning the land to local government for future use, long-term management and monitoring.\n\nAt Kelian, a former gold mine in Indonesia we have entered into a post-mining agreement with the province of East Kalimantan, under the supervision of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry to support the long-term management of the site. We have completed the restoration of the environment in the protected forest, which contains a rhinoceros sanctuary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout closure provisions and financial statements see page 196.\n\n## Building capability in closure\n\nMine closure is a complex challenge that we face as an industry. Changing societal expectations mean the landscape is evolving and we need to develop specialist skills and capability in closure. We developed the Leadership in Sustainable Mine Closure Program in partnership with the University of British Columbia, Curtin University and Ernst & Young to help meet this need and create opportunities to share best practices and learnings. Learn how some of our first program participants are finding better ways to incorporate closure into their work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information\n\nsee riotinto.com/closure.",

We work hard to avoid or minimise adverse impacts and seek to understand, and invest in, the diverse knowledge, cultures and resources that exist in areas where we operate. Our ambition is to contribute to positive and enduring outcomes for our workforce and the communities and countries where we operate.\n\n## Community engagement and social investment\n\nThe strength of our relationships with the communities where we operate, and broader society, is fundamental to our business. Without the support from host communities we can not operate successfully.\n\nThrough our partnerships, we strive to support communities in achieving their aspirations and improve lives by contributing to social and economic outcomes, all while respecting and protecting their connection to culture and nature.\n\nWe have evolved our approach to engaging with communities and Indigenous Peoples across our business. By listening to understand, being willing to learn from our mistakes and genuine partnering, we will deliver better long-term outcomes for everyone. It enhances our understanding and appreciation of the people and diverse cultures in the geographies where we work. Our relationships with Indigenous Peoples are a priority for us and we especially value our agreements with First Nations People of the lands on which we operate.\n\nWe seek out the voices of communities to inform our planning and decision making, and it helps us manage our impacts better, contribute to social outcomes and preserve and protect heritage.\n\nOur Communities and Social Performance (CSP) teams work across our entire business and include people with a range of expertise, from archaeologists, anthropologists, social scientists and economic development experts, to human rights specialists and operational leaders. While these teams help to implement our technical activities, everyone in our business has a role to play in our social licence.\n\nOur assets operate in line with our global Communities and Social Performance Standard , which was revised and strengthened in 2022. Our standard provides clear direction on what success looks like and the minimum requirements expected across our global business.\n\n## 2023 progress\n\nWe continue to strengthen our social performance capacity and capability to be better operators and partners. Throughout 2023, our CSP practitioners undertook online learning, communities of practice and face-toface cross-functional workshops. We have also added central roles in key areas such as heritage, agreements and human rights.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnderstanding and acting on the perceptions of communities who host our operations is essential. In 2023, we trialled a new program which will be rolled out across the Group in 2024 and 2025, to help us more effectively engage and better understand our host communities' perceptions, leading to improved data-driven social performance.\n\n## CSP targets\n\nIn 2023, we progressed initiatives towards our 2026 CSP targets. We focused on developing and implementing frameworks and measurement criteria for both cultural heritage co-management and social investment strategic partnerships. Our human rights training continued throughout the year, with planning for expanded online learning programs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information\n\nabout our CSP targets see page 43.",

The protests affected the safety and well-being of employees and people in the communities and in October 2023, an altercation between protesters and public security forces escalated into violence. Public security forces officially reported one person died, and one person was injured. We are committed to learning from this tragic event and will work together with local communities and other stakeholders through open, meaningful, and respectful dialogue to seek to prevent such incidents in the future and find safe, peaceful and long-term solutions to community concerns.\n\nIn 2023, QMM committed to increase its community and social investment spend to $4 million per year, on projects to be co-designed with communities, authorities and government, and which are consistent with local, regional and national development plans. This is part of a range of initiatives aimed at maintaining trust and collaboration with local communities. Our commitment to reforestation also continues through our initiative to help local communities establish village tree nurseries.\n\n## Resolution Copper project, Arizona, US\n\nAt our Resolution Copper project, we are committed to preserving Native American and local community cultural heritage and bringing lasting benefits to the entire region. We continue to strengthen relationships with local communities and Native American tribes by deepening our engagement and partnership support. In 2023, we signed agreements with a number of Native American tribes with ancestral ties to the land, to work together on youth recreation, cultural preservation and economic initiatives. We also finalised a Good Neighbour agreement with the Town of Superior to define the relationship with the town and local community groups over the life of the mine.\n\nResolution Copper also entered into several multi-year partnership agreements with local and national-level Native American organisations supporting education and youth recreation, including the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES), the Native American Basketball Invitational (NABI) and the Belvado Foundation at the San Carlos Apache community.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nvisit Resolution Copper's website resolutioncopper.com/cultural-heritage.\n\n## Simandou project, Guinea\n\nAt our Simandou iron ore project, we work with local communities to design and deliver local social investment programs, regional economic development programs and livelihood restoration initiatives to build community resilience and support the future of the operation. By raising local capacities, engaging with local entrepreneurs, and investing in training and development, we hope to contribute to a better future for the local communities.\n\nWe also work with our infrastructure and joint venture partners to ensure a consistent application of internationally recognised environmental and social performance standards across the entire project. And we are implementing human rights due diligence processes to understand our potential human rights impacts and ensure our employees, contractors and those in the local communities are treated with dignity and respect.\n\n## Oyu Tolgoi, Mongolia\n\nAt Oyu Tolgoi, we strive to be a leader in sustainable social and economic change through partnerships with local communities and government. Since 2015, we have made an annual contribution to the regional Development Support Fund (DSF) administered jointly by Oyu Tolgoi and the community - for community initiatives in the Umnugovi aimag. In 2023, the fund provided $6.2 million to help complete a local school, kindergarten and health care centre and construct sewage pipelines, pasture irrigation, waste plant and rare animal protection projects. This has improved accessibility and provided a better standard of living for community members.\n\nThe Future Generation Special Fund makes up 5% of the annual DSF investment and provides development opportunities for youth. In 2023, 114 local students were awarded the Goviin Oyu scholarship to study in specialist fields. Since 2015, 519  students have received scholarships, and of these, 70% have been hired for jobs in their local communities.\n\nEmployment from the local communities at Oyu Tolgoi increased by 10% in 2023 due to a comprehensive recruitment process and local talent development. There is also a focus on strengthening the local and national supply chain with local spending increasing from $261 million in 2022 to $272 million in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, Oyu Tolgoi committed $50 million over five years to support the Khanbogd Soum town development by 2040. Some infrastructure projects are already underway, including the construction of a road, a public square, a recreational sport centre and the renovation of the local hospital.\n\nOyu Tolgoi also continues to work with herders, local communities and the government to improve water accessibility and address the increased demand for water.\n\n## Panguna mine, Bougainville, Papua New Guinea\n\nThe Panguna mine was operated by Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL), majorityowned by Rio Tinto, for 17 years from 1972 until 1989, when operations were suspended due to a civil war, which lasted until 1998. In 2016, we transferred our 53.83% majority shareholding in BCL to the Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG) and the Papua New Guinea (PNG) Government for no consideration, enabling the ABG and PNG to hold an equal share in BCL of 36.4% each.\n\nIn September 2020, the Human Rights Law Centre (HRLC) filed a complaint against Rio Tinto on behalf of 156 Bougainville residents with the Australian National Contact Point (AusNCP) regarding the Panguna site.\n\nIn 2021, as an outcome of the AusNCP engagement, a joint committee of stakeholders, the Panguna Mine Legacy Impact Assessment Oversight Committee (Committee), was formed to oversee a detailed independent assessment of the Panguna mine. The Panguna Mine Legacy Impact Assessment (Legacy Impact Assessment) will cover the environmental impacts, and directly connected social and human rights impacts, caused by the Panguna mine since the cessation of mining. The Committee is chaired by an independent facilitator with representatives from the ABG, the Independent State of PNG, clan leaders and landowners, local communities, Rio Tinto, BCL and HRLC. It has met regularly since its formation.\n\nIn 2022, the Committee selected and endorsed Tetra Tech Coffey to undertake phase 1 of the Legacy Impact Assessment. The Legacy Impact Assessment began in December 2022 and continued throughout 2023 with three field campaigns completed successfully. The field work in 2023 included interviews with community members across the study areas as well as assessing the stability of aging mine infrastructure and impacts related to water quality and flooding. The Legacy Impact Assessment will provide all parties with a clearer understanding of the human rights impacts, so we can consider the best way forward together. Results will be presented to the Committee when phase 1 is completed (due 2024).",

Halco is a consortium comprised of Rio Tinto (45%), Alcoa (45%) and Dadco Investments (10%). Rio Tinto participates on the boards of Halco and CBG, with representation on various shareholder oversight committees.\n\nThrough our Board and committee roles, we monitor and support CBG's approach to environmental protection, community issues and human rights. We are aware of the concerns regarding access to land and water, and the pace of livelihood restoration programs as well as concerns regarding CBG's stakeholder engagement.\n\nIn 2023, sustainability advisory committees at Halco and CBG levels met regularly, strengthening our governance oversight and providing support to CBG for the improvement of CBG's social and environmental practices, including for the development of an ongoing human rights due diligence process. Both the Halco and CBG advisory committees are closely following CBG's response to a complaint made to the International Finance Corporation's (IFC) Office of the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO). The mediation process facilitated by the CAO has conducted four plenary sessions and several other bilateral meetings between the parties in 2023. Through a collaborative approach, important progress was made with agreements on CBG's practices on stakeholder engagement and management of grievances. Additionally, the implementation of previous agreements on blasting and access to water have progressed, delivering positive outcomes to local communities. Halco continues to participate in the mediation process as an observer, alongside the IFC.\n\n## Social investment\n\nWe have a long history of partnering to support the host communities and regions where we operate. We employ local people, buy local products, and engage local services. In 2023, our total voluntary global social investment was $84 million, covering a wide range of social and economic programs. And we introduced a new company-wide approach to social investment, which focuses on working together with communities to find out what is important to them so we can make decisions that will deliver positive and enduring outcomes. This is essential for our continued social licence in an increasingly complex world..\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our partnerships and community engagement see riotinto.com/ socialeconomicdevelopment\n\n## Update on our communities and social performance commitments\n\nThis section provides an update on our CSP commitments  made after the tragic destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in May 2020. This remains an important area of focus, as we continue to find better ways, recognising we always have things to learn.\n\nIn 2021 and 2022 we asked Traditional Owner groups in the Pilbara to share feedback on our progress on some of the commitments we made as part of the Rio Tinto Board Review in 2020 on cultural heritage management. We repeated this process in 2023 with six out of ten Pilbara Traditional Owner entities choosing to respond. The verbatim feedback is presented on our website at riotinto.com/juukangorge as it was provided, with only the names removed for anonymity. We now have a three-year longitudinal perspective on our relationships. We have summarised our progress under three areas: relationships, governance and process, and leadership and inclusion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nsee our 2021 and 2022 Communities and Social Performance Commitments Disclosures at riotinto.com/cspreport.\n\n## Relationships\n\nWe are finding better ways to work with communities and Indigenous Peoples, particularly in how we protect heritage. We are moving to a model of co-management, working in partnership with Indigenous Peoples across our operations. Our approach aims to enhance our understanding and appreciation of Indigenous cultural heritage and ensure that Indigenous voices inform our planning and decision making.\n\n## Social, Cultural and Heritage Management Plans\n\nIn 2023, our Iron Ore business advanced five Social, Cultural, and Heritage Management Plans for proposed developments, with positive feedback by Traditional Owners. It is based on building understanding, co-designing, partnering, and transparently sharing information.\n\n## Memorandum of understanding with Yindjibarndi Energy Corporation\n\nWe are exploring new economic models to increase First Nations participation in our business. In October 2023, we announced a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Yindjibarndi Energy Corporation to explore opportunities to collaborate on renewable energy projects on Yindjibarndi Country in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Together, we will consider a range of opportunities, including wind and solar power and battery energy storage systems.\n\n## Nammuldi cultural heritage incident\n\nIn August 2023, as part of our cultural heritage monitoring and management processes, we identified the fall of a Pilbara scrub tree and a one cubic metre rock from the overhang of a rock shelter in an area adjacent to the Nammuldi mine site. As soon as we identified this, we paused nearby blasting work occurring 150 metres away, and notified the Traditional Owners of the land, the Muntulgura Guruma People. We have apologised to the Muntulgura Guruma People, who we deeply respect, and are continuing to work closely with them. We've completed a detailed review to understand what happened and how we can improve.\n\nWe are working through the outcomes of the review with the Muntulgura Guruma People. We will continue to listen, learn and improve our ways of working.\n\n## Working with Indigenous communities in Canada\n\nHealthy community relationships are essential to our operations and future growth. We have 12 active long-term impact benefits/ participation agreements with Indigenous communities in Canada, supported by proactive site-based and regional engagements.\n\n## Naskapi Nation and Iron Ore Company of Canada agreement\n\nIn February 2023, the Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach and Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) signed an agreement to establish a mutually beneficial relationship based on dialogue, collaboration and trust. This socio-economic agreement aims to create opportunities for greater participation by Naskapi People in IOC's activities through training and development, employment, collaboration on environmental projects, and procurement. It will also protect and encourage the practice of traditional activities and provide long-term financial benefits to the Naskapi Nation.\n\n## Cheslatta Carrier Nation visit Australia\n\nWe are increasing engagement, participation and encouraging learning. In 2023, the Cheslatta Carrier Nation from British Columbia attended the World Mining Congress in Brisbane, and visited our Weipa operations in Queensland where they met with Traditional Owners.\n\n## Governance and process\n\nDuring 2023, we continued to implement our Communities and Social Performance Standard , and revise systems and processes to help us meet external expectations and deliver better social and human rights outcomes. We have strengthened our social risk framework, and our teams' understanding of social and human rights risks.\n\n## Australian Advisory Group\n\nWe established the Australian Advisory Group (AAG) in 2022 to provide independent expert advice to our executives on matters impacting our operations in Australia, with a priority focus on First Nations issues and opportunities. The group met four times in 2023, including site visits to Weipa and the Pilbara. An independent review of the AAG was finalised in October to ensure the AAG continues to operate in a way that adds genuine value to our business.",

        "page_content": "## The Oxford Leading Sustainable Corporations Programme\n\nA recommendation from the Juukan Gorge Board review in 2020 was to strengthen our leaders' understanding of current and emerging environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues to better preserve cultural heritage. In 2022, we partnered with Sa\u00efd Business School, University of Oxford to pilot their Leading Sustainable Corporations Programme. In 2023, 116 leaders completed the 12-week course. Learning outcomes and feedback were overwhelmingly positive, igniting new discussions about sustainability that will support our decarbonisation objectives, mutually beneficial sustainability outcomes for communities and the long-term success of the business. It will be offered again in 2024.\n\n## Independent Cultural Heritage Management Audit\n\nIn March 2023, we published an independent report (produced by ERM, a global sustainability consultancy) on a global audit of our cultural heritage management performance.\n\nThe audit was completed throughout 2021 and 2022 across 20 assets in Australia and 17 assets in other countries where we operate, including Canada, South Africa, US and Mongolia. The audit identified areas where we are achieving leading cultural heritage practices but also areas where we need to improve our performance. Based on the report recommendations, we are developing a consolidated action plan and a cultural heritage maturity model to monitor progress across the business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nsee the results from the Independent Cultural Heritage Management Audit at riotinto/culturalheritage.\n\n## Leadership and inclusion\n\nWe are fast-tracking Indigenous Australians into professional and leadership roles to ensure we have a stronger representation of diverse voices at our decision-making tables in Australia. In 2023, we revised our target to have 100 Indigenous leaders by 2025. Having true diversity of perspectives, and an Indigenous lens on decision making, will guide our company moving forward.\n\nCreating an environment that is safe for Indigenous employees is a priority. Our cultural safety initiative 'Care for Mob' will be delivered against a national framework in partnership with the Everyday Respect taskforce to ensure all employees feel safe, supported and respected.\n\nIn 2023, we launched the Elevating Voices Network in Australia. The Network is led by a small group of Indigenous and nonIndigenous employee volunteers who come together to activate events, activities and conversations. By encouraging connections, building cultural intelligence, and fostering a more culturally safe company, the Elevating Voices Network aims to create stronger links for collaboration, celebrate representation of our Indigenous workforce, enhance current and future initiatives and complement meaningful workplace opportunities through engagement.\n\nWe have also continued our Cultural Connection program to ensure leaders can navigate and understand Indigenous culture and build strong trusted relationships with the Indigenous community and Indigenous employees in Australia. In 2023, we introduced this program to our Communities and External Affairs team in Mongolia, to uplift their cultural knowledge in preparation for a cross cultural visit between the Nyangumarta Traditional Owner group in Australia, and Mongolian herders and employees in Mongolia.\n\n## Indigenous participation\n\nIn 2023 we re-established the Aboriginal Training and Liaison (ATAL) program through a co-design process with the Traditional Owner groups we work with in the Pilbara. This work-ready program is focused on empowering participants to develop skills for ongoing employment in different jobs and industries across the Pilbara.\n\n## Indigenous partnerships\n\nOne of our priorities is partnering with local and national Indigenous organisations to provide support in key areas such as economic development, community empowerment, preserving traditional knowledge and practices and promoting sustainable development and social inclusion.\n\nIn November 2023, we announced a five-year partnership with First Nations Media Australia (FNMA) to help them digitise and preserve at-risk media (audio and video tapes) from the 1970s to 1990s. The FNMA Archiving Project will support First Nations media organisations and other Central Australianbased Aboriginal media organisations.\n\nThe partnership sits within our Living Languages Living Cultures program, which has been designed to promote the recognition, preservation, and revitalisation of Australian Indigenous languages and cultures for the benefit of Australian Indigenous communities.\n\n## Supporting Indigenous businesses\n\nWe support local businesses, employ local people and buy local products, especially from Indigenous, small and regional businesses. In 2023, we spent more than A$725 million with Indigenous businesses across Australia - an increase of 28% on the year before.\n\nWe are also increasing our spend with local and Indigenous businesses in Canada and the US. In 2023, we spent $190 million with Indigenous suppliers in North America. We do not always get it right, but when our local suppliers have concerns, we listen and learn. In February 2023, at our Rincon lithium project in Argentina, some members of local Indigenous suppliers blocked a road to the site due to concerns about the procurement process. We met with the communities, listened to the issues and made changes to facilitate their ability to access contracts.\n\n## Truth and reconciliation\n\nIn 2023, we supported the referendum for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice in the Australian Constitution and provided a corporate donation to the 'Yes' campaign.\n\nThe 'No' outcome does not change our support for constitutional recognition for Indigenous Australians. As one of the largest employers of Indigenous Australians and a company that operates on the lands of Indigenous Peoples, we have long supported constitutional recognition for Indigenous Australians.\n\nIn Canada, we continue to create learning opportunities for our people to raise awareness about the history, culture and rights of Indigenous Peoples. In 2023, we introduced a new online training on awareness of Indigenous culture and issues, across all our Canadian sites. We held a series of educational events to celebrate National Indigenous History Month, and to commemorate Truth and Reconciliation Day.",

        "page_content": "## Health, safety and wellbeing\n\nCaring for one another is one of our values it is part of who we are and the way we work, every shift, every day. Nothing is more important than the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees, contractors and communities.\n\n## 2023 progress\n\nAlthough there were no fatalities on our managed sites in 2023, in January 2024, tragically four team members from our Diavik mine in Canada lost their lives when a charter flight crashed on its way to the mine.\n\nIn 2023, we also continued to see fatalities more broadly across our industry, including six at our non-managed operations. We firmly believe all fatalities are preventable. Our focus remains on identifying, managing and, where possible, eliminating risks to ensure everyone, including partners and colleagues at our non-managed operations, goes home safely every day.\n\nIn 2023, we encountered three permanent damage injuries; two significant hand injuries at Diavik and Guinea respectively, and another at Kennecott Integrated Skarns Project, where one of our colleagues sustained a leg injury requiring amputation.\n\nWe also experienced three significant process safety events in 2023; two at SorelTracy in Quebec, and one at Kennecott in Utah. We are continuing to find better ways to safely run our operations and prevent these incidents from occurring. One example is our newly developed process safety improvement plan that aims to continually improve the maturity of our management system and culture. These will continue to be implemented globally through until 2025.\n\nOur all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) was 0.37 in 2023, an improvement from 2022 (2022: 0.40). We continue to see a disparity in safety performance for employees compared to contractors, so our focus remains on improving contractor safety by further integrating contractors into our safety culture.\n\nAcross our operations, we continue to see serious incidents where people are exposed to potentially fatal events. The main safety risks relate to falling objects, falling from heights and vehicle-related incidents. These risk areas account for 58% of the total potentially fatal incidents and remain at the forefront of our safety maturity efforts.\n\n## Critical risk management\n\nCritical risk management (CRM) remains our primary fatality elimination tool, helping to ensure critical controls are in place and working where there is a fatal risk. In 2023, we initiated a project to help our teams reconnect with why we have CRM, and to enhance the quality of verifications which check that the right critical controls are in place for each task. In 2024, we will leverage the data we collect to identify trends, which will help us proactively intervene before incidents occur.\n\n## Vehicles and driving\n\nIn 2023, we introduced a program to help our teams learn critical lessons related to vehicles and driving, including potential gaps in vehicles and driving critical controls, and developing effective strategies to address these.\n\nWe also focused on deepening our understanding of mass transport risks, facilitating self-assessments at our sites to identify compliance with our Group procedure. We will undertake a similar exercise to better understand our aviationrelated risk profile in 2024.\n\n## Safety maturity model\n\nWe acknowledge the importance of leadership and strong processes in driving a sustained improvement to our safety performance and safety culture. This is evident in the implementation of our safety maturity model (SMM). Introduced in 2019, the SMM is our blueprint for safety, integrating best practices in leadership, engagement, learning, risk management and work planning, as well as operational ownership of health and environmental risks. In 2023, we continued to work closely with our assets to evaluate and evolve their safety maturity, and foster both physical and psychological safety. Through this work, we have refined our assessor training program, placing a higher emphasis on elements such as mindsets, behaviours and felt experiences towards our safety maturity efforts. This supports our belief that all employees and contractors should feel empowered to work safely, speak up and make decisions that prioritise their wellbeing. While we acknowledge cultural transformation is a long-term journey, we draw encouragement from the outcomes of the SMM assessments conducted in 2023. These have significantly deepened our understanding of the safety culture at each site and support actionable insights which will guide us towards creating an even safer work environment.\n\n## Demonstrating leadership of maritime safety and crew welfare\n\nAs the first initiative of its kind for the dry bulk industry, we launched the Designated Owners and Operators Program. It provides us and our shipping value chain partners, including shipowners and operators, a structured platform to work together on improving maritime safety and crew welfare standards. Although we have not had any fatalities across our owned vessels since the formation of Rio Tinto Marine in 1989, over the past four years, seven seafarers have tragically lost their lives on chartered vessels. As part of the program, our partners commit to improving everyday practices to prevent fatalities and injuries, and improve crew welfare. So far we have onboarded 16 owners/operators, representing around 36% of our shipped volumes.\n\n## Mental health and wellbeing\n\nMental health is a core part of our safety culture. We have a responsibility to support the wellbeing of our people, beyond the traditional areas of health and safety, and we are committed to creating a work environment that is free from psychological harm.\n\nOur employees' mental health can be impacted by psychosocial hazards at work, so we continue to strengthen our psychosocial risk management. To support an environment where everyone feels safe, respected and included, we are progressing all 26 recommendations from the Everyday Respect Report . This focuses on training leaders in building psychological safety and becoming upstanders, rectifying any unsafe facilities and building plans to make our facilities more inclusive, and providing a more peoplecentric response to support those impacted by harmful behaviours and disrespect. In 2023, 83.5% of our employees completed the 'Building Everyday Respect' employee learning module, a critical step towards changing our culture, building trust and supporting the psychological safety of our colleagues.\n\nTo better support people impacted by bullying, harassment, sexual harm, racism and discrimination, we introduced Care Hub in late 2023. Care Hub facilitates access to a range of wellbeing pathways and informal non-investigative resolution options to help people navigate routes for healing, recovery, support and resolution, as is aligned to the recommendations from the Everyday Respect Report . For more information about Care Hub, see page 77.\n\nIn 2023, we continued our work to help leaders recognise psychosocial hazards; assess the risks; and implement, evaluate and monitor effective controls, just as for any other health or safety risk. The practices support ISO 45003 and the World Health Organisation's mental health report. We also continued embedding our mental health framework to raise awareness of mental wellbeing, reduce stigma and increase the capacity of our leaders to recognise and support individuals experiencing mental ill-health.\n\nAligned with our commitment to provide our employees the tools and skills they need to support their mental health, we continue to provide and promote the employee assistance program (EAP), our mental health toolkit and our global Peer Support Program, which includes more than 1,600 peer supporters globally. We also support our people through our domestic violence support programs, which cover 100% of employees. Importantly, we continued to support global mental health campaigns such as R U OK? Day and World Mental Health Day. In October 2023, we held our mental health week to support mental wellbeing and encourage our people to look out for one another. We ran a program of activities that included a comprehensive communications toolkit, packed with vital information and resources for holistic wellbeing. Our people, from graduates to the Executive Committee, shared powerful stories and commitments to mental health in a series of impactful videos.",

        "page_content": "We also hosted a number of engaging regional calls addressing related wellbeing topics which have contributed to shaping a culture that prioritises mental wellbeing and breaking down stigmas.\n\nIn 2023, we challenged ourselves on the role we can play in preventing suicide. This work involved understanding how we can work together as a business, improve identification of those individuals who may be at risk, and support our people and families impacted by deaths from suicide.\n\nWe continue to be an active member of the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) Psychosocial Risk Management Working Group, chaired by MCA and industry partners, to improve the understanding and management of psychosocial risk within our industry.\n\n## Occupational health\n\nIn 2023, we recorded a higher number of new occupational health illnesses compared to the previous year, with 98 (2022: 70), in line with our increased focus on medical assessments. These assessments are a key requirement in ensuring and maintaining our employees' fitness for work, addressing legislative requirements and managing risk profiles. We continue to standardise and simplify these assessments to help improve our health performance.\n\nWe also ran two workshops for our global health and hygiene practitioners to share learnings, best practice and recent technology developments in the Southern and Northern hemisphere. We completed occupational and industrial hygiene monitoring at all of our operational and\n\nmanaged assets. This included analysis of noise, airborne particulates, gas and other contaminants that can lead to adverse health effects for our employees and contractors. This helped us to better understand our exposure profile and prioritise actions to put effective controls in place.\n\nIn 2023, we commenced a project to improve clarity and accessibility of data collected through annual surveys. This project will continue in 2024 and beyond, allowing better internal reporting of health and industrial hygiene risks at a Group level, and individually for each product group. Health monitoring remains a pivotal focus, involving the redesign of fit-for-purpose medical assessments.\n\nThe data collected over 2023 allowed for semi-quantitative assessments of risk and identified areas where we can implement or enhance control measures. Each product group worked on identifying projects within their assets which, with the support of the Health Area of Expertise, will be designed, developed and implemented to reduce exposures for our employees and contractors. We will continue to track exposure reduction projects across product groups in 2024.\n\nRecognising the need to improve the transparency and detail of our health data, we performed a Group internal audit in 2022. We are continuing to implement the audit recommendations by working to improve the reporting of our data. These recommendations include reviewing gaps in guidance, updating our existing guidance to address these gaps, re-training our\n\nhealth practitioners and improving the available consolidated reports to enable further insights.\n\nWe also made improvements to our annual corporate reporting activity to ensure data collected and reported is relevant to both internal and external stakeholders.\n\nThis transparently shares our health, safety, environment, security and communities performance over a longer period of time, and builds our environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials.\n\n## Health, safety, environment and security transformation\n\nThe health, safety, environment and security (HSES) transformation program has simplified the way we work and provided access to trusted and timely data, ultimately making our business safer. Following three successful pilots in Enablon TM in 2022 - a new digital tool helping us to integrate HSES data and processes into a single platform global deployment of the core Enablon TM modules started in 2023. Today, more than 70% of the business is using Enablon TM , and the final wave of deployment will be completed in early 2024.\n\nWe also deployed 11 Enablon TM environment modules across all Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean sites in Quebec, Canada in 2023.\n\nWork continues to expand the capabilities of Enablon TM to support processes such as management of change, in-field safety tools and chemical management, which will drive simplification and standardisation across the Group.\n\n## Safety and health performance\n\n|                                                                    |     2023 | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Fatalities at managed operations                                   |     0    | 0      | 0      | 0      | 0      |\n| All-injury frequency rate (per 200,000 hours worked)               |     0.37 | 0.40   | 0.40   | 0.37   | 0.42   |\n| Number of lost-time injuries                                       |   236    | 225    | 216    | 187    | 227    |\n| Lost-time injury frequency rate (per 200,000 hours worked)         |     0.23 | 0.25   | 0.25   | 0.22   | 0.27   |\n| Safety maturity model score 1                                      |     5.2  | 4.7    | 5.7    | 5.4    | 4.5    |\n| Rate of new cases of occupational illness (per 10,000 employees) 2 |    19.2  | 15.1   | 15.2   | 16.8   | 20.7   |\n| Number of employees 3                                              | 57000    | 54,000 | 49,000 | 47,500 | 46,000 |\n| Fines and prosecutions - safety ($'000) 4                          |   330    | 339.0  | 646.2  | 25.4   | 40.7   |\n| Fines and prosecutions - health ($'000) 5                          |     0.9  | 0.0    | 5.0    | 0.0    | 1.4    |\n\n## Contributing causes for newly reported illness cases (employees)\n\n|                            |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Noise induced hearing loss |     28 |     20 |     16 |     23 |     34 |\n| Musculoskeletal disorders  |     46 |     32 |     32 |     29 |     29 |\n| Mental stress              |      4 |      5 |      1 |      2 |      2 |\n| Others                     |     20 |     13 |     15 |     14 |     16 |\n\nNote: There can be one or more illness reported for each employee/contractor.",

Of particular note was the positive progress we are making on key indicators aligned with everyday respect: authenticity (75), belonging (71), inclusion (69) and speaking up (74). We have more to do and will continue to focus on accountability and increasing collaboration inside and outside of our business.\n\n## Supporting an inclusive culture\n\nIn 2023, we continued our work to support an inclusive culture by implementing the recommendations outlined in the Everyday Respect Report . Our focus has been on:\n\n- - promoting respect\n- - investing in leadership development\n- - creating an inclusive workplace\n- - increasing support for our people\n- - ensuring equality through pay equity.\n\nIn 2024, we will conduct an independent Everyday Respect progress review. We look forward to reporting on the results and our progress.\n\n## Promoting respect\n\nThe physical and psychological health and safety of our workforce is a priority. In 2023, 83.5% of our employees completed a learning module on building psychological safety and becoming an upstander.\n\nWe have also introduced the concept of 'Purple Banners' across the business. Through these updates, we share case studies of recent instances of harmful behaviours and disrespect that has happened in the business. This encourages deeper discussions about conduct among our teams and helps increase transparency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our work to support employees' psychological health and safety see the health, safety and wellbeing section on pages 71-72.\n\n## Investing in leadership development\n\nIn 2023, we held two leadership conferences to bring our senior leaders together to reflect on our past, make further progress against our strategy and look at ways we can shape the future of our business for the next 150 years. The keynotes, leader presentations and discussions with community groups were underpinned by our values.\n\nWe also continue to offer the Voyager leadership program to all senior leaders to help them lead authentically with care, courage and curiosity. This is an immersive leadership experience that accelerates personal growth and deepens selfunderstanding. This program has now been completed by 72% of our senior leaders. In 2023, we continued to support and develop our leaders through the Leading Sustainable Corporations Programme in partnership with Oxford University and focusing on developing leaders as coaches.\n\nIn 2023, we have spent time developing, testing and launching new leadership programs that will help our leaders create a safe environment, empower their teams and perform together.\n\nWe are also committed to increasing cultural knowledge, advancing Indigenous leadership in our workforce and creating an environment where everyone feels safe and respected. In Australia, our Indigenous leadership program continues to fast-track Indigenous Australians into professional and leadership roles, helping us to ensure that we have a stronger representation of diverse voices across our business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout how we are increasing Indigenous leadership in our business see the CSP commitments section on page 69.\n\n## Creating an inclusive workplace\n\nThe representation of women across all levels in our business continues to be an important focus. In 2023, we saw an increase from 22.9% to 24.3% and further increases across all levels of the organisation, with senior leaders increasing from 28.3% to 30.1%, and operations and general support increasing from 16.2% to 17.7%.\n\nImplementing the Everyday Respect Report recommendations remains our priority and we are confident that this will improve both the attraction and retention of women and other diverse groups to our business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout the Everyday Respect initiative see riotinto.com/everydayrespect.\n\nWe continued to evolve our award-winning graduate program in 2023 and recruited our biggest cohort yet with 298 graduate roles. Of these, 51.7% in new graduate roles were women and 37.6% were from communities where we are building new businesses. In Australia, 10.6% of the graduate intake (down from 15% in 2022) and 13.8% of our vacation student program (up from 2.2% in 2022) were Indigenous.\n\nIn December 2023, we formalised our ambitions to increase representation of ethnic minorities setting a global target of 18% ethnic minority representation within our senior leadership population (Executive Committee direct reports) by the end of 2027.\n\nCollecting and monitoring ethnicity data is challenging in a global context. We have more work to do in 2024 to ensure that we have an accurate understanding of both our baseline and progress against this target. We will report on the progress and the key programs and activities we put in place to increase representation, to ensure our organisation is welcoming and built to support all of our people.\n\nThroughout 2023, we have also made it a priority to address safety and hygiene risks in our facilities with improvements to security, lighting and access to well-maintained restrooms and change rooms. We are performing audits and making rectifications across all major sites and offices. We are committed to investing to ensure that our facilities are safe and meet the needs of our diverse workforce. To provide a safe and constructive way for employees and contractors to raise concerns and give feedback, we have created new village councils across managed villages and camps. We now have over 20 village councils across our camps, and these principles are also being adopted in some of our office locations.\n\nWe have also established a global network of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to help us find better ways to elevate diverse voices. These employee-led groups, each with an Executive Committee member as a sponsor, bring people with a shared identity together with their allies to offer a diverse lens to business challenges and projects and offer participants career development opportunities. We have three ERGs which are LGBTQ+, neurodiversity and gender equality. We plan to broaden our scope and launch additional ERGs in 2024.\n\n## 55,000\u00b9 people\n\nmake up our workforce of employees and contractors, an increase of 5.8% since 2022 (52,000).\n\n## 9,166 new hires\n\njoined the business in 2023, of which 2,718 were contractors becoming permanent employees. (2022: 11,062 new hires of which 4,317 were contractors).\n\n## 24.3% women\n\nin our workforce, an increase of 1.4% since 2022 (22.9%). Workforce breakdown: 13,396 women; 41,660 men; 8 undeclared gender.\n\n## 62% employees\n\nparticipated in myShare 2 , an increase of 3% (2022: 59%).\n\n- 1.

Care Hub currently supports matters reported through myVoice, including matters where reporters are referred to myVoice by Human Resources, our Health, Safety, Environment and Security function, leaders, our Peer Support Network, and has supported over 276 people since launching.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout the BCO, myVoice and Care Hub see page 77.\n\n## Ensuring equality through pay equity\n\nEnsuring that employees with similar skills, knowledge, qualifications, experience and performance are paid equally for the same or comparable work is intrinsically linked to our commitment to inclusion and diversity. We remain committed to eliminating any residual pay inequities based on gender or other non-legitimate dimensions of difference.\n\nOur equal pay gap, the primary lens we use when assessing gender pay, measures the extent to which women and men employed by our company in the same location and performing work of equal value receive the same pay. Our 2023 equal pay gap is less than 1% in favour of men.\n\n## Workforce data by region (1)(2)\n\n| Region                | Average  employee  headcount (3)   | Headcount  distribution %   | Absenteeism (4)   | Average  contractor  headcount (5)   | Headcount  distribution %   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Africa                | 3,058                              | 6.0%                        | 3.1%              | 134                                  | 2.8%                        |\n| Americas              | 16,174                             | 31.9%                       | 0.6%              | 845                                  | 17.7%                       |\n| Asia                  | 5,834                              | 11.5%                       | 1.2%              | 137                                  | 2.9%                        |\n| Australia/New Zealand | 24,535                             | 48.3%                       | 4.7%              | 3,594                                | 75.3%                       |\n| Europe                | 1,168                              | 2.3%                        | 0.7%              | 64                                   | 1.3%                        |\n| Total\u2076                | 50,768                             | 100.0%                      | 2.9%              | 4,773                                | 100.0%                      |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## Human rights\n\nOur human rights program is core to delivering on our business strategy and achieving impeccable environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials.\n\n## Commitment\n\nWe commit to respecting and supporting the dignity, wellbeing and human rights of everyone we interact with. Living up to that commitment relies on embedding rightsrespecting and ethical behaviour throughout our business, from how we work with local communities to how we choose our suppliers and engage with others in the workplace. We know that our activities, and those of our partners, can have both a positive and a negative impact on human rights. Successfully embedding Group-wide respect for human rights relies on our:\n\n- - business culture (to establish supportive mindsets and behaviours aligned with our values)\n- - processes and systems (to integrate and operationalise human rights due diligence into management systems)\n- - engagement with broader society (to help address root causes of human rights harm).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our human rights commitments see our Human Rights Policy.\n\n## Progress in 2023\n\n## Governance\n\nWe continue to evolve our human rights performance to help prevent our involvement in adverse human rights impacts. We regularly review and update internal standards, systems and processes to integrate human rights due diligence and promote more responsible and ethical ways of working.\n\nAs part of ongoing assurance of our human rights program, the Group Internal Audit team completed its review of risk assessment and evaluation processes across the Group's identified salient issues. The review found that while risks impacting human rights are being identified and captured in risk management systems, broader Group-wide understanding of risks and human rights consequences is needed. To help with this, we continue to develop our Group-wide human rights controls, with a focus on modern slavery risk control management.\n\n## Salient human rights issues\n\nAligned with the United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGPs) on Business and Human Rights, we identify the priority human rights issues that could severely impact people through our activities or business relationships. These issues consider our operational footprint, value chain and external contexts and include:\n\n- - land access and use\n- - Indigenous Peoples' rights\n- - security\n- - inclusion and diversity\n- - community health, safety and wellbeing\n- - workplace health and safety\n- - labour rights (including modern slavery)\n- - climate change and just transition.\n\nAssets conduct a range of assessments to enable a more complete understanding of their risk context so they can prevent and mitigate human rights risks. In 2023, Richards Bay Minerals, ISAL, Kennecott, Rincon, Iron\n\nOre Company of Canada and all Pacific region operations undertook risk assessments to review their salient human rights issues. In addition, 13 assets completed human rights and tailings assessments as part of the Global Standard on Tailings Management review. Our human rights team supported higher risk assets as they worked towards conducting human rights impact assessments, with a focus on QIT Madagascar Minerals, Simandou, Rincon and Oyu Tolgoi. For assets in more complex security contexts that involve private and public security forces, we continued to undertake security and human rights assessments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our security and human rights program see our annual VPSHR statement.\n\n## Our business relationships\n\nWe partner with communities, business partners and other stakeholders to advance respect for human rights in line with international standards and our values.\n\n## Our joint venture partners\n\nIn 2023, we worked with joint venture partners to provide human rights technical support and monitored human rights performance, through Board and Committee roles for non-managed operations. Human rights risk assessments were completed at La Compagnie des Bauxites de Guin\u00e9e (CBG) and Sohar Aluminium, as part of a broader human rights due diligence program and Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) certification. CBG received its provisional ASI certification in December 2023.\n\n## Suppliers\n\nUsing a risk-based approach through our third party due diligence process, we prescreen our potential business partners and complete desktop human rights reviews. More than 10,000 business partners completed baseline screening in 2023, and 177 were escalated for human rights review. We undertook human rights knowledge shares with 18 strategic suppliers.\n\nWe expect our suppliers (including subcontractors) to adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct , which includes respecting human rights. In 2023, we reviewed this code to further clarify our expectations and align with best practice, and plan to launch the updated code in 2024.\n\nIn 2023, we focused due diligence efforts on higher risk supplier categories, including logistics and renewables due to operating contexts and potentially higher risk workforces. We started a project to review non-financial, sustainability and human rights risks in core procurement categories to\n\nfurther promote transparency and effective risk management. We expect this work to be completed in 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our human rights and modern slavery approach see our annual Modern Slavery Statement.\n\n## Grievance and remedy\n\nEffective grievance management can enable more trusted relationships. Every asset is required to have a grievance mechanism. In 2023, we updated guidance and provided training to help teams better align practice with the UNGPs effectiveness criteria.\n\nWe are committed to providing for, or cooperating in, remediation when we identify we have caused or contributed to, human rights harm. We may also play a role in remediation where we are directly linked to harm through our products, services or operations. Receiving feedback, complaints or grievances from stakeholders is an important part of our ongoing human rights due diligence approach. In 2023 the human rights team provided counsel and support on a range of internal investigations.\n\n## Capacity building on human rights\n\nEveryone has a role in respecting human rights; our people are our first line of defence. Our strategy focuses on demystifying, integrating, operationalising and personalising respect for human rights.\n\nIn 2023, our human rights team delivered 35 tailored training sessions targeting 11 assets and 12 functional teams globally. We recorded 2,441 completions of our modern slavery online learning module. We will launch further learning initiatives to support our target to train 100% of high-risk human rights roles by the end of 2024. Our human rights training records are available in the 2023 Sustainability Fact Book .\n\n## Collaboration\n\nIt is crucial that we collaborate with peers, civil society organisations and others given the systemic nature of human rights issues. to mitigate the root causes of human rights harm.

It is designed to help all employees and contractors live our values of care, courage and curiosity, and is a a central tool in reshaping our culture. The values, commitments and behaviours set out in our Code of Conduct provide clarity which allows us to deliver responsibly. It is broader in scope than the previous version, reflecting changes in societal expectations. It also includes our newly developed ethical decision-making model to help our people reflect on the potential impacts decisions may have on the business and others. An interactive, online version of the Code of Conduct is also available, including additional related content, real life examples and associated training.\n\n## Compliance program developments\n\nBusiness integrity is core to how we build trust with our stakeholders and the foundation of our ability to run our operations. Our Business Integrity Compliance Program (BICP) is continuously evolving to align with leading industry practice, the regulatory landscape and specific business integrity risks we face across the countries where we operate.\n\nWe expect our people and partners to uphold the highest standard of integrity, act ethically and do the right thing. The way we treat our people, our partners, the environment, the communities where we work, and how we conduct business is what makes us a responsible partner of choice.\n\nDuring 2023, we delivered several BICP improvements:\n\n- - We set up a new online disclosures system for gifts and entertainment from and to third parties, conflicts of interest and sponsorship and donations. This increases transparency and allows us to automate approvals and workflow.\n- - We are exposed to reputational, financial and non-financial risk through our third parties' actions. We continued to enhance our Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) framework and hired relevant subject matter experts in areas such as sanctions and renewables. Our TPRM Committee meets regularly to set policy and risk appetite associated with categories of third-party risk. We have also started to implement a new TPRM system to increase automation and improve risk management by integrating it with other associated business processes.\n- - We completed a fraud risk assessment across the organisation and reviewed our controls to prevent and detect fraud risk. This helps us better understand the root causes of fraud and improve our response.\n- - We hired more people in country to support developing businesses in high-risk jurisdictions, such as Guinea and Argentina.\n\n## 25,187 employees\n\nundertook compliance training in 2023\n\n## Annual training\n\nOur reputation as a business that operates with high levels of integrity is dependent on the actions and decisions we make each day. We empower our people to seek guidance when faced with ethical or business dilemmas - both to prevent incidents from occurring, and to protect them and others from harm. To help equip our workforce to navigate uncertain areas and spot ethical and compliance-related risks, we implemented a new online training course focused on ethical decision making through several interactive, real-life scenarios. 25,187 employees completing online compliance training in 2023.\n\nIn addition to online training, the Ethics and Compliance team delivers tailored risk-based face-to-face training on anti-bribery and corruption, data privacy, anti-trust and trade sanctions. A total of 6,359 employees received face-to-face training in 2023. We also provide business integrity training to our third parties on a risk basis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## myVoice, our confidential reporting program\n\nWe want to create a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace, with a strong ethical culture, that reflects our values, and we encourage and support our people to speak up if they have concerns about potential misconduct or harmful behaviour. A strong culture of speaking up, with protections against reprisal, enables us to identify and address potential issues early, respond appropriately, minimise risk and care for our people and the communities in which we operate.\n\nThe myVoice program enables confidential and anonymous reporting, including protected whistleblower disclosures. myVoice is operated by the Business Conduct Office (BCO), which reports to our Chief Legal, Governance and Corporate Affairs Officer, and provides regular program insights to the Board and the Group Ethics and Compliance Committee.\n\nIn 2023, the BCO continued to enhance the myVoice program by refining our triage and investigation processes, including a peoplecentric, trauma-informed approach.\n\n## Care Hub\n\nIn 2023, the BCO launched Care Hub, which provides additional and more accessible channels to raise concerns, access wellbeing support and explore resolution options. Care Hub provides options to resolve reports of harmful and disrespectful behaviour via alternative resolution and early intervention where appropriate rather than investigation. Our support partners facilitate specialised care, guidance and resolution options for our people for matters involving racism, sexual harassment and assault, bullying and harassment or discrimination. They also support leaders, Human Resources, respondents and witnesses to those behaviours. Care Hub is underpinned by regionally appropriate support services and resolution options informed by diverse voices throughout the organisation.\n\nSince launching, Care Hub has supported over 276 people, and feedback has been positive; people feel safe and supported.\n\nWe established a BCO reporting and governance function to help us capture and communicate early insights. In 2023, we saw an increase in the number of concerns raised through myVoice to 1,613 (2022: 1,459).\n\nThe rate of reporting per 1,000 employees was 29.1 in 2023 (2022: 28.1). Anonymous reporting in 2023 (40%) remained consistent with trends in previous year (2022: 38%).\n\nOf the cases investigated by the BCO, 61% were substantiated in 2023 (2022: 65%). Of the cases closed in 2023 (for both matters reported into myVoice in 2023 and prior periods), the average days to close a case reduced to 38 days from 52 days in 2022.\n\n## Upcoming areas of focus:\n\n- - Refine and update the myVoice Procedure to reflect enhancements to our framework and processes.\n- - Continue to expand our data analytics capability and provide the business with insights that enable our people to strengthen processes and culture, locally and globally.\n- - Expand the channels of reporting to services and support available through Care Hub.\n- - Continue to identify possible barriers preventing individuals from speaking up.\n- - Track the increased awareness and impact of the BCO's interventions in more depth through data analytics.\n\nWe know there is more work to do to improve our organisational culture. Each person's experience of misconduct is unique. We are committed to holding ourselves accountable and having controls in place to identify where our business processes may have created an opportunity for misconduct to arise. This is critical to ensuring our people feel safe and respected in the workplace.\n\n## Transparency\n\nTransparency encourages accountability - ours as well as others'. Being open and transparent about our tax payments, mineral development contracts, beneficial ownership and our stance on a range of other sustainability issues, such as climate change, allows us to enter into open, fact-based conversations with our stakeholders. This provides a better understanding of everyone's roles and responsibilities.\n\nWe are recognised as a leader in transparent tax reporting. We are a founding member of the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) and have actively supported EITI's principles and global transparency and accountability standards since 2003. We are also a signatory to the B Team Responsible Tax Principles.\n\n## myVoice cases reported by category (% of cases reported)\n\n|                              | 2023              | 2023                    | 2022              | 2022                   | 2021              | 2021                   | 2020              | 2020                   | 2019              | 2019                   |\n|------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| Case rate                    | 29.1              |                         | 28.1              |                        | 25.7              |                        | 14.5              |                        | 15.9              |                        |\n| Reports received\u00b9            | 1,613             | 1,613                   | 1,459             | 1,459                  | 1,246             | 1,246                  | 748               | 748                    | 804               | 804                    |\n|                              | Reports  received | Reports  substantiated\u00b2 | Reports  received | Reports  substantiated | Reports  received | Reports  substantiated | Reports  received | Reports  substantiated | Reports  received | Reports  substantiated |\n| Business integrity           | 254               | 48 %                    | 211               | 52 %                   | 154               | 36 %                   | 102               | 51 %                   | 134               | 36 %                   |\n| Personnel                    | 1,196             | 55 %                    | 1,034             | 65 %                   | 819               | 57 %                   | 421               | 38 %                   | 454               | 31 %                   |\n| Health, safety, environment\u00b3 | 109               | 61 %                    | 120               | 47 %                   | 186               | 22 %                   | 68                | 35 %                   | 52                | 46 %                   |\n| Communities                  | 4                 | 0 %                     | 10                | 0 %                    | 6                 | 0 %                    | 25                | 0 %                    | 3                 | 0 %                    |\n| Information security         | 22                | 0 %                     | 16                | 67 %                   | 18                | 36 %                   | 99                | 47 %                   | 111               | 81 %                   |\n| Finance                      | 2                 | 50 %                    | 1                 | 0 %                    | 0                 | 0 %                    | 2                 | 68 %                   | 5                 | 33 %                   |\n| Other                        | 26                | 0 %                     | 67                | 33 %                   | 63                | 14 %                   | 31                | 50 %                   | 45                | 0 %                    |\n\n- 1.

We prohibit the use of funds to support political candidates or parties. Our business integrity procedure includes strict guidelines for dealing with current and former government officials and politicians. They cannot be appointed to senior employee positions or engaged as consultants, in certain circumstances, without the approval of executive management and our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer. We regularly engage with governments and share information and our experiences on issues that affect our operations and our industry.\n\nWe join industry associations where membership provides value to our business, investors and other stakeholders. We outline the principles that guide our participation and the way we engage, as well as a list of the top five associations by membership fees paid, on our website at riotinto.com/ industryassociations. We also track and disclose how we engage on climate policy issues, disclosing when the policies and advocacy positions adopted by industry associations differ materially from ours. We continue to strengthen our approach and disclosures on industry associations.\n\n## Voluntary commitments, accreditations and memberships\n\nWe take part in a number of global, national and regional organisations and initiatives that inform our sustainability approach and standards, which in turn allows us to better manage our risks. These independent organisations and initiatives assess and recognise our performance, and we participate in industry accreditation programs for some of our products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our voluntary commitments, accreditations and memberships see riotinto.com/sustainabilityapproach.",

Energy transition continues to be core to our strategy to strengthen our resilience and pursue new growth opportunities and partnerships.\n\n## Partnering to advance decarbonisation efforts\n\nOur targets are to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 15% by 2025 and by 50% by 2030 (when compared to 2018 levels), and achieve net zero emissions from our operations by 2050.\n\nWe aim to reduce our Scope 3 emissions from the Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) by 50% by 2035, and increase our marine emissions intensity reduction target to 50% by 2030.\n\nWe expect to invest $5-6 billion in capital to 2030 to deliver our decarbonisation strategy.\n\nOur approach to investment is based on commercial transactions for available technologies and attractive economies; transformational projects that transition our assets for low carbon; and industry breakthroughs in hard-to-abate processing.\n\n## Developing products and technologies to create options for the future\n\nWe partner with customers, competitors, suppliers, technology developers, governments and universities to tackle the energy transition.\n\nWe are committed to support customers with their intent to reduce carbon emissions from existing blast furnaces by 20% to 30% by 2035. We expect to spend around $400 million every year in research and development on the five components of our technology road map to deliver on this: health and safety, lightening our overall environmental footprint, supporting growth, decarbonising our business and our products, and improving productivity.\n\nThe full list of climate targets is published in our Climate Change Repor t.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shaping our portfolio to enable the energy transition\n\nWe focus on excelling in development and being the best operator in commodities essential for the drive to net zero.\n\nWe continue to consider higher-risk jurisdictions and broadening our target commodities.\n\nWe aim to spend up to $3 billion on growth capital every year, while maintaining capital discipline in pursuit of value-accretive opportunities.\n\nOur determination to be the best operator and to achieve impeccable environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials is underpinned by our zero tolerance for noncompliance with our operational procedures, laws and obligations.

Given our diverse portfolio and geographical footprint, we are exposed to many highly uncertain, complex and often interrelated risks. We track leading indicators of emerging risks and their likely impact on our business, markets and host communities. Our analysis is anchored on our global scenarios as outlined in the Strategy section on page 14.\n\nWe have actions in place to minimise the potential impact of heightened geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty that could impact our performance. We have put actions in place to minimise this impact. This is discussed within principal risks 11 and 14 detailed in the following pages.\n\nGovernments have been introducing new policies to support reindustrialisation, accelerate decarbonisation and meet societal expectations. While this could support demand for materials we produce and provide support for both new and existing operations, it could also encourage competition.\n\nThe rapid proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advancing technologies is an emerging area of exposure for the business. We recognise the significant opportunities and threats presented by the use of AI for us and the global economy. Our focus is on further understanding this evolution and ensuring we have strong risk management and governance processes to support its use.\n\nClimate change and the low-carbon transition continue to provide both opportunity and threats for us. We closely monitor and assess the impact of climate change through scenarios; see page 46-47. We address these and our current actions under our principal risks 2, 4 and 8. Please refer to the climate change section on pages 44-58 for further details.\n\n## Longer-term viability statement\n\n## Context\n\nTo deliver our strategy, which is underpinned by our business model, we must meet our four strategic objectives. Our strategy and business model are outlined on pages 8 and 9 respectively.\n\nOur business planning processes include modelling a series of macroeconomic scenarios and using various assumptions that consider internal and external factors. As part of our robust risk management framework, we closely track, monitor and mitigate principal risks to our business plan and model.\n\n## Viability assessment process and key assumptions\n\nThe assumptions underlying our business plan and macroeconomic forecast have the greatest level of certainty for the first three years. Our longer-term viability assessment examines the first five years (2024-28) of the business plan. This allows for a detailed analysis of the potential impacts of risks materialising in the first three years and\n\n1.\n\nenables us to further stress test the business plan for risks materialising towards the end of the time period, although with less certainty. Our Directors are therefore able to assess the Group's capacity to exercise financial levers available in both the three-year and five-year time frames to maintain our viability.\n\nThe principal risks and uncertainties section outlines risks that could materially affect our performance, prospects or reputation. For the viability assessment, we have considered principal risks that could severely impact the Group's liquidity and solvency.\n\n## Assessment of viability\n\nThe principal risks and key assumptions considered in our longer-term viability assessment are as follows:\n\n## Principal Risk A\n\n## Remaining competitive through economic cycles or shocks\n\nScenario assumptions: A global financial crisis takes place in 2024, akin to the one that took place in 2008, albeit not as severe, and extends through to the end of the assessment period. It assumes commodity prices experience large negative pricing shocks in 2024, which is sustained through 2028.\n\n## Principal Risk B\n\n## Group material major hazard or cyber risk\n\nScenario assumptions: A singular catastrophic event occurs, resulting from a major operational failure or cyber security breach, such as a tailings and water storage facility failure, extreme weather event, or underground or geotechnical event. It results in multiple fatalities, cessation of operations and significant financial impacts. We have assumed two such events occur within the assessment period. It relates to principal risks 1 (Preventing fatalities, permanent disablements, and illness) and 12 (Preventing material business disruption and data breaches due to cyber events).\n\n## Principal Risk C\n\n## Delivery of our growth projects\n\nScenario assumptions: A risk impacting our ESG credentials materialises (for example, principal risks 6 (Building trusted relationships with Indigenous Peoples) and 3 (Building trusted relationships with communities), impacting our ability to deliver our growth strategy. We have assumed an impact on our near-term key projects and considered available alternatives. The financial impact assumed here is in addition to any non-financial impact, such as reputational damage.\n\nWe quantify the expected financial impact of each risk based on internal macroeconomic and business analysis, as well as internal and external benchmarking on similar risks. We apply a probabilistic approach to quantify risks and impacts where relevant.\n\nThe first five years of the Group's business plan has been stress tested for each risk to assess the impact on the Group's longerterm viability, including whether additional\n\nfinancing facilities would be required. In addition to liquidity and solvency, the assessment also considered other financial performance metrics as well as dividend payments. These metrics are subject to robust stress tests.\n\nThe most 'severe' scenario, considers the financial impact of all three risks materialising at the start of the assessment period, followed by a second major hazard or cyber event occurring towards the end of the fiveyear time period. Without management action, this scenario would create both an immediate and prolonged severe impact, resulting in the Group's free cash flow performance over the assessment period being an estimated outflow of $6 billion in aggregate.\n\nWe have a suite of management actions available to preserve resilience through the period of assessment, including accessing lines of credit, reducing organic and inorganic growth capital expenditure and raising capital. Our financial flexibility could be limited during the peak of the crisis. The viability of the Group under all the scenarios tested remained sound.\n\nThe resilience of the Group's business model is largely underpinned by four factors:\n\n- - the competitive position and diversification of our commodities portfolio\n- - the disciplined capital allocation framework and commitment to prudent financial policy\n- - the pay-out shareholder return policy being based on earnings, and is therefore more sustainable\n- - the focus on achieving impeccable ESG credentials and therefore strengthening our social licence, which allows for growth and maintained access to debt capital and bank loan markets.\n\nTherefore, considering the Group's current position and the robust assessment of our emerging and principal risks, the Directors have assessed the prospects of the Group over the next five years (until 31 December 2028) and have a reasonable expectation that we will be able to continue to operate and meet our liabilities as they fall due over that period.\n\nIn the long term, there are four principal risks with long-dated consequences that could have a material impact on our viability.\n\n- - Preparing our Iron Ore business to meet the demand for green steel 1 .\n- - Leaving a positive legacy for future generations, embedding closure considerations throughout the lifespan of our assets.\n- - Minimising our impact on the environments we work in and building physical resilience to changes in those environments, including climate change and natural disasters.\n- - Delivering our growth projects.\n\nThe principal risks and uncertainties section provides further details including current management responses.",

While we deploy controls to reduce the likelihood and consequence of risks, some inherent risks to our business remain. These include natural disasters, where there is limited capacity in the international insurance markets to transfer such risks. We closely monitor these threats and develop business resilience plans.\n\nThe principal risk potential assessments mapped below are primarily based on our managed operations. We are exposed to risks associated with our non-managed joint ventures which, if they arise, may have consequences on our reputation or our financial condition. We seek to bring an equal\n\nlevel of rigour and discipline to our managed and non-managed joint ventures as we do to our wholly-owned assets. We do this through engagement, embedded representatives and influence, in line with applicable laws.\n\nThe timeframe of our principal risks is within five years unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\nWe frame our principal risks in the context of our overarching strategic objectives: to be the best operator; to achieve impeccable ESG credentials; to excel in development; and to protect our social licence.

Preventing fatalities, permanent disablements, and illness from a major hazard or safety event\n\nNothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our employees, contractors and communities where we operate. The mining industry is inherently hazardous, with the potential to cause illness or injury, damage to the environment and disruption to communities. Our objective is first and foremost to have zero fatalities. Our focus is on identifying, managing and, where possible, eliminating risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategic alignment\n\nChange vs 2022\n\nl\n\nBest operator\n\nStable\n\n## Opportunities\n\nDemonstrating our ability to meet or exceed our commitments in safety and hazard management can support us in attracting and retaining talent and help us achieve our impeccable ESG credential objective.\n\n## Threats\n\nMajor hazards include process safety, underground mining, slope geotechnical and tailings management. Failing to effectively manage these risks could result in a catastrophic event or other long-term damage. Loss of technical capability at complex operations poses a significant risk.\n\nWhile not considered major hazards, significant risks at our sites include falling objects, fall from height, and vehicles and driving. These are the top three causes of potentially fatal incidents (PFIs) which could result in fatalities in our business.\n\n## Key exposures\n\nOur underground operations such as Oyu Tolgoi, Diavik and Kennecott. Geotechnical risk at our Kennecott and QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM) operations. Mass passenger transportation risks (including chartered aviation). Process safety at our smelters and refineries. Our tailings and water storage facilities.\n\n## Risk oversight\n\nThe Major Hazards Steering Committee, Risk Management Committee and Sustainability Committee.\n\n## Management's response includes:\n\n- - Oversight by the Sustainability Committee, supported by the Risk Management Committee, Major Hazard Steering Committee and quarterly major hazard meetings taking place at each product group.\n- - Providing key technical capability in hazard and asset management through our Centres of Excellence within our Development & Technology function. Providing assurance against the Group Standards and Procedures with an associated control library in the RMIS.\n- - Ongoing implementation of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM).\n- - Focusing on fatality elimination through our critical risk management (CRM) program.\n- - Reporting, investigating and sharing learnings from HSES incidents internally (such as sharing learnings from PFIs) and monitoring HSES performance monthly at Group level.\n- - Building safety targets into personal performance metrics to incentivise safe behaviour and effective risk management (as outlined in our Remuneration report).\n\n## 2.

This could impact the future competitiveness of our iron ore portfolio. Decarbonisation of the steel value chain will require the development and proliferation of economic low-carbon technologies suited to low-mid grade ores.\n\nThis principal risk is focused on a medium- to longer-term time horizon.\n\n## Key exposures\n\nPilbara low-mid grade ores.\n\n## Risk oversight\n\nThe Steel Decarbonisation Steering Committee and the Board.\n\n## Management's response includes:\n\n- - Reshaping our Iron Ore portfolio to bring additional high-grade ore to the market, such as Simandou.\n- - Establishing the Rio Tinto Steel Decarbonisation team to identify and develop technical and commercial options through deep partnerships and collaboration across the steel value chain with a specific focus on economic low-carbon solutions for our Pilbara ores. See our 2023 Climate Change Report for further details.\n- - Exploring beneficiation and modular concentrators with technology partners to upgrade Pilbara ores to reduce impurities and increase amenability to future low-carbon steelmaking technology.\n- - Developing long-term strategic research and development partnerships with key iron ore customers including Baowu, Nippon Steel, BlueScope, POSCO, Zenith and Shougang to explore a range of economic new low-carbon technologies suited to low-mid grade iron ores. Key areas of focus include the development of electric melter technology, fluidised bed technology, carbon capture, use and storage, as well as optimisation of existing blast furnaces.\n- - Developing BioIron TM in partnership with the University of Nottingham and Metso.

Our assets, infrastructure, communities and broader value chains are exposed to the impacts of extreme weather events, such as drought, flooding, heat waves and fires. Climate change is expected to impact the frequency, intensity and likelihood of extreme events.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategic alignment\n\nChange vs 2022\n\nl\n\nImpeccable ESG\n\nIncreasing\n\n## Opportunities\n\nBy understanding specific exposures across our portfolio, our capital programs can incorporate measures to minimise environmental impact and improve resilience in the event of an extreme climatic event. Development and investment in nature-based solutions, independent of mining operations, addresses climate change while halting and reversing nature loss, and supporting the resilience of communities through alternative socio-economic opportunities.\n\n## Threats\n\nA number of our operations and future development opportunities exist within, or close to, sensitive biodiverse regions. Our licence to operate and develop requires us to demonstrate our capability to protect ecosystems and community health through improved practices and technological solutions. Natural hazards or extreme weather events can endanger our employees and communities, damage our assets or cause significant operational interruption.

Delivering on our growth projects\n\nDelivering our growth strategy relies on our ability to develop resources faster and more competitively than others, while aiming for impeccable ESG credentials, and on the success of our exploration and acquisition activities to secure those resources. Developing projects requires complex multi-year study and execution plans and carries significant delivery risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategic alignment\n\nChange vs 2022\n\nl\n\nExcel in development\n\nStable\n\n## Opportunities\n\nActive and focused exploration and business development efforts have the potential to increase or diversify our commodity resource base. Through operational efficiencies, deployment of new technologies or improved understanding of our orebodies, we may convert a greater proportion of resources to reserves more competitively.\n\n## Threats\n\nNew high-quality deposits are increasingly scarce and those that are known require advances in processing technology, significant capital investment or may negatively impact our ESG credentials. Additionally, as studies and projects progress, they are susceptible to changes in approvals, societal expectations or changes in underlying commercial or economic assumptions, which could impact economic viability.\n\n## Key exposures\n\nSimandou, Pilbara increasing approval time frames, Oyu Tolgoi underground expansion, Rincon, Resolution and Jadar.\n\n## Risk oversight\n\nThe Investment Committee, the Ore Reserves Steering Committee and the Board.\n\n## Management's response includes:\n\n- - Focusing on our objective 'Excel in development' to deliver inorganic and organic growth through alignment across the Group, leveraging our in-house capabilities (such as exploration, processing at Bundoora, Business Development, Battery Materials team, specialised projects and studies division).\n- - Progressing our ambition to invest up to $3 billion per annum of growth capital expenditure focused on energy transition commodities, such as copper, battery materials, high-grade iron ore and critical minerals (rhenium, tellurium, scandium and selenium).\n- - Developing joint venture partnerships to enhance development capabilities and reduce funding requirements such as the joint venture with First Quantum to develop the La Granja project.\n- - Broadening our scope to include higher-risk jurisdictions and targets (with a few exceptions, such as Russia) and consider minimum viable projects that can grow and create optionality or are a strategic fit for the Group.\n- - Stage gate approval process (Evaluation and Investment Committees, Board) including in-flight monitoring of project progress, as articulated in our Project Evaluation Standard and Guidance.\n- - New country entry (NCE) reviews to ensure robust ESG and human rights due diligence during exploration or M&A.\n\n## 8. Achieving our decarbonisation targets competitively\n\nEnsuring our ability to deliver longer-term strategic objectives, achieve our Scope 1 and 2 targets between now and 2050 and deliver on our focus area of impeccable ESG, while balancing the need to invest for growth, deliver superior shareholder returns and remain competitive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategic alignment\n\nChange vs 2022\n\nl\n\nImpeccable ESG\n\nStable\n\n## Opportunities\n\nDecarbonising our assets has the potential to enhance our competitive advantage (tariffs and access to markets) as well as embedding a culture of energy efficiency and allowing us to explore economic opportunities that will benefit our host communities. Renewable energy projects will likely provide energy in excess of our needs at certain times, improving the availability of renewable energy in the communities where we operate.\n\nWe are well placed to be a leading supplier of materials to support the energy transition; for example, aluminium for solar panels and copper for electric vehicles.\n\n## Threats\n\nDelays in priority initiatives will threaten our Scope 1 and 2 target delivery and ability to respond proactively and competitively. A key uncertainty is our ability to successfully engage (and partner where appropriate) with governments and other external parties to progress grid decarbonisation. Furthermore, our 2030 targets include new technology that is dependent on timely and successful investment in research and development; for example, hydrogen calcination and BlueSmelting TM .\n\nFollowing our social and human rights standards during implementation of decarbonisation projects will be critical to avoid adversely impacting people and stakeholder relationships. However, this may limit our available sourcing options and lead to delays in meeting our targets (for example, solar panel sourcing).\n\n## Key exposures\n\nRio Tinto Aluminium Pacific Operations (Pacific Ops) repowering and Alumina processing.\n\n## Risk oversight\n\nThe Risk Management Committee and the Board.\n\n## Management's response includes:\n\n- - Delivering our targets through six large abatement programs focused on renewables (such as Pilbara, RBM, Pacific Ops), ELYSIS TM , alumina processing (Yarwun and Queensland Aluminium Limited [QAL]), mineral processing and diesel; complemented by nature-based solutions and offsets.\n- - Establishing a dedicated team, Rio Tinto Energy & Climate, to focus on accountability for decarbonisation decision-making, funding and resource prioritisation, data collection and analysis.\n- - Having our Office of the Chief Scientist support decarbonisation research and development to identify pathways for hard-to-abate areas required to meet our targets.\n- - Developing partnerships with external parties to leverage broader capabilities and accelerate decarbonisation including:\n- - Centre for Future Materials led by Imperial College London to find innovative ways to provide the materials the world needs for the energy transition.\n- - Yarwun Hydrogen Calcination Pilot Demonstration Program in partnership with Sumitomo.\n- - Pilbara renewables memorandum of understanding with Yindjibarndi Energy Corporation.\n- - Battery Electric Haul Truck program pilots in the Pilbara with Caterpillar in 2024 and Komatsu in 2025.",

It enables us to build a workplace where everyone feels safe, respected and empowered to deliver every day.\n\n## Threats\n\nNot living our values will lead to production over safety. As societal expectations change, it is essential that we focus on our commitment to social licence and our values of care, courage and curiosity. The final report of the Western Australia Parliamentary Inquiry into Sexual Harassment in the Mining Industry and our release of the Everyday Respect Report on the findings from an independent review of our workplace culture, both in 2022, highlighted the scale of change required internally and across the resources sector.\n\n## Risk oversight\n\nThe Board.\n\n## Management's response includes:\n\nWe embarked on a cultural change program led by the refresh of our corporate values in 2021 and have accelerated this since through the Everyday Respect task force. We have also refreshed and updated our Code of Conduct, The Way We Work , to be more comprehensive and act as the blueprint of key principles, driving policy position, setting out Rio Tinto's commitments to stakeholders, and clarifying what is expected of all employees.\n\nTo support our leaders and teams in living our values, we have focused on:\n\n- - Launching our refreshed purpose and values, and a program to support how they are embedded.\n- - Developing Everyday Respect task force workstreams to address sexual harassment, bullying and racism in our workplace. These have focused on ensuring safe and appropriate facilities and providing a caring, human-centred response to disrespectful and harmful behaviours.\n- - Undertaking biannual people surveys and presenting annual values scorecards to the Executive Committee and the Board.\n- - Continuing to develop our internal whistleblowing program (myVoice), open to employees and external stakeholders to report on conduct inconsistent with our values and Code of Conduct.\n- - Launching Care Hub which are independent care units providing trauma and people-focused support, practical care and alternative resolution options to anyone affected by harmful behaviours.\n- - Changing our people management processes to create companywide alignment behind our strategy and increase respectful and transparent behaviour.",

Remaining competitive through economic cycles or shocks\n\nOur business model depends on our ability to convert existing resources to reserves available for mining when required. The viability of our orebodies and business is most sensitive to commodity economics which is greatly influenced by macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. We aim to remain competitive, preserve resilience and maintain access to funding by having costcompetitive assets, a diversified commodities portfolio, a strong balance sheet, prudent financial policies and strong ESG credentials.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategic alignment\n\nChange vs 2022\n\nl\n\nBest operator\n\nStable\n\n## Opportunities\n\nFavourable market conditions and strong internal capital discipline allow us to maintain our balance sheet strength, enabling us to invest in growth opportunities, pay down debt and enhance returns to shareholders.\n\nThrough operational efficiencies, deployment of new technologies or improved understanding of our orebodies, we may convert a greater proportion of our resources to reserves.\n\n## Threats\n\nDeteriorating economic and political environment leading to falling commodity prices (reduced cash flow, limiting profitability), trade actions (increased tariffs, retaliations and sanctions), and governments' efforts to exert more control over their natural resources by changing contractual, regulatory or tax measures. This can impact our key markets, operations or investments and access to funding.\n\nOrebody health remains challenged with Ore Reserve depletion driven by expanded production and ongoing resource development challenges. Failure to secure access and approvals limiting collection of required orebody knowledge or a material reduction in commodity price may reduce the volume of existing reserves and the future conversion of resources to reserves in the required timeframe.\n\n## Risk oversight\n\nThe Financial Risk Management Committee, the Risk Management Committee and the Audit & Risk Committee.\n\n## Management's response includes:\n\n- - Implementing the Safe Production System (SPS) which aims to transform how we operate our assets, manage performance and develop and empower our people. This enables us to consistently deliver outstanding safety and production results and improve our asset and equipment reliability and maintenance.\n- - The Orebody Knowledge Centre of Excellence maintains and assures compliance with the Group's Resources and Reserves Standard and monitors KPIs to track variations from expected asset production plans.\n- - Maintaining capital discipline and a strong balance sheet through robust investment governance processes, prudent financial policies and a pay-out-based shareholder returns policy.

Preventing material business disruption and data breaches due to cyber events\n\nManage cybersecurity events to ensure there is no disruption to our operations that could impact how our employees work, or data privacy or sensitive information breach related to customers, contractors or suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategic alignment\n\nChange vs 2022\n\nl\n\nBest operator\n\nStable\n\n## Opportunities\n\nThe value of a robust cybersecurity function extends beyond the protection of our information, productivity and people. Requests for information to substantiate Rio Tinto's cybersecurity capabilities are becoming more frequent and in-depth as our customers look to validate their supply-chain risk. In parallel, the expectations from regulators and ratings agencies are increasing and new obligations for public disclosure of cybersecurity incidents are emerging. This generates opportunity to enhance our ESG credentials and customer value proposition.\n\n## Threats\n\nCyber breaches can arise from malicious external or internal attacks, but also inadvertently through human error and the inconsistent application across functions of controls that are not managed by Information Services and Technology (IS&T). Although the extent and frequency of cybersecurity threats remains in line with growth expectations, attacks have been observed to be more destructive in nature. The ongoing digitisation and transformation of operational technology environments, and the increasing use of AI to inform and automate decisions, amplifies the threat of loss of control systems or hijacking of autonomous functions.\n\n## Key exposures\n\nOur greatest exposure continues to be through third parties. There was one notable breach in 2023 with Go Anywhere, a third party, where sensitive Rio Tinto data was exposed. Additionally, the growing reliance on technology to underpin productivity is increasing the breadth and magnitude of operational disruption exposures.\n\n## Risk oversight\n\nThe Cyber Security Steering Committee (CSSC) and the Board.\n\n## Management's response includes:\n\n- - The CSSC is our primary governance body and is responsible for our cyber strategy and oversight of Group-wide initiatives.\n- - In recognition of the role all employees play in keeping our information and systems secure, clear expectations for data privacy, cybersecurity and handling of confidential information are set out in The Way We Work .\n- - Improving mandatory Group-wide cybersecurity training and awareness programs.\n- - Maintaining business resilience management plans for major incident response and recovery, including cybersecurity events and a dedicated plan for IS&T.\n- - Maturing third-party risk management through contractual inclusions and proactive compliance assessments.\n- - Operating a perpetual cybersecurity program of work ensures our controls remain relevant to the evolving threat environment.\n- - Initiating a program in 2024 to simplify IT governance and improve the integrity, consistency and monitoring of key controls.\n- - We are investing to strengthen our cybersecurity capabilities, specifically our threat intelligence, which maintains relationships with government, industry, professional bodies and education institutions to ensure we remain vigilant of the threat landscape.\n- - Ongoing inspection and assurance of the security of our environment, and to an extent, the environment of our suppliers.\n- - Focused assessment and assurance in collaboration with industryleading practitioners on our capability and readiness to enhance and extend controls into operational technology environments in response to the increasing exposure.",

        "page_content": "## Chair's introduction\n\nOur focus as a Board in 2023 has been on embedding an empowering culture and on the delivery of consistent operational performance to progress our four key strategic objectives. Strong corporate governance is essential to achieving these goals.\n\nThe following pages provide a comprehensive description of our governance arrangements - including our overall governance framework, how we engage with stakeholders, how we evaluate our own Board effectiveness and detailed reports on the work of each of our Board committees. I believe these arrangements are first class, but we recognise that effective governance requires constant adaptation and evolution. We therefore strive to continuously improve our approach to optimise how the Board can drive and support the success of the business, for the benefit of shareholders and all of our other stakeholders.\n\nIt has been another busy year for the Board, but in this introduction I would like to highlight three areas which were an important part of our focus during 2023, and into 2024.\n\n## Site visits\n\nWith the lifting of most remaining COVIDrelated travel restrictions in 2023, we were able to resume Board visits to our operations and to strategically important countries. Whilst like many, we adapted well to the pandemic restrictions with 'virtual' Board meetings, there is simply no substitute for getting on the ground in person to gain first hand insights into operations and meet key stakeholders in person.\n\nIn July, we had a remarkable visit to Mongolia. The Board visited our mining operations at Oyu Tolgoi and met with employees, partners and contractors, and members of the local community. The visit also included important meetings with our partners in the Mongolian government and the opportunity to experience the annual Naadam Festival, showcasing the nation's history and cultural roots.\n\nIn September, we held our Board meeting in Washington, D.C. Given the importance of the Group's North American business and strategy and the very significant role that the United States plays in climate, energy transition, and geopolitics, the trip included a program of valuable engagements with US civil society, business and political leaders.\n\nWe had a landmark visit in December, where we held the first Rio Tinto Board meeting in China. The visit included a series of engagements to deepen our relationships with government, customers, partners and suppliers. We also celebrated key milestones such as the 40th anniversary of the opening of our China Office and the 50th anniversary of the first shipment of iron ore to China.\n\n## Board composition\n\nAs we reported last year, during 2022 we evaluated the mix of skills and experience on the Board and concluded that we needed to refresh our composition, with a particular focus on mining, operations and projects experience, renewables and the energy transition, finance / accounting, and knowledge of countries or regions of strategic relevance to the Group.\n\nOver the course of 2023, I am pleased that we have made significant progress in this, with the announcement of six new Non-Executive Directors representing these skillsets and experience. We have provided details on the search process for our new Non-Executive Directors and how they fulfil these skills requirements in the Nominations Committee Report on page 106.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nIn the second half of 2023 we had the three-yearly external, independent evaluation of Board effectiveness - this is described further on the following pages.\n\nOverall, the review concluded that the Board and its Committees were working effectively, but it also provided some valuable insights on how we can enhance performance. We discussed the initial findings in October 2023 and reviewed some detailed suggested actions in February 2024 that we hope will help with the ongoing optimisation of our governance arrangements.\n\nI believe that these activities, and those described over the following pages, represent a solid set of corporate governance arrangements at Rio Tinto, but also demonstrate our commitment to continuously improving them.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dominic Barton\n\nChair\n\n21 February 2024",

These visits allow the Board to observe the operations in action and deepen their knowledge, while understanding the culture of the business and how we are progressing against our People Strategy.\n\nJakob Stausholm and Jennifer Nason share the traditional Mongolian beverage \"airag\" (fermented mare's milk).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Oyu Tolgoi, Mongolia\n\nThe Board visited Mongolia in July. The Chair and several Board members met with Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene and government ministers and participated in the Mongolian Economic Forum in Ulaanbaatar, which focused on future investment opportunities in Mongolia. While in Ulaanbaatar, the Board experienced the annual Naadam Festival, which offered a great demonstration of the nation's history and cultural roots.\n\nThe Board visited Oyu Tolgoi and had the opportunity to see the underground block cave performing well. They were impressed by the mine's productivity and the management of underground health and safety. They also viewed trials of underground electric vehicles, which form part of future plans to help decarbonise the mine.\n\nWhile in Mongolia, Board members also visited a herder family in the community, shared a traditional meal, heard the education plans for their children, and listened to herders' concerns about late seasonal rains to provide feed for their camels.\n\nretention and productivity improving in recent years. As we redefined our culture, we have seen a natural attrition of people with behaviours not aligned with our values.\n\nThe Board places great importance on employee engagement and regularly reviews its approach to engaging with the workforce. Simon McKeon, in his role as our designated Non-Executive Director for engagement with the workforce, also facilitates two-way dialogue between the Board and wider workforce.\n\n## Employee engagement survey\n\nThe Board received and considered reports and updates from the Chief People Officer on the results of our twice-yearly People Survey in July and December, which provided useful insights into employee sentiment. In considering the reports, the Board supported a number of recommendations aimed at improving communications from senior leadership to the wider workforce, increasing opportunities for career growth and learning, and supporting psychological health and safety.\n\n## Western Australia town hall: celebrating 150 years\n\nDominic Barton, Jakob Stausholm, Peter Cunningham and Kellie Parker, Chief Executive, Australia, had the opportunity to celebrate Rio Tinto's 150 years during a Perth town hall, hosted by Simon Trott, Chief Executive, Iron Ore. More than 2,100 of our people attended the town hall, joining in-person and online. They had the opportunity to ask questions and hear the Board and Executive Committee members' reflections, who, in turn, gained insight into what is top of mind for our people.\n\nThe visit offered the Board a chance to deepen their relationships with the Mongolian Government, observe the culture and leadership at our site, meet our frontline leaders, partners and contractors, and assess whether the business is meeting the expectations of traditional herders and local communities in Mongolia.\n\n## Le Thoronet, France\n\nOur Chair, Dominic Barton, visited south east France in October to see our Closure team in action. Dominic visited the Gardanne alumina refinery, the closed bauxite mine of Le Thoronet and the closed bauxite residue disposal area at St-Cyr. The former bauxite sites have been fully rehabilitated and are now used by the community for recreational activities. The visit provided an opportunity to learn more about our closure activities, stakeholder engagement and how we work towards a shared vision for the environment and community after mining ends. The visit illustrated both the scale and the variety of closure activity. Work to close assets and remediate and repurpose land is critical to our social licence and impeccable ESG credentials objectives.",

No 4 does not have any other connection with Rio Tinto, and was appointed following a formal tender process overseen by the Chair, Senior Independent Director, Rio Tinto plc and Group Company Secretary.\n\n## Board review process\n\nThe external review comprised observations of Board and Committee meetings and a series of interviews with the Board members, Executive Committee members, the Company Secretary and certain advisors.\n\n## Conclusions of the evaluation\n\nThe Directors discussed the initial findings from the evaluation at the October Board meeting. The evaluation concluded overall that the Board and its Committees were working well, and that the performance of the Chair and individual directors was effective.\n\nIn terms of areas for improvement, it was agreed to explore ways of creating more time for in-depth discussion of the most material matters, to further sharpen the focus on strategic execution and, to help enable those improvements, to explore efficiencies related to the arrangements of the Board including scheduling, allocation of time and format of the Board's materials.\n\nIt was agreed that the Chair would lead further discussion on how to progress these matters and report back to the Board.\n\n## Directors' attendance at scheduled Board and committee meetings during 2023 1\n\n|                                          | Committee Appointments   | Board   | Audit & Risk   | Nominations   | People & Remuneration   | Sustainability   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------|----------------|---------------|-------------------------|------------------|\n| Chair and Executive Directors            |                          |         |                |               |                         |                  |\n| Dominic Barton 2                         |                          | 7/7     |                | 3/3           | 4/5                     | 4/4              |\n| Jakob Stausholm                          |                          | 7/7     |                |               |                         |                  |\n| Peter Cunningham                         |                          | 7/7     |                |               |                         |                  |\n| Non-Executive Directors                  |                          |         |                |               |                         |                  |\n| Megan Clark - retired 15 December 2023 3 |                          | 7/7     |                | 3/3           | 5/5                     | 4/4              |\n| Dean Dalla Valle - joined 1 June 2023 4  |                          | 4/4     |                | 2/2           | 1/1                     | 2/2              |\n| Simon Henry 5                            |                          | 7/7     | 6/6            | 2/3           |                         |                  |\n| Kaisa Hietala - joined 1 March 2023      |                          | 6/6     |                | 2/2           |                         | 3/3              |\n| Sam Laidlaw 6                            |                          | 7/7     |                | 3/3           | 5/5                     | 4/4              |\n| Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz - joined 1 June 2023 |                          | 4/4     |                | 2/2           | 3/3                     |                  |\n| Simon McKeon                             |                          | 7/7     | 6/6            | 3/3           | 5/5                     |                  |\n| Jennifer Nason                           |                          | 7/7     |                | 3/3           | 5/5                     |                  |\n| Joc O'Rourke - joined 25 October 2023    |                          | 2/2     |                |               |                         |                  |\n| Ngaire Woods                             |                          | 7/7     |                | 3/3           | 5/5                     | 4/4              |\n| Ben Wyatt                                |                          | 7/7     | 6/6            | 3/3           |                         |                  |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## Nominations Committee report\n\n## Our main priority as a Committee in 2023 was on refreshing the Board, and I am pleased to report that, over the year, we have announced the appointment of six new Non-Executive Directors.\n\nWe welcomed Kaisa Hietala, Susan LloydHurwitz, Dean Dalla Valle and Joc O'Rourke to the Board during the course of 2023 and, in December, we announced the appointments of Martina Merz, who joined the Board on 1 February 2024, and Sharon Thorne, who will join in July 2024.\n\nMegan Clark stepped down as a Non-Executive Director on 15 December 2023, having served for nine years on the Board. I would like to express my sincere thanks to Megan for her contribution to Rio Tinto. We will greatly miss her insights and wise counsel.\n\nAs we have announced today, Simon McKeon will step down as a Non-Executive Director at the conclusion of our annual general meetings in 2024. I am extremely grateful to Simon for his invaluable contribution. On behalf of the Board, I wish him well for the future.\n\n## Refreshing the Board\n\n2023 was a busy and important year in terms of refreshing the Board. As we set out in the Annual Report last year, the Nominations Committee identified a number of areas of expertise to inform the candidate search and strengthen the Board's composition in mining, operations and projects (preferably former or current Chief Executives or other senior leaders), renewables and the energy transition, financial/accounting, and knowledge of countries or regions of strategic relevance to the Group.\n\nDuring the year, and with the support of executive search firm, Spencer Stuart, the Committee oversaw the appointments of six new Non-Executive Directors who were identified as providing expertise in these areas.\n\nWe continue to work hard to enhance the diversity of our Board composition. With four of the six new directors being women, our new Board will be 43% women (six out of 14 directors). The number of directors from an ethnic background is one.\n\nThe external search diversity of the identified areas of expertise was as follows:\n\n## Mining, operations and projects\n\n| 38% women                            | 13% ethnic background                |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Renewables and the energy transition | Renewables and the energy transition |\n| 60%                                  | 9%                                   |\n| women                                | ethnic background                    |\n| Finance/accounting                   | Finance/accounting                   |\n| 74% women                            | 10% ethnic background                |\n\nThese changes mark the completion of the latest phase of refreshing the Board, with the six newly appointed Non-Executive Directors covering the key areas of expertise we had identified in our search criteria.\n\nWe have also enhanced the gender diversity of our Board composition, with four of the six new Directors being women. Our new Board will comprise 14 Directors, six of whom (43%) are women. Our new Board will peak at 14 directors and then go back to a more optimal size. We believe it is important to retain the expertise and experience of our longer-serving Directors during the transitional period as newer Directors familiarise themselves with the Group. We also acknowledge that, for the same reason, we do not currently comply with the new UK Listing Rules target that at least one of the senior board positions (Chair, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or\n\nCompleted candidate searches within identified expertise areas, were as follows:\n\n## Mining, operations and projects\n\nDean Dalla Valle and Joc O'Rourke were appointed to the Board in June 2023 and October 2023, respectively. Dean has four decades of operational and project management experience as a senior leader in the resources and infrastructure sectors and Joc has more than 25 years' experience in the mining and minerals industry, for the last decade as a Chief Executive. Dean has also succeeded Megan Clark as Chair of the Sustainability Committee.\n\nSusan Lloyd-Hurwitz and Martina Merz were appointed to the Board in June 2023 and February 2024, respectively. Susan brings extensive experience in Australia's built environment sector, for the last decade as a Chief Executive. She is known for her transformational leadership on cultural change, gender equity, diversity and inclusion, and sustainability. Martina brings leadership and operational experience as a former Chief Executive in industrial engineering and steel production.\n\n## Renewables and the energy transition\n\nKaisa Hietala was appointed to the board in March 2023.

        "page_content": "## Appointments to the Board our policy\n\nWe base our appointments to the Board on merit, and on objective selection criteria, with the aim of bringing a range of skills, knowledge and experience to Rio Tinto. This involves a formal and rigorous process to source strong candidates from diverse backgrounds and conducting appropriate background and reference checks on the shortlisted candidates. We aim to appoint people who will help us address the operational and strategic challenges and opportunities facing the company and ensure that our Board is diverse in terms of experience, gender, nationality, social background and cognitive style. As such, we engage only recruitment agencies that are signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct on diversity best practice.\n\nWe believe that an effective Board combines a range of perspectives with strong oversight, combining the experience of Directors who have developed a deep understanding of our business over several years with the fresh insights of newer appointees. We aim for the Board's composition to reflect the global nature of our business - we currently have eight different nationalities (including dual nationalities) on a Board of 14.\n\nThe Committee engaged Spencer Stuart to support the search for our new NonExecutive Directors. The Committee is satisfied that Spencer Stuart does not have any connections with the company or individual Directors that may impair their independence.\n\nWhen recruiting government or former government officials to join the Rio Tinto Board, we comply with any restrictions and obligations existing pursuant to relevant laws and regulations, including with respect to confidentiality, lobbying and conflicts of interest.\n\nThe key skills and experience of our Board are set out on this page of the report.\n\n## Our key responsibilities\n\nThe purpose of the Nominations Committee is to review the composition of the Board. The Committee leads the process for appointments, making recommendations to the Board as part of succession planning for Non-Executive Directors. It also approves proposals for appointments to the Executive Committee.\n\n## Membership of the Committee\n\nAll Non-Executive Directors are currently members of the Nominations Committee.\n\nThe Chief Executive and the Chief People Officer are invited to attend all or part of meetings, as appropriate. The Committee is chaired by the Chair of the Board, unless the matter under consideration relates to the role of the Chair.\n\nThe Committee had three formal meetings in 2023 and received regular and detailed updates on the status of the various searches, as required. Attendance at the formal meetings is included in the table on page 104.\n\n## Diversity\n\nThe Board recognises that it has a critical role to play in creating an environment in which all contributions are valued, different perspectives are embraced, and biases are acknowledged and overcome. The Board shares ownership with the Executive Committee of the Group's Inclusion and Diversity Policy, which can be found at riotinto.com/policies.\n\nThe proportion of women on the Board is currently 36% (five women and nine men) and will be 43% following the commencement of Sharon Thorne's appointment in July 2024.\n\nThe Group has continued to set measurable gender diversity objectives for the composition of senior leadership and graduate intake and achievement of these targets contributes to the variable remuneration of senior executives. Progress on diversity is shown in the Our approach to ESG section on page 43, where we show a breakdown by seniority.\n\nThe number of Directors who identify themselves as being from an ethnic background is one (Ben Wyatt).\n\nFor further information on the gender and ethnic diversity of the Board and Executive Committee please see page 153 of the Compliance with governance codes and standards section.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProgress on diversity is shown in the Talent, diversity and inclusion section on pages 73-74.\n\n## Skills and experience of the Chair and Non-Executive

        "page_content": "## Audit & Risk Committee report\n\nI am pleased to present the Audit & Risk Committee (Committee) report for 2023. During the year, the Committee continued to oversee the processes in place to monitor the Group's risk management and financial reporting. This included reviewing and considering the longer-term viability statement (LTVS) and ensuring this Annual Report is fair, balanced, and understandable.\n\nThe Committee spent much of its time discussing and overseeing the significant issues of judgement relating to the financial statements. In particular, this included consideration of impairment charges and reversals, exclusions, closure provisions, climate change, tax and litigation. We appraised and monitored the status of the Group's internal control of financial reporting for the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements. We have also overseen the Group's systems of internal control and risk management, including the Group Internal Audit (GIA) function.\n\nThis year, the Committee endorsed a GIA development program to enhance the teams quality, agility and speed of plan and assurance delivery. This sees GIA working more closely with the business to support and assure critical activities, and ensure a prioritised approach to managing recommendations following audits. It will simplify processes while maintaining strong assurance activity. We believe this approach is appropriate and will encourage cultural change to support the Group's objectives. We also monitored and supported developments in the risk management function and processes targeted at a clearer articulation of the three lines of defence model, in particular the roles and accountabilities of the first and second lines.\n\nWe continue to closely monitor the developing regulatory requirements in the three jurisdictions in which we are listed. Throughout the year the Committee received updates on the potential for UK corporate governance reform. We aim to be a valued contributor to positive developments in corporate governance, and to adopt new requirements in a timely way. I have worked with our team and through the Audit Committee Chairs' Independent Form (ACCIF) in formulating responses to the Financial Reporting Council's UK Corporate Governance Code consultation. Although many of the original proposals have now been withdrawn, we intend to continue working towards and developing an Audit and Assurance Policy, which will show how we receive assurance over the integrity of our reporting, including both financial statements and other components of the Annual Report, and other external reporting requirements. I also believe our current LTVS already meets most of the requirements for the proposed Resilience statement, and that Rio Tinto will be well positioned to consider the new requirement for a Board statement on the effectiveness of internal controls.\n\nIn 2023, the Committee, together with the Sustainability Committee, also closesly followed the changing landscape of environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting requirements. In the short term the new climate-related requirements have been disclosed on a voluntarily basis. The Committee will continue to monitor ESG reporting changes and make necessary preparations to report against them as required. I remain concerned about the multiple emerging frameworks here and the box ticking approach being taken by some stakeholders, and will continue to contribute wherever possible to development of common global standards within the mining sector.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow Committee members for their continuing diligence, insight and challenge, as well as our colleagues across the business who support the work of the Committee.\n\nI hope readers find this report of the Committee's work in 2023, set out on the following pages, informative and interesting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Simon Henry\n\nAudit & Risk Committee Chair 21\u00a0February 2024\n\n## Audit & Risk Committee members\n\n| Simon Henry (Chair)   |\n|-----------------------|\n| Simon McKeon          |\n| Ben Wyatt             |\n\n## Membership\n\nThe members of the Committee are all independent Non-Executive Directors, and their biographies can be found on pages 92-93. The Chair of the Board is not a member of the Committee.\n\nAs Rio Tinto's securities are listed in Australia, the UK and the US, we follow the regulatory requirements and best practice governance recommendations for audit committees in each of these markets.\n\n## Australian listing requirements\n\nIn Australia, the members, and the Committee as a whole, meet the independence requirements of the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) Principles. Specifically, the Committee members between them have the accounting and financial expertise and a sufficient understanding of the industry in which the company operates to be able to discharge the Committee's mandate effectively.\n\n## UK listing requirements\n\nIn the UK, the members meet the requirements of the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, and the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code relating to audit committee composition. Simon Henry, the Chair of the Committee, is considered by the Board to have recent and relevant financial experience.\n\nSimon Henry has extensive experience in the natural resources sector. Simon McKeon and Ben Wyatt have gained experience in the mining sector by serving on the Board and on the Committee, and through regular site visits, reports and presentations. The Committee as a whole has competence relevant to the sector in which the company operates.\n\nThe Committee complies with the Audit Committees and the External Audit: Minimum Standard.\n\n## US listing requirements\n\nIn the US, the requirements for the Committee's composition and role are set out in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules. The members of the Committee meet the independence requirements set out under Rule 10A-3 of the US Exchange Act and under Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. The Board has designated Simon Henry as an 'audit committee financial expert'. The Board also believes that the other members of the Committee are financially literate by virtue of their wide business experience.",

These follow the relevant best practice recommendations in Australia, the UK and the US.\n\n## Our main duties\n\nFinancial reporting - we review the key judgements needed to apply accounting standards and to prepare the Group's financial statements. We also review the narrative reporting that goes with them, with the aim of maintaining integrity in the Group's financial reporting. We also monitor exclusions made in deriving alternative (non-GAAP) (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) performance measures such as underlying earnings.\n\nExternal audit - we oversee the relationship with the external auditors and review all the non-audit services they provide and their fees, to safeguard the auditors' independence and objectivity. We also assess the effectiveness of the external audit and, when necessary, carry out a formal tender process to select new auditors.\n\nFramework for internal control and risk management - we monitor the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls, including those over financial reporting. We also oversee the Group's risk management framework.\n\nGroup Internal Audit (GIA) - we oversee the work of GIA and its head, who reports functionally to the Committee Chair.\n\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves - we oversee the reporting and assurance of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, and consider the impact on financial reporting.\n\nDistributable reserves - we provide assurance to the Board that distributable reserves are sufficient, and in the correct corporate entities, to support any dividend proposals.\n\nThese duties feed into an annual work plan that ensures we consider issues on a timely basis. The Committee has authority to investigate any matters within its remit. We have the power to use any Group resources we may reasonably require, and we have direct access to the external auditors. We can also obtain independent professional advice at the Group's expense, where we deem necessary. No such advice was required during 2023.\n\nThe Committee Chair reports to the Board after each meeting on the main items discussed, and the minutes of Committee meetings are circulated to the Board.\n\nWe had six Committee meetings in 2023. Attendance at these meetings is included in the table on page 104. The Committee has met twice to date in 2024.\n\nThe Chair of the Board, the Chief Financial Officer, the Group Financial Controller and the heads of GIA and Risk regularly attend Committee meetings, as do the Chief Legal Officer, Governance & Corporate Affairs, and the Group Company Secretary. Other senior executives and subject-matter experts are invited as needed.\n\nThe external auditors were present at all of the Committee meetings during the year. The auditors review all materials on accounting or tax matters in advance of each meeting, and their comments are included in the papers circulated to Committee members. The audit partners also meet with the Committee Chair ahead of each meeting to discuss key issues and raise any concerns.\n\nThe Committee meets regularly in private sessions. We also hold regular private discussions with the external auditors. Management does not attend these sessions. The Committee Chair also has regular contact and discussions with these stakeholders outside the formal meetings.\n\n## Use of Committee meeting time in 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Other focus areas in 2023\n\nIn addition to the scheduled workload, the Committee also:\n\n- - Received an update, at a joint session with the Sustainability Committee, on regulatory reform including potential changes to UK corporate governance requirements and the landscape for ESG reporting.\n- - Discussed an update on the OECD Pillar One and Two proposals to implement a new global tax framework involving a reallocation of taxing rights to market jurisdictions and application of a 15% global minimum tax.\n- - After a robust process, in early 2024 recommended to the Board that the draft 2023 Annual Report should be taken as whole, fair, balanced and understandable.\n- - Reviewed the quality and effectiveness of the Group's internal control and risk management systems. This review included the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls over financial reporting, and the Group's disclosure controls and procedures in accordance with sections 404 and 302 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002. The Committee also considered reports from GIA and KPMG on their work in reviewing and auditing the control environment.\n\n## Significant issues relating to financial statements\n\nThere were four significant issues considered by the Committee in relation to the financial statements.\n\n| Matters considered                                                                   | Conclusion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Review of carrying value of  cash-generating units and  impairment charges/reversals | The Committee assessed management's determination of cash-generating units, review of impairment triggers, and consideration  of potential impairment charges and reversals over the course of the year. In the first half of the year impairment triggers were  identified at the Gladstone alumina refineries. The Committee considered the key judgements made by management, in particular  the valuation sensitivity to the cost of carbon credits. In the second half of the year an impairment reversal trigger was identified at  the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea. The key matters discussed with management were the timing of cost capitalisation and  the perimeter of previously impaired assets that continue to be relevant to the project development. |\n| Application of the policy for  items excluded from  underlying EBITDA                | The Committee reviewed the Group's policy for exclusion of certain items from underlying earnings and confirmed the consistent  application of this policy year on year. The items excluded from underlying earnings comprised charges of US$2.1 billion and income  of US$0.4 billion. A reconciliation of net earnings to underlying earnings is presented in the Alternative Performance Measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Estimate for provision for  closure, restoration and  environmental obligations      | The Committee reviewed the significant changes in the estimated provision for closure, restoration and environmental obligations  by product group and Rio Tinto Closure. The Committee received updates on the closure studies completed in the period and the  significant reforecast of costs in relation to the Ranger mine by Energy Resources of Australia. The Committee reviewed economic  assumptions assessed by management, including inflation during the period and supported changes to the discount rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Climate change                                                                       | The Committee received an overview of the work that management is undertaking in relation to climate change and the potential  financial reporting implications thereof. The Committee reviewed the climate change summary in the Financial Statements and the  impacts of climate change throughout the notes, with particular emphasis on the impact to impairment charges and the related  disclosure of sensitivities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

        "page_content": "## Climate change-related financial reporting\n\nThe Directors have considered the relevance of the risks of climate change and transition risks associated with achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement when preparing and signing off the Company's accounts. The narrative reporting on climate-related matters is consistent with the accounting assumptions and judgements made in this report. The Audit & Risk Committee reviews and approves all material accounting estimates and judgements relating to financial reporting, including those where climate issues are relevant. The Group's approach to climate change is supported by strong governance, processes and capabilities.\n\nOur commodity price forecasts focus on two core scenarios. They are used to generate a central reference case for commodity forecasts and valuations, used pervasively in our financial processes, including impairment testing, estimating remaining economic life, and discounting closure and rehabilitation provisions, as was the case in the prior year.\n\nThere is broad recognition that the pace of decarbonisation across the global economy is too slow to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C and that current climate policies in many countries are not yet aligned with their stated ambitions. Consequently, neither of our two core scenarios, Fragmented Leadership and Competitive Leadership, is consistent with the expectation of climate policies required to accelerate the global transition to meet the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement. Although our operational emissions reduction targets align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, our two core scenarios do not. Given this, we also assess our sensitivity, and test the economic performance of our business against, the Aspirational Leadership scenario we have developed that reflects our view of the global actions required to meet the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nOverall, based on our internally developed pricing outlooks, we do not envisage an adverse impact of the 1.5\u00b0C Paris Agreement-aligned sensitivity on asset carrying values, remaining useful life, closure and rehabilitation provisions for our Group.\n\nDuring the year, the assessment performed under the Physical Resilience Programme, together with our ongoing review processes, including impairment assessments, did not identify any material accounting impacts as a consequence of the physical risks associated with climate change.\n\nFor more information on climate change impact on our Group, see our 2023 Climate Change Report and page 44 in this report.\n\n## Contact with regulators during 2023\n\nDuring the year, the Company received a letter from the SEC regarding the Production, Mineral Reserves, Mineral Resources and Operations disclosures in our 2022 20-F.\n\n## External auditors\n\n## Engagement of the external auditors\n\nFor the 2023 financial year, KPMG are serving as our auditors. The UK entity of KPMG audits Rio Tinto plc, and the Australian entity audits Rio Tinto Limited. The UK audit engagement partner, Jonathan Downer, was appointed in March 2021 and the Australian partner, Trevor Hart, was appointed in 2020.\n\nWe agreed on the scope of the auditors' review of the half-year accounts, and of their audit of the full-year accounts, taking into consideration the key risks and areas of material judgement for the Group. We also approved the fees for this work and the engagement letters for the auditors.\n\nThe Group has fully complied with the Statutory Audit Services Order.\n\n## Safeguarding independence and objectivity, and maintaining effectiveness\n\nIn our relationship with the external auditors, we need to ensure that they retain their independence and objectivity, and are effective in performing the external audit.\n\n## Use of the external auditors for non-audit services\n\nThe external auditors have significant knowledge of our business and of how we apply our accounting policies. That means it is sometimes cost-efficient for them to provide non-audit services. There may also be confidentiality reasons that make the external auditors the preferred choice for a particular task.\n\nHowever, safeguarding the external auditors' objectivity and independence is an overriding priority. For this reason, and in line with the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) Ethical Standard and the SEC independence rules, the Committee ensures that the external auditors do not perform any functions of management, undertake any work that they may later need to audit or rely upon in the audit, or serve in an advocacy role for the Group.\n\nWe have a policy governing the use of the auditors to provide non-audit services. The cap on the total fees that may be paid to the external auditors for non-audit services in any given year is 70% of the average of the audit fees for the preceding three years. This is in line with the FRC's Ethical Standard. Non-audit assignments fall into two broad categories:\n\n- - Audit, audit-related or other 'pre-approved' services where we believe there is no threat to auditors' independence and objectivity, other than through the fees payable.\n- - Other services approved under delegated authority.\n\nWe apply different approval regimes to these areas of work. Approval of 'pre-approved' services is as follows:\n\n- - Up to $50,000: subject to prior notification to management, this work can be awarded.\n- - From $50,001 to $100,000: requires the Chief Financial Officer's approval.\n- - Over $100,000 and with a tender process: if the external auditors are successful in the tender, the appointment requires the Chief Financial Officer's approval.\n- - From $100,001 to $250,000 without a tender process: requires the Chief Financial Officer's approval.\n- - Over $250,000 without a tender process: requires the Committee's or Committee Chair's approval.\n\nIn each case, the nature of the assignment and the fees payable are reported to the Committee.\n\nThe Chief Financial Officer can approve other services up to the value of $50,000 and an aggregate value of no more than $100,000. Fees exceeding $100,000 in aggregate require approval from the Committee or the Committee Chair.\n\nAt the half-year and year-ends, the Chief Financial Officer and the external auditors report to the Committee on non-audit services performed and the fees payable. Individual services are also reported to the Committee at each meeting that have either been approved since the previous meeting, or that require approval for commencement following the meeting.\n\nNon-audit services provided by KPMG in 2023 were either within the predetermined approval levels or approved by the Committee and were compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors and the other requirements of the relevant regulations in Australia, the UK and the US regulations.",

        "page_content": "## Fees for audit and non-audit services\n\nThe amounts payable to the external auditors, in each of the past two years, were:\n\n| Audit fees                      | 2023 $m 26.6   | 2022 $m 25.7   |\n|---------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Non-audit service fees:         |                |                |\n| Assurance services              | 4.1            | 3.3            |\n| All other fees                  | 0.1            | 0.3            |\n| Total non-audit service fees    | 4.2            | 3.6            |\n| Non-audit: audit fees (in-year) | 16 %           | 14 %           |\n\nFor further analysis of these fees, please see note 38 on page 237.\n\nNone of the individual non-audit assignments was significant, in terms of either the work done or the fees payable. We have reviewed the non-audit work in aggregate. We are satisfied that neither the work done, nor the fees payable, compromised the independence or objectivity of KPMG as our external auditors.\n\n## Independence of the external auditors\n\nKPMG are required to provide a declaration to the Directors in relation to their compliance with the independence requirements of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and the professional code of conduct for external auditors. A copy of this is on page 285.\n\nNo person who served as an officer of Rio Tinto during 2023 was a Director or partner of KPMG at a time when they conducted an audit of the Group.\n\n## Effectiveness of the external auditors\n\nWe review the effectiveness of the external auditors annually. We consider the results of a survey containing questions on the auditors' objectivity, quality and efficiency. The survey, conducted in June 2023, was completed by a range of operational and corporate executives across the business, and by Committee members.\n\nWe are satisfied with the quality and objectivity of KPMG's 2022 audit.\n\n## Appointment of the auditors\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the independence, objectivity and effectiveness of KPMG as external auditors in 2023 and in the year to date. We have recommended to the Board that KPMG should be retained in this role for 2024, which the Board supports.\n\nKPMG have indicated that they are willing to continue as auditors of Rio Tinto. A resolution to reappoint them as auditors of Rio Tinto plc will be proposed as a joint resolution at the 2024 AGMs, together with a separate resolution seeking authority for the Committee to determine the external auditors' remuneration.\n\nSubject to the approval of the above resolution, KPMG will continue in office as auditors of Rio Tinto Limited.\n\n## Risk management and internal controls\n\nWe review Rio Tinto's internal control systems and the risk management framework. We also monitor risks falling within our remit, especially those relating to the integrity of financial reporting. A summary of the business's internal control and risk management systems, and of the principal risks and uncertainties we face, is available in the Strategic report on pages 78-88. Importantly, responsibility for operating and maintaining the internal control environment and risk management systems sits at asset level. Leaders of our businesses and functions are required to confirm annually that adequate internal controls are in place, that these are operating effectively and are designed to identify any failings and weaknesses that may exist, and that any required actions are taken promptly.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee also regularly monitors our risk management and internal control systems (including internal financial controls). We aim to have appropriate policies, standards and procedures in place, and ensure that they operate effectively.\n\nAs part of considering the risk management framework, the Committee receives regular reports from the Group Financial Controller, the Chief Legal Officer, Governance & Corporate Affairs, and the Head of Tax on material developments in the legal, regulatory and fiscal landscape in which the Group operates.\n\nThe Board, supported by the Audit & Risk Committee, has completed its annual review of the effectiveness of our risk management and internal control systems. This review included consideration of our material financial, operational and compliance controls. The Board concluded that the Group has an effective system of risk management and internal control.\n\n## Internal control over financial reporting\n\nThe main features of our internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting are explained on page 151.\n\n## Internal audit program structure\n\nGIA provides independent and objective assurance of the adequacy and effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems. It may also recommend improvements.\n\nWhile the Head of GIA reports administratively to the Chief Financial Officer, appointment to, or removal from, this role requires the consent of the Audit & Risk Committee Chair. The Head of GIA is accountable to the Chairs of the Audit & Risk and the Sustainability Committees, and communicates regularly with both.\n\nOur GIA team therefore operates independently of management. Its mandate is set out in a written charter, approved by the Audit & Risk Committee. GIA uses a formal internal audit methodology that is consistent with the Institute of Internal Auditors' (IIA) internationally recognised standards.\n\nWhen needed, the team brings in external partners to help achieve its goals. There is a clear policy to address any conflicts of interest, which complies with the IIA's standards on independence. This policy identifies a list of services that need prior approval from the Head of GIA.\n\n## Governance of the annual plan\n\nEach year's internal audit plan is approved by the Audit & Risk Committee and the Sustainability Committee. The plan is focused on higher-risk areas and any specific areas or processes chosen by the committees. It is also aligned with any risks identified by the external auditors. Both committees are given regular updates on progress, including any material findings, and can refine the plans, as needed.\n\n## Effectiveness of the internal audit program\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee monitors the effectiveness of the GIA function throughout the year, with updates on performance at every meeting. In 2022, PwC's assessment of GIA provided some useful suggestions for further improvement to mature GIA to 'trusted adviser' level. These suggested improvements were actioned during 2023 and while the transformation is ongoing, it will improve the function's effectiveness and speed of delivery, while maintaining strong assurance activity.\n\nWe are satisfied that the quality, experience and expertise of GIA are appropriate for the business and that GIA was objective and performed its role effectively. We also monitored management's response to internal audits during the year. We are satisfied that improvements are being implemented promptly in response to GIA findings, and believe that management supports the effective working of the GIA function.\n\n## Committee effectiveness\n\nThe Committee reviews its effectiveness annually. In 2023, this was accomplished through an externally-facilitated evaluation of the Board and its committees.\n\nThe performance of the Committee was highly rated, with no areas of concern raised and no significant changes recommended.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability Committee report\n\nThe Sustainability Committee supports the long-term strategy of Rio Tinto's businesses by caring for our people, overseeing our contribution to the sustainability of the environments and communities in which we operate, and encouraging the business to find better ways to provide the materials that the world needs.\n\nI am pleased to present my first report on the work of the Sustainability Committee, having been appointed Chair of the Committee in October 2023.\n\nThe Sustainability Committee's activities include overseeing Rio Tinto's policies, frameworks, and management systems that are designed to maintain the health and safety of our employees and contractors, to manage our key social and environmental risks, to support the communities in which we operate, and to respect human rights in our business and value chains. By maintaining our focus on these important areas, we are also supporting Rio Tinto's social licence to operate.\n\nWhile we have now experienced five years without a fatality at our managed operations, tragically four team members from our Diavik mine in Canada lost their lives when a charter flight on its way to the mine crashed in January 2024. This is a stark reminder that safety hazards still exist in our operations, and that we must remain eternally vigilant and committed to managing them. A critical item on the Committee's agenda is tracking our progress in analysing and learning from incidents that have the potential to result in Potential Fatal Incidents (PFIs) to prevent similar incidents from happening across our operations. In July, we investigated two process safety incidents that had occurred within six weeks at Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec Operations' reduction plant in Sorel-Tracy, Canada.  We looked at the root causes of each of these events, and the work being done to investigate what further process controls should be implemented.\n\nIn 2023, the Group recorded an all-injury frequency rate of 0.37 - an improvement on the rate of 0.40 for the prior year. However, three permanent damage injuries occurred: an operator injured their hand at our Diavik diamond mine in Canada; a driller lost four fingers at the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea; and at our Kennecott copper operations in Salt Lake City, Utah a geotechnical engineer required a leg amputation. We continue to encourage transparent reporting of PFIs as they occur, and are focusing on the critical risk areas indicated by these incidents - and in particular on falling objects, working at heights, and vehicles and driving. The overall number of reported PFIs remained broadly consistent with the prior year's levels at 103.\n\nIn 2023, the Committee undertook deep dives into selected key safety risks. This included an assessment of the mass passenger transport risks across the Group, during which we examined compliance with our controls, and opportunities for strengthening those controls. Other deep dives in 2023 examined process safety risks, and risks associated with contact with electricity. The Committee also reviewed the design of the governance frameworks for health,\n\nsafety, security, environment and communities for our joint venture arrangements at Simandou.\n\nAt our April meeting, the product group Chief Executives and the Chief Commercial Officer presented to the Committee on the key ESG and operational risks and trends for each product group and for Rio Tinto Marine, and the controls for managing those risks. The Committee noted the key sustainability risk themes across the Group, and commended the collaboration across the Group for managing these risks.\n\nThe Committee continues to review the progress with our safety maturity model (SMM) program, a key tool for developing and enhancing our safety culture. In 2023, the business incorporated a mid-year selfassessment process in addition to the end of year independent assessment, and key insights were provided to the Committee. While no material changes were made to the SMM in 2023, the Group's safety maturity is steadily advancing with an average score in 2023 of 5.2 (out of a scale of 0 to 9), which is an 11% improvement on the prior year.\n\nThe Committee continued to monitor our progress towards implementation of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM). In August 2023, in accordance with GISTM Principle 15, we published information on our facilities with Very High or Extreme consequence classifications. The Committee also continues to directly engage with executives having accountability for the safety of tailings facilities across the Group, and has received progress updates from management on the pathway to full conformance with the GISTM.\n\nThe Committee examined the independent audit of Rio Tinto's Cultural Heritage Management program as part of the response plan to the Rio Tinto Board Review of Cultural Heritage Management, published August 2020. It will monitor ongoing actions to advance Cultural Heritage Management practices globally.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the progress of Rio Tinto's program for managing its physical resilience to climate change, and for the Group's compliance with the disclosure requirements set out by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure.\n\nSustainability risks cannot be considered in isolation. As part of our governance and oversight of sustainability as an integrated risk for the business, the Committee receives annual updates from our product group Chief Executives on their integrated strategies for managing sustainability risks and opportunities. The Committee examined sustainability risk themes and trends identified for the Group, including the impact of the Group's decarbonisation agenda on sustainability risks, and the need for an interdisciplinary approach\n\nfor the management of increasingly interdependent sustainability risks.\n\nThe Group's Internal Audit (GIA) function undertakes reviews and reports to the Sustainability Committee on matters within the Committee's scope. In addition, the Group's auditors, KPMG, reported to the Committee on their assurance procedures over our 2022 sustainable development reporting.\n\nOther key areas of focus for the Committee in 2023 included:\n\n- - Human Rights: reviewing management of human rights risks, tracking global trends in human rights policy and regulation, and overseeing our modern slavery reporting.\n- - Environment and biodiversity: received reports on all areas of environmental risk management (excluding decarbonisation and climate change).\n- - Water: receiving an update on our progress against our water stewardship targets.\n- - Health, Safety, Environment and Security (HSES) performance: receiving regular updates on HSES performance.\n- - Communities and Social Performance (CSP): receiving a progress update on the Group's CSP strategy, including key activities undertaken in 2023 and a forward-looking view on priorities for 2024, in support of the group objectives of Impeccable ESG and Social Licence.\n- - Major hazards: receiving updates from management on the implementation of the GISTM and implementation of the Group's Process Safety Improvement plan 2023-25.\n\nSite visits are an important element of the work of the Committee, and this year in addition to a full Board site visit to Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia, our Committee members made individual visits to our Iron Ore operations in the Pilbara, Western Australia; in the US, our operations at Resolution Copper in Arizona, and our Kennecott copper operations in Salt Lake City, Utah; QIT Madagascar Minerals' facilities in Madagascar; our RTIT operations in Suzhou, China; four Rio Tinto Alcan legacy sites at Le Thoronet, Gardanne, St-Cyr and Montgrand in France; and to our Technical Development Centre in Bundoora, Victoria.\n\nFinally, I would like to thank Megan Clark for her leadership and guidance as Chair of this Committee for the past seven years, and her commitment and generosity of time in assisting my transition into the role of Chair.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDean Dalla Valle\n\nSustainability Committee Chair\n\n21 February 2024",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration report\n\n## Annual statement by the People & Remuneration Committee Chair\n\nThe Committee's overarching purpose is to ensure the people, culture and remuneration policies, frameworks and practices are aligned with the Group's strategy, objectives and values.\n\nDear shareholders,\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our 2023 Directors' Remuneration report.\n\nNothing is more important than the health, safety and wellbeing of our people. While we had zero fatalities at our managed operations in 2023, tragically four colleagues died in a plane crash while travelling to our Diavik mine in January 2024.\n\n2023 was another year of solid operational performance. While the external environment remains volatile and challenging, the fundamentals of our business enable us to continue delivering strong financial results. We have a very resilient business with strong free cashflows underpinned by the quality of our assets, our people and strength of our balance sheet. It allows us to systemically address short term issues and build sustainable growth.\n\nOur operational performance has been accompanied by progress towards our strategic objectives of 'impeccable environment, social and governance (ESG)', 'becoming the best operator', 'excelling in development' and 'strengthening our social licence'. This has seen us accelerate our decarbonisation strategy, improve our culture, safely improve and stabilise production, and diversify in materials enabling the global energy transition.\n\nThe resilience of our business has allowed us to continue to invest in 2023. We announced an investment of $1.1 billion to expand our AP60 aluminium smelter in Canada with lowcarbon technology. We entered into joint ventures during the year, with First Quantum Minerals at the La Granja copper project in Peru, and with the Giampaolo Group through which Rio Tinto acquired a 50% stake in Matalco, to recycle aluminium products throughout the US and Canada. Good progress was made with our ELYSIS TM technology which has the potential to transformatively decarbonise the way we produce aluminium.\n\nWe continued to develop our existing portfolio, particularly at Oyu Tolgoi where we saw the first underground production in the first quarter of 2023, and at the world-class Simandou iron ore project in Guinea, where key infrastructure agreements were concluded during the year. A pre-feasibility study to progress development of the Rhodes Ridge project, one of the best undeveloped iron ore deposits in Western Australia, was approved at the end of the year.\n\n## Overview of performance and strategic progress in 2023\n\n## Short-term incentive plan\n\nIn 2023, we implemented our new Short-term incentive plan (STIP) scorecard which has collective goals at its core. Half of the scorecard for 2023 was based on financial measures of underlying earnings and STIP free cash flow (flexed and unflexed), with the flexed outcome measuring our progress towards 'best operator'. Outcomes against the other half of the scorecard are linked to strategic goals of 'impeccable ESG' covering safety performance, carbon reduction, and diversity and inclusion, 'progress on excel in development', and 'strengthening our licence to operate'. An individual multiplier is in place to be used sparingly in cases of exceptional or underperformance. The STIP scorecard applies consistently across 26,000 eligible employees including the Executive Committee.\n\nThe Committee has assessed Group performance against the STIP scorecard and determined the overall outcome is 56% of maximum.\n\nFor the financial component of the STIP scorecard, we reported STIP underlying earnings of $10.9 billion and STIP free cash flow of $10.8 billion. This is against a backdrop of higher than planned iron ore and copper prices. Operationally, we achieved slightly lower than expected production, reflecting equipment failures, extended downtime and safety-related disruptions. We also had a build in our working capital in 2023, impacting our cash flow performance. Overall, our reported 2023 financial results were above plan, albeit below target on a flexed basis, resulting in an outcome of 45% of maximum.\n\nThe strategic component of the STIP scorecard includes four separate measures. Progress has been made in each area resulting in an overall outcome of 67% of maximum. The outcome against our 'impeccable ESG' measure, which includes safety, was above target for the year. 2023 was a fatality-free year, but we regrettably recorded three permanent damage injuries (PDIs) at our sites in Diavik, Guinea and Kennecott. We continue to believe all incidents and injuries are preventable and we remain focused on identifying, managing and, where possible, eliminating risks. As a result of these PDIs, the result for the all-injury frequency rate component has been capped at 50% of maximum.\n\nProgress on decarbonisation and the approval of specific abatement projects accelerated over the year as we continued to shape our roadmap to our 2030 ambition. During the year, we critically reviewed our project portfolio, leading to project commitments equivalent to a 1.9Mt reduction in our expected 2030 emissions.\n\nOur people and culture measures include a gender diversity element and while we added 1,456 women to the workforce the outcome was below the stretching target set for 2023, with room for improvement in 2024. The delivery of our everyday respect learning reached more than 34,000 employees in 2023, which is above our outstanding range.\n\nOverall performance against the 'excel in development' measure was above target for the year, reflecting exciting progress in exploration and studies, and continued strong delivery across several projects despite some challenges during the year.\n\nThe social licence measure provides an indication of how we are perceived by our community of stakeholders. In 2023, our global reputation score remained broadly consistent with our 2022 baseline, resulting in a target outcome.\n\nThe Committee did not apply the individual multiplier for either of the Executive Directors but it has been selectively applied to some Executive Committee members. Further details on each component of the STIP scorecard outcomes, the individual performance and STIP outcomes for the Executive Directors can be found on pages 129-132.\n\n## Long-term incentive plan\n\nThe performance period for the 2019 Performance Share Award (PSA) concluded in December 2023 and awards will vest on 22 February 2024. The vesting outcome of the 2019 PSA is 94.1% based on our total shareholder return (TSR) of 103.4% over this five-year cycle. This level of TSR performance compares favourably against our mining peers and broader global corporates. The Committee considered the vesting outcome in the context of underlying business performance and the consequence management framework, and was satisfied the outcome was fair and representative of the shareholder experience.\n\n## Remuneration Policy\n\nIn accordance with the triennial policy cycle, we will be submitting our 2024 Remuneration Policy (the new Policy) to shareholders for their approval at our 2024 annual general meetings (AGMs). Changes being made to our Remuneration Policy (the current Policy) are summarised on page 115 with a full version of the new Policy on pages 119-126.\n\nThe Committee fully understands stakeholder expectations that the remuneration of executives should be linked to balanced financial and non -financial performance outcomes, appropriately governed and aligned with delivery against our strategy, supported by sustainable long -term value creation. With these elements in mind, the Committee has undertaken a comprehensive review of our current Policy with primary considerations including:",

        "page_content": "- -Competitive advantage: Responding to climate change is critical to our long-term competitive advantage and value creation. There can be an inherent tension between decarbonisation goals and short- to medium-term financial performance. Our intent is to balance this appropriately in how we structure our long-term and shortterm incentives. Given the inherent uncertainty, we believe three-year targets are most appropriate for measuring progress against our decarbonisation goals.\n- -The global talent market: Rio Tinto competes for the best talent with the world's largest companies. We need to be competitive to retain and secure the talent required to execute our strategic ambitions.\n- -Simplify focus for our global team: Over the last decade, the complexity of our business has increased, placing greater demands on our leaders. Clear, collective targets that build alignment will reinforce the STIP changes we made last year and help our leaders maintain focus on the most critical objectives.\n\nI met with many of our shareholders and the key UK and Australian advisory bodies to discuss our proposals. I would like to thank those who took part in this consultation.\n\nWhile views inevitably vary across the stakeholder group, I was pleased to find a sizeable majority of those we met were broadly supportive of the key changes. Following this consultation, the Committee further refined and adapted the proposals in response to feedback.\n\nThe main changes proposed to our current Policy relate predominantly to the structure of future long-term incentive plan (LTIP) awards.\n\nAs part of the 2021 Policy renewal, the maximum LTIP award level was reduced from 438% to 400% of base salary, while the on-target STIP for the Chief Executive was also reduced from 120% to 100% of base salary. These reductions have impacted our market positioning relative to peers in the talent market.\n\nGiven the scale of our strategic ambition and our important role in global decarbonisation, it is vital we secure and retain the talent required to achieve our goals. Our senior executives remain highly attractive to competitors and despite this competition for talent, the Committee is seeking to maintain a measured approach to pay. US-style pay practices continue to be materially higher than in other jurisdictions and we are not seeking to match these award levels in our new Policy. Instead, we have focused on ensuring executives are aligned with similarly sized and globally complex FTSE 10 companies and mining peers.\n\nThe Committee proposes future LTIP awards to Executive Directors and other Executive Committee members are capped at 500% of base salary. This would position award levels closer to FTSE 10 peers where the median LTIP maximum award is in excess of 500% of salary, yet still materially below US pay levels. Shareholder alignment will also be enhanced via increased shareholding requirements.\n\nThe additional LTIP increment will be directly linked to the achievement of our value accretive climate change strategy. Given the scale and complexity of Rio Tinto's emissions portfolio,\n\nour decarbonisation ambitions and the multi-year timeframe for this transition, we are proposing a balanced scorecard approach with four equally weighted elements. This will include input and outcome metrics that incentivise long-term value creation and sustained medium-term performance across multiple performance cycles. Both the scorecard and relative TSR will be measured over three years and awards will be subject to a further two-year holding period. This means that executives will continue to only realise value from awards after five years, consistent with the previous structure. The application of leaver and recovery provisions (malus and clawback) will remain unchanged.  This time horizon is consistent with mainstream FTSE practices in the UK, where just under 80% of the Group's shares are listed and is also aligned with the UK Corporate Governance Code . While practice on the length of performance periods is more mixed in Australia, the overall time horizon of five years remains towards the upper-end of broader ASX practice.\n\nUltimately the Committee concluded that a three-year performance period was more appropriate as it enables the setting of more robust and tangible targets for the decarbonisation scorecard where immediate action is required but long-term visibility is limited. It also provides flexibility to cascade the plan to less senior participants on more consistent terms. Relative TSR performance will be measured over the same period for simplicity.  Extensive modelling demonstrated that the change in TSR performance did not create a material difference in outcomes. Overall we continue to have a remuneration structure that is more heavily weighted to long-term incentives than many of our peers. Further details are set out on pages 134-135.\n\nThe Committee recognises the progress of our decarbonisation strategy will need to be closely monitored to inform how we set our targets and assess performance under this part of the LTIP award. To support this, the Committee will ensure input is obtained from subject matter experts within the business and other Board committees. We also commit to providing enhanced disclosure and independent verification so shareholders can fully understand the basis of any awards vesting. 80% of our LTIP will be driven by relative TSR to align with the interests of shareholders.\n\nThe Committee strongly believes our proposals will ensure our executive remuneration arrangements incentivise the delivery of our ambitious strategy with a balanced focus on the short- and long-term. This will also align our reward outcomes with Group performance and shareholder experience. I will continue to proactively engage with shareholders on this subject.\n\n## Implementation for 2024\n\nDuring 2023, the Committee considered extensive benchmarking as part of our new Policy, which shaped our remuneration decisions for 2024. In the shareholder consultations we illustrated material gaps which the Policy changes are aimed at reducing.\n\nThe STIP structure introduced in 2023 will be broadly maintained for 2024; however the\n\nfinancial metrics have been refined by replacing earnings with underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA). This is a key measure of our underlying financial performance and is well understood by both internal and external stakeholders.\n\n## Executive changes\n\nWe welcomed J\u00e9r\u00f4me P\u00e9cresse to the role of Chief Executive Aluminium in October 2023. J\u00e9r\u00f4me was appointed on terms consistent with our current Policy, and details of his terms are included on page 138.\n\nIn June 2023, Ivan Vella resigned from his role as Chief Executive Aluminium, stepping down from the Executive Committee. Ivan was due to leave Rio Tinto in December 2023; however his employment was terminated on 15 November 2023 for actions that did not follow Rio Tinto's requirements for the acceptable management of confidential information. The Committee is continuing to review this matter and will apply the consequence management framework as part of its review.\n\n## People\n\nFrom 2023, the remit of the Committee increased to include talent, capability, and diversity and culture, reflecting the everincreasing importance of these areas and our commitment to building a more inclusive culture.\n\nDuring the year, we worked with the Executive Committee to set the direction and tone for a workplace culture that aligns with our purpose, reflects our values, and supports the delivery of our strategy. To that end, we supported the implementation of a new performance management framework that places as much emphasis on how results are delivered as it does on what is achieved. This further builds on our decision to change the STIP scorecard to apply consistently across 26,000 colleagues.\n\nThe Committee monitored culture progression through visits to our sites and offices, operational deep-dives, and management presentations, considering trends and findings from our biannual engagement survey, succession and talent plans for our most senior roles as well as our ability to attract and retain a diverse workforce. The overall representation of women in our business remains a key aspect of our broader agenda on diversity and inclusion and will continue to be an area of focus in 2024.\n\n## Pay in the broader context\n\nOur focus on pay equity is evident in our gender pay metrics. We have made progress toward eradicating any equal pay and gender pay gap. Further details on equal pay, gender pay gap, and a wider discussion on diversity and inclusion, are provided in the ESG section of this report on pages 73-74.\n\nAs always, I welcome shareholder feedback and comments on our 2023 Directors' Remuneration report.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sam Laidlaw\n\nPeople & Remuneration Committee Chair\n\n21 February 2024",

that participate in the STIP have one Group scorecard rather than the diversified scorecards previously used. The metrics in the STIP design were chosen to drive the implementation of our strategy and are based around our areas of focus: our four objectives together with the delivery of strong financial performance and accelerating our culture change.\n\nThe PSA is targeted at our most senior leaders, with consistent metrics applied for all participants. The award is intended to capture how we create sustainable value for our shareholders over the longer term.  For many years, LTIP awards have been primarily based on relative TSR performance against both sector peers and the wider market. For 2024, alongside TSR, we are introducing a scorecard linked to the Group's long-term decarbonisation agenda. We are aware of our responsibility in this area and the positive impact of decarbonisation. Given the scale and complexity of our emissions portfolio, a balanced scorecard approach has been developed that focuses on input and outcome metrics.\n\n|                          | Incentive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Reflection in scorecard                                                  |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Strategic priorities                                                     |\n| STIP                     | Focuses on 'how' we do things as well as 'what' we achieve as a critical lever of accelerating our culture  change and building an inclusive workplace environment.                                                                                                                                                                                  | People and culture                                                       |\n|                          | Measures progress in relation to exploration, studies and project execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Excel in development STIP                                                |\n|                          | Safety in all its aspects remains a key priority alongside progressing the work on our decarbonisation  The new decarbonisation scorecard in the LTIP is structured around our multi-year and ambitious  decarbonisation strategy, with a focus on a combination of offensive and defensive metrics to incentivise  long-term competitive advantage. | Impeccable ESG STIP / LTIP pathways towards achieving our 2030 ambition. |\n| Social licence           | Measures our progress in building trust and meaningful relationships with our community of stakeholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | STIP                                                                     |\n|                          | Focuses on achievement of financial plan commitments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Best operator -

        "page_content": "## People & Remuneration Committee Chair Q&A\n\n## How does the new Policy support Rio Tinto's strategy?\n\n## Have the changes made to STIP last year been effective?\n\nWe have a clear strategy to build a stronger business by focusing on four objectives, which will help improve our productivity, reduce capital intensity and assist us in becoming a partner of choice for a range of stakeholders globally.\n\nAlthough our existing framework remains broadly fit for purpose, the Committee has identified a number of refinements to better align remuneration with these strategic priorities, including an increased focus on decarbonisation. The Committee is also proposing a range of simplifications to ensure our remuneration arrangements are appropriate and allow us to be competitive in the global talent market.\n\n## How do incentives support Rio Tinto's low-carbon transition agenda?\n\n## Why aren't you including Scope 3 emissions?\n\nClimate change and the low-carbon transition are at the heart of our strategy. The Committee recognises the importance of including ESG metrics in our incentives, alongside a continued focus on operational and financial performance to deliver long-term shareholder returns.\n\nImpeccable ESG is a significant part of our STIP scorecard, with an increased focus on achieving our decarbonisation ambitions while maintaining a material focus on continued safety performance.\n\nIn recognition of the long-term nature of the carbon journey, the Committee believes now is the right time to introduce decarbonisation metrics into the long-term incentives, by linking the additional PSA opportunity to the execution of our value accretive climate change strategy.\n\nMeasuring and incentivising Scope 3 emissions is inevitably challenging. These emissions are primarily from our customers in Asia, processing our iron ore into steel, and bauxite into aluminium, so our level of control is limited. The best way to tackle these emissions is to work in partnerships to develop the technologies needed to produce low-carbon metals and minerals.\n\nWhile Scope 3 emissions are not within our direct control and are not specifically measured under the incentive schemes, the breadth of the decarbonisation scorecard for the PSA, particularly the focus on transition strategy and R&D, will ensure focus is given to developing new technologies that may support the longer-term reduction of Scope 3 emissions.\n\n## What is the rationale for increasing the PSA opportunity?\n\nIn recent years we have reduced executive pay. Meanwhile, our UK and Australian competitors have increased pay for executives. Our target pay is no longer competitive and, after years of good retention, we are starting to lose executives and may be at risk of losing more after having significant invested in their development. Given the scale of our strategic ambition, it is vital that we secure, retain and attract the talent required to achieve our goals. Increasing the PSA opportunity moves us closer to our competitors' pay levels, in a way that is only realised with sustained long-term performance, enabling a focus on our decarbonisation strategy for competitive advantage. Further, we are requiring that the increased opportunity be added to mandatory shareholding requirements, increasing it by 100% of base salary for all executives.\n\n## Why are you moving to a three-year performance period for the PSA?\n\n## How do the Policy proposals align executives with the wider workforce?\n\nThe use of a three-year performance period aligns our approach with typical market practice in the UK and the US while in Australia this approach is used by around one-third of larger companies. The inclusion of a two-year holding period will mean awards will continue to be released only after five years subject to achievement of the relevant performance conditions. The combined five-year time horizon aligns with UK market practice and is longer than most US and Australian companies. Participants will also continue to be strongly aligned with shareholders via increased share ownership requirements.\n\nThe PSA is a critical tool for retaining, incentivising and motivating staff at many levels of management. The Committee believe that a three-year time horizon will be more tangible to participants below the Executive Committee and will therefore increase the competitiveness of the package and maximise the effectiveness of the PSA.\n\nThe new Policy maintains the strong alignment of the current policy between executive reward and reward in the broader organisation.\n\nThe approach to base salary is consistent across the organisation. No changes are proposed to benefits, keeping executive pensions in line with the broader employee population.\n\nThe STIP applies in a consistent manner across a population of 26,000 eligible employees, while the PSA objectives ensure senior leaders are focused on creating sustainable long-term value for our shareholders.\n\n## CEO total remuneration at target\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, we undertook a detailed review of incentives which resulted in the introduction of a much simpler STIP design for the approximately 26,000 employees that participate in the STIP, with clearer alignment to our strategy. The STIP targets help to make our goals relevant to day-to-day actions, and the level of engagement from participants over the past year has been encouraging.\n\nFor 2024, we are maintaining this design and are taking the opportunity to refine the financial metrics by replacing the current earnings measure with EBITDA. This is a key measure of our underlying financial performance that is less subject to adjustment and well understood by both internal and external stakeholders.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Policy\n\n## Remuneration Policy introduction\n\nThis Policy applies to our Executive and Non-Executive Directors and to the Chair. In accordance with Australian law, it also sets out the broad policy principles that apply to members of the Executive Committee who are not directors.\n\nOur Policy is binding only in so far as it relates to directors. Therefore, implementing this Policy for executives who are not directors may vary from that of the Executive Directors.\n\nIn determining the new Policy, the Committee followed a robust process, which included multiple discussions and engagement with investors and proxy advisers regarding the content of the Policy, taking into account the needs of the business and evolving market and best practice. The Committee considered input from both management and our independent advisers while ensuring that conflicts of interest were appropriately managed.\n\nThe overall structure of the new Policy remains broadly unchanged from the Policy previously approved by shareholders in 2021. Updates to the Policy largely reflect strategic focus, evolving corporate governance and market practice, with changes being made to aid the operation of the Policy, including refinements to incentive measures proposed for 2024. The key changes to the Policy include increasing the LTIP maximum award to 500% of salary (from 400%) to drive the decarbonisation agenda, and increasing share ownership requirements.\n\n## Our remuneration policies, principles and practices\n\nOur values of care, courage and curiosity reflect who we are and what we stand for as a business. They guide the Committee in its decisionmaking and are foundational to our remuneration-related policies, principles and practices.\n\nOur first priority is to allocate remuneration resources wisely. We want our pay policies to be regarded as fair by employees and shareholders alike to reward both short and long-term performance and to reinforce the values and collective behaviours that drive sustainable performance. Although we believe that our Policy is fit for purpose, the Committee retains the discretion to override any unforeseen and inappropriate formulaic outcomes.\n\nPeople with high quality skillsets, who are capable of managing and growing the business sustainably, are essential to delivering on our strategic objectives. Rio Tinto operates in global markets where it competes for talented executives in a limited pool. Our remuneration strategy is therefore designed to attract and retain the people we need. We recognise remuneration represents just one of the factors that encourages the attraction and retention of talent. We also seek to engage our employees over the long-term, to foster diversity, to offer a caring and respectful work environment, to provide challenging work as well as opportunities to build capability. Our people strategy is underpinned by our commitment to safety and our core values.\n\n## Competitive remuneration linked to performance and shareholder value creation\n\nWe link remuneration to performance targets over both the shortand long-term, to ensure executive rewards align to both short-term priorities and long-term sustainable growth in shareholder value. In order to assess the competitiveness of the packages we offer, we benchmark ourselves against other international mining and natural resources companies, and companies in the FTSE 30 (excluding financial services) and global industrials of comparable size, which typically have similar global reach and complexity.\n\nThe outcomes of these benchmarking exercises form just part of our consideration of the appropriate level of remuneration packages. The actual outcome will depend on both business and individual performance and behaviours.\n\nWe take salary increases in the broader employee population into account in determining any change to the base salary of executives and consult with shareholders on the design of our short- and longterm incentive plans to ensure they are aligned with shareholder interests and priorities. We do not formally consult with our employees on the Policy, but approximately 60% of the workforce are shareholders through participation in our employee share plans and therefore have the right to vote on the Remuneration report. Employees are invited to ask questions or express opinions through our normal employee communication channels. Our employee engagement surveys in 2023 were completed by an average of 38,500 employees.\n\nPerformance under the STIP is measured over one year based on a balanced scorecard including strategic and financial metrics. We recognise the importance of ensuring targets are achieved in the right way, aligned to our values and consider this when determining STIP outcomes. 50% of the STIP is normally deferred into shares that vest after three years.\n\nPerformance under the LTIP is measured over three years (for PSA awards made from 2024) and awards are typically delivered in shares together with cumulative dividends. Awards with a three-year performance period are also subject to a holding period of a further two years.\n\nOur share ownership policy requires executives to build up and maintain a material shareholding in the company as described in the Implementation report.\n\n## Alignment with the UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe UK Corporate Governance Code principles for developing a remuneration policy have been addressed as follows:\n\n| Principle             | Focus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Clarity               | Our Policy is set out in a fully transparent manner.

        "page_content": "## Executive remuneration structure - Policy table\n\nThe Policy set out on the following pages is designed to provide a total remuneration package that is appropriately balanced between fixed and variable components, with an emphasis on long-term variable pay. The remuneration structure for executives, including the relationship between each element of remuneration and Group performance, is summarised below.\n\nFurther details on the key performance indicators (KPIs) used to assess Group performance are provided in the Strategic report on pages 20-22.\n\nAny commitment made before this Policy takes effect or before an executive became or becomes a director will be honoured even if it is not consistent with this or any subsequent Policy.\n\n## Remuneration arrangements - Fixed\n\n## Base salary\n\n## Link to Group performance and strategy\n\n- - We pay competitive salaries to hire, motivate and retain highly competent executives from a global talent pool.\n\n## Operation\n\n- - Base salary is the main fixed element of the remuneration package.\n- - Base salaries are reviewed annually. We determine any increases based on Group and individual performance, global economic conditions, role responsibilities, an assessment against relevant comparator groups and internal relativities. Any increase is generally aligned with the average base salary increases applying to the broader employee population unless there were significant changes to an individual's role and/or responsibilities during the year. Such changes may include a promotion or increase in responsibility or where the executive's base salary is significantly below market positioning.\n- - Benchmarking is undertaken periodically but not annually, and our intention is to apply judgement in evaluating market data.\n\n## Pension or superannuation\n\n## Link to Group performance and strategy\n\n- - We provide competitive post-employment benefits in a cost-efficient manner in order to hire and retain.\n\n## Operation\n\n- - Employment benefits typically include participation in a pension plan, superannuation fund, or a cash allowance to contribute to a personal pension or superannuation fund, which are aligned with the arrangements for the broader workforce in the country of employment.\n- - The maximum annual benefit is currently capped at 14% of base salary but may be adjusted to reflect changes in arrangements for the wider employee population.\n\n## Other benefits\n\n## Link to Group performance and strategy\n\n- - We provide competitive other benefits in a cost-efficient manner in order to hire and retain.\n\n## Operation\n\n- - Other benefits may include, but are not limited to, private healthcare cover for the executive and their dependants, life insurance, accident insurance, professional advice, participation in local flexible benefit programs and certain other minor benefits (including modest retirement gifts in applicable circumstances, occasional spouse travel in support of the business, any Rio Tinto business expenses which are deemed to be taxable, and any resulting tax on the benefits).\n- - Secondment, relocation and localisation benefits, including payment of transfer allowances, may also be made to and on behalf of executives living outside their home country.\n- - Given the nature and variety of the items that make up benefits, there is no formal maximum level of company contribution.\n\n## Remuneration arrangements - Short-term performance-related (at risk)\n\n## Short-term incentive plan\n\n## Link to Group performance and strategy\n\n- - STIP focuses participants on achieving demanding annual performance goals, which are based on the Group's priorities, in pursuit of the creation of sustainable value for our stakeholders.\n- - We require that sustainable business practices are adhered to, particularly in the context of safety and ESG.\n- - We consider the individual performance of our executives against our values. The Way We Work outlines how we deliver both our purpose and strategy. It makes clear how all employees are expected to behave, in accordance with our values of care, courage and curiosity.\n\n## Operation\n\n- - The level of award for threshold performance is normally set at either nil or 25% of maximum, but may be adapted to reflect the stretch of the underlying targets.\n- - The award is normally pro-rated on a straight-line basis between threshold, target and outstanding points.\n- - The maximum award is capped at 200% of base salary for all executives. Any outcome from the formulaic STIP calculation is subject to discretion by the Committee.\n- - A scorecard based on the Group's priorities is established at the commencement of the financial year. The measures and the relative weightings are selected by the Committee in order to drive business performance for the current year, including the achievement of strategic and financial business outcomes that are priorities for the financial year in question. At least 50% of the measures will relate to financial performance, a significant component will relate to safety performance and any work-related fatality will have a material impact on the STIP result for all executives.\n- - At the beginning of each year, we expect to disclose the measures and weightings only, with targets deemed commercially sensitive. We intend to disclose these targets and outcomes retrospectively.\n- - An individual performance multiplier may be applied to the STIP outcome, but the final payout may not exceed 200% of salary.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration arrangements - Short-term performance-related (at risk) continued\n\n## Operation continued\n\n- - In making its year-end determination of STIP awards, the Committee seeks to ensure that actual performance is directly comparable to the targets set at the beginning of the year. This may result in adjustments to the targets or to the assessed results being made by the Committee (in particular to take account of events outside management's control), to ensure a like-for-like comparison. Both upward and downward adjustments can be made, with reference to principles agreed by the Committee, to ensure the outcomes are fair.\n- - Malus, clawback and suspension provisions apply and are set out later in the Policy.\n\n## Bonus deferral\n\n## Link to Group performance and strategy\n\n- Provides ongoing alignment between executives and shareholders through deferral of part of the STIP award into Rio Tinto shares.\n\n## Operation\n\n- - 50% of the STIP will normally be delivered in deferred shares (known as Bonus Deferral Awards (BDA)) with the remainder delivered in cash.\n- - BDA normally vest in the December of the third year after the end of the STIP performance year to which they relate.\n- - Dividends (or equivalents) may accrue in respect of any BDA that vest.\n- - Where permitted by the plan rules, and where the Committee so decides, awards may be made or satisfied in cash in lieu of shares. Awards are normally, but not exclusively, granted with an intention to settle in shares.\n- - BDA vest on a change of control.\n- - Malus, clawback and suspension provisions apply and are set out later in the Policy.\n\n## Remuneration arrangements -  Long-term performance-related (at risk)\n\n## Performance share awards under the long-term incentive plan\n\n## Link to Group performance and strategy\n\n- - Performance share awards (PSA) are designed to provide a simple and transparent mechanism for aligning executive reward with the execution of an effective business strategy and delivery of superior long-term shareholder returns.\n- - Award levels are set to provide substantive focus on and reward long-term performance. PSA are the most significant component within the remuneration package and are calibrated so as to ensure the overall competitiveness of the remuneration package.\n\n## Operation\n\n- - PSA are conditional share awards (or economic equivalent) that vest subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions and continued employment.\n- - The Committee will set performance conditions aligned with the Group's long-term strategic objectives for each PSA grant.\n- - For the 2024 awards, relative TSR has been retained as the primary measure as it provides an objective external assessment over a sustained period on a basis that is familiar to shareholders. In addition, metrics linked to decarbonisation have been introduced to reflect the importance of climate change and low-carbon transition to the Group's strategy.\n- - While we expect TSR and decarbonisation will remain key performance metrics, the Committee retains the discretion to adjust the performance measures and weightings as appropriate.\n- - PSA are normally only released five years after grant. From 2024, PSA are subject to a three-year performance period followed by a holding period of two years, with awards usually only released to executives five years after the award was granted.\n- - Awards have a maximum face value of 500% of base salary when granted which is currently determined using the average share price of the prior financial year. Actual annual award levels may vary for each executive.\n- - Threshold performance would result in the vesting of up to 22.5% of the award.\n- - Dividends (or equivalents) may accrue in respect of any PSA that vest.\n- - Where permitted by the plan rules, and where the Committee so decides, awards may be made or satisfied in cash in lieu of shares. Awards are normally, but not exclusively, granted with an intention to settle in shares.\n- - Awards and performance conditions may be adjusted to take account of variations of share capital and other transactions. Subject to this Policy, performance conditions may also be amended in other circumstances if the Committee considers that a changed performance condition would be a fairer measure of performance.\n- - If there is a change of control, awards will vest to the extent performance conditions are then satisfied. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, if the change of control happens prior to the vesting of the award, the number of shares that can vest will be reduced pro rata for the period from grant to change of control relative to the vesting period. The Committee may, alternatively, with agreement of an acquiring company, replace PSA with equivalent new awards over shares in the acquiring company.\n- - The Committee retains the discretion, where circumstances warrant, to amend performance conditions under the relevant plan rules. The Committee will seek to ensure that outcomes are fair and that they take account of the overall performance of the company during the performance period.\n- - Malus, clawback and suspension provisions apply and are set out later in the Policy.",

        "page_content": "## Shareholding requirements\n\n## Link to Group performance and strategy\n\n- - Shareholding requirements align executives' interests with those of shareholders.\n\n## Operation\n\n- - The Group understands the importance of and expects executives to build up and maintain a material shareholding in Rio Tinto.\n- - Executives should aim to reach a share ownership in Rio Tinto shares, which is set as a fixed number of shares with reference to the following levels:\n- - Chief Executive: 5 x base salary\n- - Chief Financial Officer: 4 x base salary\n- - Other executives: 4 x base salary\n- - From an operational perspective these requirements are converted into a fixed number of shares.  For 2024, the required holdings are as follows:\n- - Chief Executive: 120,000 Rio Tinto plc shares\n- - Chief Financial Officer: 60,000 Rio Tinto plc shares\n- - Other executives (requirement varies by individual): 46,000-54,000 Rio Tinto plc shares or 40,000-46,000 Rio Tinto Limited shares\n- - The applicable number of shares will be reviewed at least every two years to account for salary and share price movements.\n- - Executives are expected to build up their shareholding over a five-year period. Longer periods may be accepted for new appointments.\n- - Shares are treated as 'owned' once vested and where beneficial and/or legal ownership of the shares is held by the executive. A beneficial interest includes any shares for which an executive receives the benefit of ownership (such as a right to receive dividends) without directly owning the shares. Given the mandatory nature and absence of performance conditions, 50% of the unvested BDA will be treated as owned accounting for likely effects of taxation.\n- - Executive Directors are expected to continue to meet the shareholding requirements for two years after ceasing to be an Executive Director (or if the holding requirement is not met at this date, the relevant holding at the time). When considered alongside the existing leaver provisions for share awards, this will ensure that Executive Directors will remain aligned with shareholders for an extended period.\n- - The Committee retains the discretion to enforce shareholding requirements through the application of malus to unvested share awards and/ or scale back of future grants.\n\n## Consequence management framework\n\nIn 2021, the consequence management framework was introduced as a framework to assist with the application of Committee discretion and the potential recovery of incentives in exceptional circumstances.\n\nMalus, clawback and suspension provisions will apply to all STIP and LTIP awards in cash or shares. Under both the malus and clawback provisions, where the Committee determines that exceptional circumstances exist, the Committee may, at its discretion, reduce the number of shares to be received on vesting of an award, or, for a period of two years after the vesting, the end of any holding period or payment of a share or cash award, the Committee can clawback value from a participant.\n\nThe circumstances under which the Committee may exercise such discretion may include, inter alia:\n\n- - any fraud or misconduct by a participant or an exceptional event which has had, or may have, a material effect on the value or reputation of any member of the Group (excluding an exceptional event or events which have a material adverse effect on global macroeconomic conditions).\n- - an error in the Group's financial statements, which requires a material downward restatement or is otherwise material, or where information has emerged since the award date, which would have affected the size of the award granted or vested.\n- - where the Committee determines that the personal performance of a participant, of their product group or of the Group does not justify vesting or where the participant's conduct or performance has been in breach of their employment contract, any laws, rules or codes of conduct applicable to them or the standards reasonably expected of a person in their position.\n- - the performance of the company, business or undertaking in which a participant worked or works or for which they were or are directly or indirectly responsible for is found to have been misstated or subject to a material misrepresentation. Consequently, the award being granted and/or vesting has resulted in a greater number of shares than would otherwise have been the case.\n- - where any team, business area, member of the Group or profit centre in which the participant works or worked has been found guilty in connection with any regulatory investigation or has been in breach of any laws, rules or codes of conduct applicable to it or the standards reasonably expected of it.\n- - where the Committee determines that there has been material damage to the Group's social licence to operate.\n- - a catastrophic safety or environmental event or events occurring in any part of the Group.\n\nUnder the suspension provisions, the Committee may suspend the vesting or payment of an award (for up to five years) until the outcome of any internal or external investigation is concluded and may then reduce or lapse the participant's award based on the outcome of that investigation. Note that where suspension applies, the 24-month clawback period will not extend beyond the period commencing from the original vesting date or end of holding period.\n\nRemuneration delivered under this Policy is also subject to any additional malus and clawback provisions operated by the company, including but not limited to the Incentive-Based Compensation Clawback Policy adopted in compliance with the US SEC legislation requiring the clawback of incentives erroneously awarded as a result of material misstatements for up to three financial years.\n\n## Discretion\n\nThe Committee recognises the importance of ensuring that the outcomes of the Group's executive pay arrangements described in this Policy, properly reflect the Group's overall performance and risk appetite.\n\nThe Committee therefore reserves the right to review all remuneration outcomes arising from mechanistic application of performance conditions and to exercise discretion to make adjustments where such outcomes do not properly reflect underlying performance or the experience of shareholders or other stakeholders. The Committee will also be mindful of broader diversity and inclusion ambitions.\n\nThe Committee may, at its discretion, adjust and/or set different performance measures if events occur (such as a change in strategy, a material acquisition or divestment, a catastrophic safety or environmental incident, a change in control, or other unexpected event) which cause the Committee to determine that the measures are no longer appropriate or in the best interests of shareholders or other stakeholders, and that amendment is required so that the measures, as far as possible, achieve their original purpose. Such discretion will be exercised judiciously  and clearly disclosed and explained in the Implementation report.\n\nAny discretionary adjustments for directors will be disclosed in the Implementation report for the relevant financial period.",

arrangements on joining, is considered separately to the establishment of forward-looking annual remuneration  arrangements. Our approach with respect to such 'buy-outs' is to determine a reasonable level of award, on a like- for-like basis, consisting primarily of equity-based awards, but also potentially cash, taking into consideration the  quantum of forfeited awards, their performance conditions and vesting schedules. The Committee will obtain an  independent external assessment of the value of awards proposed to be bought out and retains discretion, subject to  the considerations noted above, to make such compensation arrangements as it deems necessary and appropriate to  secure the relevant executive's employment. The Committee's intention is that buy-out compensation should include,  where appropriate, performance conditions and equivalent timeframes for release. |\n| Relocation-related  support | If the Committee concludes that it is necessary and appropriate to secure an appointment, relocation-related support  and international mobility benefits may be provided, depending on the circumstances and in line with the Group's  broader approach. Any relocation arrangements will be set out in the Implementation report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n\n## Executives' service contracts and termination\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Executive Directors will be offered service contracts that can be terminated by either party with up to 12 months' notice in writing. In exceptional circumstances, an initial notice period of up to 24 months during the first two years of employment, reducing to up to 12 months thereafter, may be necessary to secure an external appointment. In some circumstances, it may also be appropriate to use fixed-term contracts for Executive Directors.\n\nOther executives are offered service contracts which can be terminated by the company with up to 12 months' notice in writing, and by the executive with up to 12 months' notice in writing.\n\nThe contracts for executives include appropriate non-compete and restrictive covenants.\n\nThe current contract terms of directors and the other executives are included in the Implementation report. The letters of appointment are available for inspection at Rio Tinto plc's registered office, and at our AGMs.\n\nExecutives may be required to go on 'Garden leave' during all or part of their notice period and may receive their base salary, STIP and other benefits during the notice period (or the cash equivalent). Where applicable, tax equalisation and other expatriate benefits will continue in accordance with the executive's prevailing terms and conditions.\n\nIf termination is a result of redundancy, the terms of the relevant local policy or practice will apply in the same way as for other employees hired in the same location.\n\nThe STIP and LTIP rules govern the entitlements that executives may have under those plans upon termination of employment, which is dependent on whether they are considered an eligible leaver or not. In general terms, an eligible leaver is an executive who leaves the Group by reason of ill-health, injury, disability (as determined by the executive's employer), retirement with company consent, redundancy, transfer of the undertaking in which the executive works, change of control of the executive's employing company, or death in service. In addition, the plan rules afford discretion to the Committee to award eligible leaver status in other circumstances.\n\nIn the case of dismissal for cause, the company can terminate employment without notice and without payment of any salary or compensation in lieu of notice. The Committee will apply the consequence management framework, and outstanding awards under any of the Group's incentive plans may be forfeited and previous awards clawed back.",

The Chair's letter of appointment from the company stipulates their duties as Chair of the Group and appointment may be terminated without liability on the part of Rio Tinto in accordance with the Group's constitutional documents dealing with retirement, disqualification from office or other vacation from office. Otherwise, their appointment may be terminated by giving 12 months' notice. Accrued fees will be paid up to the termination date with the exception of dismissal for cause. The Committee has the discretion to make a payment in lieu of notice if the Chair is not required to serve their full 12 months' notice. Should the Chair's appointment be terminated by reason of their removal as a director pursuant to a resolution of shareholders at the AGM, the company shall be liable to pay any fees accrued up to the date of any such removal.\n\nThe Non-Executive Directors' letters of appointment from the company stipulate their duties and responsibilities as directors. Each Non-Executive Director is appointed subject to their election and annual re-election by shareholders. Non-Executive Directors'\n\nappointments may be terminated by either party giving three months' notice. There are no provisions for compensation payable on termination of their appointment. The letters of appointment are available for inspection at Rio Tinto plc's registered office and at the AGM.\n\nThe current fee levels are set out in the Implementation report.\n\nAs provided for in the Rio Tinto plc Articles of Association and Rio Tinto Limited Constitution, the current maximum aggregate fees payable annually to the Non-Executive Directors (including the Chair) for serving on the Board and any committees is \u00a33 million. This current maximum aggregate amount of \u00a33 million per annum was approved by shareholders at the 2009 AGMs and it has remained unchanged during the past 15 years, during which time the size of the Board has also increased. An ordinary resolution will be proposed at the 2024 AGMs seeking shareholder approval to increase the maximum aggregate amount to \u00a34 million per annum with effect from 1 March 2024. In the event the resolution is not approved by the shareholders at the 2024 AGMs, the current maximum aggregate amount of \u00a33 million per annum will continue to apply.",

        "page_content": "## Implementation report\n\nThis Implementation report is presented to shareholders for approval at our AGMs. It outlines how our Policy was implemented in 2023 and the intended operation in 2024.\n\n## About our reporting\n\nAs our shares are listed on both the Australian Securities Exchange and London Stock Exchange, the information provided within our Remuneration report must comply with the reporting requirements of both countries.\n\nOur regulatory responsibilities impact the volume of information we provide, as well as the complexity. In Australia, we need to report on a wider group of executives, as described in the following paragraph. In addition, as set out in the summary table below, the two reporting regimes follow different methodologies for calculating remuneration.\n\nIn the UK, disclosure is required for the Board, including the Executive Directors. The Australian legislation requires disclosures in respect of 'key management personnel' (KMP), being those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group. Accordingly, our KMP comprise the Board, all product group Chief Executives and the Chief Commercial Officer.\n\nThroughout this Remuneration report, KMP are collectively referred to as 'executives'. They are listed on page 137, with details of the positions held during the year and dates of appointment to those roles.\n\nThe single total figure of remuneration table on page 129 shows remuneration for our Executive Directors, gross of tax and in the relevant currency of award or payment.\n\nIn table 1a on page 141, we report information regarding executives in accordance with Australian statutory disclosure requirements. The information is shown gross of tax and in US dollars. The remuneration details in table 1a include accounting values relating to various parts of the remuneration package, most notably LTIP awards, and require a different methodology for calculating the pension value. The figures in the single total figure of remuneration table are therefore not directly comparable with those in table 1a. Where applicable, amounts have been converted using the relevant average exchange rates included in the notes to table 1a.\n\nIn table 1b on page 142, we report the remuneration of the Chair and the Non-Executive Directors.\n\nCertain information contained within the Remuneration report is audited, as outlined on page 145.\n\n## Shareholder voting\n\nAs required under UK legislation, the new Policy will be subject to a binding vote at our 2024 AGMs. The Implementation report, together with the annual statement by the People & Remuneration Committee Chair, is subject to an advisory vote each year as required by UK legislation. Under Australian legislation, the Remuneration report as a whole is subject to an advisory vote. All remuneration-related resolutions will be voted on at the AGMs as Joint Decision Matters by Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited shareholders. An additional resolution is being put forward at the AGMs to increase the annual maximum aggregate fees payable to Non-Executive Directors from \u00a33 million to \u00a34 million.\n\n## The differing approaches explained\n\nAs well as the difference in methodology for measuring remuneration, there are also key differences in how remuneration is reported in the UK and Australia.\n\n## UK\n\n## Australia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Total remuneration\n\n## UK\n\n- - For reporting purposes, remuneration is divided into fixed and variable elements.\n- - We report remuneration in the currency it is paid; for example, where a UK executive is paid in pounds sterling, remuneration is reported in pounds sterling.\n\n## Australia\n\n- - For reporting purposes, remuneration is divided into short- and long-term elements.\n- - All remuneration is reported in US dollars, so using the previous example, the UK executives' remuneration would be converted to US dollars using the average exchange rate for the financial year (except STIP, which is converted at the year-end exchange rate).\n\nThe table below summarises the elements of each component of remuneration, as well as the significant differences in the approaches to measurement.",

The Chief Executive, Chief People Officer, Head of Reward and Head of Talent attend appropriate parts of the meetings at the invitation of the Committee Chair. No individual is in attendance during discussions about their own remuneration.\n\n## Independent advisers\n\nThe Committee has a protocol for engaging and working with remuneration consultants to ensure that 'remuneration\n\nrecommendations' (being advice relating to the elements of remuneration for KMP, as defined under the Australian Corporations Act 2001 ) are made free from undue influence by KMP to whom they may relate. We monitored compliance with these requirements throughout 2023. Deloitte, the appointed advisers to the Committee, gave declarations to the effect that any remuneration recommendations were made free from undue influence by KMP to whom they related, and the Board has received assurance from the Committee and is satisfied that this was the case.\n\nDeloitte are members of the Remuneration Consultants' Group, and voluntarily operate under its Code of Conduct (the Code) in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The Code is based upon principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity, competence, due care and confidentiality. Deloitte has confirmed that they adhered to the Code throughout 2023 for all remuneration services provided to Rio Tinto. The Code is available online at remunerationconsultantsgroup.com.\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that the Deloitte team is independent. During 2023, Deloitte's services also included attending Committee meetings, providing support on the 2024 Remuneration Policy and giving advice in relation to management proposals and shareholder consultations.\n\nDeloitte was paid $504,507 (2022: $545,620) for these services. Fees were charged on the basis of time and expenses incurred.\n\nWe received other services and publications relating to remuneration data from a range of sources. During the year, Deloitte also provided internal audit, tax compliance and other non-audit advisory services. These services were provided under separate engagement terms and the Committee is satisfied that there were no conflicts of interest.\n\n## How the Committee spent its time in 2023\n\nDuring 2023, the Committee met six times. We fulfilled our responsibilities as set out in our terms of reference including the expanded scope on the broader People agenda.\n\nOur work in 2023 included:\n\n- - Reviewing culture maturity metrics.\n- - Reviewing people development and talent management.\n- - Determining any base salary adjustments and LTIP grants for executives.\n- - Determining the targets for the 2023 STIP.\n- - Reviewing performance of the accountable executives for Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) implementation.\n- - Reviewing performance against the 2022 STIP and 2018 PSA targets, including assessing applicable adjustments.\n- - Considering shareholder feedback on the remuneration-related resolutions for the 2023 AGMs.\n- - Transitioning from EMIX Global Mining Index to the S&P Global Mining Index as a relative performance comparator group for PSA.\n- - Considering, reviewing and refining the alternate structures for the new Policy.\n- - Consulting with shareholders and proxy advisers on our new Policy proposals.\n- - Setting terms of appointment of J\u00e9r\u00f4me P\u00e9cresse, Chief Executive, Aluminium.\n- - Terminating the employment of Ivan Vella, Chief Executive, Aluminium.\n- - Further refining the consequence management framework.\n- - Reviewing executives' progress towards the Group's share ownership requirements.\n- - Reviewing the strategy and annual reports on the Group's global benefit plans.\n\n## Performance review process for executives\n\nWe conduct annual performance reviews for all executives. Our key objectives for the performance review process are to:\n\n- - Improve organisational effectiveness by creating alignment between the executive's objectives, Rio Tinto's strategy, the individual's leadership behaviours and the company's values.\n- - Provide a consistent, transparent and balanced approach to measure, recognise and reward executive performance.\n\nThe Chief Executive conducts the review for members of the Executive Committee and recommends the performance outcomes to the Committee. The Chief Executive's performance is assessed by the Chair of the Board and it is discussed and considered with the Committee and the Board. Performance reviews for all executives took place in 2023 and early 2024.",

Any impact of share price movement over the vesting period is shown under the share price appreciation column. The increase in values for LTIP award vesting for the Chief Executive reflects a full year grant in 2019 compared to a pro-rated grant in 2018.\n\nThe 2023 face value and the share price appreciation figures shown above are estimates of both the number of shares that will ultimately vest and the share price on vesting. Once actual values are known these estimates will be restated in the following year.

Above-plan commodity prices have continued to provide us with an uplift in financial performance: the iron ore realised price of $100 per wet metric tonne (wmt) being 11% higher than plan; the copper price 4% higher than plan.\n\nFlexed performance to remove the impact of commodity prices and foreign exchange rates gives us an indication of underlying business performance. Key drivers of flexed performance are reflected in lower than planned production volumes as a result of the overland conveyor belt failure and extended smelter shut down at Kennecott, the two furnaces that remain offline following the two process safety incidents at Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec Operations (RTIT) in June and July, and the disruptions caused from the forest fires at Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) in June.\n\nOur earnings performance benefited from a number of one-off events and non-cash impacts. Conversely, our cash flow performance was impacted by a build in working capital in 2023 of $0.9 billion which was not in the plan. This mainly related to a build in inventory at Kennecott following the extended smelter rebuild and higher working capital at RTIT, reflective of weaker market conditions.\n\nBased on these factors, the flexed component is below target for earnings (at 34.7%) and cash flow (at 10.4%).\n\nIn line with our standard STIP principles, two downward adjustments were approved by the Committee to ensure the outcome was a fair reflection of underlying performance. These related to benefits to underlying earnings that were not reflective of performance during the year. The two adjustments were in connection with the Group's share of net interest on shareholder loans following the acquisition of the minority interest in Turquoise Hill Resources in 2022 and the update of the Group's discount rate and inflation assumptions applied to closure and other provisions, along with a resulting lower amortisation charge in the period.\n\nOutcome for financials (unflexed and flexed): below target (at 44.8%)\n\n## Commentary on Strategic measures Impeccable ESG\n\nSafety is our number one priority, and while we had zero fatalities at our managed operations in 2023, tragically four colleagues died in a plane crash while travelling to our Diavik mine in January 2024. These fatalities will be considered further when reviewing 2024 performance. In 2023, we improved our all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) performance from 0.4 to 0.37, exceeding the annual target of 0.4. Regrettably, we had three permanent damage injuries (PDIs) in Canada at Diavik, in Guinea and in the US at Kennecott. Acknowledging the PDIs, the result for the AIFR component has been capped at target.\n\nAs part of our continual improvement, we have also seen an uplift of 0.6 in our safety maturity model (SMM) assessments score, against a target improvement of 0.5, resulting in a SMM global score of 5.2. We have also\n\nexceeded the target for our GISTM implementation plans for 'extreme' and 'very high' consequence tailings facilities in 2023. We have had no incidents with off-lease tailings releases at any of our facilities.\n\nDecarbonisation measures the progress of carbon abatement projects against incremental stages of development. Climate change and the low-carbon transition is at the heart of our strategy. We have set ambitious commitments to reduce carbon emissions (CO 2 e) from our business by 50% relative to 2018 levels in 2030 and achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050.\n\nThe carbon abatement target set for 2023 was 10Mt of CO 2 e. A total of 29 projects progressed through a development stage during the year, leading to an above target performance of 12Mt CO2e abatement expected by 2030.\n\nOutcome for Impeccable ESG: Above target\n\n## Excel in development\n\nExcel in development encompasses goals focusing on exploration progression, studies progression and project execution.\n\nExploration progression develops a dynamic portfolio of projects that are rigorously prioritised and rapidly tested. Exploration progression focuses on the opportunities coming out of the exploration pipeline and moving into formal studies, including Conceptual Studies completed with a decision to hold, divest or advance to Order of Magnitude (OoM), studies advancing from Projects of Merit (PoM) to Conceptual Study (CS) phase, and studies advancing from Target Testing (TT) to PoM.\n\nSix projects in the exploration portfolio pipeline advanced from PoM to CS phase in 2023, across a large variety of ore deposits. Each project has been assigned a value of 0.5 points for the PoM to CS transition, resulting in an outstanding weighted score of three.\n\nStudies progression of six studies, significantly exceeding the target of two, obtained approval from the Investment Committee (IC) to progress from feasibility study to execution project, including North Rim Skarns Stage 1 at Kennecott Copper, AP60 smelter expansion at Aluminium, West Angelas Deposit A-West, Parker Point Stockyard Sustaining, Hope Downs 1 Sustaining and Coastal Water Supply Sustaining at Iron Ore. We have also made significant progress towards the full approval of the Simandou project in Guinea. This is the highest number of studies to progress to execution in a single year since 2012. This outstanding result provides diversified growth opportunities across commodities of Copper, Aluminium and Iron Ore.\n\nProjects execution refers to the percentage of in flight and completed projects on track against the IC plan. Throughout 2023, we made strong progress on a range of projects. Four out of eight projects finished the year within three months of the approved IC schedule, achieving the 'on track' project target of 50%, including Integrated Skarns Underground Characterisation, Western Range, Oyu Tolgoi underground and the Gove Refinery Closure projects. At the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine, the construction of the\n\nconveyor to surface works is approaching 90%, with critical path maintained and the mine schedule optimisation work completed. Both shafts 3 and 4 are expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2024. At Western Range, we made progress on bulk earthworks and on the primary crusher pad construction, and the 5-month Coarse Ore Stockpile shutdown is underway.\n\nOutcome for Excel in development: Above target\n\n## People and culture\n\nOur People and culture scorecard focuses on building everyday respect and improving gender diversity.\n\nBuilding everyday respect progressed in 2023, with deployment of the Everyday Respect training program (Building Everyday Respect through care, courage and curiosity) across our organisation. The goal of the program is to set the foundational elements of psychological safety at a Group level and to emphasise the role everyone plays in creating a psychologically safe, respectful, and inclusive work environment. Over 34,000 of our in-scope employees completed the program either through a self-paced module or face-to-face sessions. Our training completion rate target has been significantly exceeded, reaching 83.5%.\n\nGender diversity in 2023 was focused on both increasing the number of women and changing the culture to become more inclusive, the representation of women across our business remains a challenge. It will continue to be an area of high focus in 2024. The year-on-year average global increase was 1.4 percentage points, landing below our 1.5 percentage points target. The increase is distributed across all levels of the organisation with women representation amongst senior leaders increasing year on year from 28.3% to 30.1%, and representation in operations and general support functions increasing by 1.5 percentage points, from 16.2% to 17.7%.\n\nOutcome for People and culture: Above target\n\n## Social licence\n\nReputation as the social licence metric focuses on building trust and acceptance of Rio Tinto with our community of external stakeholders. The general public perception in key countries is reflected by a reputation score measured by RepTrak. The 2023 result was 58.8, within the target range of 57.9 to 59.9. This score is a weighted, global aggregate made up of results from Australia, Canada, Mongolia, New Zealand, South Africa, United Kingdom, and the US.\n\nOutcome for Social licence: At target",

The value of the shares vesting included in the single total figure of remuneration table for 2023 is an estimate, as the actual value can only be determined once the share price and final application of dividend equivalents on vesting are known.\n\nThe disclosed value is based on:\n\n- - The approved TSR outcome relative to the EMIX Global Mining Index (transitioned to S&P Global Mining Index from 1 August 2023 following the decommissioning of the EMIX on 31 July 2023) and MSCI World Index (with associated dividend equivalent shares)\n- - The average share prices for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited over the last quarter of the five-year performance period (Q4 2023).\n\nThe actual value associated with the 2019 PSA vesting will be disclosed in the 2024 Remuneration report.\n\n## Calculation of 2019 PSA vesting\n\nOur independent remuneration consultants, Deloitte, calculated performance against the TSR measures. The dual TSR measures recognise that the company competes in the global market for investors as well as within the mining sector, and rewards executives for returns over the long-term that outperform both the broader market and the mining sector.\n\n| Index                     | Threshold (22.5% of maximum)   | Maximum (100% of maximum)   | Actual TSR outperformance   | Weighting   | Vesting outcome   |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| S&P Global Mining Index 1 | Equal to Index                 | Index + 6% p.a.             | Index + 5.1% p.a.           | 50 %        | 88.2 %            |\n| MSCI World Index          | Equal to Index                 | Index + 6% p.a.             | Index + 8.6% p.a.           | 50 %        | 100 %             |\n\n| Executive Director   |   Year included in single figure | Award    | Overall vesting %   | Dividend equivalents   | Dividend equivalents (% of shares  vesting)   | Shares (including dividend equivalents)   | Share price   | PSA outcome (\u00a3'000) 1   |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------|----------|---------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------|\n| Jakob Stausholm      |                             2023 | 2019 PSA | 94.1 %              | 28,796                 | 38 %                                          | 103,708                                   | \u00a353.59        | \u00a35,558                  |\n| Peter Cunningham     |                             2023 | 2019 PSA | 94.1 %              | 2,347                  | 38 %                                          | 8,453                                     | \u00a353.59        | \u00a3453                    |\n\nFor reference, the 2018 PSA vested in full on 23 February 2023 with Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited share prices of \u00a359.83 and A$125.51 respectively (closing share price on the day prior to vesting).

Achieving the maximum outcome would be consistent with the  linear trajectory required to achieve the 2030 ambition. - The Committee will take into account the relative contribution of nature-based offsets directly associated with Rio Tinto landholdings  or those of its joint ventures when assessing performance. The contribution will be capped at 10% and for any outcome above target  the contribution from offsets will be ignored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Project delivery        | - The successful delivery of abatement projects will be fundamental to achieving our stretching decarbonisation objectives. - Working with the Decarbonisation Office the Committee have identified a number of priority decarbonisation projects for which  investment approval has been granted, or is expected to be granted in 2024. Examples of projects to be included for 2024 - 2026  performance period are the commissioning of a BioIron TM  continuous pilot plant and an electric boiler at IOC, both of which have  been noted at previous investor seminars and are further defined in our 2023 Climate Change Report. The projects included will be  planned for execution within the performance period and will typically have a duration of 1-3 years. These will be physical projects,  potentially including renewable energy project delivery, alumina process heat reductions, minerals processing solutions or projects  that support our partners with Scope 3 emissions reductions. Commercial solutions such as power purchase agreements or  procuring biofuels would not be considered in this metric. - At the end of the three-year performance period, there will be a qualitative assessment of project delivery measuring conformance to  plan for both spend and schedule. Using a pre-determined framework, each project will be assigned a score out of ten and vesting |\n| Technology  development | - Progressing towards net zero will require technology advancement and research and development breakthroughs that convert into  implemented projects. - This metric assesses Group spend committed to research and development and the successful implementation of projects that have                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Transition strategy     | - This measure will align decarbonisation activity with our value creation strategy, specifically in building new capabilities or  commitments towards new growth assets. - Three transition strategy outcomes have been identified that are significant to Group value, namely, Pacific Operations (PacOps)  decarbonisation, ELYSIS TM  implementation, and aluminium and copper recycling. Working with the Chief Scientist, each project has  been assigned a bespoke scorecard that enables a qualitative assessment of progress and performance. - At the end of the three-year performance period, each transition strategy will be assigned a score out of ten using a predetermined  framework and vesting will be determined based on the average score of the transition objectives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n\nWhile the Committee have spent considerable time ensuring that the targets are robust, challenging and in line with our strategy, it is recognised that this is a complex and evolving area. Assessment of the scorecard will inevitably require a degree of judgement to ensure that outturns are an appropriate reflection of performance. To support the Committee with their assessment, additional processes have been introduced including input from subject matter experts within the business, as well as other Board Committees, and development of a framework to scoring results. The targets under each element of the scorecard are summarised below:\n\n| Objective                                                                                                                            | LTIP  weighting   | Threshold (22.5% of maximum)                                                                                                        | Target (50% of maximum)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Maximum (100% of maximum)                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Residual emissions Reduction in residual emissions  relative to 2018 baseline                                                        | 5%                | 3.6Mt CO2e                                                                                                                          | 5.1Mt CO2e                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 6.6Mt CO2e                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Project delivery Conformance to plan for priority  decarbonisation projects                                                          | 5%                | Average score of at least six  out of ten being a maximum  deviation of 25% from planned  cost and schedule                         | Average score of at least eight out of  ten being a maximum deviation of 15%  from planned cost and schedule                                                                                                                                                                          | Average score of at least nine  out of ten being less than 10%  deviation from planned cost  and schedule                                                                                    |\n| Technology development Technology advancements and  research and development   breakthroughs that convert into  implemented projects | 5%                | 0.2% of Group revenue on  decarbonisation research and  development spend At least one project into  implementation totalling 250kt | 0.4% of Group revenue on  decarbonisation research and  development spend At least one project into  implementation totalling 500kt annual                                                                                                                                            | 0.5% of Group revenue on  decarbonisation research and  development spend At least two projects into  implementation totalling 750kt                                                         |\n| Transition strategy Alignment of decarbonisation  activity with value creation                                                       | 5%                | Average score of at least six  out of ten representing more  limited progress                                                       | Average score of at least eight out of  ten representing good progress  towards strategic goals, some areas of  outperformance, substantially  achieved or on track to deliver major  objectives, or progress with no major  failures or impacts on broader  performance of the Group | Average score of at least nine  out of ten representing  significant outperformance of  expectations, implementation  achieved or a major new  advancement with scope for  material benefits |\n\nIn disclosing the above information the Committee has sought to provide transparency of the metrics, targets and how different outcomes will be rewarded, noting that certain details within the scorecard, such as those relating to activity addressing project delivery and technology development outcomes, are considered commercially sensitive. However, further detail on the targets and outcomes will be disclosed at vesting. The Committee also recognises that, although long-term in nature, the decarbonisation strategy will inevitably evolve over time and it is in shareholders' interests for the business to remain suitably agile (eg responding to technological advancements).\n\nIn setting the above measures and targets, the Committee has been mindful to use quantitative measures where possible to ensure the targets can be assessed through formulaic vesting outcomes. This approach also provides for straight-line vesting between threshold, target and maximum outcomes, where appropriate. The Committee will retain discretion in determining vesting outcomes and where required will adjust targets or baselines in relation to any material changes to the portfolio, such as following acquisitions, divestments or closure. The use of offsets towards any measure will be limited, and in the case of the residual emissions targets, will be capped and used only towards any outcome up to target.",

        "page_content": "## Base salary\n\nBase salaries for Executive Committee members are reviewed annually by the Committee with increases generally aligned with the wider employee population in the relevant jurisdiction. Variations may occur in instances in which an individual has changed position, or the position's duties and responsibilities have been enlarged, for example as a result of a reorganisation or acquisition, or where an individual's remuneration has fallen below comparable positions in the market. As disclosed last year, Bold Baatar and Simon Trott received a higher salary increase in 2023 to reflect their market positioning.\n\n## Short-term incentive plan\n\n## Overview of 2023 short-term incentive plan weightings and measures\n\nThe measures and weightings used to determine short-term incentive plan (STIP) awards for executives in 2023 are set out on page 130.\n\nThe 2023 STIP awards are detailed in the table below.\n\n|                 |                                |                         | Percentage of:       | Percentage of:         |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|\n|                 | 2023 STIP award  (% of salary) | 2023 STIP award  ('000) | Maximum STIP awarded | Maximum STIP forfeited |\n| Bold Baatar     | 140%                           | \u00a3941                    | 70%                  | 30%                    |\n| Alfredo Barrios | 84%                            | SGD981                  | 42%                  | 58%                    |\n| Sinead Kaufman  | 112%                           | A$1,188                 | 56%                  | 44%                    |\n| J\u00e9r\u00f4me P\u00e9cresse | 112%                           | C$258                   | 56%                  | 44%                    |\n| Simon Trott     | 140%                           | A$1,650                 | 70%                  | 30%                    |\n\n## Share ownership\n\nThe following table shows the share ownership level for other KMP as a multiple of base salary.\n\n|                 |   Share ownership level at  31 December 2023 as a  multiple of base salary |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bold Baatar     |                                                                        5.9 |\n| Alfredo Barrios |                                                                        4.5 |\n| Sinead Kaufman  |                                                                        6.2 |\n| J\u00e9r\u00f4me P\u00e9cresse |                                                                        0.4 |\n| Simon Trott     |                                                                        5.4 |\n\nShare ownership level is calculated using the market price of Rio Tinto shares on 31 December 2023, and we define 'share ownership' in our Policy.\n\n## Service contracts\n\nAlongside the new Policy, any newly signed service contracts can be terminated by the company or executive with 12 months' notice in writing, or immediately by the company by paying base salary only in lieu of any unexpired notice.\n\n## Other KMP appointments\n\nAll newly appointed executives have received a remuneration package that is aligned with our Policy and is comprised of base salary in line with market benchmarks; target STIP opportunity of 100% of base salary (with maximum opportunity of 200% of base salary); LTIP awards of up to 400% of base salary; company pension contributions of 14% of base salary; and other benefits such as company-provided healthcare coverage, and continued eligibility to participate in the all-employee share plans. A minimum shareholding requirement of 300% of base salary applies on appointment to be built up over subsequent years.\n\n## Executive departures\n\nIvan Vella ceased to be a KMP on 23 October 2023 and his employment was terminated on 15 November 2023 as an ineligible leaver. All subsisting variable remuneration was therefore lapsed and only statutory payments for accrued leave were made following termination.\n\n## Broader employee disclosures\n\n## Chief Executive pay ratio\n\nThe ratio of the single total figure of remuneration for the Chief Executive to the lower quartile, median and upper quartile Rio Tinto Australian employee population for 2023 is set out in the table below.\n\n|         |   Lower quartile |   Median |   Upper quartile |\n|---------|------------------|----------|------------------|\n| 2023    |              116 |       97 |               81 |\n| 2022  1 |               76 |       52 |               42 |\n\nThe median CEO pay ratio of 97:1 is higher than last year, primarily due to the vesting of Jakob's first full LTIP award from 2019 which vested at 94.1% at the end of the 2023 performance year. The Committee continues to be mindful of the relationship between executive remuneration and that of our broader workforce. The Committee's decision-making will continue to be supported by regular and detailed reporting on these matters.\n\n## Relative spend on remuneration\n\nThe table below shows our relative spend on remuneration across our global employee population and distributions to shareholders in the year.

Change in salary and fees compared on an annualised basis to smooth the impact of part-year appointments.\n- 2.

The percentage change in annual incentive compares the incentive outcomes for the 2022 performance year to those for the 2023 performance year.\n- 4. Increase in fees are representative of 2023 being the first full year post appointment in 2022 and reduction in benefits reflective of non-recurring benefits from appointment in 2022.\n- 5. No prior year data as appointed as a Non-Executive Director in 2023.\n- 6. Since Rio Tinto plc, the statutory entity for which this disclosure is required, does not have any employees, we have included voluntary disclosure of the change in employee pay for our Australian employees who make up more than 40% of our employee population.\n- '-' in the table signifies no reported change as a result of the absence of comparable data.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors\n\n## What we paid our Chair and Non-Executive Directors\n\n## Positions held\n\nWe list the Non-Executive Directors who held office during 2023 below.

No post-employment, termination or share-based payments were made. Statutory minimum superannuation contributions for Non-Executive Directors are deducted from the Director's overall fee entitlements when these are required by Australian superannuation law.\n\nThe total fee and allowance payments made to the Chair and Non-Executive Directors in 2023 were within the current maximum aggregate annual amount of \u00a33 million set out in the Group's constitutional documents, approved by shareholders at the 2009 AGMs. An ordinary resolution will be proposed at the 2024 AGMs seeking shareholder approval to increase the maximum aggregate annual amount to \u00a34 million with effect from 1 March 2024.\n\n## Share ownership policy for Non-Executive Directors\n\nRio Tinto has a policy that encourages Non-Executive Directors to build up a shareholding equal in value to one year's base fee within three years of their appointment. Details of Non-Executive Directors' share interests in the Group, including total holdings, are set out in table 2 on page 142.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors' share ownership\n\nThe Non-Executive Directors' shareholdings are calculated using the market price of Rio Tinto shares on 31 December 2023:\n\n| Director              |   Share ownership level at 31 December 2023 as a multiple of base fee | Share ownership level at 31 December 2022 as a multiple of base fee   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dominic Barton        |                                                                   1.2 | 1.1                                                                   |\n| Megan Clark 1         |                                                                   4.4 | 3.9                                                                   |\n| Dean Dalla Valle 2    |                                                                   0   | N/A                                                                   |\n| Simon Henry           |                                                                   1.2 | 0.9                                                                   |\n| Kaisa Hietala 3       |                                                                   0.3 | N/A                                                                   |\n| Sam Laidlaw           |                                                                   4.6 | 4.6                                                                   |\n| Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz 2 |                                                                   1   | N/A                                                                   |\n| Simon McKeon          |                                                                   7.7 | 6.8                                                                   |\n| Jennifer Nason        |                                                                   1.1 | 1.1                                                                   |\n| Joc O'Rourke 4        |                                                                   0   | N/A                                                                   |\n| Ben Wyatt             |                                                                   0.3 | 0.2                                                                   |\n| Ngaire Woods          |                                                                   0.9 | 0.3                                                                   |\n\n- 1.

Rio Tinto's share plans are therefore part of its standard remuneration practice, to encourage employee share ownership and create alignment with the shareholder experience. Executives may participate in broad-based share plans that are available to Group employees generally and to which performance conditions do not apply.\n\nA global employee share purchase plan is normally offered to all eligible employees unless there are local jurisdictional restrictions. Under the plan, employees may acquire shares up to the value of $5,250 (or equivalent in other currencies) per year or capped at 15% of their base salary if lower. Each share purchased will be matched by the company, providing the participant holds the shares, and is still employed, at the end of the three-year vesting period.\n\nApproximately 34,000 of our employees (63% of those eligible) are shareholders as a result of participating in these plans. In the UK, these arrangements are partially delivered through the UK Share Plan which is a UK tax approved arrangement. Under this plan, eligible participants may also receive an annual award of Free Shares up to the limits prescribed under UK tax legislation.\n\n## Management Share Awards\n\nThe Management Share Awards (MSA) are designed to help the Group attract the best staff in a competitive labour market, and to retain key individuals as we deliver our long-term strategy. MSA are conditional awards that are not subject to a performance condition. They vest at the end of three years subject to continued employment. Shares to satisfy the awards are bought in the market or reissued from Treasury. Executive Committee members are not eligible to be granted MSA after appointment.\n\n## Shareholder voting\n\nIn the table below, we set out the results of the remuneration-related resolutions voted on at the Group's 2023 AGMs.\n\n| Resolution                                                             | Votes for   | Votes against   | Votes withheld 1   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| Approval of the Directors  Remuneration report:  Implementation report | 96%         | 4%              | 21,075,873         |\n| Approval of the Remuneration Policy (2021)                             | 97%         | 3%              | 22,272,424         |\n| Approval of the Directors' Remuneration report                         | 96%         | 4%              | 21,100,383         |\n\n- 1.

'Table 1a - Executives' remuneration' is reported in US$ using A$1 = US$0.66441; \u00a31 = US$1.24329; C$1 = US$0.7410; S$1 = US$0.74464 which are year-to-date average rates, except for cash bonuses which use A$1 = US$0.68605; \u00a31 = US$1.2770; C$1 = US$0.75835; S$1 = US$0.75956 31 December 2023 year-end rates.\n- 2. 'Cash bonus' relates to the cash portion of the 2023 STIP award to be paid in March 2024.\n- 3. 'Other cash-based benefits' typically include cash in lieu of company pension or superannuation contributions. For J\u00e9r\u00f4me P\u00e9cresse this also includes the international transfer allowance paid as per the company standards upon J\u00e9r\u00f4me's relocation from France to Canada.\n- 4. 'Non-monetary benefits' for executives typically include healthcare coverage, professional tax compliance services/advice, flexible perquisites and, where applicable, leave accruals and mobility related benefits.\n- 5. The 'Value of share-based awards' has been determined in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS2 \"Share-based Payment\". The fair value of awards granted as MSA, BDA and PSA have been calculated at their dates of grant using valuation models provided by external consultants, Lane Clark and Peacock LLP, including an independent Monte Carlo valuation model, which take into account the constraints on vesting attached to these awards. Further details of the valuation methods and assumptions used for these awards are included in note 27 (Share-based Payments) in the financial statements. The fair value of other share-based awards is measured at the purchase cost of the shares from the market. The share-based values disclosed in this table do not reflect amounts actually paid in 2023 or the value of shares that will ultimately vest.\n- 6. 'BDA' represents the portion of the 2020-2023 STIP awards deferred into Rio Tinto shares.\n- 7. 'Others' includes the Global Employee Share Plan (myShare) and the UK Share Plan.\n- 8. The figures for Ivan Vella reflect his remuneration up until he ceased to be a KMP on 23 October 2023. His total remuneration up until his employment termination date of 15 November 2023 was ($268,000). The negative values for his remuneration reflect the reversal of accounting costs in relation to the lapse of share awards as a result of the termination of his employment.\n\n9.\n\nAny costs related to defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical benefits are the service costs attributable to the individual, calculated in accordance with IAS 19. The cost for\n\ndefined contribution pension plans is the amount contributed in the year by the company.\n\n- 10. 'Total remuneration' represents the disclosure of total emoluments and compensation required under the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and applicable accounting standards.\n\nFurther details in relation to aggregate compensation for executives, including directors, are included in note 29 (Directors' and key management remuneration).",

Without admitting to or denying the SEC's findings, Rio Tinto paid a $15 million civil penalty for violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act . This payment did not have a significant effect on Rio Tinto's financial position or profitability.\n- - In March 2023, we priced US$650 million of ten-year fixed rate SEC-registered debt securities and US$1.1 billion of 30-year fixed rate SEC-registered debt securities. The bonds were issued by Rio Tinto Finance (USA) plc and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited. The ten-year notes will pay a coupon of 5.000% and will mature on 9 March 2033 and the 30-year notes will pay a coupon of 5.125% and will mature on 9 March 2053.\n- - In March 2023, we announced the appointment of Dean Dalla Valle and Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz to the Board as Non-Executive Directors. Mr Dalla Valle and Ms Lloyd-Hurwitz, both Australian citizens, joined the Board on 1 June 2023.\n- - In March 2023, we announced that we and First Quantum Minerals entered into an agreement to form a joint venture that will work to unlock the development of the La Granja copper project in Peru. The transaction was expected to be completed by Q3 of 2023.\n- - In April 2023, we announced we supported Energy Resources of Australia Ltd's (ERA) plans for an Interim Entitlement Offer (IEO), which seeks to raise up to A$369 million to address funding requirements for the Ranger Rehabilitation Project in Australia's Northern Territory to the end of Q2 2024. Rio Tinto, which owns 86.3% of ERA's shares, pre-committed to subscribe for its full entitlements under the terms of the IEO, at a cost of A$319 million.\n- - In May 2023, we announced that we had published our report on payments to governments made by Rio Tinto plc and its subsidiary undertakings for the year ended 31 December 2022, as required under the UK's Report on Payments to Governments Regulations 2014 (as amended in December 2015), and it had been filed at Companies House. We paid US$10.8 billion of taxes and royalties and a further US$1.6 billion on behalf of our employees during 2022.\n- - In June 2023, we announced we will invest $1.1 billion to expand our state-of-the-art AP60 aluminium smelter equipped with low-carbon technology at Complexe Jonqui\u00e8re in Canada. The total investment includes up to $113 million of financial support from the Quebec government. This expansion, which will coincide with the gradual closure of potrooms at the Arvida smelter on the same site, will enable Rio Tinto to continue to meet customers' demands for low-carbon, high-quality aluminium for use in transportation, construction, electrical and consumer goods.\n- - In June 2023, we announced that we had an approved investment of $498 million to deliver underground development and infrastructure for an area known as the North Rim Skarn at our Kennecott operation in Utah. Production will commence in 2024 and is expected to ramp up over two years, to deliver around 250 thousand tonnes 1 of additional mined copper over the next ten years alongside open cut operations. This investment will strengthen the supply of copper in the US by increasing production from underground mining and improving the health of key assets.\n- 1. The production target of around 250 thousand tonnes of additional mined copper over the next ten years (2023 to 2033) at Kennecott was previously reported in a release to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) dated 20 June 2023 titled 'Rio Tinto invests to strengthen copper supply in US'. Rio Tinto confirms that all material assumptions underpinning that production target continue to apply and have not materially changed.",

The Directors, Group Company Secretary and Company Secretary of Rio Tinto Limited, together with employees serving as Directors of eligible subsidiaries at the Group's request, have also received similar direct indemnities. Former Directors also received indemnities for the period in which they were Directors. These are qualifying third-party indemnity provisions for the purposes of the UK Companies Act 2006 , in force during the financial year ended 31 December 2023 and up to the date of this report. During 2023, Rio Tinto paid legal costs under the terms of those indemnities for certain former Directors and officers totalling $1,878,654.\n\nQualifying pension scheme indemnity provisions (as defined by section 235 of the UK Companies Act 2006 and other applicable legal jurisdictions) were in force during the course of the financial year ended 31 December 2023 and up to the date of this Directors' report, for the benefit of trustees of the Rio Tinto Group pension and superannuation funds across various jurisdictions. No amount has been paid under any of these indemnities during the year.\n\nThe Group has agreed to pay a premium for Directors' and officers' insurance. Disclosure of the nature of the liability covered by the insurance and premium paid is subject to confidentiality requirements under the contract of insurance.\n\n## Labour relations\n\nWe also work together with our employees and their unions, and we seek constructive dialogue and fair solutions while maintaining the competitiveness of our managed operations. In 2023, we had no union industrial actions.\n\n## Employment of people with a disability\n\nWe acknowledge the systemic barriers facing people with disabilities in attaining meaningful employment. We further acknowledge the efforts necessary to fully support people with disabilities and we seek to implement the accommodations they need to fulfil their role, or an alternative role if required.\n\nOur Inclusion and Diversity Policy sets out our expectations around the behaviours needed for an inclusive and diverse workplace, where we embrace different perspectives, valuing diversity as a strength.\n\nOur Employment Policy outlines how we are committed to preventing discrimination and that we employ on the basis of job requirements and do not discriminate on grounds of disability or any other protected characteristic. It also explains how we ensure our people are trained to perform their roles. More information can be found at riotinto.com/policies.\n\nWe remain a member of the IncludeAbility Employer Network, which was set up by the Australian Human Rights Commission and aims to increase access to meaningful employment opportunities for people with a disability.

        "page_content": "## Political donations\n\nRio Tinto prohibits the use of its funds to support political candidates or parties. No donations were made by the Group to parties or political candidates during the year. At Rio Tinto, we respect every country's political process and do not get involved in political matters, nor do we make any type of payments to political parties or political candidates. In the US, in accordance with the Federal Election Campaign Act , we provide administrative support for the Rio Tinto America Political Action Committee (PAC), which was created in 1990 and encourages voluntary employee participation in the political process. All Rio Tinto America PAC employee contributions are reviewed for compliance with federal and state laws and are publicly reported in accordance with US election laws. The PAC is controlled by neither Rio Tinto nor any of its subsidiaries, but instead by a governing board of five employee members on a voluntary basis. In 2023, contributions to Rio Tinto America PAC by 12 employees amounted to $10,425 and Rio Tinto America PAC donated $17,500 in political contributions in 2023.\n\n## Government regulations\n\nOur operations around the world are subject to extensive laws and regulations imposed by local, state, provincial and federal governments. In addition to these laws, several of our operations are governed by specific agreements made with governments, some of which are enshrined in legislation.\n\nThe geographic and product diversity of our operations reduces the likelihood of any single law or government regulation having a material effect on the Group's business as a whole.\n\n## Environmental regulations\n\nRio Tinto is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries where it has operations. We measure our performance against environmental regulation by tracking and rating incidents according to their actual environmental and compliance impacts using five severity categories (very low, low, moderate, high or very high). Incidents with a consequence rating of high or very high are of a severity that requires notification to the relevant product group head and the Rio Tinto Chief Executive immediately after the incident occurring. In 2023, there were one environmental incidents at managed operations with a high impact.\n\nDuring 2023, eight managed operations incurred fines amounting to $986,968 (2022: $109,782). Details of these fines are reported in the Our approach to ESG section on page 63.\n\nAustralian corporations that exceed specific greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or energy use thresholds have obligations under the Australian The National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (NGER). All Rio Tinto entities covered under this Act have submitted their annual NGER reports by the required 31 October 2023 deadline.\n\nFurther information on the Group's environmental performance is included in the Our approach to ESG section on pages 44-58, and at riotinto.com/sustainabilityreporting.\n\n## Energy efficiency action\n\nDetails of the measures taken to increase the company's energy efficiency are reported on pages 45-58.\n\n## Energy consumption 1, 2, 3\n\n| Energy consumption in GWh                                                          | 2023    | 2022 5   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| From activities including the  combustion of fuel and the  operation of facilities | 85,463  | 84,619   |\n| From the net purchase of  electricity, heat, steam or  cooling                     | 27,421  | 25,065   |\n| Total energy consumed 4                                                            | 112,884 | 109,684  |\n\n- 2.

Rio Tinto's GHG emissions inventory is based on definitions provided by The World Resource Institute/ World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Carbon Reporting and Accounting Standard (Revised Edition) (2015).\n- 8. Rio Tinto does not report on the proportion of CO2 emissions associated with the UK and offshore area since it has no producing assets in the UK, only offices, and consequently falls below Rio Tinto's threshold level of reporting.\n- 9. Scope 1 GHG emissions are direct GHG emissions from facilities fully or partially owned or controlled by Rio Tinto (equity share basis). They include fuel use, on-site electricity generation, anode and reductant use, process emissions, land management and livestock.\n- 10. In 2023, Rio Tinto reviewed all Scope 2 emissions sources and transitioned to a dual Scope 2 reporting method. Location-based method reflects the emissions grid intensity of the location which the operation is located and includes the percentage of renewables that make up the total unadjusted grid intensity. Market-based method counts commercial decisions to purchase the unique rights to renewable energy as zero emissions and applies a residual mix factor (or similar) to the remaining MWh purchased. The residual mix factor is typically equivalent to the grid intensity with renewable attributes that have been sold removed from the factor. Scope 2 GHG emissions are GHG emissions from the electricity, heat or steam brought in from third parties (indirect emissions). Scope 2 emission factors are consistent with the Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Measurement Determination 2008 for Australian operations location-based reporting. For non-Australian operations, where possible, factors are sourced from public grid level data or electricity retailers.  Scope 2 emissions are presented on equity share basis, for market-based reporting Scope 2 includes the use of renewable electricity certificates.\n- 11. Total emissions are the sum of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. These emissions exclude indirect emissions associated with transportation and use of our products reported under Scope 3 emissions at riotinto.com.\n- 12. Historical information for copper equivalent intensity has been restated in line with the 2023 review of commodity pricing to allow comparability over time.\n- 13. Numbers restated from those originally published to ensure comparability over time using market-based method for Scope 2 reporting.\n- 14. Actual 2022 emissions. To evaluate our progress against our targets, we also disclose adjusted 2022 Scope 1 and 2 emissions on a baseline equivalent basis of 32.7Mt CO2e.\n\n## Exploration, research and development\n\nThe Group carries out exploration, research and development as described in the product group pages on pages 32-39. Exploration and evaluation costs, net of any gains and losses on disposal, generated a net loss before tax of $1,230 million (2022: $896 million). Research and development costs were $245 million (2022: $76 million).\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nDetails of the Group's financial risk management objectives and policies, and exposure to risk, are described in note 24 to the financial statements.\n\n## Dealing in Rio Tinto securities\n\nRio Tinto securities dealing policy restricts dealing in Rio Tinto securities by Directors and employees who may be in possession of inside information. These individuals must seek clearance before any proposed dealing takes place.\n\nOur policy also prohibits such persons from engaging in hedging or other arrangements that limit the economic risk in connection to Rio Tinto securities issued, or otherwise allocated, as remuneration that are either unvested, or that have vested but remain subject to a holding period. We also impose restrictions on a broader group of employees, requiring them to seek clearance before engaging in similar arrangements over any Rio Tinto securities.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\n## Financial statements\n\nThe Directors are required to prepare financial statements for each financial period that give a true and fair view of the state of the Group at the end of the financial period, together with profit or loss and cash flows for that period. This includes preparing financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards, applicable UK law ( Companies Act 2006 ), Australian law ( Corporations Act 2001 ) as amended by the ASIC class order and preparing a Remuneration report that includes the information required by Regulation 11, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended) and the Australian Corporations Act 2001 .\n\nIn addition, the UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that the Board provide a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the company's position and prospects in its external reporting.\n\nRio Tinto's management conducts extensive review and challenge in support of the Board's obligations, aiming to strike a balance between positive and negative statements and provide good linkages throughout the Annual Report .",

        "page_content": "The Directors were responsible for the preparation and approval of the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2023. They consider the Annual Report , taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable, and that it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for maintaining proper accounting records, in accordance with UK and Australian legislation. They have a general responsibility to safeguard the assets of the Group, and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are also responsible for ensuring that appropriate systems are in place to maintain and preserve the integrity of the Group's website.\n\nLegislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from current and future legislation in other jurisdictions. The work carried out by the Group's external auditors does not take into account such legislation and, accordingly, the external auditors accept no responsibility for any changes to the financial statements after they are made available on the Group's website.\n\nThe Directors, senior executives, senior financial managers and other members of staff who are required to exercise judgement while preparing the Group's financial statements, are required to conduct themselves with integrity and honesty, and in accordance with the highest ethical standards, as are all Group employees.\n\nThe Directors consider that the 2023 Annual Report presents a true and fair view and has been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, using the most appropriate accounting policies for Rio Tinto's business, and supported by reasonable judgements and estimates. The accounting policies have been consistently applied as described on pages 158-167, and Directors have received a written statement from the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer to this effect. In accordance with the internal control requirements of the Code and the ASX Principles, this written statement confirms that the declarations in the statement are founded on a sound system of risk management and internal controls, and that the system is operating effectively in all material respects in relation to financial reporting risks. Further information on Directors' responsibilities is included on page 266.\n\n## Disclosure controls and procedures\n\nThe Group maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) Rule 13a-15(e). Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Group's disclosure controls and procedures in relation to US Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of the end of the period covered by this report, and has concluded that the Group's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\n\n## Management's report on internal control over financial reporting\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. These controls, designed under the supervision of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Group's financial reporting and the preparation and presentation of financial statements for external reporting purposes, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as defined on page 158.\n\nThe Group's internal controls over financial reporting include policies and procedures designed to ensure the maintenance of records that:\n\n- - accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets,\n- - provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary, enabling the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and that receipts and expenditures are made with the authorisation of management and Directors of each of the companies, and\n- - provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of the Group's assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.\n\nDue to inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance. Similarly, these controls may not prevent or detect all misstatements, whether caused by error or fraud, within each of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited.\n\nThere were no changes to internal controls over financial reporting during the relevant period that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited.\n\nManagement's evaluation of the effectiveness of the company's internal controls over financial reporting was based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Following this evaluation, management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as at 31 December 2023.\n\n## Directors' declaration\n\nThe Directors' statement of responsibilities in relation to the Group's financial statements is set out on page 266.\n\n## Non-audit services and auditor independence\n\nDetails of the non-audit services and a statement of independence regarding the provision of non-audit services undertaken by our external auditor, including the amounts paid for non-audit services, are set out on pages 109-110 of the Directors' report.\n\nA copy of the Auditor's Independence Declaration as required under section 307C of the Corporations Act 2001 is set out on page 285.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have satisfied themselves that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Additionally, the Directors have considered longer-term viability, as described in their statement on page 80.\n\n## 2024 annual general meetings\n\nThe 2024 AGMs will be held on 4 April in London, UK and 2 May in Brisbane, Australia. Separate notices of the 2024 AGMs will be produced for the shareholders of each company.\n\n## Directors' approval statement\n\nThe Directors' report is delivered in accordance with a resolution of the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dominic Barton\n\n## Chair\n\n21 February 2024",

As our shares are listed on both the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and the London Stock Exchange (LSE), we set out how we have complied with the codes and standards of those bodies on the following pages:\n\nLondon Stock Exchange UK Corporate Governance Code (2018 version) (the UK Code), see pages 152-154.\n\nAustralian Securities Exchange ASX Corporate Governance Council's Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (4th edition) (the ASX Principles), see pages 154-156.\n\nIn addition, as explained below, as a foreign private issuer (FPI) with American depositary receipts (ADRs) listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), we need to report any significant corporate governance differences from the NYSE listing standards (NYSE Standards) followed by US companies.\n\n## Statement of compliance with the UK Code and ASX Principles\n\nThroughout 2023 and as at the date of this report, the Group has complied with all the Principles of the UK Code and the ASX Principles, and all the relevant provisions. The UK Code is available at frc.org.uk, and the ASX Principles at asx.com.au. For the purposes of ASX Listing Rule 4.10.3 and the ASX Principles, pages 91-112 of this report form our 'Corporate Governance Statement'. This statement is current as at 21 February 2024, unless otherwise indicated, and has been approved by the Board. Corporate governance documents and policies referenced can be found on our website at riotinto.com/corporategovernance.\n\n## Difference from NYSE Standards\n\nWe have reviewed the NYSE Standards and consider that our practices are broadly consistent with them, with the following exceptions where the literal requirements of the NYSE Standards are not met due to differences in corporate governance between the US, UK and Australia:\n\n- - The NYSE Standards state that US companies must have a nominating/ corporate governance committee which, in addition to identifying individuals qualified to become board members, develops and recommends to the Board a set of corporate governance principles applicable to the company. Our Nominations Committee does not develop corporate governance principles for the Board's approval. The Board itself develops such principles.\n\n- - Under US securities law and the NYSE Standards, the company is required to have an audit committee that is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of external auditors. While our Audit & Risk Committee makes recommendations to the Board on these matters, and is subject to legal and regulatory requirements on oversight of audit tenders, the ultimate responsibility for the appointment and retention of the external auditors of Rio Tinto rests with the shareholders.\n- - Under US securities law and the NYSE Standards, an audit committee is required to establish procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls and audit matters. The whistleblowing program (myVoice) enables employees to raise any concerns confidentially or anonymously. The Board has responsibility to ensure that the program is in place and to review the reports arising from its operations.\n\n## The UK Code\n\n## Board leadership and company purpose A. Making the Board effective\n\nOur Board provides effective and entrepreneurial leadership. It is collectively responsible for the stewardship and longterm success of the Group. There is a framework of prudent and effective controls that enable risk to be assessed and managed. In the Our approach to ESG section on pages 40-77 we set out how we assess our impact on wider society. See page 102 for the key activities undertaken by the Board during the year and the factors that were considered when making decisions.\n\n## B. The company's purpose, values and strategy, and alignment with culture\n\nThrough our Code of Conduct The Way We Work , the Board sets the company's purpose, values, and standards for the Group's employees. Our values are set out on page 8. The Board is committed to acting in accordance with these values, championing and embedding these in the organisation. The Board also seeks to ensure that the culture of the company is aligned with these values and standards.\n\n## C. Company performance and risk management\n\nThe Board leads the development of long-term investment plans for the company. It aims to make good quality decisions at the right time, to achieve the company's objectives, in alignment with our purpose, values and strategy. The role of the Board in establishing and monitoring the internal control environment is set out in the Audit & Risk Committee report on pages 107-110. The way in which the company manages risk is set out on pages 78-88. For information on the delegation of business to management, please refer to pages 94-95.\n\nThe formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board's decision, available at riotinto.com/corporategovernance, covers areas including: setting the Group's purpose and strategic vision;\n\nmonitoring performance of the delivery of the approved strategy; approving major investments, acquisitions and divestments; the oversight of risk and the setting of the Group's risk appetite; and reviewing the Group's governance framework.\n\n## D. Stakeholder engagement\n\nThe Chair undertakes regular engagement with our major shareholders, in addition to that carried out by the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer and the investor relations team. The committee Chairs also engage with their relevant stakeholders on any significant matters and details of any engagement are provided in the committee reports. We have mapped our key stakeholders and continually work to understand their views, and we take account of our responsibilities to our stakeholders when making business decisions. We explain more about this in our section 172(1) statement, set out on pages 96-100. We also discuss stakeholders in the Strategic report on pages 12-13 and in Our approach to ESG in this report.\n\nSimon McKeon is the designated Non-Executive Director for workforce engagement. An overview of workforce engagement during 2023 is set out on pages 96-97.\n\nAt Rio Tinto plc's AGM on 6 April 2023, Resolution 21 ('Authority to purchase Rio Tinto plc shares') was passed with less than 80% of votes in favour, and Shining Prospect (a subsidiary of the Aluminium Corporation of China (Chinalco)) voted against. Chinalco has not sold any Rio Tinto plc shares and now has a holding of over 14%, given its non-participation in Rio Tinto's significant share buyback programs. This places Chinalco close to the 14.99% holding threshold agreed with the Australian Government at the time of Chinalco's original investment in 2008.\n\n## E. Our workforce policies and practices\n\nGroup workforce policies are approved by the Board. All the policies relating to our workforce take account of the global nature of our company. Our whistleblowing process is overseen by the Board. Every member of the workforce has access to the whistleblower program (myVoice); details of this program are on page 77.\n\n## Division of responsibilities\n\n## F. The role of the Chair\n\nThe Chair leads the Board and is responsible for its overall effectiveness. He was independent on the date of his appointment and we consider he remains independent for the purposes of the Code. The Chair recognises the importance of creating a boardroom culture that encourages openness and debate and ensures constructive relations between executive and Non-Executive Directors.\n\nThe Chair is responsible for the management of the Board and its committees, Director performance, induction, training and development, succession planning, engagement with external stakeholders, and attendance by the Board at shareholder meetings.",

        "page_content": "The Chair is supported by the Senior Independent Directors, the Group Company Secretary and the Chief Executive. In line with the UK Code, the Senior Independent Director, Rio Tinto plc is responsible for acting as a sounding board for the Chair and engages with shareholders to develop a balanced understanding of their interests and concerns.\n\nFor further details, please see our Board Charter on our website, which sets out the role, responsibilities, structure, compositions and conduct of the Board, as well as the role of the Chair, the Senior Independent Director, Rio Tinto plc and the Senior Independent Director, Rio Tinto Limited.\n\n## G. Composition of the Board\n\nAs at the date of this report, the Board comprises 14 members: 11 independent Non-Executive Directors, the Chair, the Chief Executive, and the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nAs detailed in the Nominations Committee report, we engaged Spencer Stuart to support the search for six new Non-Executive Directors as set out on page 105 of the Nominations Committee report. The Committee is satisfied that Spencer Stuart does not have any connections with the company or individual Directors that may impair their independence.\n\nThe Board is satisfied that it has the appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence, and knowledge of the company to enable its members to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectively, and that no individual or group can dominate the Board's decision-making. There is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and the executive leadership of our business. The Chief Executive is responsible for the day-to-day management of the business and, under a Group delegation of authority framework, delegates to other members of the Executive Committee.\n\n## H. Role of Non-Executive Directors\n\nWe list all of the Non-Executive Directors that we consider to be independent on pages 92-93. Over 50% of the Board (excluding the Chair) are Non-Executive Directors. The Non-Executive Directors constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy. They are also\n\nresponsible for scrutinising management performance and ensuring that financial information, risks and controls, and systems of risk management are robust.\n\nEach Director has undertaken to allocate sufficient time to the Group in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively, and this is kept under review by the Nominations Committee. The Directors' other appointments are listed on pages 92-93.\n\n## I. Board processes and role of the Company Secretary\n\nThe governance framework on page 103 explains the governance structure of the Board and sets out the relationship with the Chief Executive. The roles and responsibilities of each committee are explained. On pages 100 and 102 we  provide some examples of the decisionmaking process of the Board and the steps it takes to function effectively, including how it considers stakeholders in this process.\n\nThe Group Company Secretary is the trusted interlocutor within the Board and its committees, and between senior leadership and the Non-Executive Directors. He is responsible for advising the Board, through the Chair, on all governance matters. He supports the Chair in ensuring that the information provided to the Board is of sufficient quality and appropriate detail in order for the Board to function effectively and efficiently.\n\n## Composition, succession and evaluation\n\n## J. Appointments to the Board\n\nThe Nominations Committee ensures a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new Directors. It is also responsible for Board succession planning, regularly assessing the balance of skills, experience, diversity and capacity required to oversee the delivery of Rio Tinto's strategy. This year, the Nominations Committee oversaw the appointment of six new Non-Executive Directors. Details of this process are provided in the Nominations Committee report on page 105.\n\nThe Nominations Committee also reviews proposed appointments to the Executive Committee. The Board has responsibility for the process and monitoring of Executive Committee succession planning. The Board\n\noversees a longer-term succession planning process for the Executive Committee, including the roles of the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nAll Non-Executive Directors are members of the Nominations Committee. The Committee is chaired by the Chair, apart from when the Committee is dealing with the appointment of his or her successor. Only the Chair and Committee members have the right to attend the meetings of the Nominations Committee; attendance by all other individuals is by invitation only. The Nominations Committee report sets out the Board's approach to succession planning and how this supports the development of a diverse pipeline, at all levels. All Directors are subject to annual re-election at the AGMs.\n\nDetails of external search consultancies used for Board appointments can be found in the Nominations Committee report on page 105.\n\n## K. Skills, experience and knowledge of the Board and its committees\n\nIn our succession planning, we aim to bring a diverse and complementary range of skills, knowledge and experience to the Board, so that we are equipped to navigate the operational, social, regulatory and geopolitical complexity in which our business operates. Achieving the right blend of skills and diversity to support effective decision-making is a continuing process. Further details of tenure and experience of the Board are set out in the Nominations Committee report on pages 105-106. The Board biographies set out the specific skills and experience that each Director brings to the Board (pages 92-93).\n\n## L. Board evaluation\n\nThe performance of the Board, its committees and individual Directors is evaluated annually. In accordance with Code Provision 21, every third year, an external adviser is engaged to carry out a formal independent evaluation of the Board and its committees. In 2023, we appointed No 4 to conduct our external evaluation. No 4 is a business advisory company which does not have any other connection with Rio Tinto.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information see page 104.\n\nOur disclosure on Board and executive management diversity in line with UK Listing Rules (LR9.8.6R(10)) is set out below.\n\n## Gender reporting categories as at 31 December 2023\n\n| Gender                          | Number of  Board members   | % of  Board   | Number of senior positions on the  board (e.g. CEO/CFO, SID & Chair)   | Number in executive  management   | % of executive  management   |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Men                             | 9                          | 69 %          | 4                                                                      | 9                                 | 75 %                         |\n| Women                           | 4                          | 31%\u00b9          | -                                                                      | 3                                 | 25 %                         |\n| Non-binary                      | -                          | -             | -                                                                      | -                                 | -                            |\n| Not specified/prefer not to say | -                          | -             | -                                                                      | -                                 | -                            |\n\n- 1.

Internal and external audit\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee monitors the independence and effectiveness of the Internal Audit function and external auditors. The Committee is responsible for reviewing key judgements within the Group's financial statements and narrative reporting, with the aim of maintaining the integrity of the Group's financial reporting. For further detail, please refer to the Audit & Risk Committee report on pages 107-110.\n\nThe appointment of KPMG as external auditor for the 2023 financial year was approved by shareholders at our AGMs in 2023.\n\n## N. Fair, balanced and understandable assessment\n\nThe Board is responsible for the presentation of a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the company's position and prospects, not only in the Annual Report . We have a robust process in place, including through the Disclosure Committee, to ensure that this is the case.\n\n## O. Risk management and internal control framework\n\nThe Board is ultimately responsible for aligning our long-term strategic objectives with the risk appetite of the company, taking into account the principal and emerging risks faced by the company. Please refer to pages 78-88 for further details of our business planning cycle and risk management framework and how these support our longer-term viability statement.\n\n## Remuneration\n\n## P. Remuneration policies and practices\n\nThe People & Remuneration Committee supports the Board by setting our Remuneration Policy. Through long-term and short-term incentives, our Remuneration Policy is designed to help drive a performance culture that incentivises executives to deliver the Group's long-term strategy and create superior shareholder value over the short, medium and long term. The overarching aim is to ensure our remuneration structure and policies reward fairly and responsibly with a clear link to corporate and individual performance, and to the company's long-term strategy and values. We have worked to ensure that we have a clear policy that can be understood by shareholders and stakeholders.\n\n## Q. Procedure for developing remuneration policy\n\nWe have a formal and transparent procedure for developing our Remuneration Policy, and no Director is involved in deciding their own remuneration. Executive remuneration is set with regard to the wider workforce and through market benchmarking. For further detail, please refer to the People & Remuneration Committee report on pages 113-145. The Committee is supported by remuneration consultant Deloitte. The Board received assurance from the Committee and from Deloitte that Deloitte did not have any connections with Rio Tinto or the Board that would have impaired its independence. Please refer to page 128 for further detail.\n\n## R. Exercising independent judgement\n\nThe People & Remuneration Committee comprises seven Non-Executive Directors to ensure independent judgement with regard to remuneration outcomes. The Committee considers remuneration on an annual basis and determines outcomes by assessing executive performance against performance criteria, details of which can be found in the People & Remuneration Committee report on pages 113-145. This states how our Remuneration Policy has been applied and sets out details of any adjustments made or discretions exercised.\n\n## ASX Principles\n\n## Principle 1: Lay solid foundations for management and oversight\n\n## Recommendation 1.1\n\nRio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited have a common Board of Directors. The principal role of the Board is to set the Group's strategy and to review its strategic direction regularly. The Board also has responsibility for corporate governance. A Board Charter setting out the role of the Board and management and matters reserved for the Board is available on riotinto.com/ corporategovernance.\n\nThe Board delegates responsibility for day-to-day management of the business to the Chief Executive and other members of the Executive Committee. A number of management committees support the Chief Executive and the Executive Committee. The structure of these committees is set out on page 103.\n\n## Recommendation 1.2\n\nThe Nominations Committee, on behalf of the Board, ensures a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new Directors. A similar process is followed with the Executive Committee and senior executive appointments, including a formal and rigorous process to source strong candidates from diverse backgrounds and conducting appropriate background and reference checks on the shortlisted candidates. In 2023, the Nominations Committee oversaw the appointment of six new Non-Executive Directors, Kaisa Hietala Dean Dalla Valle, Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz, Joc O'Rourke, Martina Merz and Sharon Thorne. Details of this process are provided in the Nominations Committee report on page 105.\n\nThe notice of AGM provides all material information in Rio Tinto's possession relevant to decisions on election and re-election of Directors, including a statement from the Board that it considers all Directors continue to perform effectively and demonstrate appropriate levels of commitment. It also provides reasons why each Director is recommended for re-election, highlighting their relevant skills and experience. Further information on the skills and experience of each Director is set out on pages 92-93.\n\n## Recommendation 1.3\n\nThe company has written agreements setting out the terms of appointment for each Director and senior executive. Non-Executive Directors are appointed by letters of appointment. Executive Directors and other senior executives are employed through employment service contracts. Further information is set out on page 124, 136, 138 and 139 in the Remuneration report.\n\n## Recommendation 1.4\n\nThe Group Company Secretary is accountable to the Board and advises the Chair, and, through the Chair, the Board on all governance matters. The appointment and removal of the Group Company Secretary is a matter reserved for the Board.\n\n## Recommendation 1.5\n\nRio Tinto has a Group-wide, Board-endorsed Inclusion and Diversity Policy. The policy is available at riotinto.com/policies. The Board sets objectives for achieving diversity for the Board, senior executives and the workforce, and annually reviews the Group's performance against them. Page 43 sets out the measurable objectives and our performance against them. The respective proportions of men and women on the Board, in senior executive positions and across the whole organisation, are reported on pages 43, 106 and 153 of the Annual Report .",

It is delivered over a number of months, and tailored to their specific requirements, taking into account their respective committee responsibilities.\n\nAll Directors are expected to commit to continuing their development during their tenure. This is supported through a combination of site visits, teach-ins, deep dives, and internal business and operational briefings provided in or around scheduled Board and committee meetings.\n\nIn addition, the Group Company Secretary provides regular updates on corporate governance developments in the UK, Australia and the US.\n\n## Principle 3: Instil a culture of acting lawfully, ethically and responsibly\n\n## Recommendations 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4\n\nThrough our Code of Conduct The Way We Work , the Board sets the company's purpose, values, and standards for the Group's employees. Our values are set out on page 8. The Board is committed to acting in accordance with these values, championing, and embedding them in the organisation. Our Code of Conduct is available at riotinto.com/ethics.\n\nRio Tinto's confidential and independently operated whistleblowing program (myVoice) offers an avenue through which our employees, contractors, suppliers and customers can report concerns anonymously, subject to local law. These may include concerns about the business, or behaviour of individuals, including suspicion of violations of financial reporting, safety or environmental procedures or other business integrity issues. The program features telephone and web submissions, a case management tool, and a reporting tool to allow for better analysis of case statistics.\n\nThe myVoice procedure explains how concerns regarding matters relating to Rio Tinto, its business and its people can be raised, in confidence and without fear of retaliation. The procedure also sets out who can make a report and what they can expect from us if they do report a concern. The procedure is available on our website. Further details on myVoice are set out on page 77. Rio Tinto's business integrity standard sets out the Group's position on issues relating to bribery and corruption. This  is also available on our website. Further information is set out on page 76.\n\nOversight of the Group's ethics, integrity and compliance program now falls within the remit of the Board.\n\n## Principle 4: Safeguard integrity in corporate reports\n\n## Recommendation 4.1\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee report on pages 107-110 provides details of the role and responsibilities of the Committee.

We communicate with the market through accurate, clear, concise and effective reporting, and contents of periodic reports are verified by the subject matter experts and reviewed by the relevant Group functions. Such reports are then reviewed and considered by the Group Disclosure Committee for release to the market.\n\n## Principle 5: Make timely and balanced disclosure\n\n## Recommendation 5.1\n\nWe recognise the importance of effective and timely communication with shareholders and the wider investment community.\n\nIt is our policy to make sure that all information disclosed or released by the Group is accurate, complete and timely, and complies with all continuous and other disclosure obligations under applicable listing rules and other relevant legislation.\n\nTo ensure that trading in our securities takes place in an informed and orderly market, we have established a Disclosure Committee to oversee compliance with our continuous disclosure obligations. The Group Disclosure and Communications Policy, and the terms of reference of our Disclosure Committee, together with our adopted procedures in relation to disclosure and management of relevant information, support compliance with our disclosure obligations. A copy of the Group Disclosure and Communications Policy is available on the website.\n\nThe Disclosure Committee is responsible for determining whether information relating to Rio Tinto may require disclosure to the markets under the continuous disclosure requirements in the jurisdictions in which Rio Tinto is listed. In accordance with its terms of reference, the specific focus of the Committee is to consider and determine on a timely basis whether information would, to the extent that the information is not public and relates directly or indirectly to Rio Tinto, be likely to have a material effect on the price of Rio Tinto securities if that information was generally available.",

Generally, the Chairs of all Board committees are available to answer questions raised by shareholders, and all Directors are expected to attend where possible. The AGMs are generally webcast and transcripts of the Chair's and Chief Executive's speeches are made available on our website. A summary of the proceedings at the meetings, and the results of voting on resolutions, are made available as soon as practicable after the meetings. At Rio Tinto AGMs, all resolutions are decided by poll and not by show of hands.\n\nIn 2023, the Rio Tinto Limited AGM was held in Perth as a hybrid meeting. With the use of technology, shareholders who could not attend in person were offered the opportunity to virtually participate at the AGM, ask questions and vote on the resolutions.\n\n## Recommendation 6.5\n\nShareholders can choose to communicate electronically with the companies and the share registrars. Contact details for the registrars are set out on page 355 and on our website.\n\n## Principle 7: Recognise and manage risk Recommendations 7.1, 7.2\n\nThe Board is ultimately responsible for risk management and internal controls, and for ensuring that the systems in place are robust and take into account the principal risks faced by the Group. The Board delegates certain matters relating to the Group's risk management framework to the Audit & Risk Committee, which provides updates to the Board on matters discussed at each meeting. The Sustainability Committee advises the Board on risk appetite tolerance and strategy with respect to sustainable development risks. Further information about the Sustainability Committee is set out on pages 111-112. Terms of reference for the Sustainability Committee are available on our website. Further details on the Group's governance framework for risk management and internal control are set out on pages 78-88 and 110.\n\n## Recommendation 7.3\n\nFurther information on Rio Tinto's Group Internal Audit function is set out on page 110.\n\n## Recommendation 7.4\n\nA description of the principal risks and uncertainties that could affect Rio Tinto (including economic, environmental and social sustainability risks), and of the Group's governance framework for risk management and internal control, is set on pages 78-88. Further information on sustainability is available on pages 40-77.\n\n## Principle 8: Remunerate fairly and responsibly\n\n## Recommendation 8.1\n\nThe Remuneration report on pages 113-145 provides details on the role and responsibilities of the People & Remuneration Committee. The Committee's terms of reference are available on our website. Further details on membership, the number of times the Committee met during 2023, and the attendance of members are set out on pages 92-93 and 104.\n\n## Recommendation 8.2\n\nRio Tinto's policies and practices regarding remuneration of Non-Executive Directors, Directors and senior executives are set out on pages 113-145 in the Remuneration report.\n\n## Recommendation 8.3\n\nRio Tinto's approach on participating in equity-based remuneration schemes is set out on page 150. This is also addressed in the Rio Tinto Securities Dealing Policy, which is available on our website.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate information\n\n## About Rio Tinto\n\nIn 1995, Rio Tinto plc, incorporated in the UK and listed on the London and New York Stock Exchanges, and Rio Tinto Limited, incorporated in Australia and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, formed a dual-listed companies structure (DLC). Under the DLC, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited are viewed as a single economic enterprise, with common boards of directors, and the shareholders of both companies have a common economic interest in the DLC. For further information on the DLC structure, see page 347. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)-compliant consolidated financial statements of the Rio Tinto Group are prepared on this basis, with the interests of shareholders of both companies presented as the equity interests of shareholders in the Rio Tinto Group. This is in accordance with the principles and requirements of IFRS and in accordance with an order, under section 340 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 , issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on 16 July 2021 ('ASIC class order').\n\nFor further details of the ASIC class order relief, see page 265.\n\nRio Tinto's business is finding, mining, and processing mineral resources. Major products are iron ore, aluminium, copper, industrial minerals (borates, titanium dioxide and salt) and diamonds. Activities span the world and are strongly represented in Australia and North America, with significant businesses in Asia, Europe, Africa and South America.\n\nRio Tinto plc's registered office is at 6 St James's Square, London SW1Y 4AD, UK. Rio Tinto Limited's registered office is at Level 43, 120 Collins Street, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia.\n\n## About the presentation of our financial statements\n\nAll financial statement values are presented in US dollars and rounded to the nearest million (US$m) unless otherwise stated. Where applicable, comparatives have been adjusted to measure or present them on the same basis as current year figures.\n\nOur financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 were authorised for issue in accordance with a Directors' resolution on 21 February 2024.\n\n## a. The basis of preparation\n\nThe financial information included in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, and for the related comparative periods, has been prepared:\n\n- -under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial instruments, the impact of fair value hedge accounting on the hedged items and the accounting for post-employment assets and obligations;\n- -on a going concern basis, management has prepared detailed cash flow forecasts for at least 12 months and has updated lifeof-mine plan models with longer-term cash flow projections, which demonstrate that we will have sufficient cash, other liquid resources and undrawn credit facilities to enable us to meet our obligations as they fall due;\n- -to meet UK-adopted international accounting standards, applicable UK law ( Companies Act 2006 ) and Australian law (Australian Corporations Act 2001 ) as amended by the ASIC class order;\n- -to meet international accounting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and interpretations issued from time to time by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC), which are mandatory at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe above accounting standards and interpretations are collectively referred to as 'IFRS' in this report and contain the principles we use to create our accounting policies. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the locally reported assets, liabilities, and results of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates to align their accounting policies with ours for consistent reporting.\n\n## b. The basis of consolidation\n\nThe financial statements consolidate the accounts of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited (together 'the Companies') and their respective subsidiaries (together 'the Group', 'we', 'our') and include the Group's share of joint arrangements and associates.\n\nWe consolidate subsidiaries where either of the companies controls the entity. Control exists where either of the companies has: power over the entities, that is, existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the entities (those that significantly affect the companies' returns); exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entities; and the ability to use its power to affect those returns. A list of principal subsidiaries is shown in note 30.\n\nA joint arrangement is an arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control such that decisions about the relevant activities of the arrangement (those that significantly affect the companies' returns) require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. We have two types of joint arrangements: joint operations (JOs) and joint ventures (JVs). A JO is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. This includes situations where the parties benefit from the joint activity through a share of the output, rather than by receiving a share of the results of trading. For our JOs, shown in note 31, we recognise: our share of assets and liabilities; revenue from the sale of our share of the output and our share of any revenue generated from the sale of the output by the JO; and its share of expenses. All such amounts are measured in accordance with the terms of the arrangement, which is usually in proportion to our interest in the JO. These amounts are recorded in our financial statements on the appropriate lines. A JV is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. JVs are accounted for using the equity accounting method.\n\nAn associate is an entity over which we have significant influence. Significant influence is presumed to exist where there is neither control nor joint control and the Group has over 20% of the voting rights, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case. Significant influence can arise where we hold less than 20% of the voting rights if we have the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions affecting the entity. It also includes situations of collective control.\n\nWe use the term 'equity accounted units' (EAUs) to refer to associates and JVs collectively. Under the equity accounting method, the investment is recorded initially at cost to the Group, including any goodwill on acquisition. In subsequent periods, the carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to reflect the Group's share of the EAUs' retained post-acquisition profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Our principal JVs and associates are shown in note 32.\n\nIn some cases, we participate in unincorporated arrangements and have rights to our share of the assets and obligations for our share of the liabilities of the arrangement rather than a right to a net return, but we do not share joint control. In such cases, we account for these arrangements in the same way as our joint operations, with all such amounts measured in accordance with the terms of the arrangement, which is usually in proportion to our interest in the arrangement.\n\nAll intragroup transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.",

        "page_content": "## c. Materiality\n\nOur Directors consider information to be material if correcting a misstatement, omission or obscuring could, in the light of surrounding circumstances, reasonably be expected to change the judgement of a reasonable person relying on the financial statements. The Group considers both quantitative and qualitative factors in determining whether information is material; the concept of materiality is therefore not driven purely by numerical values.\n\nWhen considering the potential materiality of information, management makes an initial quantitative assessment using thresholds based on estimates of profit before taxation; for the years ended 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 the quantitative threshold was US$700 million. However, other considerations can result in a determination that lower values are material or, occasionally, that higher values are immaterial. These considerations include whether a misstatement, omission or obscuring: masks a change or trend in key performance indicators; causes reported key metrics to change from a positive to a negative value or vice-versa; affects compliance with regulatory requirements or other contractual requirements; could result in an increase to management's compensation; or might conceal an unlawful transaction.\n\nIn assessing materiality, management also applies judgement based on its understanding of the business and its internal and external financial statement users. The assessment will consider user expectations of numerical and narrative reporting. Sources used in making this assessment would include, for example: published analyst consensus measures, experience gained in formal and informal dialogue with users (including regulatory correspondence), and peer group benchmarking.\n\n## d. Summary of key judgements or other relevant judgements made in applying the accounting policies\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to use judgement in applying accounting policies and in making critical accounting estimates.\n\nThese judgements and estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to previous experience, but actual results may differ materially from the amounts included in the financial statements. Areas of judgement in the application of accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are noted below. Further information is contained in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nSummarised below are the key judgements that we have taken in the application of the Group's accounting policies for 2023 and how they compare to the prior year. Taking a different judgement over these matters could lead to a material impact on the 2023 financial statements. More detail on the judgement can be found in the respective notes.\n\n| Key judgements                                                   |    |    | 2023 2022 Context                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|----|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Indicators of impairment and  impairment reversals (note 4)      | a  | a  | Various cash-generating units of the Group have been impaired in previous  years and are, therefore, monitored closely for indicators of further impairment  or impairment reversal as such adjustments would likely be material to our  results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Deferral of stripping costs (note 13)                            | a  | a  | The deferral of stripping costs is a key judgement in open-pit mining operations  as it impacts the amortisation base for these costs, calculated on a units of  production basis; this involves determining whether multiple pits are considered  separate or integrated operations, which in turn influences the classification of  stripping activities as pre-production or production phase. This judgement relies  on various factors that are based on the unique characteristics and  circumstances of each mine. |\n| Estimation of asset lives (note 13)                              | a  | a  | The useful lives of major assets are often linked to the life of the orebody they  relate to, which is in turn based on the life-of-mine plan. Where the major assets  are not dependent on the life of a related orebody, management applies  judgement in estimating the remaining service potential of long-lived assets. The  accuracy of estimating these useful lives is essential for determining the  appropriate allocation of costs over time, reflecting the consumption of the  asset's economic benefits.    |\n| Close-down, restoration and  environmental obligations (note 14) | a  | a  | Significant judgement is required to assess the possible extent of closure  rehabilitation work needed to fulfil the Group's legal, statutory, and constructive  obligations, along with other commitments to stakeholders. This involves  leveraging our experience in evaluating available options and techniques to  meet these obligations, associated costs and their likely timing and, crucially,  determining when that estimate is sufficiently reliable to make or adjust a  closure provision.                 |",

This  determination is a relevant judgement as intangible assets that are deemed to  have indefinite lives are not amortised; they are reviewed annually for  impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a |\n| Recoverability of deferred tax assets  (note 15)                 | a  | a  | In considering the recoverability of deferred tax assets, judgement is required  regarding the extent to which certain risk factors are likely to affect the recovery  of these assets, including future profit forecasts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Lease assessment (note 21)                                       | a  | 0  | The Group has entered into renewable energy power purchase agreements that  require judgements to assess whether the arrangement contains a lease for the  relevant power generating assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Accounting for the Pilbara Iron  Arrangements (note 31)          | a  | a  | In assessing the Pilbara Iron Arrangements, judgement is required in concluding  whether they collectively constitute a joint arrangement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Basis of consolidation of Queensland  Alumina Limited  (note 31) | 0  | a  | Judgement is required to assess how we consolidate Queensland Alumina  Limited (QAL). As a result of the Australian government imposing Trade  Sanctions against Russia, QAL is not able to process bauxite on behalf of Rusal  entities. Rio Tinto has contributed additional bauxite tonnes to ensure that 100%  of production capacity is maintained. We continue to account for QAL as a joint  operation.                                                          |\n| Accounting for Minera Escondida Ltda  (note 32)                  | a  | a  | Judgement is required in our determination that Escondida is a joint venture as  this impacts the classification of the entity in the financial statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Recognition of contingencies (note 37)                           | a  | a  | Judgement is required to determine whether disclosure is made for material  contingent liabilities depending on whether the possibility of any loss arising is  considered remote, and whether these can be reliably estimated in order to be  quantified.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |",

Key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nWe define key sources of estimation uncertainty as accounting estimates that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.

Closure studies are  performed to a rolling schedule with increased frequency and engineering  accuracy for sites approaching end of life. Information from these studies can  result in a material change to the associated provisions. The most significant  closure provision update related to the Ranger mine at Energy Resources of  Australia.  The provision is based on reforecast cash flows, these are subject to  further study which could result in material adjustment in the near term. |\n| Estimation of obligations for post- employment costs (note 28)                           | a  | a                   | The value of the Group's obligations for post-employment benefits is dependent  on the amount of benefits that are expected to be paid out, discounted to the  balance sheet date. There is significant estimation uncertainty pertaining to the  most significant assumptions used in accounting for pension plans, namely the  discount rate, the long-term inflation rate and mortality rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n\n## f. Currency\n\n## Other relevant judgements - identification of functional currency\n\nWe present our financial statements in US dollars, as that presentation currency most reliably reflects the global business performance of the Group as a whole.\n\nThe functional currency for each subsidiary, unincorporated arrangement, joint operation and equity accounted unit is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. For businesses that reside in developed economies, the functional currency is generally the currency of the country in which it operates because of the dominance of locally incurred costs. If the business resides in an emerging economy, the US dollar is generally identified to be the functional currency as a higher proportion of costs, particularly imported goods and services, are agreed and paid in US dollars, in common with other international investors. Determination of functional currency involves judgement, and other companies may make different judgements based on similar facts.\n\nThe determination of functional currency affects the measurement of non-current assets included in the balance sheet and, as a consequence, the depreciation and amortisation of those assets included in the income statement. It also impacts exchange gains and losses included in the income statement and in equity. We also apply judgement in determining whether settlement of certain intragroup loans is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future and, therefore, whether the associated exchange gains and losses can be taken to equity. During 2023, A$15 billion of intragroup loans continued to meet these criteria; associated exchange gains and losses are taken to equity.\n\nOn consolidation, income statement items for each entity are translated from the functional currency into US dollars at the full-year average rate of exchange, except for material one-off transactions, which are translated at the rate prevailing on the transaction date. Balance sheet items are translated into US dollars at period-end exchange rates.\n\nExchange differences arising on the translation of the net assets of entities with functional currencies other than the US dollar are recognised directly in the currency translation reserve. These translation differences are shown in the statement of comprehensive income, with the exception of the translation adjustment relating to Rio Tinto Limited's share capital, which is shown in the statement of changes in equity.\n\nWhere an intragroup balance is, in substance, part of the Group's net investment in an entity, exchange gains and losses on that balance are taken to the currency translation reserve.\n\nExcept as noted above, or where exchange differences are deferred as part of a cash flow hedge, all other differences are charged or credited to the income statement in the year in which they arise.\n\nThe principal exchange rates used in the preparation of the financial statements were:\n\n|                                                                    |   Full-year average |   Full-year average |   Full-year average |   Year-end |   Year-end |   Year-end |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| One unit of local currency buys the following number of US dollars |            2023     |            2022     |            2021     |   2023     |   2022     |   2021     |\n| Pound sterling                                                     |               1.24  |               1.24  |               1.38  |      1.28  |      1.21  |      1.35  |\n| Australian dollar                                                  |               0.66  |               0.69  |               0.75  |      0.69  |      0.68  |      0.73  |\n| Canadian dollar                                                    |               0.74  |               0.77  |               0.8   |      0.76  |      0.74  |      0.78  |\n| Euro                                                               |               1.08  |               1.05  |               1.18  |      1.11  |      1.07  |      1.13  |\n| South African rand                                                 |               0.054 |               0.061 |               0.068 |      0.054 |      0.059 |      0.063 |",

Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources\n\nA Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade (or quality), and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. An Ore Reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated Mineral Resource.\n\nThe estimation of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources requires judgement to interpret available geological data and subsequently to select an appropriate mining method and then to establish an extraction schedule. At least annually, the Competent Persons of the Group (according to the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (the JORC Code)), estimate Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources using assumptions such as:\n\n- - available geological data;\n- - expected future commodity prices and demand;\n- - exchange rates;\n- - production costs;\n- - transport costs;\n- - close-down and restoration costs;\n- - recovery rates;\n- - discount rates; and\n- - renewal of mining licences.\n\nWith regard to our future commodity price assumptions, to calculate our Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources for our filing on the Australian Securities Exchange and London Stock Exchange, we use prices generated by our Strategy and Economics team (refer to the Climate change section for further details about our pricing methodology). For our Annual Report on Form 20-F , filed with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), we use consensus price or historical pricing and comply with subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (SK-1300), instead of with the JORC code.\n\nWe use judgement as to when to include Mineral Resources in accounting estimates, for example, the use of Mineral Resources in our depreciation policy as described in note 13 and in the determination of the date of closure as described in note 14.\n\nThere are many uncertainties in the estimation process and assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available. New geological or economic data or unforeseen operational issues may change estimates of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources. This could cause material adjustments in our financial statements to:\n\n- - depreciation and amortisation rates;\n- - carrying values of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment;\n- - deferred stripping costs;\n- - provisions for close-down and restoration costs; and\n- - recovery of deferred tax assets.\n\nThe unaudited statement of Ore Reserves is included on pages 300 to 311 and of Mineral Resources on pages 312 to 322.\n\n## h. Impact of climate change on the Group\n\nThe impacts of climate change and the execution of our climate change strategy on our financial statements are discussed below:\n\n## Strategy and approach to climate change\n\nIn 2021, we put the low-carbon transition at the heart of our business strategy, setting a clear pathway to deliver long-term value as well as ambitious targets to decarbonise our business.\n\nOur targets are to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 15% by 2025, 50% by 2030 (both relative to our 2018 equity baseline) and to reach net zero emissions by 2050. These targets are aligned with efforts to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C - the stretch long-term goal of the Paris Agreement. The pathway to reducing our carbon footprint is organised into six global decarbonisation programs focused on renewables, Pacific aluminium operations, aluminium anodes including ELYSIS TM technology, alumina processing decarbonisation, minerals processing decarbonisation and diesel alternatives. Nature-based solutions (NbS) and carbon credits complement our decarbonisation programs. By 2025 we expect to have made financial commitments to abatement projects on renewables, diesel replacement and process heat that will achieve more than 15% of Group emissions, however, our actual emissions abatement will lag these. To accelerate these activities, we established the Rio Tinto Energy and Climate Team led by our Chief Decarbonisation Officer. To deliver our decarbonisation strategy, we estimate that we will invest around US$5 billion to US$6 billion in capital between 2022 to 2030 (revised from US$7.5 billion in prior year, due to the increased role of commercial contracts treated as operating expenditure and our expected timeline of fleet electrification roll out post 2030). This excludes capitalised voluntary and compliance-based offset costs.\n\nOur approach to addressing Scope 3 emissions is to engage with our customers on climate change and work with them to develop and scale up the technologies to decarbonise steel and aluminium production.\n\nOur forecast growth capital expenditure captures new growth opportunities with a focus on materials that are expected to see strong demand growth from the low carbon transition. This includes our investment in Simandou, completion of the Oyu Tolgoi underground copper-gold mine and investment in new copper and lithium projects. Our budget for central greenfield exploration mainly focuses on copper with a growing battery materials program.\n\nDecarbonisation investment decisions are made under a dedicated evaluation framework, which includes consideration of the value of the investment and its impact on the cost base, the level of abatement, the maturity of the technology, the competitiveness of the asset and its policy context, and alternative options on the pathway to net zero. Projects are also assessed against our approach to a just transition, with consideration of the impact on employees, local communities, and industry.\n\nFurther details on our approach and progress are provided in the front half of this Annual Report: Progressing our Strategy on page 17 and Climate Change on pages 44 to 58.",

        "page_content": "## Climate change scenarios\n\nOur strategy and approach to climate change are informed by our analysis of the interplay of global megatrends, explored through the lens of plausible global scenarios. These set the context for our industry and underpin our commodity price outlooks, portfolio and capital allocation choices and how we operate as a business.  There are many plausible scenarios for global energy transition, all with different impacts on future commodity price outcomes. We did not fundamentally change our scenarios in 2023, but have updated the temperature outcomes in 2100 based on the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The following two core scenarios are used to generate a single central reference case for use in commodity price forecasts, valuation models, reserves and resources determination and in determining estimates for assets and liabilities in our financial statements, as was the case in the prior year:\n\n- - Competitive Leadership scenario, limiting global warming to between 1.6\u00b0C-2\u00b0C (previously 2\u00b0C) by 2100, reflects a rapidly developing world of high growth and strong climate action post-2030, with change driven by policy and competitive innovation. As a result, we expect that countries achieve their Glasgow Climate Pact commitments agreed at the UN Climate Summit (COP26). Global weighted average carbon prices are forecast to rise rapidly at an average of 8% per year over the next three decades, reaching US$42/tCO 2 e in 2030, and rising rapidly post-2030 to incentivise significant mitigation in industrial sectors post-2030.\n- - Fragmented Leadership scenario, with global warming to between 2.1-2.5\u00b0C (previously exceeding 2.5\u00b0C) by 2100, is characterised by limited progress on policy reform with volatile low growth. We expect that nations eventually achieve their 2030 Nationally Determined Contributions as agreed in Paris in 2015 but fail to progress towards long-term carbon goals agreed at COP26. Global weighted average carbon prices are forecast to rise slowly, at an average of 2.9% per year over the period to 2050, reaching US$42 in 2030; but remain too low post-2030 to incentivise significant mitigation in industrial sectors resulting in flat global emissions post-2030.\n\nWe note with concern that at the UN Climate Summit in late 2023 (COP28), it was evident in the global stock take that progress to decarbonise the global economy is falling short of the goal to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C by 2100 and that current climate policies in many countries are not yet aligned with their stated ambitions. Consequently, neither of our two core scenarios are consistent with the expectation of climate policies required to accelerate the global transition to meet the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement. Although Paris Agreement, our two core scenarios do not. As a result, we also assess our sensitivity and test the economic performance of our business against a scenario we have developed to reflect our view of the global actions required to meet the stretch goal of the Paris\n\nour operational emissions reduction targets align with the goals of the Agreement. We refer to this Paris-aligned scenario as the Aspirational Leadership scenario.\n\nThe Aspirational Leadership scenario reflects a world of high growth, significant social change and accelerated climate action. Global weighted average carbon prices rise rapidly - at an average of 9.3% per year over the next three decades - reaching $59/tCO 2 e in 2030 and incentivise rapid and deep reductions in industrial emissions post-2030. Despite geopolitical differences, major economies work together through multilateral frameworks and proactively work towards limiting temperature change to 1.5\u00b0C by 2100. The Aspirational Leadership scenario is a commodity sales price and carbon tax sensitivity, with all other inputs remaining equal to our Reference Case. It is built by design to reach net zero emissions globally by 2050 and help us better understand the pathways to meet the Paris Agreement goal, and what this could mean for our business. It is used for strategy and risk discussions, including analysis of sensitivity to our view of a Paris-aligned pathway and comparison of relative economic performance to our core scenarios.\n\nImportantly, none of our three scenarios are considered a definitive representation for our assessment of the future impact of climate change on the Group. Scenario modelling has inherent limitations and, by its nature, allows a range of possible outcomes to be considered where it is impossible to predict which outcome is likely.\n\nWe do not publish the commodity price forecasts associated with these scenarios, as to do so would weaken our position in commercial negotiations and might give rise to concerns from other market participants.\n\n## Low-carbon transition risks and opportunities, financial resilience of our portfolio\n\nThrough our strategy process, we compare the economic performance of our portfolio under our two core scenarios and the Aspirational Leadership scenario. This indicates that, overall, the economic performance of our portfolio would be stronger in scenarios with proactive climate action, particularly in relation to aluminium, copper and higher-grade iron ore. This reflects anticipated increased demand for these commodities in the low-carbon transition.\n\nWe anticipate that our Group's overall economic performance will be the strongest under the Competitive Leadership scenario and the weakest under the Fragmented Leadership scenario.  Our Aspirational Leadership scenario predicts the Group's overall economic performance would fall between the Fragmented Leadership and Competitive Leadership scenarios. This reflects higher estimated economic performance for our copper and aluminium businesses in the Aspirational Leadership scenario, based on their higher price profiles, offset by higher expected carbon penalties across our operating jurisdictions, and lower prices for lower grade iron ore products. Refer below for our assessment of the accounting implications of forecast commodity pricing in the Aspirational Leadership scenario.\n\nWe carefully monitor and manage transition risks linked to our operational Scope 1 and 2 emissions and value-chain Scope 3 emissions.  In particular, we expect the decarbonisation of our assets to benefit from the implementation of new technologies. The pace of technological development is uncertain, which could delay or increase the cost of our decarbonisation efforts.\n\n## Physical risk impacts\n\nIn 2022, we launched the Physical Resilience Program across the Group starting with the asset-level resilience assessment in iron ore operations in the Pilbara and aluminium operations in the Saguenay. In 2023, we continued to make progress in a Group-wide, top-down assessment to further understand the risks and opportunities associated with physical climate change and to quantify any financial impacts, in addition to the site-specific, bottom-up assessments, which will continue in the foreseeable future. Asset-level resilience assessments conducted across our Canadian sites, including Saguenay, Kitimat, and IOC; our iron ore project at Simandou in Guinea; at Weipa and Yarwun in Australia as well as our ongoing review processes, including impairment assessments, have not identified any material accounting impacts to date. For example, in 2023, no write-offs were necessary in the Pilbara, where certain infrastructure assets, such as transmission lines, that have reached the end of their natural lives are being replaced with climate resilient infrastructure. In addition, we do not foresee the renewal of our contractual water rights in Canada that have been classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets to be at risk from climate change (note 12). Further, closure planning considers future climate change projections at each step of the process to support safe and appropriate final landform design.",

        "page_content": "## NbS, carbon credits and renewable energy certificates (RECs)\n\nWhile prioritising emissions reductions at our operations, we are also investing in NbS that can bring benefits to people, nature and climate. We have three pathways to securing carbon credits: investment in Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs), the development of our own voluntary projects and commercial agreements with voluntary carbon credit developers. We may use high quality carbon credits from these projects towards our 2030 target. This will complement our abatement project portfolio and support our compliance with carbon pricing regulation such as the Safeguard Mechanism in Australia (approximately half of our Group emissions are subject to carbon pricing regulation in Australia, Canada and elsewhere).\n\nIn March 2023, the Australian Parliament legislated to introduce reforms to the Safeguard Mechanism that apply from 1 July 2023. In the short-to-medium term, we anticipate that a number of our facilities will be above the legislated baseline, requiring us to purchase and surrender ACCUs. In 2023, we purchased US$61 million (2022: US$33 million) of carbon credits and RECs. They have been acquired for our own use and are accounted for as intangible assets (note 12).\n\n## Accounting impacts from executing our strategy\n\nGlobal decarbonisation and the world's energy transition continue to evolve, with the potential to materially impact our future financial results as our significant accounting judgements and key estimates are updated to reflect prevailing circumstances. In response, carrying values of assets and liabilities could be materially affected in future periods. Our current strategy and approach to decarbonise our operations and achieve our Scope 1 and 2 emissions targets are considered in our significant judgements and key estimates reflected in these financial results.\n\n## Progressing our strategy to grow in materials needed for the lowcarbon transition\n\nAs part of our strategy to grow in materials essential for the energy transition we progressed our high-grade iron ore project in Simandou, we continued to invest in our copper portfolio and the Rincon lithium project. These projects follow our existing accounting policies on undeveloped properties and cost capitalisation.\n\nAs discussed in note 5, we entered into an agreement with Giampaolo Group to form the Matalco joint venture for a combined consideration of US$738 million to meet a growing demand for recycled aluminium solutions. The investment is accounted for under the equity method. In 2023, we also invested US$45 million in a copper project known as Nuevo Cobre accounted for as an investment in a partially owned subsidiary (note 5).\n\n## Decarbonising our portfolio\n\nAs part of our decarbonisation programs, we invested US$94 million (2022: US$86 million) in various decarbonisation projects, all capitalised on balance sheet. Our operating expenditure on Scope 1, 2 and 3 energy efficient initiatives and research and development (R&D) costs, inclusive of our equity share of R&D related to ELYSIS TM , was US$234 million (2022: US$138 million), all recognised in the income statement (note 7). Our capital commitments related to decarbonisation in 2023 totalled US$123 million (2022: US$8 million)and included the Amrun renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) classifed as a lease not yet commenced (note 37).\n\nIn addition, we invested US$36 million (2022: US$42 million) in entities specialising in decarbonisation and related technology, accounted for as financial assets, and Australian Integrated Carbon (AIC), a leading developer of high-quality carbon credits, which is an equity accounted unit.\n\nGiven the significant investments we are making to abate our carbon emissions, we have considered the potential for asset obsolescence, with a particular focus on our Pilbara operations where we are building our own renewable assets and are prioritising investment in renewables to switch away from natural gas power generation. No material changes to useful economic lives have been identified in the current year as the assets are expected to be required for the\n\ntransition (note 13). As the renewable projects progress, it is possible that such adjustments may be identified in the future.\n\nLarge scale renewable power off-take arrangements require judgement to determine the appropriate accounting treatment and may result in a lease, a derivative or an executory contract depending on contractual terms (refer to note 21 for further information on significant judgements in lease assessment). The renewable solar PPAs at Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) will be accounted for on an accrual basis as energy is produced, while the renewable offtake arrangements at QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM) and Amrun are leases.\n\nAs part of the program to develop renewable energy solutions for our Queensland aluminium assets, on 22 December 2023 we entered into a long-term renewable 1.1GW PPA at Upper Calliope Solar Farm, to buy renewable electricity and associated green products to be generated in the future. The contract is accounted for as a level 3 financial derivative with a zero fair value at inception and an immaterial value at year end. The derivative will require complex measurement over the contract's term.\n\nNo adjustments to useful lives of the existing fleet have been identified to date as a result of planned fleet electrification in the Pilbara and the purchase of battery-powered locomotives in the prior period. The solutions are still in development or pilot stages and the gradual fleet replacement is intended to be part of the normal lifecycle renewal of trucks. Depending on technological development, which is highly uncertain, this could lead to accelerated depreciation in the future. Similarly, our target to have net zero vessels in our portfolio by 2030 has not given rise to accounting adjustments to date, as the replacement is planned as part of the lifecycle renewal. The energy efficiency double digestion project at Queensland Alumina refinery does not reduce the economic lives of the underlying alumina assets, but could lower operating costs and improve margins. The expenditure on our own carbon abatement projects and technology advancements follows existing accounting policies on cost capitalisation, research and development costs.\n\n## Impairment - sensitivities to climate change\n\nIn our impairment review process we consider the risks associated with climate change.\n\nThe Gladstone alumina refineries are responsible for more than half of our Scope 1 carbon dioxide emissions in Australia and therefore have been a key focus as we evaluate options to decarbonise our assets. The legislated Safeguard Mechanism reforms referred to above, difficult trading conditions, together with our improved understanding of the capital requirements for decarbonisation, were identified as impairment triggers and an impairment of US$1,175 million was recognised during the year at the Yarwun alumina refinery and Queensland Alumina Limited (note 4). The recoverable amount included the benefits of an energy efficiency digestion project at Queensland Alumina refinery. This does not reduce the economic lives of the underlying alumina assets but could lower operating costs and improve margins. Following the impairment in 2022, we continue to evaluate lower emission power solutions for the Boyne smelter that could extend its life to at least 2040. In such circumstances, the net present value of the forecast future cash flows could support the reversal of past impairments. In note 4 we illustrated the sensitivity of the refineries valuations to the cost of carbon credits.\n\nUnder the Aspirational Leadership scenario, which is not used in the preparation of these financial statements, nor for budgeting purposes, the economic performance of copper and aluminium is expected to be stronger under supply and demand forward pricing curves, which we believe will be consistent with the Paris Agreement. It is possible therefore, under certain conditions, that historical impairments associated with these assets could reverse.\n\nIn the Aspirational Leadership scenario, the prices for lower-grade iron ore are supported in the medium term by an assumed underlying increase in GDP-driven demand. However, in the longer term, we assume the pricing for lower-grade iron ore to be weaker than in our core scenarios. This will depend on the development of low-carbon steel technology, the pace of which is uncertain, but is expected to be",

        "page_content": "offset by higher prices for higher-grade iron ore. Consistent with the prior year, this is very unlikely to give rise to impairment triggers for 2024 or in the short- to medium-term due to the high returns on capital employed in the Pilbara and the slow deployment of lowcarbon steel technology.\n\n## Use of Paris-aligned accounting\n\nForecast commodity prices, including carbon prices, incorporated into a blend of our two scenarios are used to inform critical accounting estimates included as inputs to impairment testing, estimation of remaining economic life for units of production depreciation and discounting closure and rehabilitation provisions. These prices represent our best estimate of actual market outcomes based on the range of future economic conditions regarding matters largely outside our control, as required by IFRS. As neither of our core scenarios represents the Group's view of the goals of the Paris Agreement, our commodity price assumptions used in accounting estimates are not consistent with the expectation of climate policies required to accelerate the global transition to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. As described above, we use our Aspirational Leadership scenario to understand the sensitivity of these estimates to Paris-aligned assumptions.\n\nWe completed the divestments of our coal businesses in 2018 and no longer mine coal, but retained a contingent royalty income from these divestments. Recent favourable coal prices exceeded contractual\n\nbenchmark levels and resulted in the cash royalty receipt of US$38 million during 2023. We also carry royalty receivables of US$214 million on our balance sheet at 31 December 2023, measured at fair value (note 24). The fair value of this balance may be adversely impacted in the future by a faster pace of transition to a low carbon economy, but this impact is not expected to be material.\n\nClosure dates and cost of closure are also sensitive to climate assumptions, including precipitation rates, but no material changes have been identified in the year specific to climate change that would require a material revision to the provisions in 2023. For those commodities with higher forward price curves under the Aspirational Leadership scenario, it may be economical to mine lower mineral grades, which could result in the conversion of additional Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves and therefore longer dated closure.\n\nOverall, based on the Aspirational Leadership scenario pricing outcomes, and with all other assumptions remaining consistent with those applied to our 2023 financial statements, we do not currently envisage a material adverse impact of the 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned sensitivity on asset carrying values, remaining useful life, or closure and rehabilitation provisions for the Group. It is possible that other factors may arise in the future, which are not known today, that may impact this assessment.\n\nAdditional commentary on the impact of climate change on our business is included in the following notes:\n\n| Financial reporting considerations and sensitivities related to climate change                                          |   Page |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Recoverable value of our assets, asset obsolescence, impairment and use of sensitivities (note 4)                       |    179 |\n| Operating expenditure spend on decarbonisation (note 7 - footnote (h))                                                  |    184 |\n| Water rights - climate impact on indefinite life (note 12)                                                              |    189 |\n| Carbon abatement spend on procurement of carbon units and renewable energy certificates (note 12 - footnote (a))        |    190 |\n| Estimation of asset lives (note 13)                                                                                     |    192 |\n| Additions to property, plant and equipment with a primary purpose of reducing carbon emissions (note 13 - footnote (d)) |    194 |\n| Useful economic lives of power generating assets (note 13)                                                              |    195 |\n| Close-down, restoration and environmental cost (note 14)                                                                |    199 |\n| Upper Calliope Solar Farm PPA in Queensland (note 24 (iv))                                                              |    211 |\n| Coal royalty receivables (note 24)                                                                                      |    214 |\n| Decarbonisation capital commitments (note 37)                                                                           |    235 |",

New standards issued and effective in the current year\n\nOur financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies consistent with those applied in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022, except for the accounting requirements set out below, effective as at 1 January 2023.\n\n## Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12 'Income Taxes'), mandatory in 2023 and endorsed by the UK)\n\nAt 1 January 2023, we adopted narrow-scope amendments to IAS 12 and have restated comparative periods in accordance with the transition arrangements. These amendments introduce an exception to the initial recognition exemption application for transactions giving rise to equal and offsetting taxable and deductible temporary differences.\n\nUnder the amendments, separate deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated and recognised, prior to application of any required recovery testing and permitted offsetting, and subsequent movements in those deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement. Our previous accounting policy stated that 'where the recognition of an asset and liability from a single transaction gives rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences, we apply the initial recognition exemption allowed by IAS 12, and consequently recognise neither a deferred tax asset nor a deferred tax liability in respect of these temporary differences'.\n\nThe most significant impact of implementing these amendments is from temporary differences related to the Group's provisions for close-down and restoration, and lease obligations and corresponding capitalised closure costs and right-of-use assets. Adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities related to these balances have been recognised as at 1 January 2021, being the beginning of the earliest comparative period to be presented in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, with the cumulative effect recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings or other components of equity at that date. For other transactions, the impact of which was immaterial, the amendments apply only to those taking place on or after 1 January 2021. The impact on equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto at 1 January 2023 of implementing the amendments to IAS 12 is as follows:\n\n| At 1 January                                                      | 2023  US$m   | 2022 US$m   | 2021 US$m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Equity attributable to owners of Rio  Tinto (previously reported) | 50,175       | 51,415      | 47,054      |\n| Impact of IAS 12 amendments (a)                                   | 459          | 515         | 516         |\n| Restated equity attributable to owners  of Rio Tinto              | 50,634       | 51,930      | 47,570      |\n\nThe restatement of deferred tax balances for the comparative reporting date is as follows:\n\n|                                                           | 31 December 2022 US$m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Deferred tax assets (previously reported)                 | 2,766                   |\n| Impact of IAS 12 amendments                               | 30                      |\n| Deferred tax assets (restated)                            | 2,796                   |\n| Deferred tax liabilities (previously reported)            | (3,601)                 |\n| Impact of IAS 12 amendments                               | 437                     |\n| Deferred tax liabilities (restated)                       | (3,164)                 |\n| Net impact of IAS 12 amendments on deferred tax  balances | 467                     |\n| Comprising, prior to offsetting of balances:              |                         |\n| Deferred tax assets arising from:                         |                         |\n| -  Provisions and other liabilities                       | 1,586                   |\n| - Capital allowances                                      | (57)                    |\n|                                                           | 1,529                   |\n| Deferred tax liabilities arising from Capital allowances  | (1,062)                 |\n\nRestatement of pre-offset balances at 31 December 2022 represents additional gross deferred tax liabilities of US$922 million and gross deferred tax assets of US$1,380 million in relation to close-down and restoration obligations and related capitalised closure costs, and additional gross deferred tax liabilities of US$140 million and gross deferred tax assets of US$149 million in relation to lease liabilities and related right-of-use assets.\n\nThe impact of restatement on net earnings for the years ended 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2022 were a net credit of US$22 million and net charge of US$28 million, respectively, related to depreciation of closure and right of use assets and settlement of closure and lease liabilities.\n\n## IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' and Amendments to IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' (mandatory in 2023 and endorsed by the UK)\n\nWe implemented IFRS 17 and related amendments on 1 January 2023, which provides consistent principles for all aspects of accounting for insurance contracts. The standard does not have a material impact on the Group.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements', IFRS Practice Statement 2 'Making Materiality Judgements' and Amendments to IAS 8 'Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors'\n\nWe adopted Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2, requiring companies to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies. The amendments do not have a material impact on the Group.\n\nWe adopted Amendments to IAS 8 clarifying how companies should distinguish changes in accounting policies generally applied retrospectively, from changes in accounting estimates applied prospectively. The amendments introduce a new definition for accounting estimates clarifying that they are monetary amounts in the financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty. The amendments do not have a material impact on the Group.",

        "page_content": "## The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Pillar Two Rules\n\nWe have adopted the amendments to IAS 12 issued in May 2023, which provide a temporary mandatory exception from the requirement to recognise and disclose deferred taxes arising from enacted or substantively enacted tax law that implements the Pillar Two model rules, including tax law that implements qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes described in those rules. Under these amendments, any Pillar Two taxes incurred by the Group will be accounted for as current taxes from 1 January 2024.\n\n## j. Reconciliation with Australian Accounting Standards\n\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, as defined in the 'Basis of preparation' section on page 158, which differs in certain respects from the version of IFRS that is applicable in Australia, referred to as Australian Accounting Standards (AAS). We are required to disclose the effect of the adjustments to our consolidated income statement, consolidated total comprehensive income/(loss) and consolidated shareholders' funds if our accounts were prepared under the version of IFRS that is applicable in Australia. This is in order to satisfy the obligations of Rio Tinto Limited to prepare consolidated accounts under Australian company law, as amended by an order issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 16 July 2021.\n\nPrior to 1 January 2004, our financial statements were prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). Under IFRS, goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1998, which was eliminated directly against equity in the Group's UK GAAP financial statements, has not been reinstated. This was permitted under the rules governing the transition to IFRS set out in IFRS 1. The equivalent Australian Standard, AASB 1, does not provide for the netting of goodwill against equity. As a consequence, shareholders' funds under AAS include the residue of such goodwill, which amounted to US$380 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: US$380 million).\n\nSave for the exception described above, the Group's financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS are consistent with the requirements of AAS.",

The Executive Committee members each report directly to our Chief Executive who is the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. The CODM's primary measure of profit is underlying EBITDA.\n\nThe Copper reportable segment has been adjusted to reflect a change in management responsibility for the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea (Simandou) to the Chief Technical Officer for the build phase of this project. As a result, Simandou is now included in \"Other Operations\", which is below reportable segments in our segmental analysis.

Exclusions from underlying EBITDA\n\nItems excluded from profit after tax are those gains and losses that, individually or in aggregate with similar items, are of a nature and size to require exclusion in order to provide additional insight into the underlying business performance. The following items are excluded from profit after tax in arriving at underlying EBITDA in each year irrespective of materiality:\n\n- - Depreciation and amortisation in subsidiaries and equity accounted units;\n- - Taxation and finance items in equity accounted units;\n- - Taxation and finance items relating to subsidiaries;\n- - Unrealised gains/(losses) on embedded derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting;\n- - Net gains/(losses) on disposal of interests in subsidiaries;\n- - Impairment charges net of reversals;\n- - The underlying EBITDA of discontinued operations;\n- - Adjustments to closure provisions where the adjustment is associated with an impairment charge and for legacy sites where the disturbance or environmental contamination relates to the pre-acquisition period.\n\nIn addition, there is a final judgemental category which includes, where applicable, other credits and charges that, individually or in aggregate if of a similar type, are of a nature or size to require exclusion in order to provide additional insight into underlying business performance. In 2023, this includes all re-estimates of the closure provisions for fully impaired sites identified in the second half of the year due to the materiality of the adjustment in aggregate. In 2022 this category included the gain recognised by Kitimat relating to LNG Canada's project and the gain recognised upon sale of the Cortez royalty. In 2021 the category included the changes in closure estimates at Energy Resources of Australia and Gove Refinery.",

        "page_content": "## 4 Impairment charges net of reversals\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nImpairment charges and reversals are assessed at the level of cash-generating units (CGUs) which, in accordance with IAS 36 'Impairment of Assets', are identified as the smallest identifiable asset or group of assets that generate cash inflows, which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets. Separate cash-generating units are identified where an active market exists for intermediate products, even if the majority of those products are further processed internally. In some cases, individual business units consist of several operations with independent cash-generating streams which constitute separate CGUs.\n\nGoodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to the cash-generating unit or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the related business combination, and tested for impairment at the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. All cash-generating units containing goodwill (note 11), indefinite-lived intangible assets and intangible assets that are not ready for use (note 12) are tested annually for impairment as at 30 September, regardless of whether there has been an impairment trigger, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment charge.\n\n## Other relevant judgements - determination of CGUs\n\nJudgement is applied to identify the Group's CGUs, particularly when assets belong to integrated operations, and changes in CGUs could impact impairment charges and reversals. The most relevant judgement continues to relate to the grouping of Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec Operations and QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM) as a single CGU on the basis that they are vertically integrated operations and there is no active market for QMM's ilmenite.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, including right-of-use assets and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. This review starts with an appraisal of the perimeter of cash-generating units to consider changes in the business or strategic direction. Following this, an assessment of internal and external indicators is performed. Internal sources of information considered include assessment of the financial performance of the CGU and changes in mine plans. External sources of information include changes in forecast commodity prices, costs and other market factors.\n\nNon-current assets (excluding goodwill) that have suffered impairment are reviewed using the same basis for valuation as explained below whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment loss may no longer exist, or may have decreased. If appropriate, an impairment reversal will be recognised. The carrying amount of the cash-generating unit after reversal must be the lower of (a) the recoverable amount, as calculated above, and (b) the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the cash-generating unit in prior periods.\n\nIn 2023, we identified indicators of impairment at the Gladstone alumina refineries in the Aluminium segment and indicators of impairment reversal at the Simandou project. Refer to page 179 for details.\n\n## Key judgement - indicators of impairment and impairment reversals\n\nThe Oyu Tolgoi and Kitimat cash-generating units have both been impaired in previous years and are therefore monitored closely for indicators of further impairment or impairment reversal as such adjustments would likely be material to our results. At the time of their impairment, the carrying value and fair value for these CGUs were equal, making the CGUs sensitive to changes in economic assumptions, albeit headroom may have subsequently arisen due to the passage of time.\n\n## Oyu Tolgoi\n\nWe assessed the Oyu Tolgoi CGU for internal sources of information that could indicate impairment or impairment reversal by reference to the operational performance of the mine and development progress for the underground operation. For external sources of information that could indicate impairment or impairment reversal, we considered current and projected commodity prices. We concluded that there were no indicators of impairment or impairment reversal.\n\n## Kitimat\n\nThe Kitimat smelter was impaired in 2013 and 2014 during the construction phase as cost overruns were not expected to be recovered through economic performance. The plant was further impaired in 2021 (refer to page 180 for details) as operational performance was adversely impacted by a workforce strike in June 2021 that has reduced the capacity over a prolonged period.\n\nIn 2023, the operational performance of the plant was considered as part of the assessment of internal sources of information for evidence of impairment or impairment reversal. As highlighted in the climate change section, the economic performance of assets in the aluminium segment has the potential to perform more strongly as the world transitions to a lower carbon future; however, our assessment of external sources of information did not indicate that this had yet been priced into asset valuations. We concluded that there were no indicators of impairment or impairment reversal.\n\nWhere indication of impairment or impairment reversal exists, an impairment review is undertaken. The recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of value in use (being the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant cash-generating unit in its current condition) and fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD). When the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is measured by reference to FVLCD, this amount is further classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy for observable market data that is consistent with the unit of account for the cash-generating unit being tested. The Group considers that the best evidence of FVLCD is the value obtained from an active market or binding sale agreement and, in this case, the recoverable amount is classified in the fair value hierarchy as level 1. When FVLCD is based on quoted prices for equity instruments but adjusted to reflect factors such as a lack of liquidity in the market, the recoverable amount is classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. No cash-generating units are currently assessed for impairment by reference to a recoverable amount based on FVLCD classified as level 1 or level 2.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2023 financial statements\n\n## 4 Impairment charges net of reversals continued\n\nWhere unobservable inputs are material to the measurement of the recoverable amount, FVLCD is based on the best information available to reflect the amount the Group could receive for the cash-generating unit in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This is often estimated using discounted cash flow techniques and is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nWhere the recoverable amount is assessed using FVLCD based on discounted cash flow techniques, the resulting estimates are based on detailed life-of-mine and long-term production plans. These may include anticipated expansions which are at the evaluation stage of study.\n\nThe cash flow forecasts for FVLCD purposes are based on management's best estimates of expected future revenues and costs, including the future cash costs of production, capital expenditure, and closure, restoration and environmental costs. For the purposes of determining FVLCD from a market participant's perspective, the cash flows incorporate management's price and cost assumptions in the short and medium term. In the longer term, operating margins are assumed to remain constant where appropriate, as it is considered unlikely that a market participant would prepare detailed forecasts over a longer term. The cash flow forecasts may include net cash flows expected to be realised from the extraction, processing and sale of material that does not currently qualify for inclusion in ore reserves. Such non-reserve material is only included when there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. This expectation is usually based on preliminary drilling and sampling of areas of mineralisation that are contiguous with existing ore reserves. Typically, the additional evaluation required to achieve reserves status for such material has not yet been done because this would involve incurring evaluation costs earlier than is required for the efficient planning and operation of the mine.\n\nAs noted above, cost levels incorporated in the cash flow forecasts for FVLCD purposes are based on the current life-of-mine plan or long-term production plan for the cash-generating unit. This differs from value in use which requires future cash flows to be estimated for the asset in its current condition and therefore does not include future cash flows associated with improving or enhancing an asset's performance. Anticipated enhancements to assets may be included in FVLCD calculations and, therefore, generally result in a higher value.\n\nWhere the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is dependent on the life of its associated orebody, expected future cash flows reflect the current life of mine and long-term production plans; these are based on detailed research, analysis and iterative modelling to optimise the level of return from investment, output and sequence of extraction. The mine plan takes account of all relevant characteristics of the orebody, including waste-to-ore ratios, ore grades, haul distances, chemical and metallurgical properties of the ore impacting process recoveries and capacities of processing equipment that can be used. The life-of-mine plan and long-term production plans are, therefore, the basis for forecasting production output and production costs in each future year.\n\nForecast cash flows for ore reserve estimation for JORC purposes are generally based on Rio Tinto's commodity price forecasts, which assume short-term market prices will revert to the Group's assessment of the long-term price, generally over a period of three to five years. For most commodities, these forecast commodity prices are derived from a combination of analyses of the marginal costs of the producers and the incentive price of these commodities. These assessments often differ from current price levels and are updated periodically. The Group does not believe that published medium- and long-term forward prices necessarily provide a good indication of future levels because they tend to be strongly influenced by spot prices. The price forecasts used for ore reserve estimation are generally consistent with those used for impairment testing unless management deems that in certain economic environments a market participant would not assume Rio Tinto's view on prices, in which case in preparing FVLCD impairment calculations management estimates the assumptions that a market participant would be expected to use.\n\nForecast future cash flows of a cash-generating unit take into account the sales prices under existing sales contracts.\n\nThe discount rates applied to the future cash flow forecasts represent an estimate of the rate the market participant would apply having regard to the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted. The Group's weighted average cost of capital is generally used as a starting point for determining the discount rates, with appropriate adjustments for the risk profile of the countries in which the individual cash-generating units operate. For final feasibility studies and ore reserve estimation, internal hurdle rates, which are generally higher than the Group's weighted average cost of capital, are used. For developments funded with project finance, the debt component of the weighted average cost of capital may be calculated by reference to the specific interest rate of the project finance and anticipated leverage of the project.\n\nFor operations with a functional currency other than the US dollar, the impairment review is undertaken in the relevant functional currency. In estimating FVLCD, internal forecasts of exchange rates take into account spot exchange rates, historical data and external forecasts, and are kept constant in real terms after five years. The great majority of the Group's sales are based on prices denominated in US dollars. To the extent that the currencies of countries in which the Group produces commodities strengthen against the US dollar without an increase in commodity prices, cash flows and, therefore, net present values are reduced. Management considers that, over the long term, there is a tendency for movements in commodity prices to compensate to some extent for movements in the value of the US dollar, particularly against the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, and vice versa. However, such compensating changes are not synchronised and do not fully offset each other. In estimating value in use, the present value of future cash flows in foreign currencies is translated at the spot exchange rate on the testing date.\n\nGenerally, discounted cash flow models are used to determine the recoverable amount of CGUs. In this case, significant judgement is required to determine the appropriate estimates and assumptions used and there is significant estimation uncertainty. In particular, for fair value less costs of disposal valuations, judgement is required to determine the estimates a market participant would use. The discounted cash flow models are most sensitive to the following estimates: the timing of project expansions; the cost to complete assets under construction; long-term commodity prices; production timing and recovery rates; exchange rates; operating costs; reserve and resource estimates; closure costs; discount rates; allocation of long-term contract revenues between CGUs; and, in some instances, the renewal of mining licences. Some of these variables are unique to an individual CGU. Future changes in these variables may differ from management's expectations and may materially alter the recoverable amounts of the CGUs.",

In March 2023, the Australian Parliament legislated to introduce a requirement for large heavy industrial carbon emitters to purchase carbon credits based on their scope 1 emissions with a reducing baseline for these emissions. The challenging market conditions facing these assets, together with our improved understanding of the capital requirements for decarbonisation and the now legislated cost escalation for carbon emissions, were identified as impairment triggers during the six months ended 30 June 2023.\n\nUsing a fair value less cost of disposal methodology and discounting real-terms post-tax cash flows at 6.6%, we have recognised a pre-tax impairment charge of US$1,175 million (post-tax US$828 million). This represented a full impairment of the property, plant and equipment at the Yarwun alumina refinery (US$948 million) and an impairment of US$227 million for the property, plant and equipment of Queensland Alumina Limited (QAL). These impairments reflect market participant assumptions and the difficult trading conditions for these assets which were operating below our planned output.\n\nFor QAL, the recoverable amount (net present value of US$325 million) was represented by future cash flows attributable to the double digestion project. This major capital project improves the energy efficiency of the alumina production process and significantly reduces carbon emissions. These cash flows were risk adjusted to reflect the pre-feasibility study stage of project evaluation. If investment in the double digestion project is not approved, the post-tax impairment charge would be US$325 million greater and result in a full impairment of QAL.\n\n## Impact of climate change on our business - Gladstone alumina refineries\n\nWe are committed to the decarbonisation of our assets to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 and to net zero emissions by 2050 relative to our 2018 equity baseline. We anticipate that further carbon action may be necessary to align with the goals of the Paris agreement to limit temperature increases to 1.5 o C. To illustrate the sensitivity of the refinery valuations to the cost of carbon credits, we have modelled a 10% increase in those unit costs across all years, before the impact of decarbonisation projects with all other inputs to the 30 June 2023 impairment valuation remaining constant. For QAL, this sensitivity indicated a reduction in the pre-tax value by US$99 million; however this is expected to be largely mitigated by decarbonisation projects, including double digestion. There was no impact at Yarwun as all property, plant and equipment was already fully impaired.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2023 financial statements\n\n## 4 Impairment charges net of reversals continued\n\n## Other operations - Simandou, Guinea\n\nThe Simandou project in Guinea was fully impaired in 2015 as uncertainty over infrastructure ownership and funding had resulted in further spend on exploration and evaluation being neither budgeted nor planned. In the second half of 2023, we concluded key agreements with the Republic of Guinea and Winning Consortium Simandou (WCS) on the trans-Guinean infrastructure for the Simandou project and progressed agreements with our joint venture partners that will enable the development of the Simandou iron-ore mine. We therefore concluded that although development agreements remain subject to regulatory approvals, the key uncertainties that gave rise to the 2015 impairment have reversed and consequently an impairment reversal trigger was identified at 1 October 2023.\n\nRevisions to the Investment Framework and changes to the proposed infrastructure arrangements since 2015 mean that historical costs associated with these items have been superseded and therefore the attributable asset cost and accumulated impairment associated with these items have been permanently derecognised.  Previously capitalised exploration and evaluation costs associated with the mine and retained items of property, plant and equipment that continue to be relevant to the Simandou project development have been assessed for impairment reversal. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit measured on a fair value less cost of disposal basis, is significantly greater than the historical cost of the remaining impaired assets and therefore supports a full reversal of their previously recorded impairment charge. The pre-tax impairment reversal of US$239 million is allocated as US$231 million to intangible assets (exploration and evaluation) and US$8 million to property, plant and equipment. A deferred tax asset of US$152 million has been recorded to account for the difference between the asset values included in the Group accounts and the carrying value of in-country depreciable assets. Under our Aspirational Leadership pricing scenario, increases in carbon pricing are expected to drive demand for the higher-grade iron ore at Simandou which would indicate a higher recoverable value. As the previous impairment has been fully reversed, this Paris aligned-sensitivity would not result in a different impairment reversal.\n\nAll spend on the Simandou project between the impairment in 2015 and 30 September 2023 was expensed as incurred. With effect from 1 October 2023, qualifying spend is capitalised.\n\n## 2022\n\n## Other operations - Roughrider, Canada\n\nOn 17 October 2022, we completed the sale of the Roughrider uranium undeveloped project located in the Athabasca Basin in Saskatchewan, Canada for US$150 million (US$80 million in cash and US$70 million in shares of Uranium Energy Corp.). The project was fully impaired during the year ended 31 December 2017 due to significant uncertainty over whether commercially viable quantities of mineral resources could be identified at a future date. The sale therefore led to an impairment reversal during the year ended 31 December 2022. It also led to a loss on disposal being recognised of US$105 million arising from the recycling of the currency translation reserve to the income statement.\n\n## Aluminium - Pacific Aluminium, Australia and New Zealand\n\nThe operating and economic performance of the Boyne Smelter in Queensland, Australia was below our expectations in 2022. The plant operated with reduced capacity and the economic performance suffered due to the high cost of energy from the coal-fired Gladstone Power Station. These conditions were identified as an impairment trigger. We calculated a recoverable amount for the cash-generating unit based on post-tax cash flows, expressed in real terms and discounted using a post-tax rate of 6.6% over the period to 2029. This date was chosen as it coincided with both the remaining term of the Boyne Smelter joint venture agreements and the Group's Paris-aligned commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to the 2018 baseline. Despite the implementation of temporary energy price caps by the Australian Government in 2022, this resulted in an impairment charge of US$202 million, representing a full impairment of the carrying value of the Boyne Smelter investment in equity accounted unit.\n\n## 2021\n\n## Aluminium - Kitimat, Canada\n\nOn 3 December 2021, we announced completion of the newly-constructed wharf at Kitimat. Construction spend was incurred by LNG Canada and therefore a gain of US$336 million representing the estimated fair value of the cost of construction was recorded and the carrying value of the Kitimat CGU increased accordingly. Output from the smelter was reduced to 25% as a result of a workforce strike in mid-2021 and ramp-up to full capacity was expected to extend through into 2022. As a previously impaired CGU, and therefore carrying limited headroom, these factors were identified as conditions that could indicate that the uplifted carrying value may not be supportable and therefore the CGU was tested for impairment.\n\nUsing the fair value less cost of disposal methodology and discounting real-terms post-tax cash flows at 6.6%, we recognised a post-tax impairment charge of US$197 million (pre-tax US$269 million) representing the difference between the recoverable amount (US$3,126 million) and the carrying value (US$3,323 million).",

        "page_content": "## 5  Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nIn determining whether a particular set of activities is a business, an acquired arrangement has to have an input and substantive process, which together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. Where an acquisition does not meet the definition of a business as defined by IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' each asset is recognised on the balance sheet at fair value. In the Group cash flow statement we assess, based on the substance of the transaction, whether to allocate the cash consideration for these transactions either to 'Purchases of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets' or to 'Acquisitions of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates' depending on the type of assets purchased.\n\nFor undeveloped mining projects that have arisen through acquisition, the allocation of the purchase price consideration may result in undeveloped properties being recognised at an earlier stage of project evaluation compared with projects arising from the Group's exploration and evaluation program. Subsequent expenditure on acquired undeveloped projects is only capitalised if it meets the high degree of confidence threshold discussed in note 12.\n\nWhere we increase our ownership interest in a subsidiary, the difference between the purchase price and the carrying value of the share of net assets acquired is recorded in equity. The cash cost of such purchases is included within 'financing activities' in the cash flow statement.\n\n## 2023\n\nOn 8 November 2023 we acquired Meridian Minera Limitada's (MML) 57.7% share in Agua de la Falda (ADLF) for US$45 million. Subsequently, we entered into an agreement with Corporaci\u00f3n Nacional del Cobre de Chile (Codelco), a state-owned enterprise, to explore and potentially acquired assets in Chile's prospective Atacama region - the project will be known as Nuevo Cobre.\n\nThe majority ownership of 57.7% equity confers voting rights that will allow Rio Tinto to control the relevant activities of Nuevo Cobre. Therefore, we have accounted for Nuevo Cobre as an investment in a partially owned subsidiary. There was no goodwill recognised on acquisition as the transaction was not accounted for as a business combination. The difference between the net assets acquired and the purchase consideration has been recognised within Intangible assets as Exploration and Evaluation assets. The transaction gives rise to the recognition of a non-controlling interest of US$33 million, representing Codelco's 42.3% equity stake in Nuevo Cobre.\n\nOn 30 November 2023, Rio Tinto and Giampaolo Group completed a transaction to form the Matalco joint venture. We acquired a 50% equity interest in Matalco Canada Inc which owns one Canadian aluminium recycling facility and a 50% equity interest in Matalco USA LLC which owns six aluminium recycling facilities in the USA for combined consideration of US$738 million, inclusive of accrued transaction costs and working capital adjustments.\n\nRio Tinto has joint control over the Matalco businesses and therefore our investment is accounted for under the equity method.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the fair value of the underlying identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been provisionally determined and will be finalised within one year of the acquisition date in line with the requirements of IFRS.\n\n## 2022\n\nFollowing approval from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), on 29 March 2022 we completed the acquisition of Rincon Mining Pty Limited, the owner of a lithium project in Argentina. Total cash consideration was US$825 million. In determining whether Rincon's set of activities is a business, we assessed whether it had inputs and substantive processes which together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. Based on this assessment, we concluded that Rincon did not meet the definition of a business as defined by IFRS 3 \"Business Combinations\" and therefore no goodwill\n\nwas recorded. The transaction was therefore treated as an asset purchase with US$822 million of capitalised exploration and evaluation recorded for the principal economic resource. The balance of total consideration was allocated to property, plant and equipment and other assets/liabilities. For the Group cash flow statement we determined that, since Rincon constitutes a group of companies, it was appropriate to present the cash outflow as 'Acquisitions of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates' rather than as separate asset purchases even though it did not meet the definition of a business combination.\n\nOn 31 August 2022 we made a US$25 million investment in McEwen Copper Inc. through our copper leaching technology venture, Nuton TM . We accounted for our holding in McEwen Copper Inc. as an investment in associate, given our representation on their Board.\n\nOn 16 December 2022 we acquired the remaining 49% share of Turquoise Hill Resources for expected consideration of US$3.2 billion, inclusive of transaction costs. This transaction was not classified as a business combination as it related to the purchase of non-controlling interests in an entity already consolidated as a subsidiary. Accordingly, the transaction did not result in the remeasurement of assets or liabilities and has been accounted for in the statement of equity as an adjustment to non-controlling interests and retained earnings.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, consideration paid amounted to US$2,961 million, including US$33 million of transaction costs. In 2023, a further $33 million of transaction costs were paid (previously expected to be US$41 million). Certain shareholders exercised their right to dissent to the transaction. In accordance with the terms of the circular, those dissenting shareholders received initial consideration of C$34.4 per share, with final consideration depending on the outcome and timing of dissent proceedings, which at the end of 2023 remained outstanding. We included within Other provisions (note 36) US$211 million for additional consideration to be paid to the dissenting shareholders representing the difference between their initial consideration and C$43 per share paid to all other shareholders.\n\n## 2021\n\nOn 18 November 2021, we announced that we had completed the acquisition of the 40% share in the Diavik Diamond Mine in the Northwest Territories of Canada held by Dominion Diamond Mines, becoming the sole owner as a result. The transaction did not meet the definition of a business combination and therefore the incremental assets and liabilities were treated as an asset purchase. Prior to purchase, we recognised our existing 60% share of assets, revenues and expenses, with liabilities recognised according to its contractual obligations, and a corresponding 40% receivable or contingent asset representing the co-owner's share where applicable. Receivables relating to the co-owner's share were de-recognised and treated as part of the net purchase consideration on completion.\n\n## Disposals\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nIf a group of assets and liabilities (Disposal group) is sold the carrying value of the disposal group is de-recognised with the difference between the carrying amount and the consideration received recognised in the income statement. Certain amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of the entity disposed of may be recycled to the income statement. The cash proceeds of disposals are included within 'Investing activities' in the cash flow statement.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2023 financial statements\n\n## 5 Acquisitions and disposals continued\n\n## 2023\n\nOn 28 August 2023, we completed the sale of a 55% interest in the undeveloped La Granja project in Peru for US$105 million to First Quantum Minerals (FQM). The consideration received is recorded in the cash flow statement for US$104 million (net of US$1 million of cash balance), of which US$16 million relating to sale of land is included within 'net cash used in investing activities' and the remaining US$88 million is included within 'net cash generated from operating activities'. As a result of the sale, our retained interest in La Granja represents a 45% owned associate (equity accounted) over which Rio Tinto has significant influence during the evaluation phase.\n\nOn initial recognition, the gain on fair valuation of interest retained in the project of US$85 million was recognised to the extent of US$47 million (relating to the 55% interest sold) within 'profit relating to interests in undeveloped projects' and the remaining gain of US$38 million was eliminated against the fair value of the EAU. In total, we recognised a pre-tax gain of US$154 million in the income statement, primarily representing the consideration transferred by First Quantum, plus the fair value of the retained interest in the project.\n\n## 2022\n\nAs summarised in note 4, we sold our shareholding in the Roughrider uranium undeveloped project on 17 October 2022 for consideration of US$150 million (US$80 million in cash and US$70 million in shares of Uranium Energy Corp). This transaction was treated as a disposal of a subsidiary as the carrying value was largely represented by assets recorded as a purchase price allocation from the Hathor Exploration business combination in 2012.\n\n## 2021\n\nThere were no material disposals in 2021.\n\n## 6 Revenue by destination and product\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nWe recognise sales revenue related to the transfer of promised goods or services when control of the goods or services passes to the customer. The amount of revenue recognised reflects the consideration to which the Group is or expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\n\nSales revenue is recognised on individual sales when control transfers to the customer. In most instances, control passes and sales revenue is recognised when the product is delivered to the vessel or vehicle on which it will be transported once loaded, the destination port or the customer's premises. There may be circumstances when\n\njudgement is required based on the five indicators of control below:\n\n- -The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership and has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the good or service.\n- -The customer has a present obligation to pay in accordance with the terms of the sales contract. For shipments under the Incoterms cost, insurance and freight (CIF)/carriage paid to (CPT)/cost and freight (CFR), this is generally when the ship is loaded, at which time the obligation for payment is for both product and freight.\n- -The customer has accepted the asset. Sales revenue may be subject to adjustment if the product specification does not conform to the terms specified in the sales contract but this does not impact the passing of control. Assay and specification adjustments have historically been immaterial.\n- -The customer has legal title to the asset. The Group usually retains legal title until payment is received for credit risk purposes only.\n- -The customer has physical possession of the asset. This indicator may be less important as the customer may obtain control of an asset prior to obtaining physical possession, which may be the case for goods in transit.\n\nRevenue is principally derived from sale of commodities. We sell the majority of our products on CFR or CIF Incoterms. This means that the Group is responsible (acts as principal) for providing shipping services and, in some instances, insurance after the date at which control of goods passes to the customer at the loading port. The Group, therefore, has separate performance obligations for freight and insurance services that are provided solely to facilitate the sale of the products it produces. Other Incoterms commonly used by the Group are free on board (FOB), where the Group has no responsibility for freight or insurance once control of the goods has passed at the loading port, and delivered at place (DAP), where control of the goods passes when the product is delivered to the agreed destination. For these Incoterms, there is only one performance obligation, being the provision of product at the point where control passes.\n\nWithin each sales contract, each unit of product shipped is a separate performance obligation. Revenue is generally recognised at the contracted price as this reflects the standalone selling price. Sales revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes. Sales of copper concentrate are stated net of the treatment and refining charges, which will be required to convert it to an end product.\n\nThe Group's products are sold to customers under contracts that vary in tenure and pricing mechanisms, including some volumes sold on the spot market. Pricing for iron ore is on a range of terms, the majority being either monthly or quarterly average pricing mechanisms, with a smaller proportion of iron ore volumes being sold on the spot market.\n\nCertain of the Group's products may be provisionally priced at the date revenue is recognised and a provisional invoice issued; however, substantially all iron ore and aluminium sales are reflected at final prices in the results for the period. Provisionally priced receivables are subsequently measured at fair value through the income statement under IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' as described in note 24. The final selling price for all provisionally priced products is based on the price for the quotational period stipulated in the contract. Final prices for copper concentrate are normally determined between 30 and 120 days after delivery to the customer. The change in value of the provisionally priced receivable is based on relevant forward market prices and is included in sales revenue. Refer to 'Other revenue' within the sales by product disclosure below.\n\nRevenues from the sale of significant by-products, such as gold, are included in sales revenue. Third-party commodity swap arrangements principally for delivery and receipt of smelter-grade alumina are offset within operating costs. The sale and purchase of third-party production for own use or to mitigate shortfalls in our production are accounted for on a gross basis with sales presented within revenue from contracts with customers. Other operating income includes revenue incidental to the main revenue-generating activities of the operations and is treated as a credit to operating costs.\n\nTypically, the Group has a right to payment before or at the point that control of the goods passes, including a right, where applicable, to payment for provisionally priced products and unperformed freight and insurance services. Cash received before control passes is recognised as a contract liability. The amount of consideration does not contain a significant financing component as payment terms are less than one year. We have a number of long-term contracts to supply products to customers in future periods. Generally, revenue is recognised on an invoice basis, as each unit sold is a separate performance obligation and therefore the right to consideration from a customer corresponds directly with our performance completed to date.\n\nWe do not disclose sales revenue from freight and insurance services separately as we do not consider that this is necessary in order to understand the impact of economic factors on the Group. Our Chief Executive, the chief operating decision maker as defined under IFRS 8 'Operating Segments', does not review information specifically relating to these sources of revenue in order to evaluate the performance of business segments and Group information on these sources of revenue is not provided externally. We do provide information on freight revenue for the iron ore and bauxite businesses on pages 33 and 35 to help stakeholders understand FOB operating margins for those products.",

Refer to note 21.\n\n- (h) Operating decarbonisation spend of US$234 million (2022: US$138 million) is allocated as US$182 million (2022: US$88 million)  within 'Net operating costs (excluding items disclosed separately)', with the remainder included in our share of profit or loss of equity accounted units.\n\n## 8 Exploration and evaluation expenditure\n\nExploration and evaluation expenditure includes costs that are directly attributable to:\n\n- - researching and analysing existing exploration data;\n- - conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling;\n- - examining and testing extraction and treatment methods;\n- - compiling various studies (order of magnitude, pre-feasibility and feasibility) and/or\n- - early works at mine sites prior to full notice to proceed.\n\nExploration expenditure relates to the initial search for deposits with economic potential. Expenditure on exploration activity undertaken by the Group is not capitalised.\n\nEvaluation expenditure relates to a detailed assessment of deposits or other projects (including smelter and refinery projects) that have been identified as having economic potential. These costs are also expensed until the business case for the project is sufficiently advanced. For greenfield projects, expensing typically continues to a later phase of study compared with brownfield expansions.\n\nThe charge for the year and the net amount of intangible assets capitalised during the year are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                             | 2023  US$m   | 2022 US$m   | 2021 US$m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Expenditure in the year (inclusive of net cash proceeds of US$88 million (2022: US$1 million; 2021: US$7 million) on  disposal of undeveloped projects) (a) | (1,684)      | (1,097)     | (852)       |\n| Non-cash movements and non-cash proceeds on disposal of undeveloped projects                                                                                | (17)         | (6)         | 23          |\n| Amount capitalised during the year                                                                                                                          | 471          | 207         | 110         |\n| Exploration and evaluation expenditure (net of profit from disposal of interests in undeveloped projects) per  income statement                             | (1,230)      | (896)       | (719)       |\n| Comprising:                                                                                                                                                 |              |             |             |\n| Exploration and evaluation expenditures                                                                                                                     | (1,384)      | (897)       | (726)       |\n| Profit from disposal of interests in undeveloped projects (a)                                                                                               | 154          | 1           | 7           |",

It includes adjustments for tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of previous periods. Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain, we establish provisions based on either: the Group's judgement of the most likely amount of the liability or recovery; or, when there is a wide range of possible outcomes, a probability weighted average approach.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated in accordance with IAS 12 using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Where the recognition of an asset and liability from a single transaction gives rise to equal and off-setting temporary differences, we had previously applied the Initial Recognition Exemption allowed by IAS 12, and consequently recognised neither a deferred tax asset nor a deferred tax liability in respect of these timing differences. Under the narrow-scope amendments to IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities are required to be recognised in respect of such temporary differences and prior year results have been restated accordingly (refer to section 'New standards issued and effective in the current year' on page 166 for details). Primarily, this applies to lease arrangements and changes in closure estimates which are capitalised.\n\n## Other relevant judgements - uncertain tax positions\n\nThe Group operates across a large number of jurisdictions and is subject to review and challenge by local tax authorities on a range of tax matters. Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain, whether due to local tax authority challenge or due to uncertainty regarding the appropriate treatment, judgement is required to assess the probability that the adopted treatment will be accepted. In accordance with IFRIC 23 'Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments', if it is not probable that the treatment will be accepted, the Group accounts for uncertain tax provisions for all matters worldwide based on the Group's judgement of the most likely amount of the liability or recovery, or, where there is a wide range of possible outcomes, using a probability weighted average approach. Uncertain tax provisions include any related interest and penalties.\n\nThe Mongolian Tax Authority has issued a number of tax assessments covering the fiscal years 2013 to 2020, the most recent of which was received in December 2023, which are inconsistent with the Oyu Tolgoi Investment Agreement and Mongolian legislation. We have not booked any uncertain tax provisions for the matters under dispute, which have been referred to international arbitration. As required by Mongolian law we have paid US$356 million in respect of the assessments, pending resolution of the disputes through the arbitration. These amounts, adjusted for exchange rate movements, are included within our non-current receivables and other assets on the balance sheet. The interpretation of the Investment Agreement and Mongolian legislation has been, and is expected to continue to be, subject to dispute.  Differences in interpretation of the Investment Agreement and Mongolian legislation could have a material impact on the recovery of the amounts paid and of certain deferred tax assets, further details of which are provided in Note 15.\n\n## Taxation charge\n\n|                       | Note   | 2023  US$m   | 2022 US$m Restated (a)   | 2021 US$m Restated (a)   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| - Current             |        | 5,092        | 4,851                    | 8,144                    |\n| - Deferred            | 15     | (1,260)      | 763                      | 92                       |\n| Total taxation charge |        | 3,832        | 5,614                    | 8,236                    |",

Pillar Two was substantively enacted by the United Kingdom on 20 June 2023, with application from 1 January 2024. As the Pillar Two legislation was not operative at the reporting date, the Group has no related current tax exposure.\n\nWe have adopted the guidance contained in International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules - Amendments to IAS 12 released on 23 May 2023, which provides a temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax accounting for Pillar Two. We estimate that the exposure to additional taxation in 2024 under Pillar Two is immaterial for the Group.",

The recoverable amount has been assessed by reference to the CGU's FVLCD, in line with the policy set out in note 4 and classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. FVLCD was determined by estimating cash flows until the end of the life-of-mine plan including anticipated expansions.

        "page_content": "## 12  Intangible assets\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nPurchased intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Finite-life intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line or units of production basis, as appropriate. Intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives and intangible assets that are not yet ready for use are not amortised; they are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.\n\nThe majority of our intangible assets relate to capitalised exploration and evaluation spend on undeveloped properties and contract-based water rights. The water rights were acquired with Alcan in Canada.\n\nThe carrying values for undeveloped properties are reviewed at each reporting date in accordance with IFRS 6 'Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources'. The indicators of impairment differ from the tests in accordance with IAS 36 in recognition of the subjectivity of estimating future cash flows for mineral interests under evaluation. Potential indicators of impairment include: expiry of the right to explore, substantive expenditure is no longer planned, commercially viable quantities of mineral resources have not been discovered and exploration activities will be discontinued, or sufficient data exists to indicate a future development would be unlikely to recover the carrying amount in full. When such impairment indicators have been identified, the recoverable amount and impairment charge are measured under IAS 36. Impairment reversals for undeveloped properties are not subject to special conditions within IFRS 6 and are therefore subject to the same monitoring for indicators of impairment reversal as other CGUs.\n\n## Exploration and evaluation\n\nEvaluation expenditure relates to a detailed assessment of deposits or other projects (including smelter and refinery projects) that have been identified as having economic potential. Capitalisation of evaluation expenditure commences when there is a high degree of confidence that the Group will determine that a project is commercially viable; that is, the project will provide a satisfactory return relative to its perceived risks and, therefore, it is considered probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. The Group's view is that a high degree of confidence is greater than 'more likely than not' (that is, greater than 50% certainty) and less than 'virtually certain' (that is, less than 90% certainty).\n\nAssessing whether there is a high degree of confidence that the Group will ultimately determine that an evaluation project is commercially viable requires judgement and consideration of all relevant factors such as: the nature and objective of the project; the project's current stage, project timeline, current estimates of the project's net present value (including sensitivity analyses for the key assumptions), and the main risks of the project. Development expenditure incurred prior to the decision to proceed is subject to the same criteria for capitalisation, being a high degree of confidence that the Group will ultimately determine that a project is commercially viable.\n\nIn some cases, undeveloped projects are regarded as successors to ore bodies, smelters or refineries currently in production. Where this is the case, it is intended that these will be developed and go into production when the current source of ore is exhausted or when existing smelters or refineries are closed. Ore reserves may be declared for an undeveloped mining project before its commercial viability has been fully determined. Evaluation costs may continue to be capitalised in between declaration of ore reserves and approval to mine as further work is undertaken in order to refine the development case to maximise the project's returns.\n\n## Carbon credits and Renewable Energy Certificates\n\nCarbon credits and Renewable Energy Certificate (RECs) acquired for our own use are accounted for as intangible assets, initially recorded at cost. They are amortised through the income statement when surrendered.\n\n## Contract-based intangible assets\n\nThe majority of the carrying value of our contract-based intangible assets relate to water rights in the Quebec region. These contribute to the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our aluminium operations as they enable us to generate electricity from hydropower stations.\n\n## Other relevant judgements - assessment of indefinite-lived water rights in Quebec, Canada\n\nWe continue to judge the water rights in Quebec to have an indefinite life because we expect the contractual rights to contribute to the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our operations for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the rights are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment. We have no other indefinite-lived assets.\n\nThe remaining carrying value of the water rights of US$1,776 million (included in contract-based assets) as at 31 December 2023 (2022: US$1,693 million) relates wholly to the Quebec smelters CGU. The Quebec smelters CGU was tested for impairment by reference to FVLCD using discounted cash flows. The recoverable amount of the Quebec smelters is classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. In arriving at its FVLCD, post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms have been estimated over the expected useful economic lives of the underlying smelting assets and discounted using a real post-tax discount rate of 6.6% (2022: 6.6%).\n\nThe recoverable amounts were determined to be significantly in excess of carrying value, and there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would cause the remaining water rights to be impaired.\n\n## Impact of climate change on our business - water rights\n\nTo manage the uncertainties of climate change and our impact on the area, our team of hydrologists in Quebec analyse different weather scenarios on a daily basis. We monitor the water resource available to us along with the impact that our operation is having on the water quality and quantity, and on the environment when we return the water following use. Based on our analysis to date, we do not consider the renewal of our contractual water rights to be at risk from climate change for the foreseeable future.",

        "page_content": "## 13   Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost, as defined in IAS 16 'Property, Plant and Equipment', less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes, where applicable, the estimated close-down and restoration costs associated with the asset.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment includes right-of-use assets arising from leasing arrangements, shown separately from owned and leasehold assets.\n\nOnce an undeveloped mining project has been determined as commercially viable and approval to mine has been given, further expenditure is capitalised under 'capital work in progress' together with any amount transferred from 'Exploration and evaluation'. Once the project enters into an operation phase, the amounts capitalised in capital work in progress are reclassified to their respective asset categories.\n\nCosts incurred while commissioning new assets, in the period before they are capable of operating in the manner intended by management, are capitalised unless associated with pre-production revenue. Development costs incurred after the commencement of production are capitalised to the extent they are expected to give rise to a future economic benefit. Interest on borrowings related to construction or development projects is capitalised, at the rate payable on project-specific debt if applicable or at the Group or subsidiary's cost of borrowing if not. This is performed until the point when substantially all the activities that are necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use are complete. It may be appropriate to use a subsidiary's cost of borrowing when the debt was negotiated based on the financing requirements of that subsidiary.\n\n## Depreciation of non-current assets\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life, or over the remaining life of the mine, smelter or refinery if that is shorter and there is no reasonable alternative use for the asset by the Group. Depreciation commences when an asset is available for use and therefore there is no depreciation for capital work in progress.\n\n## Straight line basis\n\nAssets within operations for which production is not expected to fluctuate significantly from one year to another or which have a physical life shorter than the related mine are depreciated on a straight line basis as follows:\n\n|                                       | Land and buildings   | Land and buildings   | Plant and equipment               | Plant and equipment       |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Type of Property, plant and equipment | Land                 | Buildings            | Power-generating assets           | Other plant and equipment |\n| Depreciation profile                  | Not depreciated      | 5 to 50 years        | See Power note below on  page 195 | 3 to 50 years             |\n\nThe useful lives and residual values for material assets and categories of assets are reviewed annually and changes are reflected prospectively.\n\n## Units of production basis\n\nFor mining properties and leases and certain mining equipment, consumption of the economic benefits of the asset is linked to production. Except as noted below, these assets are depreciated on the units of production basis.\n\nIn applying the units of production method, depreciation is normally calculated based on production in the period as a percentage of total expected production in current and future periods based on ore reserves and, for some mines, other mineral resources. Other mineral resources may be included in the calculations of total expected production in limited circumstances where there are very large areas of contiguous mineralisation, for which the economic viability is not sensitive to likely variations in grade, as may be the case for certain iron ore, bauxite and industrial mineral deposits, and where there is a high degree of confidence that the other mineral resources can be extracted economically. This would be the case when the other mineral resources do not yet have the status of ore reserves merely because the necessary detailed evaluation work has not yet been performed and the responsible technical personnel agree that inclusion of a proportion of measured and indicated resources in the calculation of total expected production is appropriate based on historical reserve conversion rates.\n\nThe required level of confidence is unlikely to exist for minerals that are typically found in low-grade ore (as compared with the above), such as copper or gold. In these cases, specific areas of mineralisation have to be evaluated in detail before their economic status can be predicted with confidence.\n\nSometimes the calculation of depreciation for infrastructure assets, primarily rail and port, considers measured and indicated resources. This is because the asset can benefit current and future mines. The measured and indicated resource may relate to mines which are currently in production or to mines where there is a high degree of confidence that they will be brought into production in the future. The quantum of mineral resources is determined taking into account future capital costs as required by the JORC code. The depreciation calculation, however, applies to current mines only and does not take into account future development costs for mines which are not yet in production. Measured and indicated resources are currently incorporated into depreciation calculations in the Group's Australian iron ore business.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2023 financial statements\n\n## 13   Property, plant and equipment continued\n\n## Key judgement - estimation of asset lives\n\nThe useful lives of the major assets of a cash-generating unit are often dependent on the life of the orebody to which they relate. Where this is the case, the lives of mining properties, and their associated refineries, concentrators and other long-lived processing equipment are generally limited to the expected life of the orebody. The life of the orebody, in turn, is estimated on the basis of the life-of-mine plan. Where the major assets of a cash-generating unit are not dependent on the life of a related orebody, management applies judgement in estimating the remaining service potential of long-lived assets. Factors affecting the remaining service potential of smelters include, for example, smelter technology and electricity purchase contracts when power is not sourced from the Group, or in some cases from local governments permitting electricity generation from hydropower stations.\n\n## Impact of climate change on our business - estimation of asset lives\n\nWe expect there to be a higher demand for copper, aluminium, lithium and high-grade iron ore in order to meet demand for the minerals required to transition to a low carbon economic environment, consistent with the climate change commitments of the Paris Agreement. We expect this to exceed new supply to the market and therefore increase prices. Under the Aspirational Leadership scenario, the economic cut-off grade for our Ore Reserves is expected to be lower; in effect we would mine a greater volume of material before the mines are depleted. We cannot quantify the difference this would make without undue cost as it would require revised mine plans, but for property, plant and equipment this increased volume of material would reduce the depreciation charge during any given period for assets that use the 'Units of production' depreciation basis.\n\n## Deferred stripping\n\nIn open pit mining operations, overburden and other waste materials must be removed to access ore from which minerals can be extracted economically. The process of removing overburden and other waste materials is referred to as stripping. During the development of a mine (or, in some instances, pit; see below), before production commences, stripping costs related to a component of an orebody are capitalised as part of the cost of construction of the mine (or pit). These are then amortised over the life of the mine (or pit) on a units of production basis.\n\nWhere a mine operates several open pits that are regarded as separate operations for the purpose of mine planning, initial stripping costs are accounted for separately by reference to the ore from each separate pit. If, however, the pits are highly integrated for the purpose of mine planning, the second and subsequent pits are regarded as extensions of the first pit in accounting for stripping costs. In such cases, the initial stripping of the second and subsequent pits is considered to be production phase stripping (see below).\n\n## Key judgement - deferral of stripping costs\n\nWe apply judgement as to whether multiple pits at a mine are considered separate or integrated operations. This determines whether the stripping activities of a pit are classified as pre-production or production phase stripping and, therefore, the amortisation base for those costs. The analysis depends on each mine's specific circumstances and requires judgement: another mining company could make a different judgement even when the fact pattern appears to be similar.\n\nThe following factors would point towards the initial stripping costs for the individual pits being accounted for separately:\n\n- - if mining of the second and subsequent pits is conducted consecutively following that of the first pit, rather than concurrently;\n- - if separate investment decisions are made to develop each pit, rather than a single investment decision being made at the outset;\n- - if the pits are operated as separate units in terms of mine planning and the sequencing of overburden removal and ore mining, rather than as an integrated unit;\n- - if expenditures for additional infrastructure to support the second and subsequent pits are relatively large; and\n- - if the pits extract ore from separate and distinct orebodies, rather than from a single orebody.\n\nIf the designs of the second and subsequent pits are significantly influenced by opportunities to optimise output from several pits combined, including the co-treatment or blending of the output from the pits, then this would point to treatment as an integrated operation for the purposes of accounting for initial stripping costs. The relative importance of each of the above factors is considered in each case.\n\nIn order for production phase stripping costs to qualify for capitalisation as a stripping activity asset, three criteria must be met:\n\n- - it must be probable that there will be an economic benefit in a future accounting period because the stripping activity has improved access to the orebody;\n- - it must be possible to identify the 'component' of the orebody for which access has been improved; and\n- - it must be possible to reliably measure the costs that relate to the stripping activity.\n\nA 'component' is a specific section of the orebody that is made more accessible by the stripping activity. It will typically be a subset of the larger orebody that is distinguished by a separate useful economic life (for example, a pushback).",

We expect to invest US$5 billion to US$6 billion on carbon abatement projects between 2022 and 2030 (revised from US$7.5 billion in prior year). Transitioning electricity from principally fossil fuel-based power generating assets to principally renewables is critical to achieving that goal. The carrying value of power generating assets is set out in the table below. The weighted average remaining useful economic life of plant and equipment for fossil fuel-based power generating assets is 10 years (2022: 13 years). Given the technical limitations of intermittent renewable energy generation and energy storage systems, and our need for reliable baseload electricity, we expect our current generation assets will be integral to those needs for the foreseeable future. We are investing in research and development and evaluating new market options that may overcome these technical challenges. Should pathways for eliminating fossil fuel power generating assets be identified we may need to accelerate depreciation or impair the assets; however, at this present moment the requirement for fossil fuel powered back-up means that early retirement of the assets is not expected and no change to depreciation rates is required.\n\n|                | 2023                    | 2023                     | 2022                    | 2022                     |\n|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Net book value | Land and buildings US$m | Plant and equipment US$m | Land and buildings US$m | Plant and equipment US$m |\n| Fossil fuels   | 87                      | 932                      | 25                      | 882                      |\n| Renewables (a) | 201                     | 2,456                    | 198                     | 2,352                    |\n\n## Right-of-use assets - leased\n\n|                                    | 2023                    | 2023                     | 2023       | 2022                    | 2022                     | 2022       |\n|------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|------------|\n|                                    | Land and buildings US$m | Plant and equipment US$m | Total US$m | Land and buildings US$m | Plant and equipment US$m | Total US$m |\n| Net book value                     |                         |                          |            |                         |                          |            |\n| At 1 January                       | 515                     | 488                      | 1,003      | 549                     | 585                      | 1,134      |\n| Adjustment on currency translation | 11                      | 4                        | 15         | (35)                    | (16)                     | (51)       |\n| Additions                          | 96                      | 420                      | 516        | 49                      | 254                      | 303        |\n| Depreciation for the year          | (88)                    | (305)                    | (393)      | (61)                    | (295)                    | (356)      |\n| Impairment charges (a)             | (1)                     | (7)                      | (8)        | -                       | -                        | -          |\n| Disposals                          | -                       | (1)                      | (1)        | -                       | -                        | -          |\n| Transfers and other movements      | 10                      | 36                       | 46         | 13                      | (40)                     | (27)       |\n| At 31 December                     | 543                     | 635                      | 1,178      | 515                     | 488                      | 1,003      |\n\nThe leased assets of the Group include land and buildings (mainly office buildings) and plant and equipment, the majority of which are marine vessels.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2023 financial statements\n\n## 14   Close-down and restoration provisions\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nThe Group has provisions for close-down and restoration costs, which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, the removal of residual materials and the remediation of disturbed areas for mines and certain refineries and smelters. The obligation may occur during development or during the production phase of a facility. These provisions are based on all regulatory requirements and any other commitments made to stakeholders. The provision excludes the impact of future disturbance that is planned to occur during the life of mine, so that it represents only existing disturbance as at the balance sheet date.\n\nClosure provisions are not made for those operations that have no known restrictions on their lives as the closure dates cannot be reliably estimated; instead a contingent liability is disclosed. Refer to note 37 for details. This applies primarily to certain Canadian smelters that have indefinite-lived water rights from local governments permitting electricity generation from hydropower stations and are not tied to a specific orebody.\n\nClose-down and restoration costs are a normal consequence of mining or production, and the majority of close-down and restoration expenditure is incurred in the years following closure of the mine, refinery or smelter. Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is uncertain, the Group's businesses estimate their costs using current restoration standards, techniques and expected climate conditions. The costs are estimated on the basis of a closure plan, and are reviewed at each reporting period during the life of the operation to reflect known developments. The estimates are also subject to formal review, with appropriate external support, at regular intervals.\n\nThe timing of closure and the rehabilitation plans for the site can be uncertain and dependent upon future capital allocation decisions, which involve estimation of future economic circumstances and business cases. In such circumstances, the closure provision is estimated using probability weighting of the different remediation and closure scenarios.\n\nThe initial close-down and restoration provision is capitalised within 'Property, plant and equipment'. Subsequent movements in the close-down and restoration provisions for ongoing operations are treated as an adjustment to cost within 'Property, plant and equipment'. This includes those resulting from new disturbances related to expansions or other activities qualifying for capitalisation; updated cost estimates; changes to the estimated lives of operations; changes to the timing of closure activities; and revisions to discount rates.\n\nChanges in closure provisions relating to closed and fully impaired operations are charged/credited to 'Net operating costs' in the income statement.\n\nWhere rehabilitation is conducted systematically over the life of the operation, rather than at the time of closure, provision is made for the estimated outstanding continuous rehabilitation work at each balance sheet date and the cost is charged to the income statement.\n\nThe closure provision is represented by forecast future underlying cash flows expressed in real terms at the balance sheet date. These are discounted for the time value of money based on a long-term view of low-risk market yields which includes a review of historic trends plus risks and opportunities for which future cash flows have not been adjusted, namely potential improvements in closure practices between the reporting date and the point at which rehabilitation spend takes place. The real-terms discount rate used is 2.0% (2022: 1.5%) which is applied to all locations since we expect to meet closure cash flows principally from US dollar revenues and financing, with activities coordinated by the Group's central closure team.\n\nTo roll forward those real-terms cash flows between periods, we identify local rates of inflation based on Producer Price Inflation (PPI) indices and, together with the real-terms discount rate, unwind the discount through the line 'Amortisation of discount on provisions', shown within 'Finance items' in the income statement. This nominal rate for cost escalation in the current financial year is estimated at the start of each half-year and applied systematically for six months. At the end of each half-year we update the underlying cash flows for the latest estimate of experienced inflation, if it differs materially from our forecast, for the current financial year and record this as 'changes to existing provisions'. For operating sites this adjustment usually results in a corresponding adjustment to property, plant and equipment and for closed and fully impaired sites the adjustment is charged or credited to the income statement.\n\nIn some cases, our subsidiaries make a contribution to trust funds in order to meet or reimburse future environmental and decommissioning costs. Amounts due for reimbursement from trust funds are not offset against the corresponding closure provision unless payments into the fund have the effect of passing the closure obligation to the trust.\n\nEnvironmental costs result from environmental damage that was not a necessary consequence of operations, and may include remediation, compensation and penalties. Provision is made for the estimated present value of such costs at the balance sheet date. These costs are charged to 'Net operating costs', except for the unwinding of the discount which is shown within 'Amortisation of discount on provisions'.\n\nRemediation procedures may commence soon after the time the disturbance, remediation process and estimated remediation costs become known, but can continue for many years depending on the nature of the disturbance and the remediation techniques used.",

Significant judgement is also required to then determine both the costs associated with that work and the other assumptions used to calculate the provision. External experts support the cost estimation process where appropriate but there remains significant estimation uncertainty.\n\nThe key judgement in applying this accounting policy is determining when an estimate is sufficiently reliable to make or adjust a closure provision. Adjustments are made to provisions when the range of possible outcomes becomes sufficiently narrow to permit reliable estimation. Depending on the materiality of the change, adjustments may require review and endorsement by the Group's Closure Steering Committee before the provision is updated.\n\nCost provisions are updated throughout the life of the operation with conceptual study estimates reviewed every five years. Within ten years from the expected closure date, closure cost estimates must comply with the Group's Capital Project Framework. This means, for example, that where an Order of Magnitude (OoM) study is required for closure, it must be of the same standard as an OoM study for a new mine, smelter or refinery.\n\nIn 2023, a reforecast for the Ranger Uranium mine operated by Energy Resources of Australia has resulted in an increase to the closure provision of US$850 million. The increase is principally attributed to closure activities taking longer due to a reassessment of the time taken to achieve Pit 3 consolidation coupled with transition to a lower risk approach which adversely impacts achievement of final landform and the quantity of water to be processed. When operations ceased at the end of 2020, rehabilitation was expected to be complete by 2026; we now expect the final completion will be delayed until 2034, subject to permitting. The majority of the provision increase is attributable to rehabilitation activities post 2027 and is subject to further study which could result in material change to the provision. These activities remain subject to a number of studies and are also potentially sensitive to external events such as rainfall. A previous study was completed in early 2022 and the preliminary information from that study resulted in an increase to closure liabilities of US$510 million in 2021.\n\nIn some cases, the closure study may indicate that monitoring and, potentially, remediation will be required indefinitely - for example, ground water treatment. In these cases, the underlying cash flows for the provision may be restricted to a period for which the costs can be reliably estimated, which on average is around 30 years. Where an alternative commercial arrangement to meet our obligations can be predicted with confidence, this period may be shorter.",

        "page_content": "## Key accounting estimate - close-down, restoration and environmental obligations\n\nThe most significant assumptions and estimates used in calculating the provision are:\n\n- - Closure timeframes. The weighted average remaining lives of operations is shown on the previous page. Some expenditure may be incurred before closure while the operation as a whole is in production.\n- - The length of any post-closure monitoring period. This will depend on the specific site requirements and the availability of alternative commercial arrangements; some expenditure can continue into perpetuity. The Rio Tinto Kennecott closure and environmental remediation provision includes an allowance for ongoing monitoring and remediation costs, including ground water treatment, of approximately US$0.7 billion.\n- - The probability weighting of possible closure scenarios. The most significant impact of probability weighting is at the Pilbara operations (Iron Ore) relating to infrastructure and incorporates the expectation that some infrastructure will be retained by the relevant State authorities post closure. The assignment of probabilities to this scenario reduces the closure provision by US$0.7 billion.\n- - Appropriate sources on which to base the calculation of the discount rate. The discount rate by nature is subjective and therefore sensitivities are shown below for how the provision balance, which at 31 December 2023 was US$17.2 billion, would change if discounted at alternative discount rates.\n\nThere is significant estimation uncertainty in the calculation of the provision and cost estimates can vary in response to many factors including:\n\n- - Changes to the relevant legal or local/national government requirements and any other commitments made to stakeholders;\n- - Review of remediation and relinquishment options;\n- - Additional remediation requirements identified during the rehabilitation;\n- - The emergence of new restoration techniques;\n- - Precipitation rates and climate change;\n- - Change in foreign exchange rates;\n- - Change in the expected closure date; and\n- - Change in the discount rate.\n\nExperience gained at other mine or production sites may also change expected methods or costs of closure, although elements of the restoration and rehabilitation can be unique to each site. Generally, there is relatively limited restoration and rehabilitation activity and historical precedent elsewhere in the Group, or in the industry as a whole, against which to benchmark cost estimates.\n\nThe expected timing of expenditure can also change for other reasons, for example because of changes to expectations relating to ore reserves and mineral resources, production rates, renewal of operating licences or economic conditions.\n\nChanges in closure cost estimates at the Group's ongoing operations could result in a material adjustment to assets and liabilities in the next 12 months and would also impact the depreciation and the unwinding of discount in future years.\n\nChanges to closure cost estimates for closed operations, and changes to environmental cost estimates at any operation, could cause a material adjustment to the income statement and closure liability. We do not consider that there is significant risk of a change in estimates for these liabilities causing a material adjustment to the income statement in the next 12 months. Any new environmental incidents may require a material provision but cannot be predicted.\n\nProject specific risks are embedded within the cash flows which are based on a central case estimate of closure activities assuming that the obligation is fulfilled by the Group. These cash flows are then discounted using a discount rate specific to the class of obligations.\n\n## Impact of climate change on our business - close-down, restoration and environmental costs\n\nThe underlying costs for closure have been estimated with varying degrees of precision based on a function of the age of the underlying asset and proximity to closure. For assets within ten years of closure, closure plans and cost estimates are supported by detailed studies which are refined as the closure date approaches. These closure studies consider climate change and plan for resilience to expected climate conditions with a particular focus on precipitation rates. For new developments, consideration of climate change and ultimate closure conditions are an important part of the approval process. For longer-lived assets, closure provisions are typically based on conceptual level studies that are refreshed at least every five years; these are evolving to incorporate greater consideration of forecast climate conditions at closure.",

The present volatility in interest rates has resulted in expectations of higher yields from long-dated bonds, including the 30-year US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, which is a key input to our closure provision discount rate. On 30 June 2023, we revised the closure discount rate to 2.0% (from 1.5%), applied prospectively from that date.

These risk factors include the risk of expiry of losses prior to utilisation, the impact of other legislation or tax regimes, such as minimum taxes, and consideration of factors that lead to the generation of losses or other deferred tax assets. IAS 12 requires us to consider whether taxable profits will be available against which deferred tax assets may be utilised.\n\nThe Mongolian Tax Authority has issued a number of tax assessments covering the fiscal years 2013 to 2020, the most recent of which was received in December 2023, which are inconsistent with the Oyu Tolgoi Investment Agreement and Mongolian legislation. The interpretation of the Investment Agreement and Mongolian legislation has been, and is expected to continue to be, subject to dispute through international arbitration. Differences in interpretation of the Investment Agreement and Mongolian legislation could have a material impact on the amount and recovery of recognised deferred tax items, including tax losses. The arbitration process on matters of this complexity can typically take over 12 months to conclude.",

Third-party production purchased for our own use that is ordinarily interchangeable in accordance with IAS 2 'Inventories' is valued on the same basis, jointly with our own production. Average costs are calculated by reference to the cost levels experienced in the relevant month together with those in opening inventory.\n\nThe cost of raw materials and purchased components, and consumable stores, is the purchase price. The cost of work in progress and finished goods and goods for resale is generally the cost of production, including directly attributable labour costs, materials and contractor expenses, the depreciation of assets used in production and production overheads.\n\nWork in progress includes ore stockpiles and other partly processed material. Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted and is available for further processing. If there is significant uncertainty as to if and when the stockpiled ore will be processed, the cost of such ore is expensed as mined. If the ore will not be processed within 12 months after the balance sheet date, it is included within non-current assets and net realisable value is calculated on a discounted cash flow basis. Quantities of stockpiled ore are assessed primarily through surveys and assays. Certain estimates, including expected metal recoveries, are calculated using available industry, engineering and scientific data, and are periodically reassessed, taking into account technical analysis and historical performance.\n\n|                                              | 2023  US$m   | 2022 US$m   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Raw materials and purchased components       | 1,050        | 1,235       |\n| Consumable stores                            | 1,520        | 1,327       |\n| Work in progress                             | 2,467        | 2,086       |\n| Finished goods and goods for resale          | 1,836        | 1,768       |\n| Total inventories                            | 6,873        | 6,416       |\n| Comprising:                                  |              |             |\n| Expected to be used within one year          | 6,659        | 6,213       |\n| Expected to be used after more than one year | 214          | 203         |\n| Total inventories                            | 6,873        | 6,416       |\n\nDuring 2023, the Group recognised a net inventory write-off of US$60 million (2022: US$55 million write-off). This included inventory write-offs of US$94 million (2022: US$75 million) offset by a write-back of previously written down inventory due to an increase in realisable values amounting to US$34 million (2022: US$20 million).\n\nAt 31 December 2023, US$925 million (2022: US$850 million) of inventories were pledged as security for liabilities.",

Provisionally priced receivables are measured at fair value through profit or loss with subsequent fair value gains or losses taken to the income statement.\n\nAs a part of our working capital management, we offer receivables factoring and letter of credit programs for our customers/receivables. For our receivables under letter of credit programs, the business model of \"hold to collect\" has not changed and these continue to be recognised at amortised cost as the sale of the letter of credit is made close to maturity of receivables and discounting costs are immaterial. The receivables under our global factoring program do not meet the \"hold to collect\" model and therefore are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. US$475 million of receivables (2022: US$457 million) subject to factoring program and US$372 million (2022: US$430 million) of receivables subject to a letter of credit discounting program have been transferred to the participating banks and derecognised at the reporting date.\n\n|                                                                  | 2023             | 2023          | 2023        | 2022             | 2022         | 2022       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|------------|\n|                                                                  | Non-current US$m | Current  US$m | Total  US$m | Non-current US$m | Current US$m | Total US$m |\n| Trade receivables (a)                                            | -                | 2,461         | 2,461       | -                | 2,179        | 2,179      |\n| Other financial receivables (a)                                  | 234              | 548           | 782         | 124              | 462          | 586        |\n| Other receivables (b)                                            | 470              | 347           | 817         | 383              | 382          | 765        |\n| Prepayment of tolling charges to jointly controlled entities (c) | 113              | -             | 113         | 218              | -            | 218        |\n| Pension surpluses (note 28)                                      | 466              | -             | 466         | 824              | -            | 824        |\n| Other prepayments                                                | 376              | 589           | 965         | 344              | 455          | 799        |\n| Total (d)                                                        | 1,659            | 3,945         | 5,604       | 1,893            | 3,478        | 5,371      |\n\n## Credit risk related to receivables\n\nOur Commercial team manages customer credit risk by reference to our established policy, procedures and controls. The team establishes credit limits for all of our customers. Where customers are rated by an independent credit rating agency, these ratings are used as a guide to set credit limits. Where there are no independent credit ratings available, we assess the credit quality of the customer through a credit rating model and assign appropriate credit limits. The Commercial team monitors outstanding customer receivables regularly and highlights any credit concerns to senior management. Receivables to high-risk customers are often secured by letters of credit or other forms of credit enhancement.\n\nThe expected credit loss on our trade receivable portfolio is insignificant.\n\n## 18   Trade and other payables\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nTrade payables are measured at amortised cost, with the exception of provisionally priced contracts which are held at fair value as per IFRS 9.\n\nThe Group participates in supply chain finance arrangements whereby vendors may elect to receive early payment of their invoice from a thirdparty bank by factoring their receivable from Rio Tinto. These arrangements do not modify the terms of the original liability with respect to either counterparty terms, settlement date or amount due. Use of the early settlement facility is voluntary and at the vendors' discretion on an invoiceby-invoice basis. Financial liabilities subject to supply chain finance therefore continue to be classified as trade payables with the cash outflows showing in operating cash flows. At 31 December 2023, trade payables included US$821 million (2022: US$819 million) subject to early settlement election by vendors.\n\n|                                        | 2023              | 2023         | 2023       | 2022             | 2022         | 2022       |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|------------|------------------|--------------|------------|\n|                                        | Non-current  US$m | Current US$m | Total US$m | Non-current US$m | Current US$m | Total US$m |\n| Trade payables                         | -                 | 3,265        | 3,265      | 3                | 3,269        | 3,272      |\n| Other financial payables               | 238               | 913          | 1,151      | 225              | 1,083        | 1,308      |\n| Other payables                         | 56                | 208          | 264        | 63               | 131          | 194        |\n| Deferred income (a)                    | 103               | 280          | 383        | 114              | 333          | 447        |\n| Accruals                               | -                 | 1,702        | 1,702      | -                | 1,611        | 1,611      |\n| Employee entitlements                  | -                 | 992          | 992        | -                | 878          | 878        |\n| Royalties and mining taxes             | 3                 | 868          | 871        | 3                | 644          | 647        |\n| Amounts owed to equity accounted units | 196               | 10           | 206        | 196              | 98           | 294        |\n| Total                                  | 596               | 8,238        | 8,834      | 604              | 8,047        | 8,651      |\n\nThe fair value of trade payables and financial instruments within other financial payables approximates their carrying value.",

Capital is allocated in a consistent and disciplined manner. Essential capital remains our priority for capital allocation. It includes sustaining capital to ensure the integrity of our assets, high-returning replacement projects and decarbonisation investment. This is followed by ordinary dividends within our well-established returns policy. We then test investment in compelling growth projects against debt management and additional cash returns to shareholders.\n\nOur Board and senior management regularly review the capital structure and liquidity of the Group. They take into account our strategic priorities, the economic and business conditions, and any identified investment opportunities, along with the expected returns to shareholders. We expect total cash returns to shareholders over the longer term to be in a range of 40-60% of underlying earnings in aggregate through the commodity cycle.\n\nWe consider various financial metrics when managing our capital structure and liquidity risk, including total capital, net debt, gearing, the overall level of borrowings and their maturity profile, liquidity levels, future cash flows, underlying EBITDA and interest cover ratios.\n\nOur total capital as at 31 December is shown in the table below.\n\n|                                                                            | Note   | 2023  US$m   | 2022 US$m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------|-------------|\n| Equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto (see Group balance sheet)       |        | 54,586       | 50,175      |\n| Equity attributable to non-controlling interests (see Group balance sheet) |        | 1,755        | 2,099       |\n| Net debt                                                                   | 19     | 4,231        | 4,188       |\n| Total capital                                                              |        | 60,572       | 56,462      |\n\nWe have access to various forms of financing including our US Shelf Programme, European Debt Issuance Programme, Commercial Paper and credit facilities.\n\nIn 2023, we exercised our option to extend the maturity of our US$7.5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility by one year. The facility now matures in November 2028. The facility remained undrawn throughout the year. At 31 December 2023, the Group's subsidiaries had available in aggregate US$558 million (2022: US$558 million) of committed borrowing facilities; these amounts are available for use by the respective holders of each facility only and are not available for use across the Group.\n\nOur credit ratings as at 31 December, as provided by Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Services, were:\n\n|                   | 2023          | 2022          |\n|-------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Long-term rating  | A/A1          | A/A2          |\n| Short-term rating | A-1/P-1       | A-1/P-1       |\n| Outlook           | Stable/Stable | Stable/Stable |\n\nOur unified credit status is maintained through cross guarantees, which mean the contractual obligations of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited are automatically guaranteed by the other.\n\n## Financial liability analysis\n\nIn the table below, we summarise the maturity profile of our financial liabilities on our balance sheet based on contractual undiscounted payments as at 31 December. When the amount payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed is determined by reference to the conditions existing at the end of the reporting period. This will, therefore, not necessarily agree with the amounts disclosed as the carrying value.\n\n|                                                     | 2023                            | 2023                       | 2023                         | 2023               | 2023                 | 2022                            | 2022                       | 2022                         | 2022               | 2022                 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|\n| (Outflows)/Inflows                                  | Within 1 year or on demand US$m | Between 1 and 2 years US$m | Between 2  and 5  years US$m | After 5 years US$m | Total US$m           | Within 1 year or on demand US$m | Between 1 and 2 years US$m | Between 2  and 5  years US$m | After 5 years US$m | Total US$m           |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities                |                                 |                            |                              |                    |                      |                                 |                            |                              |                    |                      |\n| Trade and other financial payables (a)              | (5,769)                         | (57)                       | (68)                         | (308)              | (6,202)              | (5,971)                         | (37)                       | (57)                         | (329)              | (6,394)              |\n| Expected lease liability payments                   | (385)                           | (285)                      | (442)                        | (574)              | (1,686)              | (329)                           | (235)                      | (344)                        | (606)              | (1,514)              |\n| Borrowings before swaps                             | (845)                           | (17)                       | (2,385)                      | (10,011)           | (13,258)             | (937)                           | (1,425)                    | (1,839)                      | (7,389)            | (11,590)             |\n| Expected future interest payments (a)               | (803)                           | (781)                      | (2,156)                      | (4,886)            | (8,626)              | (668)                           | (603)                      | (1,468)                      | (3,141)            | (5,880)              |\n| Other financial liabilities                         | (4)                             | -

Our policy is to predominantly borrow in US dollars (USD) at floating interest rates, either directly or through the use of derivatives, as:\n\n- - the majority of our sales are in USD\n- - historically a lower cost of borrowing has been observed from maintaining a floating rate exposure\n- - historically there has been a correlation between interest rates and commodity prices.\n\nFor bonds with fixed interest rates, we generally enter into interest rate swaps to convert them to floating rates. The tenor of the interest rate swaps is sometimes shorter than the tenor of the bond which means we remain exposed to long-term fixed-rate funding. As interest rate swaps mature, new medium dated swaps are generally transacted to maintain this floating rate exposure; however, we may elect to maintain a proportion of fixed-rate funding after considering market conditions, the cost and form of funding and other related factors.\n\nWe have designated the swaps to be in fair value hedge relationships with the corresponding period of future interest payments of the respective debt.\n\nWhere we borrow non-US denominated debt, we generally enter into cross currency interest rate swaps to convert the principal and fixed interest coupon to a USD notional with a USD interest coupon.\n\n## Borrowings at 31 December\n\nThe characteristics and carrying value of the Group's borrowings are summarised below.\n\n|                                                                                            | Carrying  value 2023 US$m   | Carrying  value 2022 US$m   | Nominal  value of  hedged  item 2023 US$m   | Nominal  value of  hedged  item 2022 US$m   | Weighted average  interest rate  after swaps (where  applicable) (b)   | Swap  maturity  (where  applicable)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Rio Tinto Finance plc Euro Bonds 2.875% due 2024 (a)(b)(c)                                 | 452                         | 429                         | 463                                         | 546                                         | 3 month SOFR +1.90%                                                    | 2024                                  |\n| Rio Tinto Finance (USA) Limited Bonds 7.125% due 2028 (a)(b)                               | 804                         | 807                         | 750                                         | 750                                         | 3 month SOFR +3.54%                                                    | 2028                                  |\n| Alcan Inc.

        "page_content": "We refinanced the Oyu Tolgoi project finance on 16 February 2023 with a syndicate of international financial institutions, export credit agencies and commercial lenders. The lenders have agreed to a deferral of the principal repayments by three years to June 2026 and to an extension of the final maturity date by five years from 2030 to 2035. As part of refinancing, the debt transitioned to the SOFR benchmark to which we applied the Phase 2 IBOR reform relief under IFRS 9. The refinancing did not result in a derecognition of the drawn down amount; however we recognised an accounting loss on modification of US$123 million related to changes other than the benchmark transition and capitalised transaction costs incurred of US$50 million.\n\n## Update on interest rate benchmark reform\n\nWe adopted, in prior periods, Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures', IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts' and IFRS 16 'Leases'. The amendments address the financial reporting impact from reform of the LIBOR and other benchmark interest rates (collectively 'IBOR reform'). We have taken relevant practical reliefs from certain requirements relating to changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows of financial assets, financial liabilities and hedge accounting, described below. On 1 July 2023 we completed the transition of our US LIBOR derivatives to SOFR on cessation of US LIBOR at 30 June 2023. There has been no impact on our hedging arrangements because of the LIBOR reform reliefs we have taken as permitted under IFRS 9.\n\n## 21   Leases\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nIFRS 16 applies to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. Certain leases are exempt from the standard, including leases to explore for or use minerals, oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources. We apply the scope exemptions in paragraphs 3(e) and 4 of IFRS 16 and do not apply IFRS 16 to leases of any assets which would otherwise fall within the scope of IAS '38 Intangible Assets'.\n\nA significant proportion of our lease arrangements relate to dry bulk vessels and office properties. Other leases include land and non-mining rights, warehouses, ports, equipment and vehicles.\n\nWe recognise all lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet, with the exception of short-term (12 months or fewer) and low-value leases, where payments are expensed as incurred. Lease liabilities are recorded at the present value of fixed payments; variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate; amounts payable under residual value guarantees; and extension options expected to be exercised. Where a lease contains an extension option that we can exercise without negotiation, lease payments for the extension period are included in the liability if we are reasonably certain that we will exercise the option. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate are excluded from the calculation of lease liabilities at initial recognition. Payments are discounted at the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee, unless the interest rate implicit in the lease can be readily determined. For lease agreements relating to vessels, ports and properties, non-lease components are excluded from the projection of future lease payments and recorded separately within operating costs as services are being provided. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The right-of-use asset arising from a lease arrangement at initial recognition reflects the lease liability, initial direct costs, lease payments made before the commencement date of the lease, and capitalised provision for dismantling and restoration of the underlying asset, less any lease incentives.\n\nWe recognise depreciation on right-of-use assets and interest on lease liabilities in the income statement over the lease term. Repayments of lease liabilities are separated into a principal portion (presented within financing activities) and an interest portion (which the Group presents in operating activities) in the cash flow statement. Payments made before the commencement date are included within financing activities unless they in substance represent investing cash flows, for example where pre-commencement cash flows are significant relative to aggregate cash flows of the leasing arrangement.\n\n## Other relevant judgements - lease assessment\n\nWe have to apply judgement for certain contractual arrangements, such as renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs), in evaluating whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the renewable energy assets, including the right to obtain physical energy these assets generate. Based on our evaluation, we determine whether an arrangement is a lease, an executory contract or a derivative. An immaterial amount was recognised as a lease at year end for a fixed component of the QMM renewable PPA. Amrun PPA is a lease, which has not yet commenced and is included in capital commitments (note 37).\n\n## Lessee arrangements\n\nWe have made the following payments during the year associated with leases:\n\n| Description of payment                                 | Included within                      |   2023 US$m |   2022 US$m |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Principal lease payments                               | Cash flows from financing activities |         426 |         374 |\n| Interest payments on leases                            | Cash flows from operating activities |          50 |          47 |\n| Payments for short-term leases                         | Net operating costs                  |         269 |         465 |\n| Payments for variable lease components                 | Net operating costs                  |          40 |          50 |\n| Payments for low value leases (>12 months in duration) | Net operating costs                  |           3 |           1 |\n| Total lease payments                                   | Total lease payments                 |         788 |         937 |",

These commitments are not included in the lease maturity profile table above.\n\n## 22  Cash and cash equivalents\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nFor the purpose of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents covers cash on hand, deposits held with banks, and short-term, highly liquid investments (mainly money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements) that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts are shown as current liabilities on the balance sheet. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of overdrafts.\n\n|                                                                              | Note   | 2023  US$m   | 2022 US$m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------|-------------|\n| Cash at bank and in hand                                                     |        | 1,843        | 1,889       |\n| Money market funds, reverse repurchase agreements and other cash equivalents |        | 7,830        | 4,886       |\n| Total cash and cash equivalents per Group balance sheet                      |        | 9,673        | 6,775       |\n| Bank overdrafts repayable on demand (unsecured)                              | 20     | (1)          | (1)         |\n| Total cash and cash equivalents per Group cash flow statement                |        | 9,672        | 6,774       |\n\n## Restricted cash and cash equivalent analysis\n\nCash and cash equivalents of US$422 million (2022: US$391 million) are held in countries where there are restrictions on remittances. Of this balance, US$156 million (2022: US$268 million) could be used to repay subsidiaries' third-party borrowings.\n\nThere are also restrictions on a further US$553 million (2022: US$576 million) of cash and cash equivalents, the majority of which is held by partially owned subsidiaries and is not available for use in the wider Group due to legal and contractual restrictions currently in place. Of this balance US$129 million (2022: US$336 million) could be used to repay these subsidiaries' third-party borrowings.\n\n## Credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents\n\nOur Treasury team manages credit risk from our investing activities in accordance with a credit risk framework which sets the risk appetite. We make investments of surplus funds only with approved investment grade (BBB+ and above) counterparties who have been assigned specific credit limits. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of credit risk and therefore mitigate the potential for financial loss through counterparty failure.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, we held US$2,775 million (2022: US$850 million) of reverse repurchase agreements, measured at amortised cost and reported within cash and cash equivalents as they are highly liquid products maturing within three months. We accepted collateral of investment grade quality in respect of these reverse repurchase agreements, with a fair value of US$2,924 million as at 31 December 2023 (2022: US$892 million). Collateral is not recognised on our balance sheet and if the counterparty were to default we would be able to sell it.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2023 financial statements\n\n## 24  Financial instruments and risk management continued\n\n## Financial risk management objectives\n\nOur financial risk management objectives are:\n\n- - to have in place a robust capital structure to manage the organisation through the commodity cycle\n- - to allow our financial exposures, mainly commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rates to, in general, float with the market.\n\nOur Treasury and Commercial teams manage the following key economic risks generated from our operations:\n\n- - capital and liquidity risk\n- - credit risk\n- - interest rate risk\n- - commodity price risk\n- - foreign exchange risk.\n\nThese teams operate under a strong control environment, within approved limits.\n\n## (i) Capital and liquidity risk\n\nOur capital and liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to settle or meet our obligations as they fall due. Refer to our capital and liquidity section on page 204.\n\n## (ii) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that our customers, or institutions that we hold investments with, are unable to meet their contractual obligations. We are exposed to credit risk in our operating activities (primarily from customer trade receivables); and from our investing activities that include government securities (primarily US Government), corporate and asset-backed securities, reverse re-purchase agreements, money market funds, and balances with banks and financial institutions. Refer to note 17, note 22 and note 23 for an understanding of the size of, and the credit risk related to, each balance.\n\n## (iii) Interest rate risk\n\nOur interest rate management policy is generally to borrow and invest at floating interest rates. However, we may elect to maintain a proportion of fixed-rate funding after considering market conditions, the cost and form of funding and other related factors. After the impact of hedging, 68% (2022: 77%) of our borrowings (including leases) were at floating rates. To understand how we manage interest rate risk, refer to note 20.\n\n## Sensitivity to interest rate changes\n\nBased on our floating rate financial instruments outstanding at 31 December 2023, the effect on our net earnings of a 100 basis point increase in US dollar Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would be an expense of US$5 million (2022: US$26 million). This reflects the net debt position in 2023 and 2022.\n\nWe are also exposed to interest rate volatility within shareholders' equity. This is because we have designated some cross currency interest rate swaps to be in a cash flow hedge relationship with our 2029 British pound sterling (GBP) loan. As we receive fixed GBP interest and pay fixed United States dollar (USD) interest any change in the GBP interest rate or the USD interest rate will have an impact on the fair value of the derivative within shareholders' equity. With all factors remaining constant, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates in each of the currencies in isolation would impact equity, before tax, by a charge of US$33 million (2022: US$35 million) for GBP and a credit of US$42 million (2022: US$48 million) for USD. A 100 basis point decrease would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.\n\n## (iv) Commodity price risk\n\nOur broad commodity base means our exposure to commodity prices is diversified. Our normal policy is to sell our products at prevailing market prices. For certain physical commodity transactions for which the price was fixed at the contract date, we enter into derivatives to achieve the prevailing market prices at the point of revenue recognition. We do not generally consider that using derivatives to fix commodity prices would provide a long-term benefit to our shareholders.\n\nExceptions to this rule are subject to limits, and to defined market risk tolerances and internal controls.\n\nSubstantially all iron ore and aluminium sales are reflected at final prices at each reporting period. Final prices for copper concentrate, however, are normally determined between 30 and 180 days after delivery to our customer.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, we had 92 million pounds of copper sales (31 December 2022: 83 million pounds), that were provisionally priced at US 387 cents per pound (2022: US 380 cents per pound). The final price of these sales will be determined during the first half of 2024. A 10% change in the price of copper realised on the provisionally priced sales, with all other factors held constant, would increase or reduce net earnings by US$22 million (2022: US$19 million).\n\nPower costs represent a significant portion of costs in our aluminium business and, therefore, we are exposed to fluctuations in power prices.\n\nTo mitigate our exposure to changes in the relationship between aluminium prices and power prices, we have a number of electricity purchase contracts that are directly linked to the daily official LME cash ask price for high-grade aluminium (LME price) and to the US Midwest Transaction Premium (Midwest premium).\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, we apply hedge accounting to two embedded derivatives within our power contracts. The embedded derivatives (notional aluminium forward sales) have been designated as the hedging instrument. The forecast aluminium sales, priced using the LME price and the Midwest premium, represent the hedged item.\n\nThe hedging ratio is 1:1, as the quantity of sales designated as being hedged matches the notional amount of the hedging instrument. The hedging instrument's notional amount, expressed in equivalent metric tonnes of aluminium, is derived from our expected electricity consumption under the power contracts as well as other relevant contract parameters.",

        "page_content": "When we designate such embedded derivatives as the hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge, we recognise the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument in other comprehensive income, and it is accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve. The amount that is recognised in other comprehensive income is limited to the lesser of the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item, in absolute terms. On realisation of the hedges, realised amounts are reclassified from reserves to consolidated sales revenue in the income statement.\n\nWe recognise any ineffectiveness relating to the hedging relationship immediately in the income statement.\n\nSources of ineffectiveness include differences in the timing of the cash flows between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, non-zero initial fair value of the hedging instrument, the existence of a cap on the Midwest premium in the hedging instrument and counterparty credit risk.\n\nWe held the following notional aluminium forward sales

Any change in price will result in an offsetting change in our future earnings.\n\n|                        | Change in market prices   | 2023  US$m   | 2022 US$m   |\n|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Effect on net earnings | +10 %                     | (52)         | (57)        |\n|                        | (10) %                    | 67           | 83          |\n| Effect on equity       | +10 %                     | (81)         | (90)        |\n|                        | (10) %                    | 70           | 65          |\n\nWe exclude our 'own use contracts' from this sensitivity analysis as they are outside the scope of IFRS 9. Our business units continue to hold these types of contracts to satisfy their expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.\n\n## Impact of climate change on our business - Upper Calliope Solar Farm power purchase agreement in Queensland\n\nOn 22 December 2023, as part of the program to develop renewable energy solutions for our Queensland aluminium assets, we entered into a long-term renewable 1.1GW power purchase agreement to buy renewable electricity and associated green products to be generated in the future from Upper Calliope Solar Farm. The contract is accounted for as a financial derivative with a zero fair value at inception and an immaterial fair value at year-end. It will require complex derivative measurement over the contract's term categorised under level 3 with significant unobservable inputs related to future energy prices.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2023 financial statements\n\n## 24  Financial instruments and risk management continued\n\n## (v) Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe broad geographic spread of our sales and operations means that our earnings, cash flows and shareholders' equity are influenced by a wide variety of currencies. The majority of our sales are denominated in USD.\n\nOur operating costs are influenced by the currencies of those countries where our mines and processing plants are located, and by those currencies in which we buy imported equipment and services. The USD, the Australian dollar (AUD) and the Canadian dollar (CAD) are the most important currencies influencing our costs. In any particular year, currency fluctuations may have a significant impact on our financial results. A strengthening of the USD against the currencies in which our costs are partly denominated has a positive effect on our net earnings. However, a strengthening of the USD reduces the value of non-USD denominated net assets, and therefore total equity.\n\nIn most cases our debt and other financial assets and liabilities, including intragroup balances, are held in the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. There are instances where these balances are held in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. This means we recognise exchange gains and losses in our income statement (except where they can be taken to equity) as these balances are translated into the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. Our income statement also includes exchange gains and losses arising on USD net debt and intragroup balances. On consolidation, these balances are retranslated to our USD presentational currency and there is a corresponding and offsetting exchange difference recognised directly in the currency translation reserve. There is no impact on total equity.\n\nUnder normal market conditions, we do not consider that active currency hedging of transactions would provide long-term benefits to shareholders. We review our exposure on a regular basis and will undertake hedging if deemed appropriate. We may deem currency protection measures appropriate in specific commercial circumstances. Capital expenditures and other significant financial items such as acquisitions, disposals, tax and dividend cash flows may be economically hedged.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe table below shows the estimated retranslation effect on financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December, including intragroup balances, of a 10% strengthening in the closing exchange rate of the USD against significant currencies. We deem 10% to be the annual exchange rate movement that is reasonably probable (on an annual basis over the long run) for any of our significant currencies and therefore an appropriate representation for the sensitivity analysis.\n\n|                   | 2023                            | 2023                        | 2023                            | 2022                            | 2022                         | 2022                            |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Currency exposure | Closing exchange  rate US cents | Effect on net earnings US$m | Impact directly on  equity US$m | Closing exchange  rate US cents | Effect on net  earnings US$m | Impact directly on  equity US$m |\n| Australian dollar | 69                              | 228                         | (1,036)                         | 68                              | (319)                        | (986)                           |\n| Canadian dollar   | 76                              | (361)                       | -                               | 74                              | (219)                        | -                               |\n\nWe calculate sensitivities in relation to the functional currencies of our individual entities. We translate the impact of these on net earnings into USD at the exchange rates on which the sensitivities are based. The impact to net earnings associated with a 10% weakening of a particular currency, shown above, is broadly offset within equity through movements in the currency translation reserve and therefore generally has no impact on our net assets. The offsetting currency translation movement is not shown in the table above. The impact is expressed in terms of the effect on net earnings and equity, assuming that each exchange rate moves in isolation. The sensitivities are based on financial assets and financial liabilities held at 31 December 2023, where balances are not denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary or joint operation, and exclude financial assets and liabilities held by equity accounted units. These balances will not remain constant throughout 2024 and therefore this illustrative information should be used with caution.",

Changing the level 3 inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions does not change the fair value significantly, taking into account the expected remaining term of contracts for either reported period. The fair value of these derivatives is a net liability of US$186 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: US$208 million).\n\n## Impact of climate change on our business - coal royalty receivables\n\nAt 31 December 2023, royalty receivables include amounts arising from our divested coal businesses with a carrying value of US$214 million (2022: US$209 million). These are classified as 'Other investments, including loans' within note 23. The fair values are determined using level 3 unobservable inputs. These royalty receivables include US$90 million from forecast production beyond 2030. These have not been adjusted for potential changes in production rates that could occur due to climate change targets impacting the operator.\n\nThe main unobservable input is the long-term coal price used over the life of these royalty receivables. A 15% increase in the coal spot price would result in a US$64 million increase (2022: US$68 million) in the carrying value. A 15% decrease in the coal spot price would result in a US$39 million decrease (2022: US$18 million) in the carrying value. We have used a 15% assumption to calculate our exposure as it represents the annual coal price movement that we deem to be reasonably probable (on an annual basis over the long run).\n\n## Fair values disclosure of financial instruments\n\nThe following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of our borrowings including those which are not carried at an amount which approximates their fair value at 31 December. The fair values of some of our financial instruments approximate their carrying values because of their short maturity, or because they carry floating rates of interest.\n\n|                                         | 2023                | 2023            | 2022                | 2022            |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n|                                         | Carrying value US$m | Fair value US$m | Carrying value US$m | Fair value US$m |\n| Listed bonds                            | 8,607               | 8,672           | 6,631               | 6,649           |\n| Oyu Tolgoi project finance              | 3,850               | 4,090           | 3,770               | 3,928           |\n| Other                                   | 544                 | 494             | 670                 | 615             |\n| Total borrowings (including overdrafts) | 13,001              | 13,256          | 11,071              | 11,192          |\n\nBorrowings relating to listed bonds are categorised as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy while those relating to project finance drawn down by Oyu Tolgoi use a number of level 3 valuation inputs. Our remaining borrowings have a fair value measured by discounting estimated cash flows with an applicable market quoted yield, and are categorised as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.",

The awards are settled in equity.\n\n## Equity Incentive Plan\n\nSince 2018, all long-term incentive awards have been granted under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan which allows for awards in the form of Performance Share Awards (PSA), Management Share Awards (MSA) and Bonus Deferral Awards (BDA) to be granted. In general, these awards will be settled in equity, including the dividends accumulated from date of award to vesting and therefore the awards are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.\n\n## Performance Share Awards\n\nParticipants are generally assigned shares in settlement of their PSA on vesting. Therefore the awards are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying to equity-settled share-based payment transactions, including the dividends accumulated from date of award to vesting.\n\nThe awards are subject to Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance conditions, as set out in the Remuneration Report. The fair value of the awards is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model taking into account the TSR performance conditions. Forfeitures prior to vesting are assumed at 5% per annum of outstanding awards (2022: 5% per annum).\n\n## Management Share Awards\n\nThe vesting of these awards is dependent on service conditions being met; no performance conditions apply.\n\nThe fair value of each award on the day of grant is based on the share price on the day of grant. Forfeitures prior to vesting are assumed at 7% per annum of outstanding awards (2022: 7% per annum).\n\n## Bonus Deferral Awards\n\nBonus Deferral Awards provide for the mandatory deferral of 50% of the bonuses for Executive Directors and Executive Committee members.\n\nThe vesting of these awards is dependent only on service conditions being met. The fair value of each award on the day of grant is based on the share price on the day of grant. Forfeitures prior to vesting are assumed at 3% per annum of outstanding awards (2022: 3% per annum).\n\n## Global Employee Share Plans\n\nThe Global Employee Share Plans were introduced in 2012 and reapproved by shareholders in 2021. Under these plans, the companies provide a Matching share award for each Investment share purchased by a participant. The vesting of Matching awards is dependent on service conditions being met and the continued holding of Investment shares by the participant until vesting. These awards are settled in equity including the dividends accumulated from date of award to vesting. The fair value of each Matching share on the day of grant is equal to the share price on the date of purchase less a deduction of 15% (5% per annum) for estimated cancellations (caused by employees withdrawing their Investment shares prior to vesting) in addition to a deduction for forfeitures prior to vesting which are assumed at 5% per annum of outstanding awards (2022: 5% per annum).\n\nThe PSA, MSA, BDA and awards under the Global Employee Share Plans and UK Share Plan together represent 100% (2022: 100%) of the total IFRS 2 'Share-based Payment' charge for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited plans in 2023.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nThese plans are accounted for in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of IFRS 2.\n\nThe fair value of the Group's share plans is recognised as an expense over the expected vesting period with an offset to retained earnings for Rio Tinto plc plans and to other reserves for Rio Tinto Limited plans.\n\nThe Group uses fair values provided by independent actuaries calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.\n\nThe terms of each plan are considered at the balance sheet date to determine whether the plan should be accounted for as equity-settled or cash-settled. The Group does not operate any material plans as cash-settled although certain awards can be settled in cash at the discretion of the directors or where settling awards in equity is challenging or prohibited by local laws and regulations. The value of these awards is immaterial.\n\nThe Group's equity-settled share plans are settled either by the issuance of shares by the relevant parent company; the purchase of shares on market; or the use of shares held in treasury. If the cost of shares acquired to satisfy the plans differs from the expense charged, the difference is taken to retained earnings or other reserves, as appropriate.\n\nThe charge that has been recognised in the income statement for Rio Tinto's share-based incentive plans, and the related liability (for cashsettled awards), is set out in the table below.\n\n|                       | Charge recognised for the year   | Charge recognised for the year   | Liability at the end of the year   | Liability at the end of the year   | Liability at the end of the year   |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                       | 2023  US$m                       | 2022 US$m                        | 2021 US$m                          | 2023  US$m                         | 2022 US$m                          |\n| Equity-settled awards | 140                              | 117                              | 122                                | -                                  | -                                  |\n| Cash-settled awards   | 4                                | 5                                | 4                                  | 6                                  | 7                                  |\n| Total                 | 144                              | 122                              | 126                                | 6                                  | 7                                  |",

The total liability for these awards at 31 December 2023 was US$5 million (2022: US$5 million).\n\n## 28  Post-retirement benefits\n\n## Description of plans\n\nThe Group operates a number of pension and post-retirement healthcare plans which provide lump sums, pensions, medical benefits and life insurance to retirees. Some of these plans are defined contribution and some are defined benefit, with assets held in separate trusts, foundations and similar entities.\n\nDefined benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare plans expose the Group to a number of risks.\n\n| Uncertainty in benefit  payments   | The value of the Group's liabilities for post-retirement benefits will ultimately depend on the amount of benefits paid out. This in turn will depend on the level of future pay increases, the level of inflation (for those benefits that are subject to some form  of inflation protection) and how long individuals live.                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Volatility in asset values         | The Group is exposed to future movements in the values of assets held in pension plans to meet future benefit payments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Uncertainty in cash funding        | Movements in the values of the obligations or assets may result in the Group being required to provide higher levels of cash  funding, although changes in the level of cash required can often be spread over a number of years. In some countries control  over the rate of cash funding or over the investment policy for pension assets might rest to some extent with a trustee body or  other body that is not under the Group's direct control. In addition the Group is also exposed to adverse changes in pension |\n\nFor these reasons, the Group has a policy of moving away from defined benefit pension provisions and towards defined contribution arrangements. The defined benefit pension plans for non-unionised employees are closed to new entrants in all countries. For unionised employees, some plans remain open.\n\nThe Group does not usually participate in multi-employer plans in which the risks are shared with other companies using those plans. The Group's participation in such plans is immaterial and therefore no detailed disclosures are provided in this note.",

Eligibility for coverage is dependent upon certain age and service criteria. These arrangements are unfunded, and are included in the reported defined benefit obligations.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nFor post-employment defined benefit schemes, in accordance with IAS 19 'Employee Benefits', local actuaries calculate the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan obligations using a variety of valuation techniques dependent on the type of asset or liability. The difference is recognised as an asset or liability in the balance sheet.\n\nWhere appropriate, the recognition of assets may be restricted to the present value of any amounts the Group expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions. In determining the extent to which a refund will be available the Group considers whether any third party, such as a trustee or pension committee, has the power to enhance benefits or to wind up a pension plan without the Group's consent.\n\nThe current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any curtailment or settlements and the interest cost less interest income on assets held in the plans are recognised in the income statement. Actuarial gains/(losses) and returns from assets are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.\n\nAll amounts charged to the income statement in respect of these plans are included within 'Net operating costs' or in 'Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units', as appropriate.\n\n## Plan assets\n\nThe assets of the pension plans are invested predominantly in a diversified range of bonds, equities, property and qualifying insurance policies. Consequently, the funding level of the pension plans is affected by movements in interest rates and also in the level of equity markets. The Group monitors its exposure to changes in interest rates and equity markets and also measures its balance sheet pension risk using a value at risk approach. These measures are considered when deciding whether significant changes in investment strategy are required.\n\nInvestment strategy reviews are conducted on a periodic basis to determine the optimal investment mix. This is performed while bearing in mind the risk tolerance of the Group and local sponsor companies, and the views of the Pension Committees and trustee boards who are legally responsible for the plans' investments. The assets of the pension plans may also be invested in qualifying insurance policies which provide a stream of payments to match the benefits being paid out by the plans. This would therefore remove the investment, inflation and longevity risks.\n\nIn Canada, the UK and Switzerland, the Group works with the governing bodies to ensure that the investment policy adopted is consistent with the Group's tolerance for risk. In the US the Group has direct control over the investment policy, subject to local investment regulations.",

In October 2023, the trustee of the Rio Tinto 2009 Pension Fund purchased a buy-in contract for US$1.7 billion, largely through an in specie transfer of assets. The value of those policies is calculated by the local actuaries using assumptions consistent with those adopted for valuing the insured obligations.\n\n- (g) The Group makes limited use of futures, repurchase agreements and other instruments to manage the interest rate risk in some of its plans. Fund managers may also use derivatives to hedge currency movements within their portfolios and, in the case of bond managers, to take positions that could be taken using direct holdings of bonds but more efficiently. Exposure to these instruments is closely monitored and maintained at a level that does not endanger the liquidity of any pension plan.\n\nThe assets of the plans are managed on a day-to-day basis by external specialist fund managers. These managers may invest in the Group's securities subject to limits imposed by the relevant fiduciary committees and local legislation. The approximate total holding of Group securities within the plans is US$2 million (2022: US$2 million).",

See note 26.\n\n## Funding policy and contributions to plans\n\nThe Group reviews the funding position of its pension plans on a regular basis and considers whether to provide funding above the minimum level required in each country. In Canada and the US the minimum level is prescribed by legislation. In the UK and Switzerland the minimum level is negotiated with the local trustee in accordance with the funding guidance issued by the local regulators. In deciding whether to provide funding above the minimum level, we consider other possible uses of cash elsewhere, the local sponsoring entity's tax situation and any strategic advantage we might obtain. The Group does not generally pre-fund post-retirement healthcare arrangements.\n\n|                                             | 2023                  | 2023                | 2022 2021   | 2022 2021   | 2022 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                             | Pension benefits US$m | Other benefits US$m | Total US$m  | Total US$m  | Total US$m  |\n| Contributions to defined benefit plans      | 205                   | 32                  | 237         | 211         | 464         |\n| Contributions to defined contribution plans | 408                   | 2                   | 410         | 363         | 311         |\n| Total                                       | 613                   | 34                  | 647         | 574         | 775         |\n\nThe level of surplus in the Rio Tinto Pension Fund in the UK is such that it may be used to pay for the employer contributions to the defined contribution section of that Fund, in accordance with the funding arrangements agreed with the Trustee of that Fund. Consequently, the cash paid to defined contribution plans is lower than the defined contribution service cost by US$6 million. Contributions to defined benefit pension plans are kept under regular review and actual contributions will be determined in line with the Group's wider financing strategy, taking into account relevant minimum funding requirements.\n\nIn 2021, additional cash of US$294 million was paid in order to settle pension obligations in France. This amount was paid to an external insurer, along with the transfer of existing pension assets in order to transfer the obligations to that insurer.\n\nAs contributions to many plans are reviewed on at least an annual basis, the contributions for 2024 and subsequent years cannot be determined precisely in advance. Most of the Group's largest pension funds are fully funded on their local funding basis and at present do not require longterm funding commitments. Contributions to defined benefit pension plans for 2024 are estimated to be around US$70 million but may be higher or lower than this depending on the evolution of financial markets and voluntary funding decisions taken by the Group. Contributions for subsequent years are expected to be at similar levels. Healthcare plans are generally unfunded and contributions for future years will be equal to benefit payments net of participant contributions. The Group's contributions for healthcare plans in 2024 are expected to be similar to the amounts paid in 2023.",

In determining the extent to which the asset ceiling has an effect, the Group considers the funding legislation in each country and the rules specific to each pension plan. The calculation takes into account any minimum funding requirements that may be applicable to the plan, whether any reduction in future Group contributions is available, and whether a refund of surplus may be available. In considering whether any refund of surplus is available, the Group considers the powers of trustee boards and similar bodies to augment benefits or wind up a plan. Where such powers are unilateral, the Group does not consider a refund to be available at the end of the life of a plan. Where the plan rules and legislation both permit the employer to take a refund of surplus, the asset ceiling may have no effect, although it may be the case that a refund will only be available many years in the future.",

The most significant assumptions used in accounting for pension plans are:\n\n- - The discount rate - used to determine the net present value of the obligations, the interest cost on the obligations and the interest income on plan assets. We use the yield from high-quality corporate bonds with maturities and terms that match those of the postemployment obligations as closely as possible. Where there is no developed corporate bond market in a currency, the rate on government bonds is used.\n- - The long-term inflation rate - used to project increases in future benefit payments for those plans that have benefits linked to inflation. The assumption regarding future inflation is based on market yields on inflation linked instruments, where possible, combined with consensus views.\n- - The mortality rates - used to project the period over which benefits will be paid, which is then discounted to arrive at the net present value of the obligations. The Group reviews the actual mortality rates of retirees in its major pension plans on a regular basis and uses these rates to set its current mortality assumptions. It also uses its judgement with respect to allowances for future improvements in longevity having regard to standard improvement scales in each relevant country and after taking external actuarial advice.\n\nThe weighted-average assumptions used for the valuation at year end are summarised below:\n\n|                              | Canada   | UK   | US   | Switzerland   |\n|------------------------------|----------|------|------|---------------|\n| At 31 December 2023          |          |      |      |               |\n| Discount rate                | 4.6%     | 4.5% | 4.8% | 1.5%          |\n| Long-term inflation (a)      | 1.9%     | 3.1% | 2.2% | 1.2%          |\n| Rate of increase in pensions | 0.2%     | 2.6% | -%   | 2.3%          |\n| At 31 December 2022          |          |      |      |               |\n| Discount rate                | 5.0%     | 4.9% | 5.3% | 2.3%          |\n| Long-term inflation (a)      | 2.1%     | 3.3% | 2.4% | 1.2%          |\n| Rate of increase in pensions | 0.5%     | 2.8% | -%   | 3.4%          |\n\nThe main financial assumptions used for the healthcare plans, which are predominantly in the US and Canada, were: discount rate: 5.0% (2022: 5.4%); medical trend rate: 8.3% reducing to 4.7% by the year 2032 broadly on a straight line basis (2022: 7.1%, reducing to 4.8% by the year 2031); claims costs based on individual company experience.\n\nFor both the pension and healthcare arrangements, the post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in longevity. The mortality tables used imply that a man aged 60 at the balance sheet date has a weighted average expected future lifetime of 27 years (2022: 27 years) and that a man aged 60 in 2041 would have a weighted average expected future lifetime of 28 years (2022: 28 years). The mortality tables are generally based upon the latest standard tables published in each country, adjusted appropriately to reflect the actual mortality experience of the plan participants where credible data is available. Adjustments have been made to some of our plans within the demographic assumptions for the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe values reported for the defined benefit obligations are sensitive to the actuarial assumptions used for projecting future benefit payments and discounting those payments. In order to estimate the sensitivity of the obligations to changes in assumptions, we calculate what the obligations would be if we were to make changes to each of the key assumptions in isolation. The difference between this figure and the figure calculated using our stated assumptions is an indication of the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in each assumption. The results of this sensitivity analysis are summarised in the table below. Note that this approach is valid for small changes in the assumptions but will be less accurate for larger changes in the assumptions. The sensitivity to inflation includes the impact on pension increases, which are generally linked to inflation where they are granted.\n\n|                                                               |                                                                                           | 2023 Approximate (increase)/   | 2023 Approximate (increase)/   | 2022 Approximate (increase)/ decrease in obligations   | 2022 Approximate (increase)/ decrease in obligations   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Assumption                                                    | Change in assumption                                                                      | Pensions US$m                  | Other US$m                     | Pensions US$m                                          | Other US$m                                             |\n| Discount rate                                                 | Increase of 0.5 percentage points                                                         | 460                            | 31                             | 483                                                    | 32                                                     |\n|                                                               | Decrease of 0.5 percentage points                                                         | (514)                          | (33)                           | (510)                                                  | (34)                                                   |\n| Long-term inflation                                           | Increase of 0.5 percentage points                                                         | (183)                          | (9)                            | (174)                                                  | (10)                                                   |\n|                                                               | Decrease of 0.5 percentage points                                                         | 176                            | 8                              | 168                                                    | 9                                                      |\n| Demographic - allowance for future  improvements in longevity | Participants assumed to have the mortality rates of individuals  who are one year older   | 244                            | 7                              | 241                                                    | 8                                                      |\n|                                                               | Participants assumed to have the mortality rates of individuals  who are one year younger | (244)                          | (7)                            | (241)                                                  | (8)                                                    |",

In assessing the Pilbara Iron Arrangements, it has been concluded that they collectively constitute a joint operation on the basis that decisions about relevant activities require unanimous consent. The resulting efficiencies are shared between Rio Tinto and Robe River Iron Associates (Robe River), and the parties fund all of the cash flow requirements of Pilbara Iron (Company) Services Pty Ltd and Pilbara Iron Pty Ltd.\n\nEach of the partners in the joint operation is able to request the other to construct assets on their tenure to increase the capacity of the rail and port infrastructure network. The requesting partner's (Asset User's) share of the capacity of the network will increase by the capacity of the newly constructed asset, but generally that capacity may be provided from any of the network assets. The Asset User will pay an annual charge, Committed Use Charge (CUC) over a contractually specified period irrespective of network usage. The constructing partner (Asset Owner) has an ongoing obligation to make available capacity from those assets and to maintain the assets in good working order as required under relevant State Agreements and associated tenure. The arrangements are managed through two wholly-owned subsidiaries: Pilbara Iron (Company) Services Pty Ltd and Pilbara Iron Pty Ltd.\n\nWe have also considered whether the CUC arrangements give rise to a lease between the Asset Owner and the Asset User. We have concluded that they do not, as there is no specified asset; rather the Asset User has a first priority right to the capacity in the CUC asset. This treatment was grandfathered on adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, following an assessment under the preceding standards IAS 17 'Leases' and IFRIC 4 'Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease', with no change to the conclusion under IFRS 16 for subsequent expenditure subject to the existing CUC arrangements. Management considers that these arrangements are unique and has used judgement to apply the principles of IFRS to the accounting for the arrangements as described above. The obligation of the Asset Owner to make capacity available is fulfilled over time and not at a point in time. The CUC arrangement is therefore an executory contract as defined under IAS 37, whereby neither party has performed any of its obligations, or both parties have partially performed their obligations to an equal extent, and so the CUC payments are expensed as incurred. An alternative interpretation of the fact pattern could have resulted in a gross presentation in the Group's balance sheet with an asset and a corresponding liability to reflect the present value of the CUC payments. The Asset User is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto, whereas the Asset Owner is a joint operation. This impact would be some US$1,009 million (calculated on the basis of grossing up the tax written down value of the CUC assets).

We have based this on the nature of significant commercial decisions, including those in relation to capital expenditure, which require approval of both Rio Tinto and its partner BHP (holders of a 57.5% interest). In contrast, our partner has assessed Rio Tinto's rights as protective and concluded that it controls Escondida through its rights to direct relevant activities. Adoption of the equivalent judgement by the Group would result in reclassification of Escondida from a joint venture to an associate, with no other financial reporting consequence since accounting under the equity method would remain in place.",

If purchased Rio Tinto plc shares are cancelled, an amount equal to the nominal value of the cancelled share is credited to the capital redemption reserve.\n\n## Rio Tinto plc\n\n|                                                                     | 2023  Number (million)   | 2022 Number (million)   | 2021 Number (million)   | 2023  US$m   | 2022 US$m   | 2021 US$m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Issued and fully paid up share capital of 10p each                  |                          |                         |                         |              |             |             |\n| At 1 January                                                        | 1,255.845                | 1,255.795               | 1,255.756               | 207          | 207         | 207         |\n| Ordinary shares issued under the Global Employee Share plan  (GESP) | 0.047                    | 0.050                   | 0.039                   | -            | -           | -           |\n| Shares purchased and cancelled (a)                                  | -                        | -                       | -                       | -            | -           | -           |\n| At 31 December                                                      | 1,255.892                | 1,255.845               | 1,255.795               | 207          | 207         | 207         |\n| Shares held by public                                               |                          |                         |                         |              |             |             |\n| At 1 January                                                        | 1,249.655                | 1,248.141               | 1,246.904               |              |             |             |\n| Shares reissued from treasury under the GESP                        | 1.619                    | 1.464                   | 1.198                   |              |             |             |\n| Ordinary shares issued under the GESP                               | 0.047                    | 0.050                   | 0.039                   |              |             |             |\n| Shares purchased and cancelled (a)                                  | -                        | -                       | -                       |              |             |             |\n| At 31 December                                                      | 1,251.321                | 1,249.655               | 1,248.141               |              |             |             |\n| Shares held in treasury                                             | 4.571                    | 6.190                   | 7.654                   |              |             |             |\n| Shares held by public                                               | 1,251.321                | 1,249.655               | 1,248.141               |              |             |             |\n| Total share capital                                                 | 1,255.892                | 1,255.845               | 1,255.795               |              |             |             |\n| Other share classes                                                 |                          |                         |                         |              |             |             |\n| Special Voting Share of 10p each (b)                                | 1 only                   | 1 only                  | 1 only                  |              |             |             |\n| DLC Dividend Share of 10p each (b)                                  | 1 only                   | 1 only                  | 1 only                  |              |             |             |\n\nDuring 2023, US$17 million of shares and ADRs (2022: US$16 million; 2021: US$18 million) were purchased by employee share ownership trusts on behalf of Rio Tinto plc to satisfy employee share awards on vesting.

These are quantified unless, in our judgement, the amount cannot be reliably estimated. The unit of account for claims is the matter taken as a whole and therefore when a provision has been recorded for the best estimate of the cost to settle the obligation there is no further contingent liability component. This means that when a provision is recognised for the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation from a single past event, a further contingent liability is not reported for the maximum potential exposure in excess of that already provided.\n\nWe have not established provisions for certain additional legal claims in cases where we have assessed that a payment is either not probable or cannot be reliably estimated. A number of our companies are, and will likely continue to be, subject to various legal proceedings and investigations that arise from time to time. As a result, the Group may become subject to substantial liabilities that could affect our business, financial position and reputation. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and large judgements may at times occur. The Group may in the future incur judgements or enter into settlements of claims that could lead to material cash outflows. We do not believe that any of these proceedings will have a materially adverse effect on our financial position.\n\n## Contingent liabilities (subsidiaries, joint operations, joint ventures and associates)\n\n|                                                                          |   2023  US$m |   2022 US$m |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Contingent liabilities, indemnities and other performance guarantees (a) |          435 |         498 |",

Without admitting to or  denying the SEC's findings, Rio Tinto paid a US$15 million civil penalty for violations of the books and  records and internal controls provisions of the  Foreign Corrupt Practices Act . In August 2023, the  UK Serious Fraud Office announced that it was not in the public interest to proceed with a  prosecution and closed its case. It also announced that the Australian Federal Police maintains a live  investigation into the matter. Rio Tinto continues to co-operate fully with relevant authorities in |\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the outcome of this investigation remains uncertain, but it could ultimately expose the Group to material financial cost. We believe this case is unwarranted and will defend the allegation vigorously. A dedicated Board committee continues to monitor the progress of this matter, as appropriate.\n\nIn November 2023, we reached a court approved settlement with the SEC in relation to Rio Tinto's disclosures and timing of the impairment of Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique (RTCM), which was reflected in Rio Tinto's 2012 year-end accounts. This was previously disclosed as a contingent liability - not quantifiable at 31 December 2022. Without admitting to or denying the SEC's allegations related to its books, records and reporting requirements, Rio Tinto paid a US$28 million penalty and agreed to retain an independent consultant to advise on its current policies, procedures, and controls related to impairment, disclosures and project risk. Rio Tinto settled claims brought by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission in 2022 and the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority in 2017 relating to the same RTCM impairment. The U.S. Court who approved the SEC settlement previously dismissed a related private putative securities class action in 2019. An appeals court affirmed the dismissal.\n\nFormer Chief Executive Tom Albanese has also reached a settlement with the SEC and will pay a US$50,000 penalty, without admitting to or denying the allegations related to books and records and internal controls.\n\nWith this settlement, all investigations of Rio Tinto regarding this matter have been finalised.\n\n## Other contingent liabilities\n\nWe continue to modernise agreements with Traditional Owner groups in response to the Juukan Gorge incident. We have created provisions, within 'Other provisions', based on our best estimate of historical claims. However, the process is incomplete and it is possible that further claims could arise relating to past events.\n\nClose-down and restoration provisions are not recognised for those operations that have no known restrictions on their lives as the date of closure cannot be reliably estimated. This applies primarily to our Canadian aluminium smelters, which are not dependent upon a specific orebody and have access to indefinite-lived power from owned hydropower stations with water rights permitted by local governments. In these instances, a closure obligation may exist at the reporting date. However, due to the indefinite nature of asset lives it is not possible to arrive at a sufficiently reliable estimate for the purposes of recognising a provision. Close-down and restoration provisions are recognised at these operations for separately identifiable closure activities which can be reasonably estimated, such as the demolition and removal of fixed structures after a pre-determined period. Any contingent liability for these assets will crystallise into a closure provision if and when a decision is taken to cease operations.\n\n## Contingent assets\n\nThe Group has, from time to time, various insurance claims outstanding with reinsurers. Recognition of any assets arising takes place once the insurance company has agreed to refund the claims and the amount is quantifiable. This is usually in the same period as payment is received.\n\n## Capital commitments\n\nOur capital commitments includes:\n\n- - open purchase orders for managed operations and non-managed tolling entities;\n- - expenditure on major projects already authorised by our Investment Committee for non-managed operations.\n\nOn a legally enforceable basis, capital commitments would be approximately US$1.4 billion (2022: US$1.0 billion) as many of the contracts relating to the Group's projects have various cancellation clauses.\n\nThe Group's share of joint venture capital commitments was US$227 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: US$15 million).\n\n## Impact of climate change on our business - decarbonisation capital commitments\n\nCapital commitments do not include the estimated incremental capital expenditure relating to decarbonisation projects of US$5 billion to US$6 billion between 2022 and 2030 unless otherwise contractually committed (revised from US$7.5 billion in prior year). Included in capital commitments in 2023 are contractually committed decarbonisation capital commitments of US$123 million (US$8 million in 2022), inclusive of Amrun power purchase agreement, which is a treated as a lease, which has not yet commenced (disclosed in note 21).",

As of 31 December 2023, a total of US$173 million (2022: US$nil) of such expenditure is estimated to be incurred over the next 25 years, out of which US$10 million is expected to be incurred within the next year.\n\n## Unrecognised commitments to contribute funding or resources to joint ventures\n\nAlong with the other joint venture partners, we have commitments to provide emergency funding (such as funding required to preserve the life or assets of the company or to comply with applicable laws) if required by Sohar Aluminium Company L.L.C., subject to approved thresholds.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, Minera Escondida Ltda held an undrawn shareholder line of credit for US$225 million (Rio Tinto share) (2022: US$225 million). The current facility has been extended during the year and will now mature in September 2024.\n\n## Purchase obligations\n\nPurchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding agreements to buy goods or services. They specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased or consumed; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions.\n\nPurchase obligations for goods mainly relate to purchases of raw materials and consumables, and purchase obligations for services mainly relate to charges for the use of infrastructure, commitments to purchase power and freight contracts. These goods and services are expected to be used in the business. To the extent that this changes, a provision for onerous obligations may be made.\n\nPurchases from joint arrangements or associates are included if the quantity to be purchased is in excess of our ownership interest in the entity. However, purchase obligations exclude contracted purchases of bauxite, alumina and aluminium from joint arrangements and associates and contracted purchases of alumina from third parties. This is because these purchases are made for commercial reasons and the Group is, overall, a net seller of these commodities.\n\nThe aggregate amount of future payment commitments under purchase obligations outstanding at 31 December is shown in the table below.\n\n|                       | 2023  US$m   | 2022 US$m   |\n|-----------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Within 1 year         | 2,927        | 3,618       |\n| Between 1 and 2 years | 1,663        | 2,091       |\n| Between 2 and 3 years | 1,496        | 1,632       |\n| Between 3 and 4 years | 1,147        | 1,309       |\n| Between 4 and 5 years | 948          | 907         |\n| After 5 years         | 6,365        | 6,574       |\n| Total                 | 14,546       | 16,131      |\n\n## Guarantees by parent companies\n\nRio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited have, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed the following securities issued by the following 100% owned finance subsidiaries: US$6.2 billion (2022: US$4.4 billion) Rio Tinto Finance (USA) Limited and Rio Tinto Finance (USA) plc bonds with maturity dates up to 2053; and US$1.1 billion (2022: US$1.0 billion) on the European Debt Issuance Programme. In addition, Rio Tinto Finance plc and Rio Tinto Finance Limited have entered into undrawn facility arrangements for an aggregate amount of US$7.5 billion (2022: US$7.5 billion). The facilities are guaranteed by Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited.\n\nRio Tinto plc has provided a guarantee, known as the completion support undertaking (CSU), in favour of the Oyu Tolgoi LLC project finance lenders. During the year, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto plc became a lender under the project finance facility ranking pari passu with the external lenders.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, a total of US$4.7 billion of project finance debt was outstanding under this facility of which US$3.9 billion is owed to external third party lenders (2022: US$3.9 billion). Rio Tinto plc, through its subsidiaries, owns 66% of Oyu Tolgoi LLC, with the remaining share owned by Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC (34%), which is controlled by the Government of Mongolia. The project finance has been raised for development of the underground mine and the CSU will terminate on the completion of the underground mine according to a set of completion tests set out in the project finance facility. The CSU contains a carve-out for certain political risk events.",

The Court upheld that the Australian sanctions restrict Rio Tinto from supplying bauxite to Rusal entities and restrict QAL from processing bauxite for Rusal entities and supplying it with alumina. The Rusal entities can file an appeal of the decision by 29 February 2024.\n\nOn 15 January 2024 we announced that Dampier Salt had entered into a sales agreement for the Lake MacLeod salt and gypsum operation in Carnavon, Western Australia, with privately-owned salt company Leichhardt Industrials Group for A$375 million (US$251 million).",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Rio Tinto plc Financial Statements\n\n## A   Principal accounting policies\n\n## a. Basis of preparation\n\nThe Rio Tinto plc company financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial liabilities and in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006 and Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework ('FRS 101'). The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\n\nIn preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of UKadopted international accounting standards, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements. The following exemptions available under FRS 101 have been applied:\n\n- - Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2 'Share-based Payment' (details of the number and weighted average exercise prices of share options and how the fair value of goods and services received was determined).\n- - Paragraphs 91-99 of IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement' (disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities).\n- - IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'.\n- - Paragraph 38 of IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements', comparative information requirements in respect of Paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1.\n- - The following paragraphs of IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements':\n- - 10 (d) (statement of cash flows);\n- - 16 (statement of compliance with all IFRS);\n- - 38A (requirement for minimum of two primary statements, including cash flow statements);\n- - 38B-D (additional comparative information);\n- - 111 (cash flow statement information); and\n- - 134-136 (capital management disclosures).\n- - IAS 7 'Statement of Cash Flows'.\n- - Paragraph 30 and 31 of IAS 8 'Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors' (requirement for the disclosure of information when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been issued and is not yet effective).\n- - Paragraph 17 of IAS 24 'Related party disclosures' (key management compensation).\n- - The requirements of IAS 24, 'Related party disclosures' to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group.\n\n## b. Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make assumptions, judgements and estimates and to use judgement in applying accounting policies and making critical accounting estimates. These judgements, estimates and assumptions are based on management's best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to previous experience, but actual results may differ materially from the amounts included in the financial statements.\n\nThe key area of judgement that has the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is the review for impairment of investment carrying values.\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. The unit of account being the equity of the subsidiary taken as a whole, which may include interests in multiple cash-generating units.\n\nIf any such indication exists, Rio Tinto plc makes an assessment of the recoverable amount. If the asset is determined to be impaired, an impairment loss will be recorded and the asset will be written down based on the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\n## c. Currency translation\n\nItems included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates (the functional currency). The financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Company's functional and presentation currency. Transactions denominated in other currencies, including the issue of shares, are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\nExchange rates used are consistent with the rates used by the Group as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements on page 161.\n\n## d. Investments\n\nInvestments in Group companies are valued at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\n## e. Financial guarantees\n\nFinancial guarantees are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation.\n\n## f. Share-based payments\n\nThe Company operates a number of share-based payment plans for Group employees, the details of which are included in the consolidated financial statements (note 27). The fair value of the Company's share plans is recognised as an addition to the cost of the investment in the subsidiary in which the relevant employees work over the expected vesting period, with a corresponding entry to retained earnings. Payments received from the Company's subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments are recognised as a reduction in the cost of the investment. The Company uses fair values provided by independent actuaries calculated using either a lattice-based option valuation model or a Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value of the share plans is determined at the date of grant, taking into account any marketbased vesting conditions attached to the award.\n\nNon-market vesting conditions (for example, relative EBIT margin performance targets) are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest. The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued. No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.\n\n## g. Dividend income\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.\n\n## h. Treasury shares\n\nThe consideration paid for shares repurchased by the Company and held as treasury shares is recognised as a reduction in shareholders' funds through retained earnings.",

In addition, these entities also jointly guarantee the Group's undrawn credit facility which was US$7.5 billion at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: US$7.5 billion). Rio Tinto plc has provided guarantees in respect of certain derivative contracts that are in a liability position of US$381 million at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: US$523 million).\n\nRio Tinto plc has provided a guarantee, known as the completion support undertaking (CSU), in favour of the Oyu Tolgoi LLC project finance lenders. During the year, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto plc became a lender under the project finance facility ranking pari passu with the external lenders.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, a total of US$4.7 billion of project finance debt was outstanding under this facility of which US$3.9 billion is owed to external third party lenders (31 December 2022: US$3.9 billion). Rio Tinto plc, through its subsidiaries, owns 66% of Oyu Tolgoi LLC with the remaining share owned by Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC (34%), which is controlled by the Government of Mongolia. The project finance has been raised for development of the underground mine and the CSU will terminate on the completion of the underground mine according to a set of completion tests set out in the project finance facility. The CSU contain a carve-out for certain political risk events.\n\nDuring 2023, fees of US$77 million (2022: US$75 million) were received from Oyu Tolgoi LLC as consideration for the provision of the CSU.\n\nRio Tinto plc has provided a number of guarantees in relation to various pension funds. Subject to certain conditions, Rio Tinto plc would pay any contributions due from Group companies participating in these funds should the companies fail to meet their contribution requirements. The guarantees were not called upon in 2023. The aggregate of company contributions to these plans in 2023 was US$8 million (2022: US$9 million).\n\nOther guarantees issued by Rio Tinto plc in relation to Rio Tinto Group entities as at 31 December 2023 amount to US$525 million (31 December 2022: US$458 million).

        "page_content": "## Australian Corporations Act Summary of ASIC Relief\n\nPursuant to section 340 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act), the Australian Securities and Investments Commission issued an order dated 16 July 2021 that granted relief to Rio Tinto Limited from certain requirements of the Corporations Act in relation to its financial statements and associated reports. The order essentially continues the relief that has applied to Rio Tinto Limited since the formation of the Group's dual listed companies (DLC) structure in 1995. The order applies to Rio Tinto Limited's financial reporting obligations for the financial years up to and including 31 December 2023.\n\nIn essence, instead of being required under the Corporations Act to prepare consolidated financial statements covering Rio Tinto Limited and its controlled entities, it allows the Company to prepare consolidated financial statements in which it, Rio Tinto plc and their respective controlled entities are treated as a single economic entity. In addition, those consolidated financial statements are to be prepared:\n\n- -in accordance with the principles and requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the United Kingdom (UK IFRS) rather than the Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) (except for one limited instance in the case of any concise report), and in accordance with UK financial reporting obligations generally;\n- - on the basis that the transitional provisions of International Financial Reporting Standard 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, should be applied using the combined financial statements previously prepared for Rio Tinto Limited, Rio Tinto plc and their respective controlled entities under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United Kingdom, under which the DLC Merger between Rio Tinto Limited and Rio Tinto plc was accounted for using 'merger', rather than 'acquisition', accounting (reflecting that neither Rio Tinto Limited nor Rio Tinto plc was acquired by, or is controlled by, the other; and meaning that the existing carrying amounts, rather than fair values, of assets and liabilities at the time of the DLC Merger were used to measure those assets and liabilities at formation);\n- - on the basis that Rio Tinto Limited and Rio Tinto plc are a single company (with their respective shareholders being the shareholders in that single company); and\n- - with a reconciliation, from UK IFRS to AAS, of the following amounts: consolidated loss/profit for the financial year, total consolidated comprehensive loss/income for the financial year and total consolidated equity at the end of the financial year (see page 167).\n\nThose consolidated financial statements must also be audited in relation to their compliance with relevant Australian and UK requirements. Rio Tinto Limited must also prepare a Directors' Report which satisfies the content requirements of the Corporations Act (applied on the basis that for these purposes, the consolidated entity is the Group, and the consolidated financial statements cover the Group). This includes a Remuneration Report (see pages 113 to 145) prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act.\n\nRio Tinto Limited is also required to comply generally with the lodgement and distribution requirements of the Corporations Act (including timing requirements) in relation to those consolidated financial statements (including any concise financial statements), the Auditors' report and the Directors' Report. The Corporations Act also requires that a non-binding resolution to adopt the Remuneration Report be voted on by shareholders at Rio Tinto Limited's annual general meeting.\n\nRio Tinto Limited is not required to prepare separate consolidated financial statements solely for it and its controlled entities. Rio Tinto Limited is also not required to prepare and lodge parent entity financial statements for itself in respect of each relevant financial year.\n\nRio Tinto Limited must, however, in accordance with the Corporations Act include in the consolidated financial statements for the Group, as a note, various parent entity information regarding Rio Tinto Limited (including in relation to assets, liabilities, shareholders' equity, profit and loss, income, guarantees, contingent liabilities, and contractual commitments) prepared in accordance with AAS (see page 238).",

Under UK law, our Directors have elected to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and applicable law. We have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework, and applicable law). Under Australian law, the Directors are also required to prepare certain Rio Tinto Limited parent company financial statements in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards (AAS). In preparing the Group financial statements, the Directors have also elected to comply with IFRS, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nUnder UK and Australian company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the companies as at the end of the financial year, and of the profit or loss of the companies and Group for the period (as applicable).\n\nIn preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:\n\n- - select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;\n- - make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent;\n- - state whether applicable UK adopted international accounting standards and AAS have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group and parent company financial statements respectively;\n- - assess the Group and companies' ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern;\n- - use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the companies or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the transactions of the companies and the Group and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the companies and the Group and enable them to ensure that:\n\n- - the Group financial statements comply with the UK Companies Act 2006 and the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 16 July 2021;\n- - the Rio Tinto plc financial statements comply with the UK Companies Act 2006;\n- - the Rio Tinto Limited parent company disclosures comply with the Corporations Act as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 16 July 2021; and\n- - the Remuneration Report complies with the UK Companies Act 2006 and the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 16 July 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDominic Barton\n\nChair\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJakob Stausholm Chief Executive\n\nPeter Cunningham Chief Financial Officer\n\nThe Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the companies and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group's website. Legislation governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ between jurisdictions in which the Group reports.\n\nEach of the current Directors, whose names and function are listed on pages 92 and 93 in the Governance section, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:\n\n- -the Rio Tinto Group financial statements and notes, which have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards, the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 16 July 2021 and the UK Companies Act 2006, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group;\n- - the Rio Tinto plc financial statements and notes, which have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the company;\n- - the Rio Tinto Limited parent company disclosures, which have been prepared in accordance with the AAS and Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 16 July 2021, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the company;\n- - the Strategic Report section of the Annual Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces; and\n- - there are reasonable grounds to believe that each of the Rio Tinto Group, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited will be able to pay its debts as and when they become due and payable.\n\nThe Directors have been given the declarations by the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer required by section 295A of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 16 July 2021.\n\n## Disclosure of information to auditors\n\nThe Directors in office at the date of this report have each confirmed that:\n\n- - so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group's auditors are unaware; and\n- - they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a Director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group's auditors are aware of that information.\n\nThis declaration is made in accordance with a resolution of the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Financial Information by Business Unit\n\nBusiness units are classified according to the Group's management structure. Our management structure is based on product groups together with global support functions whose leaders make up the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee members each report directly to our Chief Executive who is the chief operating decision maker and is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. Finance costs and net debt are managed on a Group-wide basis and are therefore excluded from the segmental results.\n\nThe disclosures in this note include certain non-IFRS financial measures (non-IFRS measures). For more information on the nonIFRS measures used by the Group, including definitions and calculations, refer to section entitled alternative performance measures (pages 289 to 294).\n\n- (a) The financial information by business unit has been adjusted to reflect a change in management responsibility for the Simandou iron ore project from Copper to the Chief Technical Officer. As a result, we have moved Simandou outside of reportable segments and accordingly adjusted prior period comparatives.\n- (b) Underlying earnings for the year ended 31 December 2022 and 2021 and operating assets as at 31 December 2022 and 2021 have been restated for the impact of narrow-scope amendments to IAS 12. Refer to page 166 for details.\n- (c) Segmental revenue, Underlying EBITDA and Capital expenditure are defined and calculated in note 1 from pages 173 to 175. Underlying Earnings is defined and calculated within the Alternative performance measures section on pages 290 and 291.\n- (d) Pilbara represents the Group's 100% holding in Hamersley, 50% holding in Hope Downs Joint Venture, 54% holding in Western Range Joint Venture and 65% holding in Robe River Iron Associates. The Group's net beneficial interest in Robe River Iron Associates is 53%, as 30% is held through a 60% owned subsidiary and 35% is held through a 100% owned subsidiary.\n- (e) Segmental revenue, Underlying EBITDA, Underlying earnings and Operating assets within Evaluation projects/other include activities relating to the shipment and blending of Pilbara and Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) iron ore inventories held portside in China and sold to domestic customers. Transactions between Pilbara and our portside trading business are eliminated through the Iron Ore 'intra-segment' line and transactions between IOC and the portside trading business are eliminated through 'intersegment transactions'.\n- (f) Until 16 December 2022, our interest in Oyu Tolgoi was held indirectly through our 50.8% investment in Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd (TRQ), where TRQ's principal asset was its 66% investment in Oyu Tolgoi LLC, which owned the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine. Following the purchase of TRQ we now directly hold a 66% investment in Oyu Tolgoi LLC.\n- (g) Includes our interests in Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec Operations (100%), QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM, 80%) and Richards Bay Minerals (attributable interest of 74%).\n- (h) Includes our interests in Argyle (100%) residual operations which relate to the sale of remaining inventory and Diavik. Until 18 November 2021 we recognised our 60% share of assets, revenue and expenses relating to the Diavik joint venture. Liabilities were recognised according to Diavik Diamond Mine Inc's contractual obligations at 100%, with a corresponding 40% receivable or contingent asset representing the co-owner's share where applicable. Post acquisition, we now consolidate (100%) of the Diavik.\n\n- (i) Rio Tinto Simfer UK Limited (which is wholly owned by the Group) holds a 53% interest in Simfer Jersey Limited (Simfer Jersey), a company incorporated in Jersey. Simfer Jersey, in turn, has an 85% interest in Simfer S.A., the company that operates the Simandou mining project in Guinea. As at 31 December 2023, Simfer Jersey also owns 100% of Simfer InfraCo Guin\u00e9e S.A., a company incorporated in Guinea, which will deliver Simfer's scope of the co-developed rail and port infrastructure. The Group therefore has a 45.05% indirect interest in Simfer S.A. and a 53% indirect interest in Simfer InfraCo Guin\u00e9e S.A. These entities are consolidated as subsidiaries and together referred to as the Simandou iron ore project.\n- (j) Other operations includes our 86% interest in Energy Resources of Australia, sites being rehabilitated under the management of Rio Tinto Closure, Rio Tinto Marine, and the remaining legacy liabilities of Rio Tinto Coal Australia. These include provisions for onerous contracts, in relation to rail infrastructure capacity, partly offset by financial assets and receivables relating to contingent royalties and disposal proceeds. From 16 June 2022, Commercial Treasury and related central costs are reported as part of 'Other operations' instead of 'Other items' in previous periods.\n- (k) Capital expenditure is the net cash outflow on purchases less sales of property, plant and equipment, capitalised evaluation costs and purchases less sales of other intangible assets as derived from the Group cash flow statement. The details provided include 100% of subsidiaries' capital expenditure and Rio Tinto's share of the capital expenditure of joint operations but exclude equity accounted units.\n- (l) Operating assets of the Group represents equity attributable to Rio Tinto adjusted for net (debt)/cash. Operating assets of subsidiaries, joint operations and the Group's share relating to equity accounted units are made up of net assets adjusted for net (debt)/cash and post-retirement assets and liabilities, net of tax. Operating assets are stated after the deduction of non-controlling interests; these are calculated by reference to the net assets of the relevant companies (i.e. inclusive of such companies' debt and amounts due to or from Rio Tinto Group companies).\n- (m) North American Aluminium comprises our reporting unit formerly known as Primary Metal and from 1 December 2023 our 50% interest in Matalco which focuses on recycling of aluminium. The operations are principally located in Canada and USA, however this reporting unit also includes our interests in ISAL (Iceland) and Sohar (Oman).",

        "page_content": "## Alternative Performance Measures\n\nThe Group presents certain non-IFRS financial measures (non-IFRS measures) which are reconciled to directly comparable IFRS financial measures below. These non-IFRS measures hereinafter referred to as alternative performance measures (APMs) are used by management to assess the performance of the business and provide additional information, which investors may find useful. APMs are presented in order to give further insight into the underlying business performance of the Group's operations.\n\nAPMs are not consistently defined and calculated by all companies, including those in the Group's industry. Accordingly, these measures used by the Group may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures made by other companies. Consequently, these APMs should not be regarded as a substitute for the IFRS measures and should be considered supplementary to those measures.\n\nThe following tables present the Group's key financial measures not defined according to IFRS and a reconciliation between those APMs and their nearest respective IFRS measures.\n\nReconciliation of APMs to the nearest comparable IFRS financial measures for the year 2020 and 2019 can be found in the section APM of our 2020 Annual Report . Reconciliation of underlying return on capital employed and Net (debt)/cash for the year 2021 can be found in our 2021 Annual Report .\n\n## APMs derived from the income statement\n\nThe following income statement measures are used by the Group to provide greater understanding of the underlying business performance of its operations and to enhance comparability of reporting periods. They indicate the underlying commercial and operating performance of our assets including revenue generation, productivity and cost management.\n\n## Segmental revenue\n\nSegmental revenue includes consolidated sales revenue plus the equivalent sales revenue of equity accounted units in proportion to our equity interest (after adjusting for sales to/from subsidiaries). The reconciliation can be found in 'Our financial performance' on page 173.\n\n## Underlying EBITDA\n\nUnderlying EBITDA represents profit before taxation, net finance items, depreciation and amortisation adjusted to exclude the EBITDA impact of items that do not reflect the underlying performance of our reportable segments. The reconciliation of profit after tax to underlying EBITDA can be found in 'Our financial performance' on page 175.\n\n## Underlying EBITDA margin\n\nUnderlying EBITDA margin is defined as Group underlying EBITDA divided by the aggregate of consolidated sales revenue and our share of equity account unit sales after eliminations.\n\n|                                                                                                    | 2023 US$m   | 2022  US$m   | 2021  US$m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Underlying EBITDA                                                                                  | 23,892      | 26,272       | 37,720       |\n| Consolidated sales revenue                                                                         | 54,041      | 55,554       | 63,495       |\n| Share of equity accounted unit sales and inter-subsidiary/equity accounted unit sales eliminations | 3,016       | 2,850        | 3,073        |\n|                                                                                                    | 57,057      | 58,404       | 66,568       |\n| Underlying EBITDA margin                                                                           | 42 %        | 45 %         | 57 %         |\n\n## Pilbara underlying FOB EBITDA margin\n\nThe Pilbara underlying free on board (FOB) EBITDA margin is defined as Pilbara underlying EBITDA divided by Pilbara segmental revenue, excluding freight revenue .\n\n|                                                      | 2023 US$m   | 2022  US$m   | 2021  US$m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Pilbara                                              |             |              |              |\n| Underlying EBITDA                                    | 19,828      | 18,474       | 27,837       |\n| Pilbara segmental revenue                            | 30,867      | 29,313       | 39,111       |\n| Less: Freight revenue                                | (2,098)     | (2,206)      | (2,707)      |\n| Pilbara segmental revenue, excluding freight revenue | 28,769      | 27,107       | 36,404       |\n| Pilbara underlying FOB EBITDA margin                 | 69 %        | 68 %         | 76 %         |",

        "page_content": "## APMs derived from cash flow statement\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nCapital expenditure includes the net sustaining and development expenditure on property, plant and equipment, and on intangible assets. This is equivalent to 'Purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets' in the cash flow statement less 'Sales of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets'.\n\nThis measure is used to support management's objective of effective and efficient capital allocation as we need to invest in existing assets in order to maintain and improve productive capacity, and in new assets to grow the business.\n\n## Rio Tinto share of capital investment\n\nRio Tinto's share of capital investment represents our economic investment in capital projects. This measure was introduced in 2022 to better represent the Group's share of funding for capital projects which are jointly funded with other shareholders and which may differ from the consolidated basis included in the Capital expenditure APM. This better reflects our approach to capital allocation.\n\nThe measure is based upon the Capital expenditure APM, adjusted to deduct equity or shareholder loan financing provided to partially owned subsidiaries by non-controlling interests in respect of major capital projects in the period. In circumstances where the funding to be provided by non-controlling interests is not received in the same period as the underlying capital investment, this adjustment is applied in the period in which the underlying capital investment is made, not when the funding is received. Where funding which would otherwise be provided directly by shareholders is replaced with project financing, an adjustment is also made to deduct the share of project financing attributable to the noncontrolling interest. This adjustment is not made in cases where Rio Tinto has unilaterally guaranteed this project financing. Lastly, funding contributed by the Group to Equity Accounted Units for its share of investment in their major capital projects is added to the measure. No adjustment is made to the Capital expenditure APM where capital expenditure is funded from the operating cash flows of the subsidiary or Equity Accounted Unit.\n\n|                                                                                        | 2023 US$m   | 2022  US$m   | 2021  US$m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets                        | 7,086       | 6,750        | 7,384        |\n| Less: Equity or shareholder loan financing received/due from non-controlling interests | (125)       | -            | -            |\n| Rio Tinto share of capital investment                                                  | 6,961       | 6,750        | 7,384        |\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash generated from operating activities minus purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangibles and payments of lease principal, plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\n\nThis measures the net cash returned by the business after the expenditure of sustaining and development capital.

Production figures are sometimes more precise than the rounded numbers shown, hence small differences may result from calculation of Rio Tinto share of production.\n\n- 1. Rio Tinto percentage share, shown above, is as at 31 December 2023. The footnotes below include all ownership changes over the three years.\n- 2. Jonqui\u00e8re's (Vaudreuil) production shows smelter grade alumina only and excludes hydrate produced and used for specialty alumina.\n- 3. On 30 November 2023, Rio Tinto's ownership interest in Porto Trombetas increased from 12% to 22%. Production is reported including this change from 1 December 2023.\n- 4. Rio Tinto has a 22.95% shareholding in the Sangar\u00e9di mine, but benefits from 45% of production.\n- 5. Borate quantities are expressed as B2O3.\n- 6. On 16 December 2022, Rio Tinto completed the acquisition of 100% of Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd, increasing our ownership in Oyu Tolgoi from 33.52% to 66%. Production is reported including this change from 1 January 2023.\n- 7. On 17 November 2021, our ownership interest in Diavik increased from 60% to 100%. Production from 1 November 2021 is reported including this change.\n- 8. Includes 100% of production from Paraburdoo, Mount Tom Price, Western Turner Syncline, Marandoo, Yandicoogina, Brockman, Nammuldi, Silvergrass, Channar, Gudai-Darri and the Eastern Range mines. While we own 54% of the Eastern Range mine, under the terms of the joint venture agreement, Hamersley Iron manages the operation and is obliged to purchase all mine production from the joint venture and, therefore, all of the production is included in Rio Tinto's share of production. Our ownership interest in Channar mine increased from 60% to 100%, following conclusion of its joint venture with Sinosteel Corporation upon reaching planned 290 million tonnes production on 22 October 2020.\n- 9. Quantities comprise 100% of Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec Operations and our 74% share of Richards Bay Minerals' production. Ilmenite mined in Madagascar is processed in Canada.\n- 10. Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) reports drummed U3O8. ERA ceased processing operations on 8 January 2021, as required by the Ranger Authority. In February 2020, our interest in ERA increased from 68.4% to 86.3% as a result of new ERA shares issued to Rio Tinto under the Entitlement Offer and Underwriting Agreement to raise funds for the rehabilitation of the Ranger Project Area. Production is reported including this change from 1 March 2020.\n\nArvida, Canada",

        "page_content": "## Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves\n\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves for Rio Tinto managed operations are reported in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, 2012 edition (the JORC Code), as required by the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Rio Tinto also files an annual report on Form 20-F (Form 20-F) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and prepares the Form 20-F Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves in accordance with subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (SK-1300). Mineral Reserves under SK-1300 are the equivalent of Ore Reserves under ASX. Some variations may occur between the reporting in accordance with the JORC Code and SK-1300.\n\nA Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade (or quality) and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. Estimates of such material are based largely on geological information with only preliminary consideration of mining, economic and other factors. While in the judgement of the Competent Person there are realistic expectations that all or part of the Mineral Resources will eventually become Proved or Probable Ore Reserves, there is no guarantee that this will occur, as the result depends on further technical and economic studies and prevailing economic conditions in the future.\n\nAn Ore Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted. It is defined by studies at pre-feasibility or feasibility level as appropriate, with the application of modifying factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction can reasonably be justified.\n\nRio Tinto's Mineral Resources are reported as additional (exclusive) to the reported Ore Reserves.\n\nFor Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve reporting, the JORC Code envisages the use of reasonable investment assumptions to test the economic viability of the Ore Reserves and the reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction for the Mineral Resources. To achieve this, Rio Tinto uses internally generated, projected long-term commodity prices.\n\nSK-1300 requires the use of a justifiable commodity price to test the economic viability of the Mineral Reserves and the reasonable prospects of economic extraction for the Mineral Resources, and prices used in calculating the estimates must be disclosed. As a result of the commercial sensitivity of Rio Tinto's long-term commodity prices, we use commercially available consensus pricing or historical pricing for SEC reporting. For this reason and others, some Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves reported to the SEC in the Form 20-F may differ from those Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves reported below.\n\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves information in the following tables is based on information compiled by Competent Persons (as defined by the JORC Code), most of whom are full-time employees of Rio Tinto or related companies. Each has had a minimum of five years' relevant experience and is a member of a recognised professional body whose members are bound by a professional code of ethics. These bodies include the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (AusIMM), Australian Institute of Geoscientists (AIG) or recognised professional organisations (RPO). Each Competent Person consents to the inclusion in this Annual Report of information they have provided in the form and context in which it appears. Competent Persons responsible for the estimates are listed on page 323, by operation, along with their professional affiliation, employer, and accountability for Mineral Resources and/or Ore Reserves.\n\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves from externally managed operations, in which Rio Tinto holds a minority share, are reported as received from the managing entity and in accordance with the JORC Code.\n\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves from our managed operations are the responsibility of the managing directors of the business units and estimates are carried out by the Competent Persons.\n\nThe Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves figures in the following tables are as of 31 December 2023. Summary data for year end 2022 are shown for comparison. Metric units are used throughout. The figures used to calculate Rio Tinto's Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves are more precise than the rounded numbers shown in the tables, hence small differences might result if the calculations are repeated using the tabulated figures.\n\nJORC Table 1 reports for new or materially changed significant deposits are released to the market. They are also available at riotinto.com/resourcesandreserves. JORC Table 1, SEC Technical Report Summaries and NI 43-101 Technical Reports generated by non-managed units or joint venture partners are referenced within the reporting footnotes, with the location and initial reporting date identified.",

A JORC Table 1 in support of this change will be released to the market contemporaneously with the release of this Annual Report and can be viewed at riotinto.com/ resourcesandreserves.\n\nAndoom and Gove Ore Reserves tonnes increase is associated with a routine review of price assumptions over the life of the mine. Cessation of mining at East Weipa in 2024 will result in no future reporting of Ore Reserves for that operation.\n\n## Porto Trombetas (MRN)\n\nOn 30 November 2023, Rio Tinto completed an acquisition of Companhia Brasileira de Alum\u00ednio's 10% equity in the Minerac\u00e3o Rio do Norte bauxite mine (MRN) in Brazil, raising our stake from 12% to 22%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Type of mine: O/P = open pit/surface.\n- 2. Ore Reserves of iron ore are shown as recoverable Ore Reserves of marketable product after accounting for all mining and processing losses. Mill recoveries are therefore not shown.\n- 3. Australian iron ore Ore Reserves tonnes are reported on a dry weight basis.\n- 4. Australian iron ore Ore Reserves are all located on State Agreement mining leases. Prior to mining, state government approvals (including environmental and heritage) are required. Reported Ore Reserves include select areas where one or more approvals remain outstanding. In these areas, it is expected that these approvals will be obtained within the timeframes required in the current production schedule.\n- 5. Ore Reserves of Brockman Ore are 87.7% Rio Tinto-owned, with the remainder split between the non-Rio Tinto partners in the Bao-HI joint venture and the Hope Downs joint venture.\n- 6. Ore Reserves of Marra Mamba Ore are 80.9% Rio Tinto-owned, with the remainder split between the non-Rio Tinto partners in the Hope Downs joint venture and the Robe River joint venture.\n- 7. Ore Reserves of Pisolite Ore are 80.0% Rio Tinto-owned, with the remainder split between the non-Rio Tinto partners in the Robe River joint venture.\n- 8. Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) Ore Reserves are reported as marketable product (57% pellets and 43% concentrate for sale) at a natural moisture content of 2%. The marketable product is derived from mined material comprising 357 million dry tonnes at 38% iron, 36% silica, 0.23% alumina, 0.022% phosphorus (Proved) and 651 million dry tonnes at 38% iron, 35% silica, 0.19% alumina, 0.023% phosphorus (Probable) using process recovery factors derived from current IOC concentrating and pellet operations. No meaningful relationship has been established between the product and feed grades of alumina and phosphorus, so these grades cannot be reported for Ore Reserves. Saleable product is produced to meet silica grade specifications, so the Ore Reserve silica grade is the targeted silica grade for the currently anticipated long-term product mix. Loss on Ignition (LOI) is not determined for resource drilling samples, so no estimate of % LOI is available for Ore Reserves.\n- 9. Simandou Ore Reserves tonnes are reported on a dry weight basis.\n- 10. Simandou Ore Reserves are reported for the first time since 2016 and relate to the Ou\u00e9l\u00e9ba portion only of the Simfer Iron Ore Project.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nArvida, Canada",

updates for Brockman, Marra Mamba and Pisolite Ore include mining depletion, the addition of new deposits (primarily at Brockman 4, West Angelas and Greater Nammuldi) and changes to cut-off grades.\n\nOre Reserves classification is determined based on confidence in all the modifying factors. Generally, Proved Ore Reserves are derived from Measured Mineral Resources, and Probable Ore Reserves are derived from Indicated Mineral Resources. In 2023, portions of the Ore Reserves derived from Measured Mineral Resources have been classified as Probable Ore Reserves. This classification primarily represents areas where one or more state government approvals remain outstanding or specific Traditional Owner engagement is required prior to mining.\n\n## Iron Ore Company of Canada\n\nOre Reserves updates include depletion, plus a change in the methodology for distinguishing between Proved and Probable Ore Reserves, which has resulted in reclassification of a significant proportion of the Proved Ore Reserves to Probable Ore Reserves. The change is based on the density of geometallurgical data available to estimate iron recovery and ore grind energy in the concentrator. A JORC Table 1 in support of this change will be released to the market contemporaneously with the release of this Annual Report and can be viewed at riotinto.com/resources-and-reserves.\n\n## Simandou\n\nA JORC Table 1 in support of the Ore Reserves was released to the market on 6 December 2023 and can be viewed at riotinto.com/resourcesandreserves.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Canyon\n\nUnderground Skarns Mineral Reserves comprise the Lower Commercial Skarns (LCS) Ore Reserves and the North Rim Skarn (NRS) Ore Reserves. An initial NRS Probable Ore Reserve of 3.0 million tonnes at 2.39% copper, 1.77 g/t gold, 18.59 g/t silver, and 0.010% molybdenum was released to the market by Rio Tinto on 20 June 2023 with a supporting JORC Table 1 and can be viewed at riotinto.com/resourcesandreserves.\n\nIt is noted that the Underground Skarns Ore Reserves are only economically viable while the current open pit is in operation.\n\n## Oyu Tolgoi\n\nSustainable production from the Hugo Dummett North L1 underground mine commenced in March 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A JORC Table 1 in support of this change will be released to the market contemporaneously with the release of this Annual Report and can be viewed at riotinto.com/resourcesandreserves.\n\nUnderground Skarns Mineral Resources represent the combined Mineral Resources from the various underground deposits at Bingham Canyon.\n\n## La Granja\n\nAs reported to the market on 28 August 2023,  Rio Tinto and First Quantum Minerals (First Quantum) completed a transaction to form a joint venture that will work to unlock the development of the La Granja project in Peru, with First Quantum acquiring a 55% stake in the project. The Rio Tinto interest percentage (45%) reflects this change.",

        "page_content": "## Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves governance and internal controls\n\nRio Tinto has well-established governance processes and internal controls to support the generation and publication of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, including a series of business unit and product group structures and processes independent of operational reporting.\n\n## Audit & Risk Committee\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee's remit includes the governance of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. This includes an annual review of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves at a Group level, as well as a review of findings and progress from the Group Internal Audit program.\n\n## Ore Reserves Steering Committee\n\nThe Ore Reserves Steering Committee (ORSC), chaired by the Chief Technical Officer, Development & Technology, meets at least quarterly. The ORSC comprises senior representatives across our technical, financial, governance and business groups, and oversees the appointment of Competent Persons nominated by the business units; reviews Exploration Results, Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves data prior to public reporting; and oversees the development of the Group Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves standards and guidance.\n\n## Orebody Knowledge Centre of Excellence\n\nThe Orebody Knowledge Centre of Excellence contains a dedicated Orebody Knowledge Technical Assurance team. Orebody Knowledge Technical Assurance, in conjunction with the ORSC, is the guardian and author of Group Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves standards and guidance, and is responsible for the governance and compilation of Group Mineral Resources, Ore Reserves and reconciliation reporting. The Technical Assurance team also advises on disclosure obligations, monitors the external reporting environment and facilitates internal audits.\n\nArvida, Canada\n\n## Internal Auditing\n\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves internal audits are conducted by independent external consulting personnel in a programme managed by Orebody Knowledge Technical Assurance. Material findings are reported outside of the product group reporting line to the ORSC, and all reports and action plans are reviewed by the ORSC for alignment to internal and external reporting standards.\n\nDuring 2023, two internal Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves audits were completed.\n\n## Geoscientific information management and assurance\n\nWe employ industry-standard drilling, sampling, assaying and quality assurance/ quality control (QA/QC) practices supported by formally documented procedures.\n\nDiamond core and reverse circulation are our primary drilling methods. We use other methods such as sonic and air core if appropriate for the style of deposit. Drill hole locations are typically confirmed by highprecision differential Global Positioning System (GPS) and down-hole trace positioning is primarily achieved by gyroscopic survey.\n\nDrill sample recovery is typically recorded, and all geological data is collected by qualified geoscientific professionals. Geological logging consistency is secured via formal logging procedures and training, reference materials, application of geological code libraries and digital logging directly to the geological database.\n\nOn-site or commercial laboratories provide appropriate analytical (assaying) techniques, according to the commodity and style of deposit. Reliability of assay data is maintained via QA/QC procedures, which monitor assay accuracy and precision through the analysis of blanks, sample duplicates and matrix-matched certified reference materials.\n\nOur geoscientific information management standard is the industry-leading acQuire system and we employ strict QA/QC criteria to ensure only high-quality assay data is uploaded to a project's database.\n\n## Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves risk management\n\nRisks to our Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimates are managed through comprehensive risk assessments undertaken in support of the annual reporting cycle. Risks are identified and managed by verifying controls, determining and undertaking suitable actions to remove or reduce the risk, conducting reviews, and maintaining compliance with standards and procedures. Risks are managed through a commercial risk management solution.\n\nAt the end of each reporting cycle, we analyse the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves risks across all business units to ensure both consistency of reporting and determine any Group-wide risks to the various processes.",

During the 1990s, Channar (1990), Brockman 2 (1992), Marandoo (1994) and Yandicoogina (1998) achieved first ore. Nammuldi achieved first ore in 2006 followed by Brockman 4 (2010), Western Turner Syncline (2011) and Silvergrass (2017). The latest addition to the network of Hamersley Iron mines, Gudai-Darri, had first ore railed in December 2021, and commissioned its primary crusher in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Property description/type of mine\n\nAll mines operated by Rio Tinto within the property are open pit mines. The mining method employed uses conventional surface mining, whereby shovels and loaders are used to load drilled and blasted material into trucks for removal to waste dumps and stockpiles or feed to process plants.\n\nIn addition to mining activities, Rio Tinto conducts both exploration and development drilling across the property.\n\n## Type of mineralisation\n\nBrockman 2, Brockman 4, Channar, Gudai-Darri, Tom Price, Paraburdoo and Western Turner Syncline: mineralisation is haematite/goethite mineralisation hosted within the banded iron formations of the Brockman Formation. Detrital deposits also occur at these sites. At Tom Price and Western Turner Syncline, some goethite/haematite mineralisation hosted within the Marra Mamba Formation also occurs.\n\nMarandoo, Nammuldi and Silvergrass: mineralisation occurs as goethite/haematite within the banded iron formations of the Marra Mamba Formation. Some detrital mineralisation also occurs.\n\nYandicoogina: goethite mineralisation occurs as pisolite ores within the paleo-channel of a channel iron formation.\n\n## Processing plants and other available facilities\n\nAt Brockman 2, Brockman 4, the Nammuldi dry plant and Gudai-Darri, dry crushing and screening is used to produce lump and fines iron ore products. Ore from the Silvergrass and Nammuldi mines is blended and processed through a wet scrubbing and screening plant, ahead of desliming of the fines product using hydrocyclones. At Marandoo, wet scrubbing and screening is used to produce lump and fines iron ore products, prior to desliming of fines products using hydrocyclones. Ore from the Channar and Paraburdoo mines is crushed and then processed through a central tertiary crushing and dry screening plant to produce a dry lump product, with further wet processing of the fines using hydrocyclones to remove slimes. Ore from the Tom Price and Western Turner Syncline mines is directed to either the high-grade plant for dry crushing and screening to dry lump and fines products, or to the low grade plant for beneficiation. Heavy media separation is used to beneficiate low-grade lump, and a combination of heavy media hydrocyclones and spirals is used to beneficiate the low-grade fines. At Yandicoogina, ore is crushed to fines product only through a combination of dry crushing and screening, or crushing and wet processing of ore using classification to remove finer particles.\n\nThe processing plants within the Hamersley Iron network vary considerably in age, and many plants have been subject to brownfields development since original construction. All plants are subject to an ongoing regime of sustaining capital investment and maintenance, underpinned by asset integrity audits, engineering inspections, engineering life cycles for key equipment and safety inspections and audits.\n\n## Power source\n\nSupplied through the integrated Hamersley and Robe power network operated by Pilbara Iron.",

The brine is hosted in two separate aquifers: an upper unconfined fractured halitic aquifer and a lower semi-confined aquifer composed mainly of volcaniclastic sand.\n\n## Processing plants and other available facilities\n\nThe project includes a wellfield for brine extraction and a chemical plant for the production of lithium carbonate, a spent brine disposal facility, wellfield for the extraction of process water and water pre-treatment equipment, camp and office buildings, warehouses and loading/unloading facilities.\n\n## Power source\n\nConnected to the national electric grid with access to power from nearby solar farms. Option for the construction of a solar farm under agreement with a third party on a build/own/ operate model under consideration.\n\n## History\n\nThe Jadar deposit was discovered in 2004 by Rio Tinto Exploration geologists during a regional exploration program for borates in the Balkans. The deposit is in its majority composed of a mineral new to science named Jadarite with high concentrations of lithium and boron. Resource definition and processing workflow development and testing were conducted for over a decade. The pre-feasibility study (PFS) completed in July 2020 has shown that the Jadar project has the potential to produce both battery grade lithium carbonate and boric acid. In January 2022, the Government of Serbia cancelled the Spatial Plan for the Jadar project and required all related permits to be revoked.\n\n## Property description/type of mine\n\nUnderground mine.\n\n## Type of mineralisation\n\nJadarite mineralisation is present in three broad zones containing stratiform lenses of variable thickness. These units are hosted in a much thicker gently dipping sequence mainly composed of fine-grained sediments affected by syn and post depositional faulting.\n\n## Processing plants and other available facilities\n\nThe planned site layout includes a concentrator to beneficiate the primary ore, a chemical plant to produce boric acid and lithium carbonate, paste plant, water and waste treatment plants, surface waste storage (dry stack), railroad spur and warehouses for product storage and loading/unloading, and office buildings.\n\n## Power source\n\nConnected to the national electric grid. Electricity planned to be sourced from nearby hydroelectrical power plant.",

The deposit has two mine planning sequences: East Zone (1979-2027) and West Zone Phase 1 (2027-2040).\n\nOn 30 November 2023 Rio Tinto completed an acquisition of Companhia Brasileira de Alum\u00ednio's 10% equity in the MRN bauxite mine in Brazil, raising the Rio Tinto stake from 12% to 22%.\n\n## Property description/type of mine\n\nOpen cut.\n\n## Type of mineralisation\n\nConsists of a series of bauxite tabular deposits.\n\n## Processing plants and other available facilities\n\nThe beneficiation process is formed by a primary crusher, conveyors, scrubbers, secondary crushers, screenings, hydrocyclones and vacuum filters. The superfines tailings are pumped to a tailings storage facility.\n\n## Power source\n\nOn-site generation fuel (oil + diesel).\n\n## History\n\nBauxite mining commenced in 1961 at Weipa. Major upgrade completed in 1998. Rio Tinto interest increased from 72.4% to 100% in 2000. In 1997, Ely Bauxite Mining Project Agreement signed with local Aboriginal land owners. Bauxite Mining and Exchange Agreement signed in 1998 with Comalco to allow for extraction of ore at Ely. The Western Cape Communities Co-Existence Agreement, an ILUA, was signed in 2001. Following the ramp up to full production of Amrun the current annual production of the Weipa mine is 35.5 Mt.\n\n## Property description/type of mine\n\nOpen cut.\n\n## Type of mineralisation\n\nBauxite.\n\n## Processing plants and other available facilities\n\nAndoom, East Weipa and Amrun - wet crushing and screening plants to remove ultra fine proportion.\n\n## Power source\n\nOn-site generation (diesel) supplemented by a solar generation facility.",

Camp facilities are in place with a current workforce involved in further geological sampling and early construction works for the project. Planned expansion of the camp facilities including a dedicated airstrip are planned for the project construction phase.\n\nIron ore extracted from the Simfer mine concession (and Simandou Blocks 1 & 2 which are owned by Winning Consortium Simandou [WCS]) will be exported through a rail and port infrastructure to be co-developed by the State, Simfer Jersey and WCS. It includes a purpose-built port facility to be constructed at Morebaya estuary (south of Conakry) to be accessed by a 536km main rail line with rail spurs connecting our Concession (68km) and WCS's (16km) respectively. The main rail line will have an initial capacity of up to 120 Mtpa. The ultimate owner and operator of the infrastructure will be the Compagnie du Transguin\u00e9en (CTG) (The TransGuinean Company), an incorporated joint venture between Simfer Jersey (42.5%), WCS (42.5%) and the State (15%).\n\n## Title/lease/acreage\n\nSimandou South Mining Concession was granted by Presidential Decree on 22 April 2011 under the conditions of the Amended and Consolidated Basic Convention (ACBC), which was ratified by the Guinean National Assembly on 26 May 2014. The Concession duration is 25 years, renewed automatically for a further period of 25 years followed by further ten year periods in accordance with the Guinean Mining Code and the ACBC. The Concession covers an area of 369km 2 .\n\nSimfer also holds a BOT Convention to enable development of the rail and port infrastructure. Simfer has signed agreements with the State and WCS, the owner of Simandou Blocks 1 & 2 deposits, to enable co-development of the rail and port infrastructure for the Simandou iron ore projects. The Co-Development Convention, which, along with bipartite amendments for each of the Simfer and WCS Mine Conventions, adapts the existing investment frameworks of Simfer and WCS. These conventions require ratification and are subject to a number of conditions, including regulatory approvals.\n\n## Key permit conditions\n\nIn addition to the Concession, the ACBC, as amended by the mine bipartite agreement, establishes the legal regime for the mine project and sets out Simfer's key legal rights and protections. The Simandou mine SEIA was approved in 2012 and has since been maintained in accordance with applicable law. An updated SEIA for the mine and rail spur was submitted for regulatory review in July 2023 and an update to the SEIA for the port was submitted in November 2023.\n\n## History\n\nSimfer submitted a bankable feasibility study to the State in 2016, with further feasibility studies for mine and infrastructure to reflect the infrastructure co-development arrangements completed in 2022, 2023 and 2024, and which are currently pending approval by the State as part of the infrastructure co-development arrangements.\n\n## Property description/type of mine\n\nOpen pit.\n\n## Type of mineralisation\n\nSupergene-enriched itabirite hosted iron ore deposits. The deposits are part of a supracrustal belt with the banded iron formation proto-ore likely deposited in a shallow marine setting within a forearc basin. The age of deposition is considered to be between 2.7Ga and 2.2Ga.\n\n## Processing plants and other available facilities\n\nCurrent plans are for the run-of-mine ore to be coarsely crushed at the Ou\u00e9l\u00e9ba mine site at a maximum rate of 60 Mtpa phase 1 capacity to P100 of -100 mm through two identical primary and secondary crushing stations in a staged arrangement. The coarsely crushed ore will then be conveyed to the mine stockyard. The ore will be reclaimed from the stockpiles and conveyed to the train load-out facility for loading into trains which transport materials to the port facility where it will be likely shipped by bulk carrier to several ports including in China. Other major facilities that will support the operations include power generation, explosives facilities, fuel and lubricants facilities, administration buildings, workshops and a permanent village.\n\n## Power source\n\nCurrent designs contemplate that power for the mine site and other areas will be supplied by a hybrid power plant consisting of diesel generators and solar generation powered fuel station. Further, there is a plan to connect the facility to the power grid local operator \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de Guin\u00e9e. This will require an approximately 20km connection line to the main grid once it is available and would substantially reduce energy costs and fuel consumption.",

These expressions are used for convenience, since both companies, and other companies in which they directly or indirectly own investments, are separate and distinct legal entities. Likewise, the words 'we', 'us', 'our' and 'ourselves' are used in some places to refer to the companies of the Rio Tinto Group in general. These expressions are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying any particular company or companies. We usually omit 'Limited', 'plc', 'Pty', 'Inc.', 'Limitada', 'L.L.C.', 'A.S.' or 'SA' from Group company names, except to distinguish between Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited. Financial data in US dollars ($) is derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the 2023 financial statements. In general, where we have provided financial data in other currencies, it has been translated from the consolidated financial statements, and is provided solely for convenience. Exceptions arise where data has been extracted directly from source records.\n\n## History\n\nRio Tinto plc was incorporated on 30 March 1962, then called The Rio Tinto-Zinc Corporation Limited (RTZ), and was formed by the merger of The Rio Tinto Company Limited and The Consolidated Zinc Corporation Limited. The Rio Tinto Company was incorporated in 1873 to reopen ancient copper workings in Spain. The Consolidated Zinc Corporation Limited began operations in the early twentieth century as part of the Australian mining industry. Based at Broken Hill in New South Wales, it began mining silver, lead and zinc deposits and later expanded into lead and zinc smelting.\n\nRio Tinto Limited was incorporated on 17 December 1959, then called The Rio Tinto Mining Company of Australia Pty Limited. In 1962 the Australian interests of The Consolidated Zinc Corporation Limited and The Rio Tinto Company Limited were merged to form Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Limited, a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Victoria, Australia. In 1980, Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Limited changed its name to CRA Limited.\n\nBetween 1962 and 1995, both RTZ and CRA discovered important mineral deposits, developed major mining projects and grew through acquisition.\n\nRTZ and CRA began operating in 1995 through a dual-listed companies structure. In 1997, RTZ became Rio Tinto plc and CRA became Rio Tinto Limited.\n\n## Dual-listed companies structure\n\nIn 1995, Rio Tinto shareholders approved the terms of the dual-listed companies' merger (the DLC structure). The aim was to put shareholders of both companies in substantially the same position they would be in if they held shares in a single entity owning all assets of both companies.\n\nFollowing the approval of the DLC structure, both companies entered into a DLC Merger Sharing Agreement (the Sharing Agreement). As part of this, both companies agreed to be managed in a unified way, to share the same Board of Directors, and to put in place arrangements to provide shareholders of both companies with a common economic interest in the DLC structure.\n\nTo achieve this third objective, the Sharing Agreement fixed the ratio of dividend, voting and capital distribution rights attached to each Rio Tinto plc share and each Rio Tinto Limited share at an Equalisation Ratio of 1:1. This has remained unchanged ever since, although the Sharing Agreement makes clear this can be revised in special circumstances. For example where certain modifications are made to the share capital of one company (such as rights issues, bonus issues, share splits and share consolidations) but not to the other.\n\nOutside the circumstances specified in the Sharing Agreement, the Equalisation Ratio can only be altered with the approval of shareholders under the class rights action approval procedure, described in the voting arrangements section below. Any adjustments must be confirmed by the Group's external auditors.\n\nConsistent with the DLC structure, the directors of both companies aim to act in the best interests of Rio Tinto as a whole. The class rights action approval procedure exists to deal with instances where there may be a conflict of interest between the shareholders of the two companies.\n\nTo ensure that the Boards of both companies are identical, resolutions to appoint or remove Directors must be put to shareholders of both companies as Joint Decisions, described in the voting arrangements section below. The Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc and the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited make clear that a person can only be a Director of one company if he or she is also a Director of the other. This means that if a person were removed as a Director of Rio Tinto plc, he or she would also cease to be a Director of Rio Tinto Limited.\n\nOne consequence of the DLC merger is that Rio Tinto is subject to a wide range of laws, rules and regulatory reviews across multiple jurisdictions. Where these rules differ, Rio Tinto will comply with the requirements in each jurisdiction at a minimum.\n\n## Dividend arrangements\n\nThe Sharing Agreement ensures that dividends paid on Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited shares are equalised on a net cash basis without taking into account any associated tax credits. Dividends are determined in US dollars (with the exception of ADR holders, paid in sterling and Australian dollars) and both companies are required to announce and pay dividends and other distributions, or as close to, at the same time as possible.\n\nThe payment of dividends between companies and their subsidiaries, including the payment of dividends on the DLC dividend shares, provides the Group with flexibility to manage internal funds and distributable reserves to enable the payment of equalised dividend or equalised capital distributions.\n\nIf the payment of an equalised dividend would contravene the law applicable to one of the companies, they can depart from the Equalisation Ratio. In that situation, the relevant company must put aside reserves for payment on the relevant shares at a later date.\n\nRio Tinto shareholders have no direct rights to enforce the dividend equalisation provisions of the Sharing Agreement.\n\n## Voting arrangements\n\nIn principle, the Sharing Agreement enables the shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited to vote as a joint electorate on any matters that affect them in similar ways. These are referred to as Joint Decisions, and include the creation of new classes of share capital, the appointment or removal of directors and auditors, and the receiving of annual financial statements. All shareholder resolutions that include Joint Decisions are voted on a poll.\n\nThe Sharing Agreement also protects shareholders of both companies by requiring joint approval for decisions that do not affect the shareholders of both companies equally.",

        "page_content": "These are known as class rights actions, and are voted on a poll. For example, fundamental elements of the DLC structure cannot be changed unless approved separately by the shareholders of both companies.\n\nExceptions to these principles can arise in situations such as where legislation requires the separate approval of a decision by the appropriate majority of shareholders in one company, and where approval of the matter by shareholders of the other company is not required.\n\nWhere a matter has been expressly categorised as either a Joint Decision or a class rights action, the Directors cannot change that categorisation. If a matter falls within both categories, it is treated as a class rights action. In addition, if an issue is not expressly listed in either category, Directors can decide how it should be put to shareholders for approval.\n\nTo support joint voting arrangements, both companies have entered into shareholder voting agreements, where a Special Voting Share is issued to a special purpose company (SVC) and held in trust for shareholders by a common trustee. Rio Tinto plc (RTP) has issued its Special Voting Share (RTP Special Voting Share) to Rio Tinto Limited (RTL) Shareholder SVC, while Rio Tinto Limited has issued its Special Voting Share (RTL Special Voting Share) to RTP Shareholder SVC. The total number of votes cast on Joint Decisions by the shareholders of one company are decided at a parallel meeting of the other company. The exact role of these SVCs is described below.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, certain shareholders can be excluded from voting at their respective company's general meetings. For example, they may have acquired shares in the other company in excess of a given threshold without making an offer for all the shares in the other company. In this situation, votes cast by these excluded shareholders are disregarded.\n\nFollowing the companies' general meetings, the overall results of the voting are announced to relevant stock exchanges and the media, and published at riotinto.com\n\nAt a Rio Tinto plc shareholders meeting during which a Joint Decision is considered, each Rio Tinto plc share carries one vote. The holder of the Special Voting Share has one vote for each vote cast by the public shareholders of Rio Tinto Limited in their parallel meeting. The holder of the Special Voting Share must vote in accordance with the votes cast by public shareholders for and against the equivalent resolution at the parallel Rio Tinto Limited shareholders' meeting. The holders of Rio Tinto Limited ordinary shares do not hold voting shares in Rio Tinto plc by virtue of their holding in Rio Tinto Limited, and cannot enforce the voting arrangements relating to the Special Voting Share.\n\nSimilarly, at a Rio Tinto Limited shareholders meeting during which a Joint Decision is considered, each Rio Tinto Limited share carries one vote and the holder of its Special\n\nVoting Share will have one vote for each vote cast by the public shareholders of Rio Tinto plc in their parallel meeting. The holder of the Special Voting Share must vote in accordance with the votes cast for and against the equivalent resolution at the parallel Rio Tinto plc shareholders meeting. The holders of Rio Tinto plc ordinary shares do not hold any voting shares in Rio Tinto Limited by virtue of their holding in Rio Tinto plc, and cannot enforce the voting arrangements relating to the Special Voting Share.\n\n## Capital distribution arrangements\n\nIf either company goes into liquidation, the Sharing Agreement ensures a valuation is made of the surplus assets of both companies. If the surplus assets available for distribution by one company on each of the shares held by its shareholders exceed the surplus assets available for distribution by the other company on each of the shares held by its shareholders, then an equalising payment must be made - to the extent permitted by applicable law - such that the amount available for distribution on each share held by shareholders of both companies reflects the Equalisation Ratio.\n\nThe aim is to ensure the shareholders of both companies have equivalent entitlements to the assets of the combined Group on a per share basis, taking account of the Equalisation Ratio.\n\nThe Sharing Agreement does not grant any enforceable rights to the shareholders of either company upon liquidation of either company.\n\n## Limitations on ownership of shares and merger obligations\n\nThe laws and regulations of the UK and Australia impose restrictions and obligations on persons who control interests in publicly listed companies in excess of defined thresholds. These can include an obligation to make a public offer for all outstanding issued shares of the relevant company. The threshold applicable to Rio Tinto plc under UK law and regulations is 30% and to Rio Tinto Limited under Australian law and regulations is 20% on both a standalone and a Joint Decision basis.\n\nAs part of the DLC merger, the Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc and the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited were amended with the aim of extending these laws and regulations to the combined enterprise. This amendment also ensures that a person cannot exercise control over one company without having made offers to the public shareholders of both companies.\n\nThis guarantees the equal treatment of both sets of shareholders, and that the two companies are considered as a single economic entity. The Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc and the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited impose restrictions on any person who controls, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the votes on a Joint Decision. If, however, such a person has an interest in either Rio Tinto Limited or Rio Tinto plc only, then the restrictions only apply if they control, directly or indirectly, 30% or more of the votes at that company's general meetings.\n\nIf one of these thresholds is exceeded, the person cannot attend or vote at general meetings of the relevant company, cannot receive dividends or other distributions from the relevant company, and may be divested of their interest by the Directors of the relevant company (subject to certain limited exceptions and notification by the relevant company). These restrictions continue to apply until that person has either made a public offer for all the publicly held shares of the other company, has reduced their controlling interest below the thresholds specified, or has acquired through a permitted means at least 50% of the publicly held shares of each company.\n\nThis arrangement ensures that offers for the publicly held shares of both companies would be required to avoid the restrictions set out above, even if the interests which breach the thresholds are held in just one of the companies. The Directors do not have the discretion to exempt a person from the operation of these rules.\n\nUnder the Sharing Agreement, the companies agree to cooperate to enforce the above restrictions contained in their Articles of Association and Constitution.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nIn 1995, each company entered into a deed poll guarantee in favour of creditors of the other company. In addition, each company guaranteed the contractual obligations of the other and the obligations of other persons guaranteed by the other company, subject to certain limited exceptions.\n\nBeneficiaries under deed poll guarantees can make demands on the relevant guarantor without first having recourse to the company or persons whose obligations are being guaranteed. The obligations of the guarantor under each deed poll guarantee expire upon termination of the Sharing Agreement and under other limited circumstances, but only in respect of obligations arising after such termination and, in the case of other limited circumstances, the publication and expiry of due notice.\n\n## Markets\n\n## Rio Tinto plc\n\nThe principal market for Rio Tinto plc shares is the London Stock Exchange, with shares trading through the Stock Exchange Electronic Trading Service (SETS) system.\n\nRio Tinto plc American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nFurther details relating to Rio Tinto plc ADRs are available in Rio Tinto's annual reports on Form 20-F.\n\n## Rio Tinto Limited\n\nRio Tinto Limited shares are listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).\n\nThe ASX is the principal trading market for Rio Tinto Limited shares. The ASX is a national stock exchange with an automated trading system.",

        "page_content": "## Material contracts\n\n## Articles of Association, Constitution, and DLC Sharing Agreement\n\nAs explained on page 347, under the terms of the DLC structure, shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and of Rio Tinto Limited entered into certain contractual arrangements designed to place the shareholders of both companies in substantially the same position as if they held shares in a single entity that owned all the assets of both companies. As far as is permitted by the UK Companies Act 2006 , the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and ASX Listing Rules, this principle is reflected in the Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc and in the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited.\n\nThe following summaries describe the material rights of shareholders of both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited.\n\n## Objects\n\nAt the 2009 AGMs, shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited approved amendments to their Articles of Association and Constitution whereby the object clauses were removed to allow the companies to have the widest possible scope of activities.\n\n## Directors' interests\n\nUnder Rio Tinto plc's Articles of Association, a Director may not vote in respect of any proposal in which he or she, or any other person connected with him or her, has any interest, other than by virtue of his or her interests in shares or debentures or other securities of, in or through the company, except in certain circumstances, including in respect of resolutions:\n\n- - Indemnifying him or her or a third party in respect of obligations incurred by the Director on behalf of, or for the benefit of, the company, or in respect of obligations of the company, for which the Director has assumed responsibility under an indemnity, security or guarantee.\n- - Relating to an offer of securities in which he or she may be interested as a holder of securities or as an underwriter.\n- - Concerning another body corporate in which the Director is beneficially interested in less than 1% of the issued shares of any class of shares of such a body corporate.\n- - Relating to an employee benefit in which the Director will share equally with other employees.\n- - Relating to liability insurance that the company is empowered to purchase for the benefit of Directors of the company in respect of actions undertaken as Directors (or officers) of the company.\n- - Concerning the giving of indemnities in favour of Directors or the funding of expenditure by Directors to defend criminal, civil or regulatory proceedings or actions against a Director.\n\nUnder Rio Tinto Limited's Constitution, a Director may be present at a meeting of the Board while a matter in which the Director has a material personal interest is being considered and may vote in respect of that matter, except where a Director is constrained by Australian law.\n\nThe Directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of the companies to borrow money; to charge any property or business of the companies or all, or any, of their uncalled capital; and to issue debentures or give any other security for a debt, liability or obligation of the companies or of any other person. The Directors shall restrict the borrowings of Rio Tinto plc to the limitation that the aggregate amount of all monies borrowed by the company and its subsidiaries shall not exceed an amount equal to 1.5 times the companies' share capital plus aggregate reserves unless sanctioned by an ordinary resolution of the company.\n\nDirectors are not required to hold any shares of either company by way of qualification. The Remuneration Report on pages 113-145 provides information on shareholding policies relating to Executive and NonExecutive Directors. Please refer to the Directors' Report for information on the appointment of Directors.\n\n## Rights attaching to shares\n\nUnder UK law, dividends on shares may only be paid out of profits available for distribution, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and by the relevant law. Shareholders are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by the Directors. Directors may also pay interim dividends to shareholders as justified by the financial position of the Group.\n\nUnder the Australian Corporations Act 2001 , dividends on shares may only be paid if the company's assets exceed its liabilities immediately before the dividend is declared, the excess is sufficient for the payment of the dividend, the payment is fair and reasonable to the company's shareholders as a whole, and the payment does not materially prejudice the company's ability to pay its creditors. Any Rio Tinto plc dividend unclaimed after 12 years from the date the dividend was declared, or became due for payment, will be forfeited and returned to the company. Any Rio Tinto Limited dividend unclaimed may be invested or otherwise used by the Board for the benefit of the company until claimed or otherwise disposed of according to Australian law. Rio Tinto Limited is governed by the State of Victoria's unclaimed monies legislation, which requires the company to pay to the state revenue office any unclaimed dividend payments of A$20 or more that on 1 March each year have remained unclaimed for over 12 months.\n\n## Voting\n\nVoting at any general meeting of shareholders on a resolution on which the holder of the Special Voting Share is entitled to vote shall be decided by a poll, and any other resolution shall be decided by a show of hands unless a poll has been duly demanded. On a show of hands, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy (or other duly authorised representative) and is entitled to vote, has one vote regardless of the number of shares held. The holder of the Special Voting Share is not entitled to vote in a show of hands. On a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy (or other duly authorised representative) and is entitled to vote, has one vote for every ordinary share for which he or she is the holder. In the case of Joint Decisions, the holder of the Special Voting Share has one vote for each vote cast in respect of the publicly held shares of the other company.\n\nA poll may be demanded by any of the following:\n\n- - The Chair of the meeting.\n- - At least five shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution.\n- - Any shareholder(s) representing in the aggregate not less than one tenth (Rio Tinto plc) or one 20 th (Rio Tinto Limited) of the total voting rights of all shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution.\n- - Any shareholder(s) holding Rio Tinto plc shares conferring a right to vote at the meeting on which there have been paid-up sums in the aggregate equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring that right.\n- - The holder of the Special Voting Share of either company.\n\nA proxy form gives the proxy the authority to demand a poll, or to join others in demanding one.\n\nThe necessary quorum for a Rio Tinto plc general meeting is three members present (in person or by proxy or other duly authorised representative) and entitled to vote. For a Rio Tinto Limited general meeting it is two members present (in person or by proxy or other duly authorised representative).\n\nMatters are transacted at general meetings by the proposing and passing of resolutions as:\n\n- - Ordinary resolutions (for example the election of Directors), which require the affirmative vote of a majority of persons voting at a meeting for which there is a quorum.\n- - Special resolutions (for example amending the Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc or the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited), which require the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the persons voting at a meeting at which there is a quorum.",

        "page_content": "The Sharing Agreement further classifies resolutions as Joint Decisions and class rights actions as explained on page 347.\n\nAGMs must be convened with 21 days' written notice for Rio Tinto plc and with 28 days' notice for Rio Tinto Limited. In accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Rio Tinto plc AGM in 2023, other meetings of Rio Tinto plc may be convened with 14 days' written notice for the passing of a special resolution, and with 14 days' notice for any other resolution, depending on the nature of the business to be transacted. All meetings of Rio Tinto Limited require 28 days' notice. In calculating the period of notice, any time taken to deliver the notice and the day of the meeting itself are not included. The notice must specify the nature of the business to be transacted.\n\n## Variation of rights\n\nIf, at any time, the share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to each class may be varied, subject to the provisions of the relevant legislation, the written consent of holders of three-quarters in value of the shares of that class, or upon the adoption of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. At every such meeting, all of the provisions of the Articles of Association and Constitution relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that the quorum for Rio Tinto plc should be two or more persons who hold or represent by proxy not less than one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class.\n\n## Rights upon a winding-up\n\nExcept as the shareholders have agreed or may otherwise agree, upon a winding-up, the balance of assets available for distribution after the payment of all creditors (including certain preferential creditors, whether statutorily preferred creditors or normal creditors), and subject to any special rights attaching to any class of shares, is to be distributed among the holders of ordinary shares according to the amounts paid-up on the shares held by them. This distribution should generally be made in cash. A liquidator may, however, upon the adoption of a special resolution of the shareholders, divide among the shareholders the whole or any part of the assets in specie or kind.\n\nThe Sharing Agreement describes the distribution of assets of each of the companies in the event of a liquidation, as explained on page 348.\n\n## Facility agreement\n\nDetails of the Group's $7.5 billion multicurrency committed revolving credit facilities are set out in the Our capital and liquidity section to the financial statements on page 204.\n\n## Exchange controls and foreign investment\n\n## Rio Tinto plc\n\nThere are no UK foreign exchange controls or other restrictions on the import or export of capital by, or on the payment of dividends to, non-resident holders of Rio Tinto plc shares, or that materially affect the conduct of Rio Tinto plc's operations. It should be noted, however, that various sanctions, laws, regulations or conventions may restrict the import or export of capital by, or the payment of dividends to, non-resident holders of Rio Tinto plc shares. There are no restrictions under Rio Tinto plc's Articles of Association or under UK law that specifically limit the right of non-resident owners to hold or vote Rio Tinto plc shares. However, certain of the provisions of the Australian Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (the Takeovers Act) described below also apply to the acquisition by non-Australian persons of interests in securities of Rio Tinto plc.\n\n## Rio Tinto Limited\n\nUnder current Australian legislation, Australia does not impose general exchange or foreign currency controls. Subject to some specific requirements and restrictions, Australian and foreign currency may be freely brought into and sent out of Australia. There are requirements to report cash transfers in or out of Australia of A$10,000 or more. There is a prohibition on (or in some cases the specific prior approval of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or Minister for Foreign Affairs must be obtained for) certain payments or other dealings connected with countries or parties identified with terrorism, or to whom United Nations or autonomous Australian sanctions apply. Sanction, antimoney laundering and counterterrorism laws may restrict or prohibit payments, transactions and dealings or require reporting of certain transactions.\n\nRio Tinto Limited may be required to deduct withholding tax from foreign remittances of dividends, to the extent that they are unfranked, and from payments of interest.\n\nAcquisitions of interests in shares, and certain other equity instruments in Australian companies by non-Australian ('foreign') persons are subject to review and approval by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia under the Takeovers Act.\n\nIn broad terms, the Takeovers Act applies to acquisitions of interests in securities in an Australian entity by a foreign person where, as a result, a single foreign person (and any associate) would control 20% or more of the voting power or potential voting power in the entity. The potential voting power in an entity is determined having regard to the voting shares in the entity that would be issued if all rights (whether or not presently exercisable) in the entity were exercised.\n\nThe Takeovers Act also applies to direct investments by foreign government investors, in certain circumstances regardless of the size of the investment. Persons who are proposing relevant acquisitions or transactions may be required to provide notice to the Treasurer before proceeding with the acquisition or transaction.\n\nThe Treasurer has the power to order divestment in cases where relevant acquisitions or transactions have already occurred, including where prior notice to the Treasurer was not required. The Takeovers Act does not affect the rights of owners whose interests are held in compliance with the legislation.\n\n## Limitations on voting and shareholding\n\nExcept for the provisions of the Takeovers Act, there are no limitations imposed by law, Rio Tinto plc's Articles of Association or Rio Tinto Limited's Constitution, on the rights of non-residents or foreigners to hold the Group's ordinary shares or ADRs, or to vote that would not apply generally to all shareholders.\n\n## Directors\n\n## Appointment and removal of Directors\n\nThe appointment and replacement of Directors is governed by Rio Tinto plc's Articles of Association and Rio Tinto Limited's Constitution, relevant UK and Australian legislation, and the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board may appoint a Director either to fill a casual vacancy or as an addition to the Board, so long as the total number of Directors does not exceed the limit prescribed in these constitutional documents. An appointed Director must retire and seek election to office at the next AGM of each company. In addition to any powers of removal conferred by the UK Companies Act 2006 and the Australian Corporations Act 2001 , the company may by ordinary resolution remove any Director before the expiry of his or her period of office and may, subject to these constitutional documents, by ordinary resolution appoint another person who is willing to act as a Director in their place. In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code , all directors are required to stand for re-election at each AGM.",

These powers include the Directors' ability to issue or buy back shares. Shareholders' authority to empower the Directors to purchase its own ordinary shares is sought at the AGM each year. The constitutional documents can only be amended, or replaced, by a special resolution passed in general meeting by at least 75% of the votes cast.\n\n## UK listing rules cross-reference table\n\nThe following table contains only those sections of UK listing rule 9.8.4 C which are relevant.

All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report, including, without limitation, those regarding Rio Tinto's financial position, business strategy, plans and objectives of management for future operations (including development plans and objectives relating to Rio Tinto's products, production forecasts, and reserve and resource positions), are forward-looking statements. The words 'intend', 'aim', 'project', 'anticipate', 'estimate', 'plan', 'believes', 'expects', 'may', 'should', 'will', 'target', 'set to' or similar expressions, commonly identify such forward-looking statements.\n\nSuch forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Rio Tinto, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Rio Tinto's present and future business strategies and the environment in which Rio Tinto will operate in the future. Among the important factors that could cause Rio Tinto's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: an inability to live up to Rio Tinto's values and any resultant damage to its reputation; the impacts of geopolitics on trade and investment; the impacts of climate change and the transition to a lowcarbon future; an inability to successfully execute and/or realise value from acquisitions and divestments; the level of new ore resources, including the results of exploration programs and/or acquisitions; disruption to strategic partnerships that play a material role in delivering growth, production, cash or market positioning; damage to Rio Tinto's relationships with communities and governments; an inability to attract and retain requisite skilled people; declines in commodity prices and adverse exchange rate movements; an inability to raise sufficient funds for capital investment; inadequate estimates of ore resources and reserves; delays or overruns of large and complex projects; changes in tax regulation; changes in environmental, social and governance reporting standards; safety incidents or major hazard events; cyber breaches; physical impacts from climate change; the impacts of water scarcity; natural disasters; an inability to successfully manage the closure, reclamation and rehabilitation of sites; the impacts of civil unrest; breaches of Rio Tinto's policies, standards and procedures, laws or regulations; trade tensions between the world's major economies; increasing societal and investor expectations, in particular with regard to environmental, social and\n\ngovernance considerations; the impacts of technological advancements; and such other risks identified in Rio Tinto's most recent Annual Report and accounts in Australia and the United Kingdom and the most recent annual report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC or Form 6-Ks furnished to, or filed with, the SEC. Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be construed in light of such risk factors and undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report. Rio Tinto expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking (except as required by applicable law, the UK Listing Rules, the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and the Listing Rules of the Australian Securities Exchange) to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Rio Tinto's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\nNothing in this report should be interpreted to mean that future earnings per share of Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited will necessarily match or exceed its historical published earnings per share.",
