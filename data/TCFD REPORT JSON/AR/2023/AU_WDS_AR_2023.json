        "page_content": "## About Woodside\n\nWe are a global energy company founded in Australia, providing reliable and a/ffordable energy to help people lead better lives.\n\nDriven by a spirit of innovation and determination, we established the liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry in Australia 35 years ago and today supply a growing base of customers.\n\nWe have reliably delivered gas to homes and businesses in Australia for decades, supporting the development of local industry and driving economic prosperity.\n\nFollowing our merger with BHP's petroleum business in 2022, we have become a larger supplier of energy to the world through an expanded global portfolio.\n\nWe are contributing to the energy transition by leveraging our track record of reliable operations, strong customer relationships and investing in new energy.\n\nOur strategy is to thrive through this transition by developing a low cost, lower carbon, profitable, resilient and diversified portfolio. 1\n\nOur LNG in particular can help customers in Asia's major economies meet their energy security needs, while also supporting their decarbonisation goals. We are also investing in new products and services that can help customers reduce or avoid their emissions.\n\nWe are working to reduce our net equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions towards our aspiration of net zero by 2050 or sooner. 2\n\nOur quality global portfolio and strong balance sheet enables us to execute major projects today, while pursuing opportunities that will deliver Woodside's next wave of growth. These opportunities are across gas, oil, new energy products and lower carbon services.\n\nWe balance our pursuit of growth with a disciplined investment approach, focused on financial returns and value for our shareholders.\n\nWe recognise that to maintain strong operational and financial performance, we need to run our business sustainably. We have a continued focus on safety, environmental and social performance and maintaining meaningful relationships with communities.\n\nWe are guided by our values, and we believe that our success is underpinned by our people and culture.\n\n- 1 Please see section 6.7 - Glossary, units of measure and conversion factors for a definition of how Woodside uses the term lower carbon portfolio.\n- 2 Targets and aspiration are for net equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions relative to a starting base of 6.32 Mt CO 2 -e which is representative of the gross annual average equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions over 2016-2020 and which may be adjusted (up or down) for potential equity changes in producing or sanctioned assets with a final investment decision prior to 2021. Net equity emissions include the utilisation of carbon credits as o/ffsets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Chair's report\n\nAt a time of rising cost of living pressures, we are tremendously proud to return value to our shareholders and communities.\n\nSadly, our 2023 performance was overshadowed by the fatality of our colleague Michael Jurman at the North Rankin Complex in June. We must improve on safety and do all we can to ensure everyone who works on Woodside's assets and facilities returns home safely.\n\n## Creating value through performance\n\nRecord production from our expanded portfolio further established Woodside as a global energy supplier.\n\nWe achieved strong financial performance in 2023. While oil and gas prices eased from 2022's record highs, robust product demand continued. In 2023, we recorded an annual net profit after tax of $1.7 billion and an underlying net profit after tax of $3.3 billion. Based on this, the Board has determined a fullyfranked final dividend of 60 US cents per share, resulting in a total full-year dividend of 140 US cents per share.\n\nWhen Woodside performs well, the communities in which we operate also benefit. In 2023, Woodside paid a record A$5 billion to the Australian Government in tax and royalty payments.\n\n## A clear growth strategy\n\nWoodside's strategy is to thrive through the energy transition, by building a low cost, lower carbon, profitable, resilient and diversified portfolio. 1 Our pipeline of longer-term opportunities across di/fferent commodities supports this.\n\nOur major growth projects including Sangomar, Scarborough and Trion are well placed to support the demand needs of our customers. Our strong performance and disciplined capital management will help us to meet this demand and continue delivering growth and returns.\n\n## Supporting the energy transition\n\nIn 2023, I spoke to many investors who want to learn more about our plans to respond to the challenges of climate change and this was a regular focus of Board meetings throughout the year.\n\nWe also continued to review our approach to Scope 3 targets in response to investor feedback and have decided to supplement our existing investment target with a new complementary emissions abatement target. We have evolved our climate disclosures, which will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at our 2024 Annual General Meeting.\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe will continue to listen carefully to investors to inform our approach, including how we consider future investments.\n\nReflecting on 2023, conflicts in the Middle East and Europe contributed to another volatile year on global energy markets. Coupled with a strong focus on energy security, this further indicates the transition will not be smooth or linear and our strategy needs to be responsive.\n\nWe are confident gas will continue to play a crucial role in the global energy mix, including as back up support for electricity grids powered by renewables. We are also working to diversify our portfolio into new energy products and lower carbon services.\n\n## Strong leadership\n\nOn behalf of the Board, it was a pleasure to welcome Ashok Belani who started as non-executive director on 29 January 2024. Ashok has extensive experience in new energy and petroleum sector decarbonisation and will be a valuable asset to the Woodside Board.\n\nI would also like to thank our Chief Executive O/fficer Meg O'Neill and the entire Woodside team for another successful year. Meg is calm, methodical and inclusive. She is the right leader to seize the opportunities the energy transition brings and work through its challenges. Thank you also to our shareholders, for investing and placing your trust in Woodside.\n\nIn 2024, Woodside is celebrating its 70th anniversary and 40 years of production from the North West Shelf, the birthplace of Australia's LNG industry. It is an opportunity to reflect on the significant contribution Woodside has made to Australia's prosperity and regional energy security. We plan to build on this legacy for years to come.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Richard Goyder, AO\n\nChair of the Board\n\n27 February 2024",

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive O/fficer's report\n\nThe past year has seen Woodside deliver record production while laying the foundations for future growth and value.\n\nWe bedded down our transition to a larger, global energy company following the merger with BHP's petroleum business, working e/ffectively as one team across multiple locations.\n\n## Safety must improve\n\nWhen I reflect on 2023 I will always think of our colleague Michael Jurman, who lost his life while working at our North Rankin Complex. His death continues to a/ffect many of us, and I again o/ffer my deepest condolences to Michael's family and friends.\n\nSafety is our number one priority and we must improve. In 2023, we commissioned an external review of our safety systems and this will guide our e/fforts to improve safety performance.\n\n## Strong, reliable production\n\nWe achieved record full-year production of 187.2 MMboe (513 Mboe/day) from our expanded global portfolio. Reliability at Pluto LNG and the Karratha Gas Plant (KGP) in Western Australia was excellent at 98%. Planned turnarounds and maintenance activities were successfully completed at major assets.\n\nThis strong operational performance allowed us to leverage continued robust demand for our products. Operating revenue for 2023 was $14 billion, driving an annual reported net profit after tax of $1.7 billion.\n\nWe achieved this record production while continuing to reduce our net equity Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which in 2023 were 12.5% below our starting base (compared to 11% in 2022). 1\n\n## Delivering the next wave of growth\n\nDuring the year we made good progress at our key growth projects. By the end of 2023, our Scarborough Energy Project was more than 55% complete and on track for first LNG cargo in 2026. 2 At year end, fabrication of the Pluto Train 2 modules was underway with six of the 51 complete, and site works were well progressed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Sangomar project o/ff Senegal was 93% complete at the end of 2023, with 17 of 23 wells drilled and completed. 4 The floating production storage and o/ffloading (FPSO) facility sailed away from the Singapore shipyard in December. We are targeting first oil in mid-2024.\n\nIn June, we took a final investment decision (FID) on the Trion Project in the Gulf of Mexico. Procurement activities commenced for the floating production unit (FPU) materials and subsea equipment. We are targeting first oil from Trion in 2028.\n\nIn our new energy portfolio, we took FID on the Hydrogen Refueller @H2Perth. We are targeting supply of hydrogen to Western Australian industrial and public customers in 2025. We are also advancing several carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. Progress is also being made on our proposed H2OK hydrogen project in Oklahoma, United States and the proposed Woodside Solar project near Karratha, Western Australia.\n\n## Sustainable performance\n\nAs Woodside's global presence increases, our sustainability performance becomes ever more important. In 2023 we updated our Sustainability Strategy, further embedding sustainability performance into everything we do.\n\nIn closing, I am proud of the Woodside team and proud to work in this industry. I have seen first-hand how safe, reliable energy transforms lives. We cannot lose sight of this as we work towards a stable energy transition that benefits future generations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Meg O'Neill\n\nChief Executive O/fficer and Managing Director\n\n27 February 2024\n\nKey environmental approvals were accepted in late 2023 and following this our seismic program was successfully completed. Our sale and purchase agreement with LNG Japan, for the sale of a 10% equity interest in the Scarborough Joint Venture, was a key 2023 achievement. 3\n\n- 1 Targets and aspiration are for net equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions relative to a starting base of 6.32 Mt CO 2 -e which is representative of the gross annual average equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions over 2016-2020 and which may be adjusted (up or down) for potential equity changes in producing or sanctioned assets with a final investment decision prior to 2021. Net equity emissions include the utilisation of carbon credits as o/ffsets.\n- 2 The completion percentage excludes the Pluto Train 1 modifications project.\n- 3 Subject to completion of the transaction, targeted in the first quarter of 2024.\n- 4 The progress of the project has been updated to 93% following a 0.2% correction identified subsequent to the period.",

We play to our strengths, providing oil and gas to our customers while advancing new energy products and lower carbon services. Climate is an integrated part of our strategy and we assess investment decisions against a wide range of considerations including climate outcomes. This is important as the demand from our customers becomes increasingly shaped by their decarbonisation goals.\n\n## Woodside's strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nSecondly, we want to create and return value to our shareholders. Our capital management framework aims to optimise value, balance strong shareholder returns and invest in quality opportunities.\n\nFinally, we aim to conduct our business sustainably. To achieve this, we need to manage our impact on people, communities and the environment in which we operate. The safety of our people and a strong focus on managing our net equity Scope 1 and 2 emissions to meet our targets is critical to the longevity of our business.\n\nAll three goals are critical to ensuring that Woodside delivers its strategy and thrives through the energy transition.\n\n## Goals driving our strategic direction\n\nProvide energy\n\nCreate and return value\n\nConduct our business sustainably",

Woodside's disciplined capital allocation approach includes robust assessment of opportunities, portfolio outcomes and shareholder returns while maintaining focus on safe, reliable and e/fficient operations.\n\nOur global portfolio includes LNG, oil and gas assets across Australia, the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, Senegal, Timor-Leste and Canada.\n\nWe are weighted towards LNG, which we expect to play a sustained role through the energy transition as our customers seek to reduce their emissions. Our LNG assets are geographically advantaged.\n\nOur domestic gas assets deliver steady cash flows, resilience to commodity prices and provide reliable returns.\n\nIn our oil assets, we seek high cash generation and shorter payback periods, which boosts our funding capabilities in the short-term, while remaining resilient in the long-term as the demand for oil decreases.\n\nWe strive to operate our assets safely, reliably and e/fficiently to deliver the best value to our customers.\n\n## OIL\n\n## OFFSHORE\n\n## DIVERSIFIED\n\nGenerate high returns to fund diversified growth, focusing on high quality resources\n\nNew energy products and lower carbon services to reduce customers' emissions; hydrogen, ammonia, CCUS 1\n\nHigh cash generation Shorter payback period Quick to market\n\nDeveloping market Lower capital requirement Lower risk profile\n\nPayback within 5 years\n\nIRR > 10% Payback within 10 years 2\n\nWe have major projects in execution phase that will deliver Woodside's next wave of growth.

The total amount of the final dividend payment is $1,139 million which represents approximately 80% of underlying NPAT for the second half of 2023. 1\n\nThe dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) remains suspended.\n\n## Liquidity and debt service\n\nWoodside's primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, net cash generated by operating activities, unused borrowing capacity under its bilateral facilities and syndicated facilities, issuances of debt or equity securities and other sources, such as sales of non-strategic assets.\n\nDuring the year, Woodside generated $6,145 million of cash flow from operating activities and delivered positive free cash flow of $560 million. 2,3\n\nWoodside increased its standby debt facilities from $4,050 million to $6,050 million and repaid $284 million of maturing debt. At the end of the period, drawn debt was $4,874 million, with no principle debt payable in 2024 and liquidity was $7,790 million.\n\nAdditional details of Woodside's credit facilities, including total commitments, maturity and interest and amount outstanding as at 31 December 2023, can be found in section 5 - Financial Statements and Note C.2 to the audited Financial Statements of Woodside as at 31 December 2023 and 2022.\n\nWoodside's principal ongoing uses of cash are to meet working capital requirements, fund debt obligations and finance Woodside's capital expenditure and acquisitions. We believe working capital is sufficient for our present requirements.\n\nWoodside's capital expenditure for 2024 is expected to be between $5,000 million and $5,500 million primarily due to Sangomar, Scarborough and Trion project expenditure. This excludes the impact of any subsequent asset sell-downs, acquisitions or other changes in equity. We are targeting first oil in mid-2024 for Sangomar, first LNG cargo in 2026 for Scarborough and first oil in 2028 for Trion.\n\nWoodside has no o/ff-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material e/ffect on the Woodside's financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nWoodside's commitment to an investment grade credit rating remains unchanged and supports Woodside's aims of providing sustainable returns to shareholders and investing in future growth opportunities, in accordance with our capital allocation framework. In 2023, Woodside's credit ratings of BBB+ and Baa1 by S&P Global and Moody's respectively were both maintained. 4\n\nWoodside's gearing at the end of 2023 was 12.1%, within the lower end of our target range of 10-20%. Woodside's gearing may at times fall outside the target range of 10-20% as the balance sheet is managed through the investment cycle. 5\n\n## Commodity price risk management\n\nWoodside hedges to protect the balance sheet against downside commodity price risk, particularly during periods of high capital expenditure.\n\nWoodside hedged approximately 22 MMboe of 2023 volumes. The realised value of these oil price hedges was a pre-tax expense of approximately $200 million.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, Woodside has placed oil price hedges for approximately 29 MMboe of 2024 production at an average price of approximately $76 per barrel.\n\nWoodside has also placed hedges for Corpus Christi LNG volumes to protect against downside pricing risk. These hedges are Henry Hub and Title Transfer Facility (TTF) commodity swaps. An average of 63% of 2024 volumes and 17% of 2025 volumes have reduced pricing risk as a result of hedging activities.",

Increased demand for oil and natural gas has highlighted the need for continued production of and investment in hydrocarbons, while policy support for renewables and lower carbon services has continued to be robust.\n\n## MACROECONOMIC\n\nThe global economy proved resilient in 2023 despite the dual challenges of persistently high inflation levels and rising interest rates; gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 3.0%. 1 Hawkish monetary policy from 2022 was adopted, curbing inflation. Many advanced economies are passing peak interest rates; however, longer-term macroeconomic impacts of policy are unknown.\n\nChina presents uncertainty as the economy struggles with tepid demand, lower confidence and the real estate sector faces liquidity issues. However, recent government stimulus is a positive sign for future growth enabling China to meet its 2023 o/fficial GDP growth target of approximately 5%.\n\nThe world's population is expected to increase by approximately two billion people by 2050 and GDP is forecast to almost double, driving increased energy demand. 2\n\n## OIL\n\nOPEC+ continues to exert control in balancing oil markets and has committed to further production cuts in 2024. 3 However, non-OPEC production volumes, particularly in the US Lower 48, Canada, Brazil and Guyana will continue to grow into 2024 potentially o/ffsetting OPEC+ cuts.\n\nDated Brent averaged US$83/bbl in 2023, 18% below average 2022 prices which were elevated by the energy crisis and 14% above the five-year average. 4 Oil prices are expected to remain elevated into 2024 supported by a geopolitical risk premium, OPEC+ production management and a slower growth rate for non-OPEC production.\n\n- 1 International Monetary Fund, January 2024. 'World Economic Outlook Update'.\n- 2 Wood Mackenzie, September 2023. 'Energy Transition Outlook 2023'.\n\n- 4 Thompson Reuters Eikon.\n\n5\n\nWood Mackenzie, October 2023. 'Global Gas Investment Horizon Outlook'.\n\n6\n\nAustralian Energy Market Operator, 2023. 'Western Australian Gas Statement of Opportunities'.\n\n## LIQUIFIED NATURAL GAS\n\nIn 2023, global gas markets began to rebalance but remained tight, exacerbated by Russian LNG sanction uncertainty. Although North East Asian LNG prices averaged half of 2022 average prices at US$14/MMBtu, global gas prices remain robust and consistent with long-term expectations. 4 Wood Mackenzie forecasts in its base case scenario that global LNG demand will grow 53% to 2033, supported by growth in Europe (until 2029), China and emerging Asian markets. 5\n\n## NEW ENERGY PRODUCTS\n\nGlobally, investment in new energy technology has increased, spurred by government incentives such as REPowerEU and the US Inflation Reduction Act and a common goal to reduce long-term emissions. Subsidies have driven early growth in wind and solar followed by refinement of technology and large-scale manufacturing which has improved a/ffordability. Although the environment for new energy products remains challenged by uncertainty in proving technologies, securing future demand for product, lack of clarity on the application of incentives, and unfavourable project economics, Woodside believes that new energy products will play an important role in the energy transition.\n\n## AUSTRALIAN DOMESTIC GAS MARKETS\n\nThe Australian domestic gas market experienced supply shortfalls in 2023 as demand outpaced supply. In Western Australia, demand was supported by the progressive retirement of coal fired power generation, numerous outages and project delays. Demand is expected to exceed supply by up to 11% until 2029 with an increasing supply gap to 2032 as coal supply is retired. 6 Despite the Federal government implementing a price cap of A$12/GJ for new supplies in 2023 to improve a/ffordability, further investment in supply and infrastructure will be needed in the future to ensure that demand can be met.",

        "page_content": "## NORTH WEST SHELF PROJECT\n\nThe NWS Project consists of three o/ffshore platforms and the onshore KGP, which includes five onshore LNG processing trains.\n\nWoodside's share of NWS Project production was 40.8 MMboe in 2023. This was an 11% increase compared to 2022, due to the increase of Woodside's equity share following completion of the merger with BHP Petroleum in June 2022. In 2023, 11.2 MMboe of Pluto gas was processed at KGP through the Pluto-KGP Interconnector. The Interconnector enables gas from Pluto LNG to be transported to KGP for processing.\n\nIn June 2023, a fatality occurred at the North Rankin Complex. The tragic loss of our colleague, a contractor employee, has led to the implementation of additional operational controls based on preliminary investigation insights into the incident. The external investigations into the incident are ongoing.\n\nKGP is expected to have increased ullage in 2024 due to a combination of natural field decline and limited third-party gas processing demand. To optimise utilisation of onshore infrastructure, NWS is planning to take one LNG train o/ffline in 2024.\n\nDiscussions continue between NWS and other resource owners for the processing of third-party gas and NWS continues to progress the development of infill and nearfield opportunities to utilise ullage at KGP. The NWS Project started processing Waitsia gas in 2023 at low rates and will commence processing at a large scale when the Waitsia Stage 2 facility comes online which is expected in 2024.\n\nState and Commonwealth regulatory approval processes continue for the North West Shelf Project Extension, which supports long-term operations and processing of future third-party gas resources at KGP.\n\nWoodside successfully completed planned turnaround and maintenance activities on the North Rankin Complex, Goodwyn Platform and KGP in the second half of 2023.\n\nWoodside is operator and holds a 33.33% participating interest.\n\n## WHEATSTONE AND JULIMAR-BRUNELLO\n\nWheatstone is an LNG processing facility near Onslow, Western Australia, comprising an o/ffshore production platform and two onshore LNG processing trains. It processes gas from several o/ffshore gas fields including Julimar and Brunello.\n\nWoodside's share of Wheatstone production was 13.5 MMboe in 2023, an increase from 12.2 MMboe in 2022, which was impacted by a major facility turnaround.\n\nThe FID on Julimar-Brunello Phase 3 was approved in April 2023. The project involves the drilling of up to four development wells tied-back from the Julimar field to the existing Julimar field production system.\n\nWoodside is operator and holds a 65% participating interest in the Julimar-Brunello fields. Woodside holds a 13% non-operated interest in the Wheatstone project.\n\n## BASS STRAIT\n\nBass Strait is located in the south-east of Australia and produces oil and gas through a network of o/ffshore platforms, pipelines and onshore processing facilities. The Bass Strait assets include the Gippsland Basin Joint Venture (GBJV) and the Kipper Unit Joint Venture (KUJV).\n\nWoodside's share of production from the Bass Strait was 22.8 MMboe in 2023, driven by lower Australian east coast gas market demand due to a number of factors including a warmer winter. All of Woodside's share of the gas produced by the GBJV is supplied into the eastern Australian domestic gas market, supporting Australia's energy needs.\n\nAs production rates decline, progress has been made to optimise facilities through the Gas Asset Streamlining project. This project will support the implementation of a gas focused business.\n\nThe Kipper Compression project has progressed and is expected to enable continued supply of gas to the domestic market in 2024.\n\nWoodside holds a 50% non-operating interest in the GBJV and a 32.5% non-operating interest in the KUJV.\n\n## OTHER AUSTRALIAN OIL AND GAS ASSETS\n\nWoodside operates three FPSO facilities o/ff the north-west coast of Western Australia. These are the Ngujima-Yin FPSO (Woodside interest: 60%), Okha FPSO (Woodside interest: 50%) and Pyrenees FPSO (Woodside interest: 40% in WA-43-L and 71.4% in WA-42-L).\n\nWoodside's share of production from the FPSO assets was 8.0 MMboe, down from 10.6 MMboe in 2022 primarily due to the planned five-yearly Ngujima-Yin FPSO maintenance turnaround.\n\nThe Ngujima-Yin FPSO turnaround performed in Singapore was completed safely in June 2023. The Pyrenees turnaround is planned for the first half of 2024.\n\nMacedon (Woodside interest: 71.4%), also operated by Woodside, is a gas project located near Onslow, Western Australia which produces pipeline gas for the Western Australian domestic gas market.\n\nWoodside's share of production from Macedon in 2023 was 8.2 MMboe. The Macedon facility delivered approximately 17% of the Western Australian domestic gas market supply in 2023.",

The field is being developed through new o/ffshore facilities connected by an approximately 430 km pipeline to a second LNG train at the existing Pluto LNG onshore facility.\n\nThe development of the Scarborough field includes the installation of a FPU with eight wells drilled in the initial phase and 13 wells drilled throughout the life of the field. Expansion of Pluto LNG includes the construction of a second LNG train (Pluto Train 2), installation of additional domestic gas processing facilities and supporting infrastructure and modifications to the existing Pluto Train 1 to allow it to process Scarborough gas.\n\nScarborough gas is expected to produce approximately 5 Mtpa of LNG from Pluto Train 2, and up to 3 Mtpa of LNG from the existing Pluto Train 1. The Scarborough reservoir contains less than 0.1% CO 2 . Combined with processing design e/fficiencies at the o/ffshore floating production unit and onshore Pluto Train 2 the Scarborough Energy Project will be one of the lowest carbon intensity sources of LNG delivered into North Asian markets. 1\n\nAt the end of 2023, the project was 55% complete. 2 Fabrication of the FPU is ongoing with the living quarters commissioning underway and the hull and topsides progressing. Subsequent to the period, the hull exited its first drydock and the flare boom was installed on the topsides. Fabrication of the subsea flowlines and trunkline are complete.\n\nThe environment plans for the seismic, drilling, subsea and trunkline installation activities were accepted by the regulator in December. Following this approval, the seismic program was successfully completed. Subsequent to the period, the first subsea flowline was installed, drilling of the production wells commenced and work on the nearshore pipeline installation completed. Work on the remainder of the pipeline in Commonwealth waters is underway.\n\nPluto Train 2 site works are well progressed in preparation for delivery of equipment and modules throughout 2024. At the end of 2023, approximately 33,000 m 3 of concrete has been poured, 564 tonnes of structural steel erected and 3 km of piping has been installed. Fabrication of six modules was complete, with a further 38 modules underway. Additional modules were completed subsequent to the period.\n\n- 1 Wood Mackenzie Emissions Benchmarking.\n- 2 The completion percentage excludes the Pluto Train 1 modifications project.\n- 3 LJ Scarborough Pty Ltd (LNG Japan) is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of LNG Japan Corporation, which is a 50:50 joint venture between Sumitomo Corporation and Sojitz Corporation.

        "page_content": "Our climate-related opportunities and risks are outlined below and also described in detail in section 5.0 of the Climate Transition Action Plan and 2023 Progress Report. This includes detail of how these processes are integrated into Woodside's overall risk management framework.\n\n## Potential opportunities\n\nThe categories of potential climate-related opportunities include: resources e/fficiency, energy sources, products and services, markets and resilience.\n\n## Potential risks\n\nThe categories of potential climate-related risks include: transition risks such as policy and legal risks, technology, market, and reputation; physical risks such as acute, and chronic.\n\nSee also section 3.9 - Risk factors.\n\n## Our approach\n\nThis is an abbreviated summary of our Climate Transition Action Plan and 2023 Progress Report which should be read in full, and is available at woodside.com.\n\n## REDUCE OUR NET EQUITY SCOPE 1 AND 2 GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS\n\nWoodside is targeting a reduction of net equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions of 15% by 2025 and 30% by 2030, with an aspiration of net zero by 2050 or sooner. 1 Our performance against these targets is highlighted in the highlights section.\n\nReducing our net equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions is supported by three levers:\n\n- \u00b7  avoiding emissions in design\n- \u00b7  reducing emissions in operations and\n- \u00b7  o/ffsetting the remainder with carbon credits.\n\nWoodside has a long standing focus on energy e/fficiency. Our first formal climate-related target was a 5% energy e/fficiency target over the period 2016-2020. We exceeded this target, achieving 8%.\n\n## Decarbonisation planning\n\nOur priority is to avoid and reduce emissions. All Woodside operated assets and projects must draw up decarbonisation plans to identify the technical opportunities to reduce emissions at the facility, so that the opportunities can be further assessed for engineering and commercial viability.\n\nOpportunities that are estimated to cost less than our internal long-term cost of carbon of $80/t CO 2 -e (real terms 2022) are incorporated into asset or project level business plans. 2 These opportunities are at varying levels of maturity. To date:\n\n- \u00b7  Opportunities that we estimate could avoid approximately 16 million tonnes CO 2 -e (cumulatively to 2050) have been incorporated into the design of the Scarborough, Pluto Train 2 and Trion projects 3\n- \u00b7  Around a further 70 opportunities, which we estimate could avoid approximately 12 million tonnes CO 2 -e (cumulatively to 2050) are targeted for completion at our existing facilities by 2030. 3\n\nWe estimate that the opportunities still to be implemented at our existing operating facilities could have a combined capital cost of around $200 million. 3\n\n## Large scale abatement plan\n\nEmissions reduction opportunities that are estimated to cost more than $80/t CO 2 -e are reviewed by our Executive Leadership Team. 2 They are subject to more engineering, cost reduction or technology maturation in a company-wide large scale abatement plan, as depicted in the chart below. If they can be matured to an appropriate level, they will be reassessed by the Executive Leadership Team and progressed where appropriate. The proposed Woodside Solar project is an example of a project likely costing more than $80/t CO 2 -e that is progressing.\n\nLNG facilities are the source of the majority of our emissions. They arise from reservoir CO 2 , power generation, mechanical turbines and our flaring system. Electrification (using renewable or lower carbon power), CCS and hydrogen fuelling of turbines are all options that could reduce these emissions, creating choices in the optimal mix.",

        "page_content": "We estimate these large scale opportunities could potentially deliver approximately 35 million tonnes of additional cumulative Scope 1 and 2 emissions reductions through to 2050. 1 The next stage of our planning process is therefore to determine which of the multiple abatement options should be selected. With a focus on cost-e/ffectiveness, they will also be compared with alternatives, such as new emerging technologies, or the use of carbon credits as o/ffsets.\n\nIf all current abatement e/fforts and future abatement pipeline opportunities are realised, residual emissions from our current portfolio could be approximately 0.3 Mtpa CO2-e in 2050, an approximately 95% reduction from our 2016-2020 starting base. 1,2\n\n## Abatement option for typical LNG emissions sources 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Marginal abatement cost curve 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Utilising carbon credits\n\nLike our asset decarbonisation plans, our portfolio of carbon credits enables our base business to manage the price risk associated with regulations and our corporate net equity Scope 1 and 2 emissions targets.\n\nOne carbon credit is intended to represent a tonne of emissions avoided, reduced or removed outside of our facilities. 3 Because of the importance of carbon credit integrity, Woodside applies our own additional assessment to our carbon credits portfolio. This assessment is described in the Climate Transition Action Plan, and includes:\n\n- \u00b7  additionality of the credited abatement is demonstrable\n- \u00b7  abatement has a high likelihood of permanence\n- \u00b7  abatement is accurately quantified.\n\nWe established a Carbon Business in 2018 in order to develop a portfolio of carbon credits and our skills and expertise in managing carbon credit integrity. Since then we have invested more than $150 million, with approximately one third of that spend focused on the origination of our own projects, and the remainder on purchase of credits. 4,5,6,7 Today, Woodside manages a portfolio of more than 20 million carbon credits, which it has acquired with an average cost of supply of less than $20/t. 5,7\n\nOur approach is informed by current and emerging external frameworks such as the Integrity Council on the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM)'s Core Carbon Principles, the Investor Group on Climate Change's (IGCC)'s guidance, and the Oxford Principles for Net Zero Aligned O/ffsetting. 8,9,10\n\n- 1 Indicative only, not guidance.

Investment in carbon credits allocated to Scope 1 and 2 emissions do not contribute to our Scope 3 investment target. The $150 million quoted investment in carbon credits in this report has not been attributed to the $335 million Scope 3 investment target update in this report.\n- 5 Portfolio volume excludes carbon credits (held and expected to be received) from Woodside Pluto Carbon O/ffset Project Stages 1-4 held by Woodside Burrup Pty Ltd.\n- 6 Origination refers to carbon o/ffset projects developed by Woodside or third-party project developers, characterised by (i) the provision by Woodside of up-front investment or funding; (ii) Woodside either being a majority participant in the project or a recipient of carbon credits from the project (or both); and (iii) the acceptance of risk by Woodside in relation to carbon credit delivery.\n- 7 The carbon portfolio is dynamic. Volumes, methods and geography are subject to change. Portfolio volume includes Australian Carbon Credit Units and voluntary carbon market credits held, and expected to be delivered or generated up to 2050 under or in relation to: (i) third-party contracts entered into prior to 31 December 2023; or (ii) Woodside originated projects for which land has been purchased prior to 31 December 2023. Volumes reported on an unrisked basis. Unrisked volumes do not include an adjustment to such volumes to reflect any risk of non-delivery. Portfolio volume excludes retired units. Woodside does not make any claims in relation to the mitigation impact of carbon credit within the portfolio unless, and until, a credit is retired or surrendered (taken out of circulation and can no longer be sold). Cost of supply is calculated pre-tax and is based on portfolio volumes and a calculation of 2023 present value unit costs.\n- 8 ICVCM, 2023.

        "page_content": "## INVEST IN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR THE ENERGY TRANSITION\n\nInvesting in products and services for the energy transition is supported by three levers:\n\n- \u00b7  assessing investments for their resilience to the energy transition\n- \u00b7  diversifying our products and services and\n- \u00b7  supporting our customers and suppliers to reduce their emissions.\n\n## Assessing investments\n\nThe precise shape and pace of the energy transition is uncertain. It is expected to vary across countries because they have di/fferent starting points, development requirements, resources and capabilities. However, the scale of the transition is clearer as it will take many trillions of dollars, invested over decades. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates it will require $150 trillion of cumulative investment by 2050. 1\n\nWhilst the scale of the investment required for the energy transition creates opportunity for Woodside, its inherent uncertainty and potential volatility creates risks. We believe that acknowledging the uncertainty and building resilience to it is a better response than picking a single future scenario and acting as if it were certain.\n\nThis approach requires us:\n\n- \u00b7  to carefully analyse a wide range of energy market and climate-related scenarios\n- \u00b7  diversify our portfolio to meet changing customer demand\n- \u00b7  have a disciplined capital allocation framework to focus our investments where we believe we will be most competitive\n- \u00b7  work diligently with our customers to understand and meet their needs so that ultimately we secure their purchase of our products and services.\n\nWe have developed a 'transition case' methodology which, like a business case and a safety case, helps us to manage risk by assessing investment opportunities across a range of climate-related factors. There are currently six elements to our transition case methodology, which was first applied to the final investment decision for the Trion development in the Mexican segment of the Gulf of Mexico in 2023.\n\n## Transition case for oil and gas investments\n\nWe consider:\n\n- 1. Investment attractiveness utilising a range of economic assumptions informed by climate scenarios as well as other factors such as geopolitics and macroeconomics.\n- 2. Cash flow scenario analysis impact by comparing the impact 'with and without opportunity' on future cash flows using scenarios, including a 1.5\u00b0C case. 2\n- 3. Potential demand resilience analysis considering the competitiveness of the project's cost of supply relative to the range of demand in IPCC scenarios, including 1.5\u00b0C cases.\n- 4. Climate-related risks and opportunities by comparing the impact 'with and without opportunity' on our portfolio aggregate climate risk exposure.\n- 5. Scope 1 and 2 portfolio emissions assessing the impact of 'design out' work on project emissions, and of residual emissions upon portfolio emissions abatement demand, and portfolio emissions intensity.\n- 6. Scope 1, 2 and 3 portfolio emissions intensity by comparing the impact 'with and without opportunity' on our portfolio.\n\n- 2 IPCC, 2023. 'Climate Change 2023: Synthesis Report.

We focus on health and safety because we believe that everyone should be able to go home in the same condition as they started the day.\n\nWe aim to be an industry leader in health and safety outcomes to protect people, communities and environments. We expect all our workers (including employees and contractors) to prioritise their own health and safety and that of others to keep each other safe. We strongly believe in embedding a safety culture where our people are empowered to take action to prevent injuries and maintain a safe working environment.\n\nThe fatality of our colleague, a contractor employee, on the North Rankin Complex (NRC) continues to a/ffect many of us. Our response prioritised the immediate safety and wellbeing of the workforce on the NRC. The Woodside Board convened and members of our Board and Executive Leadership Team visited our operational sites to meet with our workers (including employees and contractors) and o/ffer their support. We completed a significant internal investigation into the incident and presented the findings and agreed actions to the Board and the National O/ffshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we facilitated an external review of our integrated safety and operational systems and plan to incorporate recommendations of this review into actions as part of a continuous improvement to our safety performance.\n\n## Highlights\n\n## Potential opportunities\n\n- \u00b7  Continue to learn from the incident on the NRC that led to the fatality of our colleague employed by a contractor company and other significant events.\n\n## Potential risks\n\n- \u00b7  Significant loss of primary containment process safety events.\n- \u00b7  Failure to e/ffectively plan and execute high-risk work activities.\n- \u00b7  Failure to apply lessons from investigations and Field Leadership Program engagements leading to repeated events.\n\nSee also section 3.9 - Risk factors.\n\n## Our approach\n\nAt Woodside everything we do is guided by Our Values. Everyone has the right to come to work and feel safe. Woodside continues its longstanding commitment to building and maintaining a work environment that is free from all forms of discrimination and inappropriate behaviour including sexual harassment. Our Code of Conduct defines the expected behaviours of everyone working at Woodside. Implementation of our Working Respectfully Policy supports the psychological safety of our workforce.\n\nRefer to woodside.com for our Code of Conduct and Working Respectfully Policy.\n\nOur We Care value, guides us to keep each other safe and care for communities. We prioritise safety and promote a positive safety culture by encouraging everyone to speak up and intervene on safety issues. We acknowledge providing energy to the world in the form of oil, gas and new energy potentially presents safety risks. We aim to control or mitigate the potential impacts of these risks on people, the economy and the environment.\n\nOur Health and Safety Policy outlines the objectives and principles that shape our approach. This approach is consistent across all our business operations. When assessing safety risks, we consider the potential negative impacts of our business activities to communities and our workforce, including impacts on human rights. We implement systems and processes to identify, assess and control safety risks by applying the hierarchy of controls. Our expectations and procedures set mandatory requirements for managing high-risk work, including obligations to stop unsafe work to prevent potential fatalities and high-consequence injuries.\n\nWe take action to protect the health of our workforce and facilitate earliest recovery from work-related injury or illness. We aim to eliminate or mitigate workplace health hazards at the design stage of projects or control them as far as reasonably practicable based on the level of assessed risk. If hazards remain and there is a risk of exposure, we strive to ensure that worker exposure does not exceed legal limits through implementation of the hierarchy of controls method.\n\n- \u00b7  Embed our Field Leadership Program to strengthen understanding of our work practices and make improvements to HSE risk controls.\n- \u00b7  Improve tracking and visibility of leading indicators of HSE performance.\n- \u00b7  Employee survey results showed us that our people feel empowered to speak up and act on health and safety issues.\n- \u00b7  The framework for our new Woodside Field Leadership Program was developed and we commenced testing with our Australian based workforce.\n- \u00b7  Integration of our global approach to wellbeing, event reporting and investigations, health, safety and environment (HSE) in contracting and performance monitoring was progressed.",

Potentially harmful workplace health hazards include uncontrolled exposure to noise, hazardous substances (e.g. benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX), and mercury), naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM), infectious disease (e.g. COVID-19), hazardous manual tasks and psychological hazards.\n\nRefer to woodside.com for additional information about our approach to Health, safety and wellbeing.\n\n## Our performance\n\nA fatality of our colleague on the NRC occurred in June 2023. Three additional high-consequence injuries were also recorded for 2023. Two musculoskeletal injuries that required surgery with extended recovery beyond six months and partial amputation of a thumb following a crush injury. Following insights from event investigations, we are focusing on field leadership and engagement, risk assessments and equipment management processes.\n\nIn 2023, Woodside experienced two Tier 1 and one Tier 2 loss of primary containment (LOPC) process safety events (PSE). All events were investigated, and actions were put in place to address the root causes, including preventative actions across our facilities. We are also embedding lessons learned relating to equipment selection and maintenance.\n\nThe workforce exposure hours in 2023 (total hours 20,914,483) increased by 25%, when compared to 2022 (total hours 16,699,730). The increase in exposure hours in 2023 was due to increasing project activity and merger integration.\n\nOur total recordable injury rate (TRIR) of 1.86 increased with 39 recordable injuries in 2023, compared to 30 in 2022. The main injury types were lacerations, wounds and soft tissue injuries.\n\nOur total recordable occupational illness frequency (TROIF) increased to 1.15 per million hours worked from 0.72 in 2022. The 24 recordable occupational illnesses comprised 12 noise induced hearing loss, five psychological illnesses, four musculoskeletal conditions and three skin reactions.\n\n## Process safety\n\nWe recognise the critical importance of e/ffective Process Safety Management (PSM) to avoid major accident and environmental events due to loss of control of hazardous substances. We continue to focus on process safety leadership to ensure consistent awareness of contemporary PSM approaches, organisational status, personal expectations, and accountabilities. In 2023, we rationalised and improved our competency curriculum and continued with regular assessment and assurance of process safety critical roles across global operations. Future focus areas include continuing our e/fforts to embed a strong process safety culture, building competency across our hydrocarbon business and increasing process safety applications in our new energy and carbon business areas.\n\nIn 2024, we are targeting a 95% company-wide completion of competency assessments for people in process safety critical roles requiring a skilled (advanced) level of competency.\n\n## Field Leadership Program\n\nWoodside's Field Leadership Program provides a structured approach to work team engagement, where leaders build their understanding of onsite work practices and develop the leadership skills that aim to lead to a safer workplace. The program has been designed to be applied at all worksite types from operating assets to the o/ffice environment. A key objective is to learn from frontline workers which is aligned with Our Values and Human Organisational Performance (HOP) principles. Outcomes from the program include increased organisational knowledge of risks and controls, a sustainable method to identify and improve organisational factors, and to further develop our culture of care.\n\nIn 2023, the Field Leadership Program framework was tested with operational groups. This required extensive workforce engagement to listen and learn from current approaches to HSE and work management so that the program can be tailored to enable a safer Woodside.\n\nIn 2024, the program will evolve by listening and supporting end users through training and coaching activities. We aim to develop and implement a strategy to rollout and sustain the program across our global sites.\n\n## Mental health and wellbeing\n\nOur wellbeing vision is to be recognised as an employer of choice. We aim to cultivate a work environment where everyone can flourish by focusing on people, empowerment, and quality leadership. To achieve this, we have expanded and refreshed our Global Wellbeing Framework to focus on six key elements: (1) protecting from harm, (2) promoting health and wellbeing, (3) connection and community, (4) work-life balance, (5) opportunities for growth, and (6) meaning and purpose. Each element has a strategic goal, enabling activities and metrics to track progress, including the use of our employee survey to seek regular feedback from our people. In 2024, we plan to launch our refreshed wellbeing framework across our global business areas, and work with our leaders to commence enabling activities.",

Begin to invest in biodiversity positive projects in the regions where we are active.\n- \u00b7  Continue to collect knowledge on environmental and biodiversity benefits of in-situ decommissioning.\n- \u00b7  Ongoing development of technology to identify the seasonality of o/ffshore cetaceans and further manage our underwater noise impacts.\n- \u00b7  Increased regulatory landscape and stakeholder expectations leading to extended timeframes for assessment and complexity of environmental approvals.\n- \u00b7  Failure to progress biodiversity positive outcomes in a timely manner in the regions and areas where we operate.\n- \u00b7  Potential incident resulting in significant loss of hydrocarbon to the environment.\n\nSee also section 3.9 - Risk factors.\n\n## Our approach\n\nThe nature of our operations are accompanied by certain environmental impacts and risks. We work to minimise our impacts by integrating environmental management into our activities, including the design, construction, operation and decommissioning of our facilities.\n\nWe continue this integration by reviewing our processes and commitments, identifying areas of strength to build on and look to embed renewed environmental standards across Woodside and set appropriate targets and metrics against these. Our focus on implementing leading environmental management and mitigation strategies has allowed us to avoid and minimise our environmental impacts and maintain a more than 30 year record of oil and gas operations without any major environmental incidents.\n\nWe recognise that it is not just how we approach environmental management, such as the use of a risk-based assessment which matters, but that we also need to be clear and transparent. We engage with our stakeholders to better understand the possible impacts of our activities and to further understand preferred methods and frequency of engagement.\n\nOur hydrocarbon spill preparedness and response framework continues to be a focus across the company's global portfolio. The approach is underpinned by a comprehensive process informed by international best practice conventions. These require all activities to assess credible spill scenarios to marine environment, evaluate surface and subsea response options and recommend appropriate response techniques. These activity specific plans are supplemented by corporate plans, regional equipment, and locally trained resources.\n\n## Environmental management\n\nWe recognise our activities have an environmental footprint and we seek to avoid or minimise adverse environmental impacts to the natural environment in the regions we operate.\n\nWe do this by adopting a risk based approach that allows us to address the environmental impacts and risks associated with our activities in a consistent way. It allows us to focus our e/ffort and resources on the most significant risks associated with our activities no matter where we operate or what a regulatory regime may require.\n\n- \u00b7  In 2023, obtained secondary approvals for construction-related environment plans for the Scarborough Energy project.\n- \u00b7  We supported a number of scientific programs and industry working groups to further our knowledge and understanding on noise-related issues and o/ffshore whale species. Through these programs, bespoke underwater noise controls were developed to avoid and minimise marine noise impacts for o/ffshore projects.\n- \u00b7  A consultation approach for Environment Plans in Australia which has successfully addressed evolving regulatory requirements was developed.\n- \u00b7  Invested in science and biodiversity programs and conservation partnerships to support improved knowledge outcomes.\n- \u00b7  Established Woodside's Biodiversity Positive Program framework.\n- \u00b7  In 2023, Woodside planted approximately 2.7 million mixed biodiverse seedlings across approximately 4,700 hectares of land at Woodside owned properties. These activities bring the total number of hectares planted to approximately 10,000 hectares since the Native Reforestation Project began in 2020.",

Given this and the growing pressure on our natural environment, the environmental performance and the management of our environmental impacts is critical to the future success of our business.\n\nIn 2023, there were no environmental incidents involving hydrocarbon or hazardous non-hydrocarbon spills greater than 1 bbl released to the environment.\n\nAs part of our commitment to reducing impacts and risks, our hydrocarbon spill preparedness and response framework was embedded across our global portfolio of activities and operations. This enables our business to plan and evaluate spill risks to the marine environment in accordance with our environmental approach.\n\nIn 2023, we developed new oil pollution emergency plans that contributed to regulatory acceptance of 11 environmental approvals across our Australian assets. We also delivered capability and training programs for regions where we operate. We continue to engage with regional and international industry groups to assist in proactively managing and monitoring emerging risks.\n\nFrom 2023, Woodside has committed to supporting positive biodiversity outcomes in the regions in which we operate. Our approach builds on existing biodiversity positive projects, that commenced in the years prior to 2023. Woodside developed a framework in 2023 to assess and implement future projects. Woodside seeks to support biodiversity positive projects that have a measurable biodiversity outcome, that enhance stakeholder involvement and adequately manage risks.\n\nWe continue to invest in science to support better environmental performance and outcomes across our global portfolio.\n\nWe also continue to progress our environmental regulatory authorisations across Australia, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States, Mexico and Senegal to advance our projects. See section 3.7 - New energy and carbon solutions.\n\n## First Nations cultural heritage and engagement\n\nWe acknowledge the unique connection that First Nations communities have to land, waters and the environment. We believe First Nations cultural heritage and industry can successfully coexist. We seek to ensure Traditional Owners and Custodians are central to heritage management so that cultural values are understood and remain protected. We understand the importance of identifying and working with those who have longstanding cultural and spiritual connections to land and waters where we have a presence, and we are guided by them in our e/fforts to avoid or minimise potential impact of our operations on those First Nations communities.\n\nWe partner with First Nations communities to create positive outcomes that leave a lasting legacy.\n\nWe acknowledge the diversity of the First Nations communities in the areas where we are present. When communicating with a wide audience, Woodside uses the term Indigenous and First Nations interchangeably. On a local level, Woodside will be guided by the community as to the appropriate terms of reference.\n\n## Highlights\n\n- \u00b7  Extensive consultations in relation to cultural heritage management approvals.\n\n## Potential opportunities\n\n## Potential risks\n\n- \u00b7  Woodside contributes to negative impacts to Murujuga Rock Art.\n- \u00b7  Woodside does not meet local content outcomes for First Nations communities.\n- \u00b7  Woodside does not meet expectations of First Nations communities in areas where we are active.\n\nSee also section 3.9 - Risk factors.\n\n## Our approach\n\nOur First Nations Communities Policy defines our approach and is regularly reviewed and updated as required. Woodside employees, contractors and joint venture partners engaged in activities under Woodside's operational control, are collectively responsible for the application of the Policy and are provided with training to ensure they are able to do so. The Policy notes that Woodside is to be guided by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples which demonstrates our commitment to understanding the relevant human rights considerations as we engage with di/fferent First Nations communities.\n\n- \u00b7  Progression of relationships in New Zealand with the Ng\u0101i Tahu iwi relevant to the Southern Green Hydrogen Project, with a continued focus on strengthening stakeholder relationships.\n- \u00b7  Provision of support for consultation with First Nations stakeholders relevant to environment plan approvals.\n- \u00b7  Continued commitment to support submerged heritage research at Murujuga to inform project implementation and manage possible impacts.\n- \u00b7  First Nations Advisory Group Roundtable discussions.\n- \u00b7  Pursue initiatives in addition to existing Reconciliation Action Plan targets.\n- \u00b7  Further develop relationships with First Nations communities in the areas where we are active.\n- \u00b7  Pursue and formalise First Nations partnerships in the areas where we are active.",

        "page_content": "In Australia, we maintain relationships with First Nations communities in the Pilbara, Kimberley, South West and Perth. Due to recent changes to regulatory compliance requirements our approach to consultation has been extended. In 2023, Woodside's First Nations relations team consulted with a range of First Nations communities, in Australia, from Esperance to the Tiwi Islands and as far east as Melbourne. The diversity of the environments we are operating in as a global company has expanded our engagements with a range of community stakeholders in the United States, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, and New Zealand.\n\nRefer to woodside.com for our First Nations Community Policy.\n\n## Our performance\n\nIn 2023, new relationships were formed and new land use and relationship agreements were executed. Woodside remains committed to close consultation with the relevant persons in the areas in which we operate by way of community and individual meetings, attending community-initiated events, and ensuring accessibility for feedback or questions as needed. A key element of our consultation e/fforts is our willingness to be flexible and adaptable in our consultation format to suit the audience.\n\n## Cultural heritage\n\nWoodside's Cultural Heritage Management Procedure reflects our publicly available First Nations Communities Policy. This policy includes engaging with a/ffected communities of First Nations peoples in ways that are consistent with the principles of seeking Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC).\n\nOur approach to the identification, management and protection of tangible and intangible cultural heritage seeks to avoid impacts, or if avoidance is not possible, to minimise and mitigate those impacts. We seek to ensure Traditional Owners and Custodians are central to heritage management so that cultural values are understood and remain protected.\n\nWoodside also prepares detailed Cultural Heritage Management Plans (CHMPs) for nearshore and onshore facilities and projects and completes heritage audits and surveys with Traditional Custodians and independent heritage experts. Woodside is also committed to ensuring our management of cultural heritage is thorough, transparent and underpinned by consultation and continued engagement with First Nations communities, which is illustrated through our extensive consultation on our Environment Plans, completed heritage surveys for the proposed Woodside Solar project, and support for Murujuga's World Heritage Listing.\n\n## Cultural heritage management approvals\n\nWoodside's activities are the subject of environmental assessments by a range of regulators including the Australian National O/ffshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority.\n\nWoodside has consulted extensively with Indigenous stakeholders on a variety of activities in 2023. These consultations have included the tangible and intangible cultural heritage of the environments in which we plan to operate, as well as the environmental values. In 2023, we also agreed the Scarborough Cultural Heritage Management Plan with Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation (MAC), which is publicly available on our website at woodside.com.\n\nThe CHMP is designed to ensure that impacts to heritage sites and values, including to Murujuga's National Heritage Listed and World Tentative Heritage Listed values, are adequately protected in a manner agreed between Woodside and Traditional Owners and Custodians represented through MAC. It aims to preserve the tangible and intangible heritage values and protect the cultural and spiritual values of the Traditional Owners and Custodians. Woodside is also progressing the agreement of a CHMP with Ngarluma Aboriginal Corporation for the development of a proposed solar photovoltaic farm on the Maitland Strategic Industrial Estate.\n\n## Our continued commitment to reconciliation\n\nWoodside has been part of Reconciliation Australia's Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) program since 2009. Woodside's vision for reconciliation is to partner with Indigenous communities to create positive economic, social and cultural outcomes. It is also to reflect on our shared history, empower Indigenous voices to speak and be heard so all Australians can learn, and work together towards a better, shared future.\n\nWe are continuing to move away from recording completed activities, in favour of measuring longer-term impact outcomes. Woodside reports annually on progress towards the committed outcomes that support our four Reconciliation Action Plan pillars: respect for culture and heritage, capability and capacity, economic participation and stronger communities.\n\nIn 2023, Woodside made donations to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice Referendum activities that were aligned with Our Values, the principles set out within our 2021-2025 Reconciliation Action Plan and our First Nations Communities Policy. Our donations supported organisations to disseminate information and advocate in favour of formalising a pathway for Indigenous Australians to share their views on policies that impact them. Woodside's contribution aligns with our support for the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which called for the establishment of an Indigenous voice to Parliament, agreement making and truthtelling. For further information, please see the Corporate Governance Statement included in this report and the Sustainability section of our website at woodside.com.",

We are committed to managing risks in a proactive, informed and e/ffective manner as a source of competitive advantage.\n\nOur approach is intended to enable risk informed decision making, which will protect us against potential negative impacts and enable us to seek the right opportunities. The objective of our risk management framework is to provide a single consolidated view of risks across the company to understand our full risk exposure and prioritise risk management and governance.\n\nFor more information on our risk management process, refer to our Risk Management Policy, available on our website at woodside.com.\n\nWoodside's risk management process is presented as an iterative sequence that we undertake in a coordinated manner. The process helps us implement risk management to e/ffectively identify, assess, and control risks, thereby enhancing the likelihood of achieving our objectives. The process involves:\n\n- \u00b7  communication and consultation with key stakeholders\n- \u00b7  define risk scope, context and criteria\n- \u00b7  risk assessment\n- \u00b7  risk treatment\n- \u00b7  monitor and review risk management process; and\n- \u00b7  record and report risks.\n\nThe process is defined in our risk management procedure which is designed to provide a consistent process for the identification, management and reporting of risks that have the potential to materially impact the achievement of Woodside's business objectives.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee plays a crucial role in enabling the Board to meet its oversight responsibility in relation to Woodside's risk management. The Sustainability Committee also focuses on sustainability-related risk management. Refer to section 4.1.3 - Board committees for more information on the Audit & Risk Committee and the Sustainability Committee.\n\nWe categorise risks into three categories:\n\n## 1. Strategic risks\n\nRisks that could a/ffect our organisation's ability to achieve its strategic objectives.\n\n## 2. Entity risks\n\nRisks that could a/ffect our organisation's ability to achieve our business objectives. They can be positive, negative, or both; and can address, create, or result in opportunities and threats.\n\n## 3. Emerging risks\n\nRisks defined as an external threat or opportunity that has a high degree of uncertainty due to rapid or non-linear evolution. They have the potential to materially impact the achievement of strategic objectives.\n\nWoodside's risk appetite statement is a vital element of our risk framework. In 2023 the statement was updated to reflect the merged organisation's appetite to take risk and tolerance to outcomes. The statement is designed to enable our organisation to make risk informed decisions.",

        "page_content": "## OVERVIEW OF OUR RISK FACTORS\n\n## Climate change\n\nThe global response to climate change is changing the way the world produces and consumes energy. The complex and pervasive nature of climate change means transition risks are interconnected with and may amplify other risks. Additionally, the inherent uncertainty of potential societal responses to climate change may create a systemic risk to the global economy. Climate change may also create significant physical risks, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, wildfires, floods and other climatic events, as well as chronic shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns.\n\n## How is this factor relevant to Woodside?\n\nWoodside's risks associated with climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy include possible impacts to demand (and pricing) for oil, gas and its substitutes, the policy and legal environment for its exploration, development and production, and Woodside's reputation and operating environment. We may also face risks related to climate change's potential to cause physical damage or disruptions to our assets or our supply chains.\n\nWoodside is an energy company and in order for us to meet the ongoing needs of our customers and the communities in which we operate, we must understand, forecast and manage several critical risks to evolve and prosper through this transition.\n\nThese elements include:\n\n- \u00b7  the demand and pricing of oil, gas, new energy products and lower carbon services\n- \u00b7  the regulation of oil and gas exploration, production and consumption\n- \u00b7  the timing and rate of the global transition to a lower carbon economy\n- \u00b7  public perception of Woodside and the broader oil and gas industry\n- \u00b7  access to, and value of, carbon credits or emission allowances; and\n- \u00b7  uncertainties associated with changing weather patterns.\n\n## Examples of how this factor may impact Woodside\n\n- \u00b7  Physical impacts on our assets or those of our suppliers, customers or communities caused by increased frequency or intensity of severe weather events.\n- \u00b7  Over or under investing in oil and gas reserves leading to an imbalance between our supply and global demand.\n- \u00b7  Failure to transition to new energy at a pace that serves the global demand, or stakeholder sentiments, or to develop and implement lower carbon technologies on which Woodside's strategy may depend.\n- \u00b7  Climate-driven changes to legislation, regulation and policy or climate-related litigation resulting in additional costs, prevent or restrict Woodside from conducting activities and adversely impacting Woodside's reputation.\n\n## How is Woodside managing these risks?\n\nWoodside is working to meet its net equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, and to invest in the products and services for the energy transition. This includes oil, gas, new energy products and lower carbon services. 1\n\nWe engage and advocate with key industry and governance stakeholders. Our Climate Transition Action Plan and 2023 Progress Report includes further information on Woodside's approach to managing climate change risks.\n\nFor more information on this topic, refer to woodside.com and the Climate Transition Action Plan and 2023 Progress Report.\n\n- \u00b7  Availability and cost of emission allowances or carbon credits could impact Woodside's ability to meet its 2025 and 2030 net equity Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets.\n- \u00b7  Failure of other organisations to meet emissions targets across the broader oil and gas industry.\n- \u00b7  Reputational risks with respect to Woodside or the oil and gas industry in general.\n- \u00b7  Financial risks, including limits on availability of funding, changes in financing terms for oil and gas projects or ability to access capital markets.\n\nThese impacts may lead to a loss in shareholder value, loss of market share to competitors, delays or stoppages in our operations, reduced capacity to fund capital projects, delayed or suspended regulatory approvals, legal liabilities and adverse impacts on Woodside's reputation, social licence to operate and on the delivery of our strategy.",

Our employees, host communities, Traditional Owners and Custodians, government authorities, investors and other groups form significant relationships with our organisation. These relationships are built on the trust that Woodside will meet our stakeholders' expectations. We must also consider the role our commercial agreements play in relation to human rights around the world, as we have a responsibility to ensure the rights of all humans are not negatively a/ffected by our organisation.\n\nSome of the most significant risks to our relationships with stakeholders include:\n\n- \u00b7  Engaging in activities that have real or perceived adverse impacts on the environment, biodiversity, human rights or cultural heritage.\n- \u00b7  Failing to meet our net equity Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets or investment targets in new energy.\n- \u00b7  Inadequately responding to quickly evolving expectations of Woodside (including expectations that may significantly di/ffer in the various jurisdictions in which we operate).\n\nAdditionally, third-party risks that are outside of our control could negatively impact our reputation and licence to operate, such as oil spills or other disasters or scandals that cause collateral damage to Woodside's licence to operate via reputational damage to the oil and gas industry at large.\n\nFailure to maintain healthy relationships with our various stakeholders may result in violation of local or national laws or regulations, significant reputational damage, delayed approvals, civil suits and ultimately the deterioration of our licence to operate.\n\n## Examples of how this factor may impact Woodside\n\n- \u00b7  Limited, delayed or failed approvals from local and national government bodies.\n- \u00b7  Lost or limited stakeholder support for our current business and future opportunities.\n- \u00b7  Risks related to class action lawsuits, litigation and activism, including allegations of greenwashing.\n- \u00b7  Reductions in the availability, or less favourable terms, of financing.\n- \u00b7  Decreased ability to attract and retain a talented workforce, and other operational concerns.\n\n## How is Woodside managing these risks?\n\nWoodside proactively maintains and builds our social licence to operate through the application of our values, e/ffective stakeholder engagement strategies, our regulatory compliance framework and our anti-fraud and corruption program.\n\nOur regulatory compliance framework assists Woodside to proactively maintain relationships with governments and regulators within countries that support base business and future growth opportunities.\n\nWoodside maintains meaningful relationships with stakeholders, seeking proactive engagement to inform decisions and gain support for changes.\n\nThese impacts may lead to a loss in shareholder value, loss of market share to competitors, decreases in the value of assets, delays or stoppages in our operations or infringements on our ability to execute and complete transactions, reduced capacity to fund capital projects, delayed or suspended regulatory approvals, legal liabilities and adverse impacts on Woodside's reputation, social licence to operate and on the delivery of our strategy.\n\nOur fraud and corruption framework aims to prevent, detect and respond to unethical behaviour. It incorporates policies, standards, guidelines and training, which will enable us to conduct our activities ethically and to a high standard.\n\nOur business conduct is informed by the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), which set a global standard of conduct for all businesses wherever they operate.

To maintain a stable pipeline of future projects and realise the full value of growth opportunities, Woodside will need to compete with major oil companies, national oil companies (NOCs), independent oil and gas companies, individual producers and new energy companies. Failure to e/ffectively compete with these companies may result in the inability to continue to expand Woodside's current operations and meet our objectives.\n\nWoodside must continue to e/ffectively manage relationships with industry partners, for example, at times we enter joint ventures with organisations which may also be a competing oil and gas supplier. It is essential that our voice is heard both within our industry and more broadly. In order for us to e/ffectively communicate, we may at times align with industry bodies to advocate what we believe is right. In addition, our current and planned projects involve uncertainties and operating risks that could prevent us from realising profits or result in the total or partial loss of our investment.\n\n## New energy\n\nWe have set targets for our new energy products and lower carbon services. 1,2 However, there is uncertainty around the pace of required technological innovation and the reliability of technologies that will be needed to transition to a lower carbon environment. In addition, new sources of energy, such as hydrogen or ammonia, may be more difficult to commercialise than expected or may not be able to be commercialised safely or as efficiently as expected at scale. Woodside may also face unforeseen obstacles in the commercialisation of a future carbon capture business and in the implementation of other lower carbon services and emission reduction e/fforts.\n\n## Examples of how this factor may impact Woodside\n\n- \u00b7  An unbalanced portfolio of oil and gas and new energy, which may not meet the market's needs.\n- \u00b7  Limited or reduced market share resulting in a loss of shareholder value.\n- \u00b7  Our competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects, including operatorships and licences, than our financial or human resources permit.\n- \u00b7  Our projects could experience project implementation schedule slippage, permitting delays, shortages of or delays in the delivery of equipment or purpose-built components from suppliers, escalation in capital cost estimates, possible shortages of construction or other personnel, other labour shortages, environmental occurrences during construction that result in a failure to comply with environmental regulations or conditions on development, or delays and higher-thanexpected costs due to the remote location of the projects, the impact of global conflicts on the relevant workforce or supply chain, other unanticipated natural disasters, accidents, miscalculations, political or other opposition, litigation, acts of terrorism, operational difficulties, climate change related risks or other events associated with that construction that may result in the delay, suspension or termination of our projects.\n\n## How is Woodside managing these risks?\n\nOur opportunity management framework is flexible and adaptable with the primary objective to realise the value of an opportunity while mitigating the risk of a suboptimal outcome for our organisation, our shareholders and our communities.\n\n- \u00b7  An inability to obtain financing at acceptable costs, or at all, for the development of new energy projects.\n- \u00b7  Failure to implement our new energy plans within our anticipated time frame and in line with global demands.\n- \u00b7  Failure to identify, execute and/or implement strategic transactions, including acquisitions and divestments, or to achieve the full benefits of those transactions.\n- \u00b7  Failure to remain commercially and technologically competitive to e/fficiently develop and operate an attractive portfolio of assets, to obtain access to new opportunities and to keep pace with deployment of new technologies and products.\n- \u00b7  Higher than expected competition in the markets for new energy products and lower carbon services in which Woodside expects to participate.\n\nThese impacts may lead to a loss in shareholder value, loss of market share to competitors, decreases in the value of assets, delays or stoppages in our operations, reduced capacity to fund capital projects, delayed or suspended regulatory approvals, legal liabilities and adverse impacts on Woodside's reputation, social licence to operate and on the delivery of our strategy.\n\nWe aim to identify and progress a suite of commercially attractive and sustainable opportunities that complement our existing assets, enable portfolio diversity and optimise our commercial position.",

        "page_content": "## Operations\n\nDue to the nature of our operations, Woodside and our communities are potentially exposed to a broad range of risks; some are beyond Woodside's control. This is a result of factors such as the geographical range, operational diversity and technical complexity of our assets.\n\n## Health and safety:\n\nOur operations are subject to risks related to safety or major hazard events in connection with our activities or facilities, and may also include unanticipated or unforeseeable adverse events which impact our ability to respond, manage and recover from such events.\n\n## Commercial:\n\nWe manage commercial risks within our operations, including third-party relationships such as joint venture partners, contract counterparties and our supply chain.\n\n## Regulation:\n\nWoodside is subject to extensive governmental oversight and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and such regulations may change in ways that adversely a/ffect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we are required to comply with securities regulations in Australia, the US and the UK.\n\n## Reserves and resources estimates:\n\nWe manage the estimation of proved oil and gas reserves by using judgement and the application of complex rules, and subsequent downward adjustments of Woodside's reported reserves estimates are possible.\n\n## How is this factor relevant to Woodside?\n\n## General operational risks:\n\nOur operating assets are subject to a range of operating risks associated with process safety incidents, breaches of cybersecurity, extreme weather events and supply chain disruptions. Disruptions to our supply chain, or failure of our contractual counterparties to fulfill their obligations, could adversely impact our production, operations and our financial performance, result in litigation or class actions and cause long-term damage to our reputation.\n\n## Health and safety:\n\nAt Woodside, one of our competitive advantages is our ability to operate safely. Failure to continue to do so could result in sustained production interruptions leading to an inability to meet production forecasts, as well as potential reputational damage with customers, employees, commercial partners and other stakeholders.\n\n## Commercial:\n\nThe majority of our major projects and operations are conducted in joint ventures, which may limit our control over, and our ability to e/ffectively manage risks associated with, such projects. Joint venture participants may have economic or business interests or objectives that are inconsistent with or opposed to our interests and objectives. For projects in which we are not the operator, we may be unable to control the behaviour, performance and cost of operations of joint ventures in which we participate. In these cases, we will be dependent on joint venture participants acting as operators and their ability to direct operations or manage the timing and performance of any activity or the costs or risks involved may be reduced.\n\n## Regulation:\n\nWe are subject, in each of the countries in which we operate, to various national and local laws, regulations and approvals relating to the exploration, development, production, marketing, pricing, transportation and storage of our products, as well as the management, decommissioning, clean up and restoration of our properties, and management and disclosure of our operations and impacts. The exploration, production, and transportation of oil and gas involves risk that releases to the environment may occur, which could cause substantial harm to the environment, natural resources, or human health and safety.\n\nThese laws and regulations could change, and any such changes could have a material adverse e/ffect on our business and financial condition. Because such laws and regulations are subject to amendment and reinterpretation over time, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws. Moreover, we cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate the oil and gas industries might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted and what e/ffect, if any, the proposals might have on our operations. The adoption and implementation of new or more stringent legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that result in the imposition of more stringent standards for greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and gas industry could restrict the areas in which this sector may operate, and could result in increased compliance costs and changes in product pricing, which could impact consumer demand for our products.\n\nAdditionally, the conduct of Woodside, our employees and our third-party partners could result in actual or alleged breaches of laws, regulations and approvals, including fraud, corruption, anti-competitive behaviour, money laundering, breaching trade or financial sanctions, market manipulation, privacy breaches, ethical misconduct and wider organisational cultural failings. We have incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures, some of which may be material, to comply with applicable laws, regulations and approvals.\n\n## Reserves and resources estimates:\n\nEstimating proved oil and gas reserves involves subjective judgements and determinations based on available geological, technical, contractual and economic information. New information from production or drilling activities, changes in economic factors, such as oil and gas prices, alterations in the regulatory policies of host governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or other events may cause estimates to change over time. Additionally, estimates may change to reflect acquisitions, divestments, new discoveries, extensions of existing fields and improved recovery techniques.",

        "page_content": "## Examples of how this factor may impact Woodside\n\n- \u00b7  A loss of containment event or other operational incident on or related to our property or operations could occur, which could have significant impacts including to human health and safety, the environment, natural resources or cultural resources, as well as financial, legal and reputational impacts.\n- \u00b7  Certain activities are undertaken in deep waters where operations, support services and decommissioning activities are more di/fficult and costly than in shallower waters. The deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as international deepwater locations, lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. As a result, deepwater operations may have additional risks, such as a blowout, and require significant time between a discovery and the time that Woodside can market its production.\n- \u00b7  Natural disasters, earthquakes, social unrest, pandemic diseases (such as COVID-19) and criminal actions by external parties could result in injuries, loss of life, disruption of our operations or the loss or suspension of permits or other approvals.\n- \u00b7  Our joint venture partners may have the ability to exercise veto rights to block certain key decisions or actions that we believe are in our or the joint venture's best interests or approve those matters without our support.\n- \u00b7  Our partners and contractual counterparties may not be able to meet their financial or other obligations to the projects. In addition, the actions of our partners, contractors and subcontractors could result in legal liability and financial loss for Woodside.\n- \u00b7  Applicable laws and regulations may obligate Woodside to identify, avoid, mitigate and disclose environmental risks in various operational practices, which in turn could materially adversely a/ffect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may also be required to maintain financial assurance through bonds or insurance.\n- \u00b7  A failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and approvals may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of current or proposed projects, and issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in a particular area.\n\n## How is Woodside managing these risks?\n\n- \u00b7  Safe operation is fundamentally embedded through an extensive framework of controls that deliver strong operational performance in our base business.\n- \u00b7  The framework includes production processes, drilling and completions and well integrity management processes, inspection and maintenance procedures and performance standards. The framework is supported and inspected on an ongoing basis by our regulators.\n- \u00b7  An operational incident could result in multiple fatalities.\n- \u00b7  Supply chain disruptions such as long wait times for critical spares may cause extended outages at our operations.\n- \u00b7  Joint participants or contractual counterparties may be primarily responsible for the adequacy of the human or technical competencies and capabilities which they bring to bear on the joint project, which may not be adequate.\n- \u00b7  The suspension, revocation, failure to renew or alteration of, or challenges to, the terms of the licences, permits, government contracts or approvals required for our operations.\n- \u00b7  Sanctions for non-compliance with laws and regulations may include administrative, civil and criminal penalties, demand for reimbursement for government or regulatory actions, government orders, suspension or revocation of licences, permits, government contracts or approvals, and corrective action orders.\n- \u00b7  Government policy objectives in the countries in which we do business, now or in the future, could take the form of increased governmental regulations (including in respect of restoration, protection of the environment, greenhouse gas emissions, natural resources, and worker health and safety), redirection of product distribution (such as domestic gas reservation policies), changes in taxation regulation or enforcement (including, for example, changes in tax rates or increased focus on audits), taxation subsidies or royalties, nationalisation of resource assets or restrictions or moratoriums on our operations on government leases, limitations on periods of lease retention, interference with the confidentiality and availability of information, forced renegotiation of contracts, changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies, trade sanctions, currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other governmental steps.\n- \u00b7  Actual or alleged violations of the securities laws that we are subject to could result in private or governmental litigation, civil penalties, regulatory action and shareholder class actions.\n- \u00b7  Downward adjustments of our reported reserves estimates could indicate lower future production volumes or the impairment of assets.\n\nThese impacts may lead to a loss in shareholder value, loss of market share to competitors, decreases in the value of assets, delays or stoppages in our operations, reduced capacity to fund capital projects, delayed or suspended regulatory approvals, legal liabilities and adverse impacts on Woodside's reputation, social licence to operate and on the delivery of our strategy.\n\nWoodside had a fatality in 2023. The tragic loss of our colleague, a contractor employee, has led to the implementation of additional controls based on preliminary investigation insights into the incident. The external investigations into the incident are ongoing.\n\n- \u00b7  Decommissioning is integrated into project planning. We work with our partners and technical experts to identify sustainable and beneficial post-closure options that minimise financial, social and environmental impacts.\n- \u00b7  The framework is adaptable to enable us to maintain and improve our operating model and performance, target reliability, cost discipline, emissions reductions and strong safety and environmental performance for both our existing business and future growth opportunities.",

        "page_content": "## Finance and market\n\nRisks associated with the ability to capture value whether markets are stable or volatile, and manage the risks associated with interest rate, commodity price and foreign exchange fluctuations and inflation. Generally, Woodside does not have control over the factors that a/ffect market development and prices.\n\n## How is this factor relevant to Woodside?\n\nWoodside must be financially well positioned in order to pursue our strategic objectives and remain resilient during times of economic challenge. Several factors can a/ffect our position, including:\n\n## Market and commodity price:\n\nWoodside's revenues are primarily derived from the sale of hydrocarbons. The prices Woodside receives for these products are variable and are impacted by global economic factors beyond Woodside's control. We seek to forecast changes in the economic factors to enable us to maintain a strong market position during challenging economic times. Refer to section 6.3 - Additional disclosures and section A in the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information.\n\n## Capital management:\n\nFor Woodside to continue to operate sustainably we must make risk informed decisions related to allocation of capital. We seek to apply a disciplined and balanced approach to capital management through the commodity price cycle. Refer to section 2.2 - Capital management for further information.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk:\n\nWoodside is exposed to foreign currency risk from future commitments, financial assets and financial liabilities that are not denominated in US dollars. Refer to section A in the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information.\n\n## Interest rate risk:\n\nThis is the risk that Woodside's financial position will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. Woodside's risk relates primarily to financial instruments with floating interest rates including long-term debt obligations, cash and short-term deposits. Refer to section C in the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information.\n\n## Examples of how this factor may impact Woodside\n\n- \u00b7  A reduced ability to fund our strategy including our projects.\n- \u00b7  Significant volatility in energy prices, such as the volatility experienced in recent years, may increase the challenges associated with long-term plans.\n- \u00b7  An imbalance in supply and demand can impact commodity prices and our ability to forecast market conditions determines whether we are impacted positively or negatively.\n- \u00b7  Woodside may become a less attractive joint venture partner.\n- \u00b7  Reduced shareholder returns due to lower commodity prices.\n- \u00b7  If we inaccurately forecast the global demand for our LNG products we may face difficulties obtaining longer term sales contracts with desirable commercial terms.\n- \u00b7  If counterparties to our derivative instruments are unable to fulfill their obligations, a larger percentage of our future oil and gas production could be subject to price changes.\n\n## How is Woodside managing these risks?\n\n- \u00b7  The delivery of our strategic portfolio objectives requires significant capital expenditure, supported by strong underlying cash flows. Uncertainty associated with product demand is mitigated by selling LNG in a portfolio manner and under long-term take or pay sale agreements, in addition to the spot market. Our low cost of production and prudent approach to balance sheet risk management further mitigates this exposure. Refer to section 6.3 - Additional disclosures and section A in the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information.\n- \u00b7  A flexible approach to capital management enables this overall level of investment in the di/fferent areas of our business and the mix to be adjusted to reflect the external environment. Our capital management strategy focuses on capital allocation, capital discipline and efficiency, and active balance sheet management including commodity and foreign exchange hedging.\n- \u00b7  Woodside hedges to protect the balance sheet against downside commodity price risk, particularly during periods of high capital expenditure.\n\n- \u00b7  Inability to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings on expected timeline or at all.\n- \u00b7  Unforeseen costs relating to the integration of development, extraction and production operational systems, IT systems and financial and accounting systems of both businesses.\n- \u00b7  Impairments of assets, goodwill or other intangible assets could have a significant negative e/ffect on our reported net income and our ability to pay dividends in one or more accounting periods if the level of impairment were to exceed profits available for distribution.\n\nThese impacts may lead to a loss in shareholder value, loss of market share to competitors, decreases in the value of assets, delays or stoppages in our operations, reduced capacity to fund capital projects, delayed or suspended regulatory approvals, legal liabilities and adverse impacts on Woodside's reputation, social licence to operate and on the delivery of our strategy.\n\n- \u00b7  The US dollar reflects the majority of Woodside's underlying cash flows and is used in our financial reporting, reducing our exposure to currency fluctuations. Refer to section A in the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information. Refer to section C in the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information on interest rate risk management.\n- \u00b7  We maintain insurance in line with industry practice and sufficient to cover normal operational risks. However, Woodside is not insured against all potential risks because not all risks can be insured and because of constraints on the availability of commercial insurance in global markets. Insurance coverage is determined by the availability of commercial options and cost/benefit analysis, taking into account Woodside's risk management program. Losses that are not insured could impact Woodside's financial performance. For example, Woodside does not purchase insurance for the loss of revenue arising from an operational interruption. Our extensive framework of financial controls, including monitoring of counterparties, enables the management of these risks.",

We must build and maintain a capable workforce if we are to achieve our objectives. An e/ffective operating model with a balanced organisation structure will allow us to conduct our operations and pursue new energy opportunities. For Woodside to remain an employer of choice, our culture must support our current employees and attract the best new candidates.\n\n## Examples of how this factor may impact Woodside\n\n- \u00b7  During periods of high demand for skilled resources, Woodside may be unable to fill critical roles at acceptable costs or at all, leading to operational impacts.\n- \u00b7  A limited ability to operate due to our people leaving critical roles.\n- \u00b7  An inability to pursue innovation opportunities due to a skills shortage.\n- \u00b7  Loss of key personnel or expert knowledge.\n- \u00b7  An inability to reach timely agreements with employees including where represented by third parties may result in industrial action.\n\n## How is Woodside managing these risks?\n\nWoodside has a set of resourcing frameworks to attract, retain and develop our workforce to support both base business and growth opportunities.

Key drivers for these revisions include:\n\n- \u00b7  asset optimisation, including injector to producer conversions, and field performance at Angostura and Ruby in Trinidad and Tobago contributed to proved and proved plus probable reserves increases of 13.0 MMboe and 19.3 MMboe, respectively\n- \u00b7  improved overall field performance and technical updates in North West Shelf increased proved reserves by 49.7 MMboe. North West Shelf proved plus probable reserves decreased by 8.9 MMboe, due to the transfer of several late life undeveloped projects to 2C contingent resources, partially o/ffset by improved overall field performance\n- \u00b7  performance based revisions at Shenzi resulted in decreases in both proved and proved plus probable reserves of 13.4 MMboe and 30.2 MMboe, respectively\n- \u00b7  improved overall field performance and technical updates at Pluto and Macedon contributed to proved plus probable reserves increases of 28.4 MMboe and 14.7 MMboe, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, in 2023, Woodside completed a transaction whereby Calgary-based Paramount Resources took a 50% equity interest in, and operatorship of, 28 leases of the Liard field in Canada. The transaction resulted in Woodside's 2C contingent resources decreasing by 2,241.2 MMboe. Voluntary relinquishment of Magellan in Trinidad and Tobago, and Wildling in the US Gulf of Mexico resulted in a 77.2 MMboe decrease in 2C contingent resources.\n\nThe reclassification of undeveloped reserves to developed reserves is discussed in the Undeveloped Reserves section of this Reserves and Resources Statement.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, the following apply to this Reserves and Resources Statement 2 : The e/ffective date for reserves and resources estimates is 31 December 2023. Proved reserves are calculated using SEC-compliant economic assumptions and pricing. Production is reported for the period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023. Reserves, resources and production stated are Woodside's net share and inclusive of fuel consumed in operations. All numbers are internal estimates produced by Woodside.

Proved reserves are estimated and reported on a net interest basis, excluding royalties owned by others, in accordance with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations and have been determined in accordance with SEC Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X. As defined by the SEC, proved reserves are those quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, operating contracts, and government regulations. Unless evidence indicates that renewal of existing operating contracts is reasonably certain, estimates of economically producible reserves reflect only the period before the contracts expire. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence within a reasonable time.\n\nProved reserves are estimated by reference to available well and reservoir information, including but not limited to well logs, well test data, core data, production and pressure data, geologic data, seismic data and, in some cases, similar data from analogous, producing reservoirs. A wide range of engineering and geoscience methods, including performance analysis, numerical simulation, well analogues and geologic studies, have been used to develop high confidence in estimated quantities.\n\nProved plus probable reserves and 2C contingent resources are estimated in accordance with the 2018 Society of Petroleum Engineers/World Petroleum Council/American Association of Petroleum Geologists/Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers Petroleum Resources Management System (SPE-PRMS) guidelines. SPE-PRMS guidelines allow (amongst other things) escalations to prices and costs and, as such, volume estimates in accordance with those guidelines would be on a di/fferent basis than volumes estimated as prescribed by the SEC. Proved plus probable reserves and 2C contingent resources estimates are inherently more uncertain than proved reserves estimates.\n\n## GOVERNANCE AND ASSURANCE\n\nWoodside has several processes designed to provide assurance for reserves and contingent resources reporting, including its Reserves and Resources Policy, Petroleum Resources Management Procedure, Reserves and Resources Guideline, annual sta/ff training and minimum experience levels. The Woodside Reserves and Resources Policy requires external audits of all projects or fields with material reserves at least once every four years. In addition, Woodside has a dedicated and independent Corporate Reserves Team (CRT) that provides oversight and assurance of the reserves and resources assessments and reporting processes. Reserves and resources are estimated by sta/ff in teams directly responsible for development and production activities. These individuals are trained in the fundamentals of reserves reporting and are approved by the CRT on an annual basis. Reserves assessments are reviewed annually by the CRT to ensure technical quality, adherence to internally published guidelines and compliance with SEC and SPE-PRMS reporting requirements (as applicable). All reserves and resources are reviewed and approved by Woodside's Qualified Petroleum Reserves and Resources Evaluator and approved by senior management and the Board prior to public reporting.\n\n## QUALIFIED PETROLEUM RESERVES AND RESOURCES EVALUATOR STATEMENT\n\nThe estimates of petroleum reserves and contingent resources are based on and fairly represent information and supporting documentation prepared by, or under the supervision of Mr Ben Stephens, Woodside's Vice President Reserves and Subsurface, who is a full-time employee of the company and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The Reserves and Resources Statement as a whole has been approved by Mr Stephens.

Technical studies and performance resulted in a 3.4 MMboe decrease to proved undeveloped reserves. The e/ffect of commodity prices relative to 2022 resulted in a 15.8 MMboe reduction to proved undeveloped reserves at Sangomar.\n\nUndeveloped reserves in Julimar Brunello have remained undeveloped for longer than five years from the dates they were initially reported and are expected to be developed in a phased manner to meet long-term contractual commitments. The project is included in the company business plan, demonstrating the intent to proceed with the development.\n\nThe changes in proved undeveloped reserves in 2023 are summarised by category in Table 7.\n\nTable 7: Proved undeveloped reserves reconciliation (net Woodside share, as at 31 December 2023)\n\n|                                           | Total  MMboe   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Reserves as at 31 December 2022           | 1,615.2        |\n| Extensions and discoveries                | 204.1          |\n| Revision of previous estimates            | -106.9         |\n| Reclassifications to developed            | - 87.7         |\n| Performance, technical studies, and other | -3.4           |\n| Development plan changes                  | 0.0            |\n| Price                                     | -15.8          |\n| Acquisitions and divestments              | 0.0            |\n| Reserves as at 31 December 2023           | 1,712.5        |\n\nSmall di/fferences are due to rounding\n\nAt 31 December 2023, Woodside's remaining proved plus probable undeveloped reserves were 2,682.3 MMboe, representing an increase of 157.7 MMboe from the 2,524.5 MMboe as at 31 December 2022.\n\nExtensions and discoveries associated with Trion and Mad Dog Southwest increased proved plus probable undeveloped reserves by 300.0 MMboe.\n\nIn 2023, 130.1 MMboe of proved plus probable undeveloped reserves were converted to proved plus probable developed reserves with start-up of development wells in Mad Dog Phase 2 (71.7 MMboe), Shenzi North (28.6 MMboe), Atlantis (15.8 MMboe), and Pyrenees (1.3 MMboe), and completion of o/ffshore Pluto water handling (12.7 MMboe). Additionally, 22.0 MMboe of late life North West Shelf undeveloped projects were transferred to 2C contingent resources.\n\nDuring 2023, Woodside spent US$5.3 billion on development activities worldwide. Of this amount, US$4.7 billion was spent progressing the conversion of proved undeveloped reserves for projects where development status was achieved in 2023 or is expected to be achieved when development is completed in the future.",

        "page_content": "## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR US INVESTORS\n\nThe SEC prohibits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, from disclosing estimates of oil or gas resources other than 'reserves' (as that term is defined by the SEC). In this report, Woodside includes estimates of quantities of oil and gas using certain terms, such as 'proved plus probable (2P) reserves,' 'best estimate (2C) contingent resources,' 'reserves and contingent resources,' 'proved plus probable,' 'developed and undeveloped,' 'probable developed,' 'probable undeveloped,' 'contingent resources' or other descriptions of volumes of reserves, which terms include quantities of oil and gas that may not meet the SEC's definitions of proved, probable and possible reserves, and which the SEC's guidelines strictly prohibit Woodside from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and would require substantial capital spending over a significant number of years to implement recovery, and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of being recovered by Woodside. In addition, actual locations drilled and quantities that may be ultimately recovered from Woodside's properties may di/ffer substantially. Woodside has made no commitment to drill, and likely will not drill, all drilling locations that have been attributable to these quantities. US investors are urged to consider closely the disclosures in Woodside's filings with the SEC, which are available at www.sec.gov.\n\n## NOTES TO THE RESERVES AND RESOURCES STATEMENT\n\n- 1 'Production' is the volume of natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs), condensate and oil produced during the period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 and converted to 'MMboe' for the specific purpose of reserves reconciliation. The production volume figures in this Reserves and Resources Statement di/ffer from the production volume figures reported elsewhere in this report and in Woodside's quarterly reports, because the production volume figures reported in this Reserves and Resources Statement include all fuel consumed in operations but exclude 1.1 MMboe in excess of reserves working interest percentage from Pluto non-operating participants processed via the Pluto-KGP Interconnector. Small di/fferences are due to rounding.\n- 2 Woodside is an Australian company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, and the London Stock Exchange. Woodside reports its proved reserves in accordance with SEC regulations, which are also compliant with SPE-PRMS guidelines, and prepares and reports its proved plus probable reserves and 2C contingent resources in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines. Woodside reports all petroleum resource estimates using definitions consistent with SPE-PRMS.\n- 3 For o/ffshore oil projects, the reference point is defined as the outlet of the floating production storage and o/ffloading facility (FPSO) or platform, while for the onshore gas projects the reference point is defined as the outlet of the downstream (onshore) gas processing facility.\n- 4 'Reserves' are estimated quantities of petroleum that have been demonstrated to be producible from known accumulations in which the company has a material interest from a given date forward, at commercial rates, under presently anticipated production methods, operating conditions, prices, and costs. Woodside reports reserves inclusive of all fuel consumed in operations. Proved reserves are estimated and reported in accordance with SEC regulations which are also compliant with SPE-PRMS guidelines. SEC-compliant proved reserves estimates use a more restrictive, rules-based approach and are generally lower than estimates prepared solely in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines due to, among other things, the requirement to use commodity prices based on the average of first of month prices during the 12-month period in the reporting company's fiscal year. Proved plus probable reserves are estimated and reported in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines and are not compliant with SEC regulations.\n- 5 Assessment of the economic value in support of an SPE-PRMS (2018) reserves and resources classification, uses Woodside Portfolio Economic Assumptions (Woodside PEAs). The Woodside PEAs are reviewed on an annual basis, or more often if required. The review is based on historical data and forecast estimates for economic variables such as product prices and exchange rates. The Woodside PEAs are approved by the Woodside Board. Specific contractual arrangements for individual projects are also taken into account.\n- 6 Woodside uses both deterministic and probabilistic methods for the estimation of reserves and contingent resources at the field and project levels. All proved reserves estimates have been estimated using deterministic methods and reported on a net interest basis in accordance with the SEC regulations and have been determined in accordance with SEC Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X. Unless otherwise stated, all petroleum estimates reported at the company or region level are aggregated by arithmetic summation by category. The aggregated proved reserves may be a conservative estimate due to the portfolio e/ffects of arithmetic summation.\n\n- 7 'Contingent resources' are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations, but the applied project(s) are not yet considered mature enough for commercial development due to one or more contingencies. Contingent resources are estimated and reported in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines and may include, for example, projects for which there are currently no viable markets, or where commercial recovery is dependent on technology under development, or where evaluation of the accumulation is insu/fficient to clearly assess commerciality. Woodside reports contingent resources inclusive of all fuel consumed in operations. Contingent resources are di/fferent from, and should not be construed as, reserves. Contingent resources estimates may not always mature to reserves and do not necessarily represent future reserves bookings. Contingent resources volumes are reported at the 'Best Estimate' (P50) confidence level. 2C contingent resources are not compliant with SEC regulations. The SEC prohibits disclosure of oil and gas resources, including contingent resources, in SEC filings. However, Australian securities regulatory authorities allow disclosure of oil and gas resources, including contingent resources.\n- 8 'Natural gas' is defined as the gas product associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pipeline gas. Liquid volumes of crude oil, condensate and NGLs are reported separately.\n- 9 'Natural gas liquids' or 'NGLs' is defined as the product associated with liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and consists of propane, butane, and ethane - individually or as a mixture.\n- 10 'Total' includes fuel consumed in operations.\n- 11 'Bcf' means Billions (10 9 ) of cubic feet of gas at standard oilfield conditions of 14.696 psi (101.325 kPa) and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.56 degrees Celsius).\n- 12 'MMbbl' means millions (10 6 ) of barrels of NGLs, oil and condensate at standard oilfield conditions of 14.696 psi (101.325 kPa) and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.56 degrees Celsius).\n- 13 'MMboe' means millions (10 6 ) of barrels of oil equivalent. Natural Gas volumes are converted to oil equivalent volumes via a constant conversion factor, which for Woodside is 5.7 Bcf of dry gas per 1 MMboe. Volumes of NGLs, oil and condensate are converted from MMbbl to MMboe on a 1:1 ratio.\n- 14 'Proved reserves' are those quantities of crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, operating contracts, and government regulations. Proved reserves are estimated and reported on a net interest basis in accordance with the SEC regulations and have been determined in accordance with SEC Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X.\n- 15 'Developed reserves' are those reserves that are producible through currently existing completions and installed facilities for treatment, compression, transportation and delivery, using existing operating methods and standards.\n- 16 'Undeveloped reserves' are those reserves for which wells and facilities have not been installed or executed but are expected to be recovered through future significant investments.\n- 17 'Probable reserves' are those reserves which analysis of geological and engineering data suggests are more likely than not to be recoverable. Proved plus probable reserves represent the best estimate of recoverable quantities. Where probabilistic methods are used, there is at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves. Proved plus probable reserves are estimated and reported in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines and are not compliant with SEC regulations.\n- 18 'Liard' comprises unconventional contingent resources in the Liard Basin. As at 31 December 2023, Liard represents approximately 42% of Woodside's 2C contingent resources.\n- 19 'Acquisitions and divestments' are revisions that represent changes (either upward or downward) in previous estimates of reserves or contingent resources, which result from either purchase or sale of interests and/or execution of contracts conveying entitlement.\n- 20 'Revision of previous estimates' are changes (either upward or downward) in previous estimates of reserves or contingent resources, resulting from new information normally obtained from development drilling and production history, or resulting from a change in economic factors.\n- 21 'Transfer to/from reserves' are revisions that represent changes (either upward or downward) in previous estimates of reserves or contingent resources, which are a result of re-classification of petroleum resources estimates (i.e. from reserves to contingent resources or vice versa) associated with one or more project(s).\n- 22 'Extensions and discoveries' represent additions to reserves or contingent resources that result from increased areal extensions of previously discovered fields demonstrated to exist subsequent to the original discovery and/or discovery of reserves or contingent resources in new fields or new reservoirs in old fields.\n- 23 Proved reserves at 31 December 2023 are estimated and reported in accordance with SEC regulations. Proved plus probable reserves and contingent resources at 31 December 2023 are estimated and reported in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines.\n- 24 'Greater Pluto' consists of the Pluto, Xena, Pyxis, Larsen, Martell, Martin, Noblige, and Remy fields.\n- 25 'North West Shelf' consists of all oil and gas fields within the North West Shelf Project Area.\n- 26 'Exmouth' consists of the Pyrenees, Macedon, Julimar-Brunello, and Ngujima-Yin fields.\n- 27 'Scarborough' consists of Scarborough, Thebe, and Jupiter fields. Scarborough proved undeveloped reserves as at 31 December 2023 are 7,336.0 Bcf (1,287.0 MMboe). Development activities are underway. In this Reserves and Resources Statement, Scarborough estimates are based on one hundred per cent interest in the Scarborough Joint Venture until completion of the transaction with LNG Japan referenced in the announcement on 8 August 2023 entitled 'Woodside to Sell 10% Scarborough Interest to LNG Japan'.\n- 28 'Gulf of Mexico' consists of the Shenzi, Shenzi North, Atlantis, and Mad Dog fields. 29 'International' consists of the Angostura, Ruby, Trinidad and Tobago Deep Water, Trion, and Sangomar fields which are under Production/Revenue Sharing-type agreements. These fields represent approximately 13% of proved reserves, proved plus probable reserves, and 2C contingent resources. Woodside net economic interest volumes are reported.\n- 30 'Browse' consists of the Brecknock, Calliance, and Torosa fields.\n- 31 'Sunrise' consists of the Sunrise and Troubadour fields.",

The Board is responsible for the overall corporate governance of Woodside.\n\nWoodside's corporate governance model is illustrated in the diagram below. The Woodside Management System (WMS) describes the Woodside way of working, enabling Woodside to understand and manage its business to achieve its objectives. It defines the boundaries within which Woodside employees and contractors are expected to work. The WMS establishes a common approach to how we operate, wherever the location.\n\nWoodside continues to review and, where necessary, enhance our corporate governance policies and practices. We frequently consider developments arising in the markets where Woodside securities are listed, including the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), London Stock Exchange (LSE) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Our practices will evolve as we continually look to strengthen our governance framework in the context of our multi-jurisdictional business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe company must comply with the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), the ASX Listing Rules, UK Listing Rules, UK Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, UK Market Abuse Regulation, relevant provisions of the NYSE Listed Company Manual and US securities laws applicable to Woodside as a foreign private issuer and other applicable Australian and international laws. This Corporate Governance Statement (Statement) reports on Woodside's key governance principles and practices.\n\nThe ASX Listing Rules require the company to report on the extent to which it has followed the Corporate Governance Recommendations contained in the fourth edition of the ASX Corporate Governance Council's Principles and Recommendations (ASXCGC Recommendations).

        "page_content": "## Board performance evaluation\n\nBoard performance evaluations are conducted annually.\n\nThe Board performance evaluation process is conducted by way of questionnaires appropriate in scope and content to e/ffectively review:\n\n- \u00b7  the performance of the Board and each of its committees against the requirements of their respective charters;\n- \u00b7  the individual performance of the Chair and each director; and\n- \u00b7  the interface between Board and management.\n\nThe Board performance evaluation process may also involve interviews with directors and senior management, and observation of Board and committee meetings by an external consultant. The reports on Board and committee performance are provided to all directors and discussed by the Board. The report on the Chair's performance is provided to the Chair and two committee chairs for discussion.\n\nA report on each individual director is also provided to the individual and to the Chair. The Chair meets individually with each director to discuss the findings of their report. The Board, through the Nominations & Governance Committee, considers and discusses the final report in detail.\n\nThe performance of each director retiring at the next AGM is taken into account by the Board in determining whether or not the Board should support the re-election of the director. The directors seeking re-election will be asked to reconfirm that they have su/fficient time to meet their responsibilities.\n\nThe Human Resources & Compensation Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the Board on the criteria for the evaluation of the performance of the CEO. The Board conducts the evaluation of the performance of the CEO and considers senior executive succession planning.\n\nIn 2023, performance evaluations for the Board, its committees, directors and Senior Executives took place in accordance with the process disclosed above, and in the section on 'Performance evaluation of Executive Leadership Team' on page 66 and in the Remuneration Report.\n\n## Directors' retirement and re-election\n\nThe Woodside Constitution sets out the requirements for the retirement and re-election of directors. With the exception of the CEO/Managing Director, directors must retire at the third AGM following their election or most recent re-election. At least one director must stand for election at each AGM.\n\nBoard support for a director's re-election is not automatic and is subject to satisfactory director performance and assessment of overall Board composition and capabilities.\n\n## Director independence\n\nIn accordance with the Policy on Independence of Directors, the Board assesses independence with reference to whether a director is non-executive, not a member of management and is free of any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with, or could reasonably be perceived to materially interfere with, the independent exercise of their judgement.\n\nIn making this assessment, the Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances. In particular, the Board focuses on the factors relevant to assessing the independence of a director set out in Box 2.3 of the ASXCGC Recommendations.\n\nThe Board has reviewed the independence of each of the non-executive directors in o/ffice at the date of this Statement and determined they are all independent. The CEO, Meg O'Neill, is not considered independent as she is an Executive Director and a member of management.\n\nFrank Cooper was re-elected at the 2022 AGM and has served 11 years on the Board in February 2024. The Board reviewed the independence of Mr Cooper and determined that he remained independent, notwithstanding his length of tenure on the Board.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nThe Board has approved a Directors' Conflict of Interest Policy which applies if there is, or may be, a conflict between the personal interests of a director, or the duties a director owes to another company, and the duties the director owes to Woodside. Directors are required to disclose circumstances that may a/ffect, or be perceived to a/ffect, their ability to exercise independent judgement so that the Board can assess independence on a regular basis.\n\nUnder Woodside's Constitution, directors must comply with the Corporations Act in relation to disclosure and voting on matters involving material personal interests. Subject to the Corporations Act:\n\n- \u00b7  a director may be counted in a quorum at a Board meeting that considers, and may vote on, any matter in which that director has an interest\n- \u00b7  the company may proceed with any transaction that relates to the interest and the director may participate in the execution of any relevant document by or on behalf of the company\n- \u00b7  the director may retain benefits under the transaction even though the director has an interest\n- \u00b7  the company cannot avoid the transaction merely because of the existence of the interest.\n\nUnder Woodside's Constitution, a director may be a director of or hold any other o/ffice or position in any corporation promoted by the company or in which the company may be interested. The Board may exercise the voting power conferred by the shares in any corporation held or owned by the company, and a director may vote in favour of exercising those voting rights despite the fact that the director is, or may be about to be appointed, a director of that other corporation and may be interested in the exercise of those voting rights. An interested director is to be counted in a quorum despite the interest.\n\nUnder Woodside's Constitution, the Board may exercise all the powers of the company to raise or borrow money, guarantee the debts or obligations of any person or enter into any other financing arrangements on the terms it thinks fit. If any director or o/fficer of the company is personally liable for the payment of any sum which is or may become primarily due from the company, the Board may charge the whole or any part of the assets of the company by way of indemnity to secure the director or o/fficer from any loss in respect of the liability.",

The Board uses this skills matrix to assess the skills and experience of each director and the combined capabilities of the Board, to identify potential areas of focus for director recruitment and to identify any professional development opportunities that may benefit directors.\n\n## Leadership and culture\n\n- \u00b7  Business leadership\n- \u00b7  Values and behaviours\n\n## Finance\n\n- \u00b7  Accounting and audit\n- \u00b7  Financial acumen\n\n## Business strategy\n\n- \u00b7  Corporate financing and treasury\n- \u00b7  Business strategy\n\n## Commercial\n\n- \u00b7  Gas/LNG marketing\n- \u00b7  Mergers and acquisitions\n- \u00b7  Business development\n- \u00b7  Public listed company experience\n- \u00b7  Insurance\n- \u00b7  Taxation\n- \u00b7  Capital projects\n- \u00b7  Legal and regulatory compliance\n- \u00b7  US regulatory compliance\n- \u00b7  Risk management\n\n## Sustainability and stakeholder management\n\n- \u00b7  Health and safety\n- \u00b7  Community relations\n- \u00b7  Corporate governance\n\n## Climate change\n\n- \u00b7  Policy and legal risks\n- \u00b7  Market\n\n## People and capability\n\n- \u00b7  People and culture\n- \u00b7  Industrial relations\n\n## Industry\n\n- \u00b7  Oil and gas experience\n- \u00b7  New energy and renewables\n- \u00b7  Technology and innovation\n\n## International\n\n- \u00b7  International oil and gas exploration, development and production\n- \u00b7  Environment\n- \u00b7  Public and regulatory policy\n- \u00b7  Technology\n- \u00b7  Reputation\n- \u00b7  Remuneration\n- \u00b7  Major projects\n- \u00b7  Digital\n- \u00b7  Cybersecurity\n- \u00b7  International experience\n\nThe skills matrix is reviewed annually and updated regularly to ensure it remains appropriate for Woodside's strategy, operations and risk profile and any other emerging issues.\n\nThe 2023 review confirmed that the Board collectively have the necessary skills and competencies. As discussed in the Board performance evaluation section, the review also informed and supported the Board's review of succession priorities.\n\nThe Board supplements its expertise with internal and external subject matter experts as appropriate (for example, regular attendance at Board meetings by relevant executives and other independent advisers). The Sustainability Committee received regular briefings and education on climate change from Woodside's Senior Executive responsible for climate change, to inform its oversight of related matters with input from climate change science and expert advice.\n\n## Chair\n\nThe Chair of the Board, Richard Goyder, is an independent, non-executive director and an Australian resident and citizen.\n\nThe Chair is responsible for leadership and e/ffective performance of the Board and for the maintenance of relations between directors and management that are open, cordial and conducive to productive cooperation. The Board has arrangements in place to ensure ongoing leadership if unforeseen circumstances mean Mr Goyder is not available. Mr Goyder's o/ffice is located in the company's headquarters in Perth, Western Australia. The Board is satisfied that Mr Goyder commits the time necessary to discharge his role e/ffectively. The Chair's responsibilities are set out in more detail in the Board Charter.\n\n## Company Secretaries\n\nDetails of the Company Secretaries are set out in section 4.2 - Directors' report - Company Secretaries. All directors have direct access to the Company Secretaries who are accountable directly to the Board, through the Chair, on all matters to do with the proper functioning of the Board. The Company Secretaries' responsibilities are set out in more detail in the Board Charter.\n\n## Board succession planning\n\nThe Board manages its succession planning with the assistance of the Nominations & Governance Committee which annually reviews the size, composition and diversity of the Board. In conducting the review, the Board skills matrix and the tenure of each director is considered.\n\nThe Nominations & Governance Committee is also responsible for evaluating Board candidates and recommending individuals for appointment to the Board. The Committee evaluates prospective candidates against a range of criteria including the skills, experience, expertise and diversity that will best complement Board e/ffectiveness at the time. The Board may engage an independent recruitment firm to undertake a search for suitable candidates.\n\nRefer to the 'Board composition' section for information about recent changes to the Board's composition.",

Our approach is intended to protect us against potential negative impacts and improve our resilience against emerging risks. These include conduct risk, technology and innovation, cybersecurity, privacy and data breaches, sustainability and climate change.\n\nWoodside's Risk Management Policy describes the manner in which Woodside:\n\n- \u00b7  provides a consolidated view of risks across the company to understand risk exposure and prioritise risk management and governance\n- \u00b7  confers responsibility on Woodside sta/ff at all levels to pro-actively identify, assess and treat risks relating to the objectives they are accountable for delivering.\n\n## Board, Audit & Risk Committee and management\n\nThe Board is responsible for reviewing and approving Woodside's risk management framework, policy and performance. The Board is also responsible for satisfying itself that management has developed and implemented a sound system of risk management and internal control.\n\nThe Board has delegated oversight of the Risk Management Policy, including review (at least annually) of the e/ffectiveness of Woodside's internal control system and risk management framework, to the Audit & Risk Committee. The Audit & Risk Committee also regularly reviews Woodside's Risk Appetite Statement and oversees Internal Audit's activities and reviews Internal Audit's performance.\n\nManagement is responsible for promoting and applying the Risk Management Policy.\n\nIn 2023, the Audit & Risk Committee reviewed and confirmed the company's risk management framework was sound, and that the company was operating with due regard to the risk appetite endorsed by the Board. In 2023, Woodside also identified opportunities to change the risk management framework and updated the risk matrix and risk appetite statement to represent today's organisation. Additionally, Woodside's approach to managing risk will follow a three lines model, this model clarifies roles and responsibilities of all areas of the business related to managing risk. These changes enable risk informed decision making and e/ffective management of current risks.\n\nAs part of its oversight of the Risk Management Policy, the Audit & Risk Committee oversees risks from cybersecurity threats. The Audit & Risk Committee aims to hold at least five regular meetings a year with cybersecurity risks and the Group's management of such risks reviewed as part of those meetings.\n\nThe identification and direct management of cybersecurity risks and threats are performed by Woodside's cybersecurity function, with subject matter expertise provided as part of our cyber resilience process.\n\nThe cybersecurity function is led by Woodside's Chief Information Security O/fficer (CISO) and a group of competent and experienced cybersecurity professionals. Our CISO has over a decade of industry experience and has held multiple technology and business facing roles.\n\nThe cyber resilience process as described previously includes the monitoring, prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity risks and incidents.\n\nThe Woodside Board and the Audit & Risk Committee are kept informed of any material cybersecurity risks and incidents through formal risk registers, briefing papers, internal audit reports and periodic reporting in person at Audit & Risk Committee meetings or as required through our Crisis and Emergency Management process if and when a major cyber security incident were to occur.\n\nWoodside's cybersecurity resilience and risk management strategy and process are based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. This process is documented within the WMS.\n\n## Internal Audit function\n\nInternal Audit provides assurance that the design and operation of the Group's risk management and internal control system is e/ffective. A risk-based audit approach is used to ensure that higher risk activities are prioritised in the audit program.\n\nInternal Audit is independent of both business management and of the activities it reviews and has all necessary access to management and information to fulfill its role. Internal Audit is sta/ffed by industry professionals including qualified accountants and engineers. The head of Internal Audit is jointly accountable to the Audit & Risk Committee and the Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial O/fficer (CFO).\n\n## Governance, Risk and Compliance function\n\nThe Governance, Risk and Compliance function is responsible for Woodside's risk management framework, development of risk management capability, and providing risk management oversight to senior levels of management and the Audit & Risk Committee on the strategic risk profile and the Group's risk management performance.\n\n## Material risks\n\nOur material risks (including environmental and social risks) and how they are managed are disclosed in section 3.9 - Risk factors.",

Internal audit and external audit are separate and independent of each other.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee evaluates the objectivity and independence of the external auditor and the quality and e/ffectiveness of the external audit arrangements, including through:\n\n- \u00b7  review of all non-audit services for actual and perceived independence threats\n- \u00b7  confirmation that non-audit service fee commitment does not exceed 70% of audit fees for the year\n- \u00b7  confirmation that Woodside fees does not exceed 10% of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Perth aggregate revenues for the prior period\n- \u00b7  annual review of auditor performance.\n\n## External Auditor independence\n\nThe guidance policy includes provisions directed at maintaining the independence of the external auditor and assessing whether the proposed provision of any non-audit services by the external auditor is appropriate. The External Auditor Guidance Policy classifies a range of non-audit services which could potentially be provided by the external auditor as acceptable within limits, requiring Audit & Risk Committee pre-approval or not acceptable. The Audit & Risk Committee reviews the auditor independence annually.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee did not waive the pre-approval requirement under paragraph (c)(7)(i) of Rule 2-01 of SEC Regulation S-X in 2023.\n\nWith e/ffect from 2022, PwC was appointed as auditor of the Group, replacing Ernst & Young (EY). Under SEC regulations, the remuneration of the auditors (PwC) of $9.6 million (2022: $5.4 million (PwC)) is required to be presented as follows: audit fees represent 84% (2022: 76%); audit-related fees 5% (2022: 18%); tax fees 11% (2022: 5%); and all other fees nil (2022: 1%).\n\nThe nature of the services comprising each category of fees is described below:\n\n- \u00b7  Audit - work that constitutes the agreed fees for the audit of Woodside's consolidated financial statements, report on Woodside's internal controls over financial reporting, and statutory audits of Woodside's controlled entities (including interim reviews).\n- \u203a Audit-related - includes assurance services and agreed upon procedures. This is work that is outside the scope of the statutory audits of Woodside and its controlled entities but is consistent with the role of the external statutory auditor. The work is reasonably related to the performance of an audit or review, is of a compliance or procedural nature, and is work that the external auditors must or are best placed to undertake and is permissible within the framework of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other relevant independence standards.\n\n- \u00b7  Tax services - tax related work, including tax compliance services, that is outside the scope of the statutory audits of Woodside and its controlled entities but is permissible within the framework of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other relevant independence standards.\n- \u00b7  Other services - other work that is permissible within the framework of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other relevant independence standards.\n\n## Verification of periodic corporate reports\n\nThe Board has adopted a Continuous Disclosure and Market Communications Policy (Disclosure Policy) that applies to all disclosures to the market, including periodic corporate reports that are not audited by an external auditor. Management has developed practices and guidance material that are intended to ensure that periodic corporate reports provide clear, concise and e/ffective disclosure, in accordance with the Disclosure Policy. Authority has been delegated to the Disclosure Committee to ensure the implementation of the reporting and communications processes and controls set out in the Disclosure Policy and associated guidance material.\n\nReports are prepared by, or under the supervision of, subject matter experts and material statements in the reports are reviewed for accuracy. Reports are also reviewed for compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. This process is intended to ensure that all applicable laws, regulations and company policies have been complied with, and that appropriate approvals are obtained before a report is released to the market.\n\n## CEO and CFO assurance\n\nBefore approving the Financial Statements for a financial period, the Board receives from the CEO and CFO a declaration stating that:\n\n- \u00b7  in their opinion Woodside's financial records have been properly maintained, comply with the appropriate accounting standards and give a true and fair view of Woodside's financial position and performance\n- \u00b7  the opinion has been formed on the basis of a sound system of risk management and internal control which is operating e/ffectively.",

In addition, the UK Listing Rules require companies to disclose their progress against three specified diversity targets, being:\n\n- \u00b7  At least 40% of the directors are women\n- \u00b7  At least one director is from an ethnic minority background\n- \u00b7  At least one of the senior positions on the board is held by a woman\n\nUnder the UK Listing Rules, the senior positions on the Board are the Chair, CEO, CFO and Senior Independent Director (SID). For Woodside, the senior positions on the Board are only the Chair and the CEO. In line with market practice for Australian listed companies, the CFO does not sit on the Board and Woodside does not have a SID as this role is not required under the corporate governance code Woodside applies, being the ASXCGC Recommendations.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, Woodside had at least one of the senior positions on the Board held by a woman and at least one director from an ethnic minority background.\n\n36% of the Board were women which is below the 40% figure set out in the UK Listing Rules. The I&D Policy includes a commitment to improve diversity on the Board, with a key focus on reaching 40% female representation. As part of Board succession planning, the Nominations & Governance Committee evaluates prospective candidates against a range of criteria including the skills, experience, expertise and diversity that will best complement Board e/ffectiveness at the time.\n\nThe tables below set out the diversity information required under the UK Listing Rules as at 31 December 2023. The data presented in those tables was collected by requesting all members of the Board, Executive Leadership Team and Group Company Secretary to self-report in questionnaires about their cultural background, languages spoken, racial identity, LGBTIQA+ identity and gender.\n\nIn accordance with UK Listing Rule 14.3.33, these tables set out the Board and executive management diversity data as at 31 December 2023.\n\nWoodside notes that the ethnic/racial background groupings do not align to groupings common in some regions but has presented the data in this way to comply with UK Listing requirements.\n\n## Gender identity\n\n|                                   | Number of  Board members   | Percentage   of the Board   | Number of senior  positions on the   Board (CEO, CFO,   SID and Chair) 1   | Number in  executive  management 2   | Percentage  of executive  management   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Men                               | 7                          | 64%                         | 1                                                                          | 8                                    | 62%                                    |\n| Women                             | 4                          | 36%                         | 1                                                                          | 5                                    | 38%                                    |\n| Not specified/  prefer not to say |                            |                             |                                                                            |                                      |                                        |\n\n## Ethnic/racial background\n\n|                                                                  | Number of  Board members   | Percentage   of the Board   | Number of senior  positions on the   Board (CEO, CFO,   SID and Chair) 1   | Number in  executive  management 2   | Percentage  of executive  management   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| White British or other White   (including minority-white groups) | 9                          | 82%                         | 2                                                                          | 11                                   | 85%                                    |\n| Mixed/multiple ethnic groups                                     |                            |                             |                                                                            | 2                                    | 15%                                    |\n| Asian/Asian British                                              | 1                          | 9%                          |                                                                            |                                      |                                        |\n| Black/African/Caribbean/Black British                            |                            |                             |                                                                            |                                      |                                        |\n| Other ethnic group, including Arab                               | 1                          | 9%                          |                                                                            |                                      |                                        |\n| Not specified/prefer not to say                                  |                            |                             |                                                                            |                                      |                                        |",

Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that Woodside's disclosure controls and procedures were e/ffective, as at 31 December 2023, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by Woodside in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarised and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, including that such information is accumulated and communicated to Woodside's management, including the CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n## Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting\n\nThe management of Woodside is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act).\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including our CEO and CFO, the e/ffectiveness of Woodside's internal control over financial reporting was evaluated based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Controls - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of the Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was e/ffective as at 31 December 2023.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and, even when determined to be e/ffective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of e/ffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during FY2023 that materially a/ffected or were reasonably likely to materially a/ffect our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Attestation report of the registered public accounting firm\n\nThe e/ffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2023 has been audited by PwC, an independent registered accounting firm that also audits Woodside's Financial Statements. Their audit report on the internal control over financial reporting is included in the Financial Statements.\n\n## DIFFERENCES FROM NYSE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS\n\nWoodside's ADSs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and, accordingly, Woodside is subject to the listing standards of the NYSE (NYSE Listing Rules). The NYSE Listing Rules include certain accommodations in the corporate governance requirements that allow foreign private issuers, such as Woodside, to follow 'home country' corporate governance practices in lieu of the otherwise applicable corporate governance standards of the NYSE. Woodside has elected to comply with certain home country rules in lieu of the applicable NYSE requirements, as more fully described below.\n\nWoodside may in the future decide to use other foreign private issuer exemptions with respect to other NYSE Listing Rules. Following Woodside's home country governance practices, as opposed to the requirements that would otherwise apply to a company listed on the NYSE, may provide less protection than is accorded to investors under the NYSE Listing Rules applicable to US domestic issuers. If, at any time, Woodside ceases to be a foreign private issuer, it will take all action necessary to comply with the SEC and NYSE Listing Rules.\n\n## Quorum\n\nThe NYSE Listing Rules generally require that a listed company's by-laws provide for a quorum for any meeting of the holders of such company's voting shares that is su/fficiently high to ensure a representative vote. Pursuant to the NYSE Listing Rules, Woodside, as a foreign private issuer, has elected to comply with practices that are permitted under Australian securities laws in lieu of the provisions of the NYSE Listing Rules. The Woodside Constitution provides that a quorum for a meeting of Woodside Shareholders is three eligible Woodside Shareholders entitled to vote.\n\n## Audit committee requirements\n\nUnder Section 303A.06 of the NYSE Listing Rules and the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act (Rule 10A-3), a US listed company is required to have an audit committee of such company's board of directors consisting entirely of independent members that comply with the requirements of Rule 10A-3. In addition, the audit committee must have a written charter which is compliant with the requirements of Section 303A.07(b) of the NYSE Listing Rules, the listed company must have an internal audit function and the listed company must fulfill all other requirements of the NYSE Listing Rules and Rule 10A-3. Foreign private issuers must comply with the audit committee standard set forth in Rule 10A-3, subject to limited exemptions, but may elect to follow 'home country' practices in lieu of the additional audit committee requirements in the NYSE Listing Rules. Rule 10A-3 requires NYSE-listed companies to ensure their audit committees are directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of the external auditor unless the company's governing law or documents or other home country legal requirements require or permit shareholders to ultimately vote on or approve these matters.

        "page_content": "## 4.3.1 Committee Chair's letter\n\n## 27 February 2024\n\nDear Shareholders\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\nI would like to acknowledge that, in June, one of our colleagues tragically lost his life while working at the North Rankin Complex. Protecting the health and safety of our employees and our contractors is our top priority, and we must ensure we remain focused on our commitment to prevent injuries. We are resolved to strive to achieve industry-leading safety performance.\n\nIn 2023, our expanded global portfolio has delivered record and reliable production, good progress has been made on our key growth projects and we achieved strong emissions performance at our facilities. While our operating performance was strong in 2023, lower realised oil and gas prices contributed to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation, excluding impairment (EBITDA) being below target.\n\nThese results are reflected in our 2023 Executive key management personnel (KMP) remuneration outcomes outlined below and in further detail in this report. The Board considers the 2023 remuneration outcomes align with overall corporate performance and shareholder's return, while maintaining Woodside's ability to attract and retain talented executive capability in a globally competitive market.\n\n## Business performance\n\nIn 2023, the Corporate Scorecard continued to have a strong link between executive reward and our shareholders' experience. It was based on Woodside's performance across four equally weighted measures of financial, base business, material sustainability issues, and strategy and growth.\n\nThe health and safety performance measure, which contributes to 10% of the total 2023 scorecard outcome, was zero. This reflects the tragic fatality at our North Rankin Complex, together with below target TRIR and disappointing process safety performance. The Board recognises we must improve on safety.\n\nThe financial measure for EBITDA was US$9,363 million, below the target of US$11,860 million due to lower realised prices. While LNG prices remained above the long-term average, they were less than budget. Operating Expenditure was $47 million higher than the target of US$2,208 million.\n\nOur expanded global portfolio delivered record production in 2023 (187.2 MMboe) due to reliable operating performance. This was achieved while beating our internal gross equity Scope 1 and 2 emissions 1 target by 5%.\n\nOver the year, we made good progress on our key growth projects with the Scarborough Energy Project on track for first LNG cargo in 2026. First oil is targeted for mid-2024 on our Sangomar project o/ff Senegal and we achieved FID on the Trion Project in the Gulf of Mexico. On our new energy projects, work continues on our proposed H2OK hydrogen project in Oklahoma and several CCS opportunities are advancing. In Western Australia, State and Federal environmental approvals were secured for the proposed Woodside Solar Project near Karratha.\n\nThe company's performance across the four Corporate Scorecard measures gave an overall corporate performance outcome of 4.8 (out of a maximum of 10).\n\nThe 2024 Corporate Scorecard has been reviewed and approved by the Board and reflects Woodside's balanced approach to operational performance against material sustainability criteria. It includes a distinct standalone measure for each of safety and climate, at 15% each of the total 2024 scorecard. These changes are described in further detail in the 2024 Corporate Scorecard section of this report.\n\n## Executive Incentive Scheme outcomes\n\nVariable Annual Reward (VAR) is delivered under the Woodside Executive Incentive Scheme (EIS). Each executive's award is based on their individual performance against key performance indicators (KPIs) and the company's performance through the Corporate Scorecard.\n\nIn 2023, the individual performance of the CEO was assessed against five equally weighted measures of growth agenda, e/ffective execution, enterprise capability, culture, reputation, and shareholder focus. At the end of the year, the Board reviewed the CEO's performance, which together with the Corporate Scorecard outcome, resulted in an EIS award at 104% of the target opportunity.\n\n- 1 Gross equity emissions are calculated prior to retirement of carbon credits as o/ffsets, focusing the organisational priorities on avoiding and reducing emissions. This contributes to our company target to reduce net equity Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Further information on this company target is provided in section 3.8 - Climate and sustainability.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The CEO proposed to the Board her final EIS award be reduced by 5% in light of the fatality at our North Rankin Complex. The Board exercised its discretion to reduce the EIS award to 99% of the target opportunity (66% of the maximum opportunity). The Board will consider whether any further action is appropriate as Woodside's response to the fatality continues.\n\nSenior Executive individual performance was evaluated against the same performance measures as the CEO, with individual KPIs set relevant to each Executive's area of responsibility. Senior Executive EIS awards ranged from 101% to 105% of target opportunity.\n\nThe Board has reviewed the 2023 EIS outcomes and believes they appropriately align with overall corporate performance and shareholder experience.\n\n## Executive remuneration\n\nCEO and Senior Executives remuneration, both fixed and variable, is reviewed annually with regard for accountabilities, experience and individual performance. It is also supported by external benchmarking.\n\nE/ffective 1 January 2024, the Board determined that the CEO's Fixed Annual Reward (FAR) would increase by 3%. The VAR component of the CEO's remuneration package remained unchanged.\n\nSenior Executive FAR was also reviewed during 2023. The Board determined that FAR would increase by 5% for Mr Graham Tiver and Ms Shiva McMahon, e/ffective 1 April 2023. The VAR structure and opportunity of Senior Executive remuneration remained unchanged.\n\nExternal benchmarking was conducted by external remuneration consultants, against ASX 20 companies, selected peers in the Australian materials and energy sector, and international oil and gas companies. The Board believes this review brings the total remuneration of the CEO and Senior Executives to a competitive position in the selected peer groups.\n\nThese changes are described in further detail in the remuneration changes section of this report.\n\nThe Board appointed Ms Liz Westcott as Executive Vice President Australian Operations e/ffective 1 June 2023. Details of Ms Westcott's FAR and key contract terms are set out in this report.\n\n## Chair and non-executive director fees\n\nFees for the Chair, and non-executive directors are reviewed annually against benchmarking from external remuneration consultants.\n\nThe fees for the Chair and non-executive directors and committee membership were last increased by 5% on 1 January 2023, the first increase since 2019. This increase considered benchmarking conducted by external independent remuneration consultants KPMG against the ASX 20 and selected international oil and gas companies.\n\nNo changes to Chair or non-executive director fees are proposed for 2024.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Human Resources & Compensation Committee continued to review the company's remuneration policies and practices globally to ensure these remain competitive in local markets and meet changing regulatory requirements. In 2023, this included adopting a Mandatory Clawback Policy consistent with the requirements of Section 303.A14 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual.\n\nMore detail on the Committee's activities in 2023 is available in the Corporate Governance Statement 2023.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Mr Gene Tilbrook who served as Chair of the Committee from 2019 until December 2023. As Committee Chair, Gene has overseen the introduction of activities to assess and monitor culture and brought a focus to investor engagement on executive remuneration and its connection to the strategy and shareholder experience.\n\nWe look forward to our ongoing engagement with you and sharing in Woodside's future success.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Arnaud Breuillac\n\nChair of Human Resources & Compensation Committee",

        "page_content": "## EXECUTIVE KMP\n\n## Remuneration policy\n\nWoodside's strategy is to thrive through the energy transition by building a low cost, lower carbon, profitable, resilient and diversified portfolio. There are three goals which drive this strategic direction.\n\nFirst, we strive to have the right portfolio to provide the energy required for future demand. We play to our strengths, providing oil and gas to our customers while advancing new energy products and lower carbon services. Climate is an integrated part of our strategy and we assess investment decisions against a wide range of considerations including climate outcomes. This is important as the demand from our customers becomes increasingly shaped by their decarbonisation goals.\n\nSecondly, we want to create and return value to our shareholders. Our capital management framework aims to optimise value, balance strong shareholder returns and invest in quality opportunities.\n\nFinally, we aim to conduct our business sustainably. To achieve this, we need to manage our impact on people, communities and the environment in which we operate. The safety of our people and a strong focus on managing our net equity Scope 1 and 2 emissions to meet our targets is critical to the longevity of our business.\n\nAll three goals are critical to ensuring that Woodside delivers its strategy and thrives through the energy transition.\n\nTo do so, the company must be able to attract and retain executive capability in a globally competitive market. The Board structures remuneration so that it rewards those who perform, is valued by Executives, and is aligned with the company's values, strategic direction and the creation of enduring value to shareholders, and other stakeholders.\n\nFixed Annual Reward (FAR) is determined having regard to the scope of each Executive's role and their level of knowledge, skills and experience.\n\nVariable Annual Reward (VAR) is calculated annually, based on performance measures set by the Board aimed at aligning executive remuneration with short and long-term shareholder returns. VAR aligns shareholder and executive remuneration outcomes by making a significant portion of executive remuneration at risk, while rewarding performance.\n\nExecutive remuneration is reviewed annually, having regard to the accountabilities, experience and performance of each individual. FAR and VAR are compared against domestic and international competitors at target, to maintain Woodside's capacity to attract and retain talent and to ensure appropriate motivation is provided to Executives to deliver on the company's strategic objectives.\n\n## Executive Incentive Scheme\n\nVAR is delivered under the Woodside Executive Incentive Scheme (EIS). The EIS is structured having regard to the key objectives of executive engagement, alignment with the shareholder experience and strategic fit.\n\n## EXECUTIVE ENGAGEMENT\n\nEnable Woodside to attract and retain executive capability in a globally competitive environment by providing Executives with a clear remuneration structure giving line of sight to how performance is reflected in remuneration outcomes.\n\n## ALIGNMENT WITH THE SHAREHOLDER EXPERIENCE\n\nPromote significant share ownership through equity awards. Equity awards are delivered as a combination of Restricted Shares and Performance Rights. The Performance Rights are Relative Total Shareholder Return (RTSR) tested against comparator groups, after five years.\n\n## STRATEGIC FIT\n\nMeasures which determine the quantum of the EIS award are selected for alignment with Woodside strategy and award deferral periods reflect Woodside's strategic time horizons. Together these drive Executives to deliver our strategic objectives with discipline and collaboration, in turn creating shareholder value.",

        "page_content": "## Individual and Company Performance\n\nThe EIS delivers a single variable reward linked to challenging individual and company annual targets set by the Board.\n\nEach Executive KMP's award is based upon two components: individual performance against KPIs (30% weighting) and the company's performance against the Corporate Scorecard (70% weighting).\n\nIndividual performance measures are designed to ensure Executives focus on driving Woodside's culture and values whilst executing Woodside's strategic imperatives.\n\n## Financial\n\n## Base business\n\n## Sustainability\n\n## Strategy and growth\n\nEBITDA is a key contributor to annual profitability, and controlling Operating Expenditure brings a focus on e/fficient operations, cost competitiveness and shareholder returns.\n\n25 %\n\n25 %\n\n25 %\n\n25 %\n\n## Calculation of Award\n\nThe EIS award is subject to performance in each 12-month period and is determined at the conclusion of each performance year.\n\nIndividual performance is rated on a scale between 0 and 5 and is assessed by the Board in the case of the CEO, and by the CEO and the Human Resources & Compensation Committee in the case of Senior Executives. Corporate performance is rated on a scale between 0 and 10, with a score of 5 for an outcome at target and a maximum of 10 on each measure. The sum of these two components determines the award.\n\nExceeding targets results in an increased award with a linear calculation up to the maximum, while under-performance will result in a reduced award. The minimum award that an Executive can receive is zero if the performance conditions are not achieved on either company or individual performance.\n\nThe decision to pay or allocate an EIS award is subject to the overriding discretion of the Board, which may adjust outcomes, both upwards and downwards, to better reflect shareholder outcomes and company or management performance. Each year, the Board conducts a holistic assessment of Woodside's performance on all significant factors, before considering whether it is appropriate to adjust EIS outcomes, either upwards or downwards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Target variable reward opportunity for 2023\n\nEach Executive is given a target VAR opportunity and a maximum VAR opportunity which is expressed as percentage of the Executive's FAR. The opportunities for 2023 are outlined below.\n\n|                   | Minimum opportunity   |   Target opportunity   (% of FAR) |   Maximum opportunity   (% of FAR) |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Position CEO      | (% of FAR) Zero       |                               280 |                                420 |\n| Senior Executives | Zero                  |                               160 |                                256 |\n\n## CEO remuneration at target\n\nFixed reward 26%\n\nVariable reward 74%\n\n## Senior Executives remuneration at target\n\nFixed reward 38%\n\nVariable reward 62%\n\nRevenue is maximised and value generated from our assets when they are fully utilised in production.\n\nMaterial sustainability issues include personal and process safety, environment, emissions reductions, and our social licence to operate.\n\nBusiness priorities focus on progress and milestones of capital projects, business developments, and balance sheet management.\n\nThe Board has strong oversight and governance to ensure that appropriate and challenging individual targets are set to create a clear link between performance and reward.\n\nThe 2023 Corporate Scorecard for Executive KMP was based on four equally weighted measures that were chosen because they impact short-term and long-term shareholder value. This includes measures selected for alignment with Woodside strategy, covering operational e/fficiency, financial outcomes and performance against key sustainability measures.",

There are no further performance conditions attached to these awards. This element creates a strong retention proposition for Executives as vesting is subject to employment not being terminated with cause or by resignation during the deferral period. The deferral mechanism means that the value of awards reflects fluctuations in share price across the deferral periods, which is intended to reflect the sustainability of performance over the medium and long-term and support alignment between Executives and shareholders.\n\n## Performance Rights\n\nThe Performance Rights are divided into two portions with each portion subject to a separate RTSR performance hurdle tested over a five-year period. Performance is tested after five years as Woodside operates in a capital intensive industry with long\n\n## VAR\n\n- \u00b7  Executives are eligible to receive a single variable reward linked to individual and company annual targets set by the Board.\n- \u00b7  The VAR is subject to performance against individual and corporate performance in the initial 12-month period and is determined at the conclusion of each performance year.\n\n## Senior Executives EIS structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninvestment timelines. It is imperative that Executives take decisions in the long-term interest of shareholders, focused on value creation across the commodity price cycles of the oil and gas industry.\n\nOur view is that RTSR is the best measure of long-term value creation across the commodity price cycle of our industry.\n\nOne-third of the Performance Rights are tested against a comparator group that comprises the entities within the ASX 50 index at 1 December 2023. The remaining two-thirds are tested against an international group of oil and gas companies, set out in Table 11.\n\nRTSR outcomes are calculated by an external adviser after the conclusion of the performance period. The outcome of the test is measured against the schedule below. For EIS awards, any Performance Rights that do not vest will lapse and are not retested.\n\nFor valuation purposes all Performance Rights are treated as if they will be equity settled. Each Performance Right is a right to receive a fully paid ordinary share in Woodside on vesting (or, at the Board's discretion, as cash equivalent payment). No amount is payable by the Executive on the grant or vesting of a Performance Right.",

The number  of Restricted Shares and Performance Rights is calculated by dividing the value by the volume weighted average  price (VWAP) of the Company's shares traded on each trading day across December of the performance year.                                                                                                                                                |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dividends and voting     | Executives are entitled to receive dividends on Restricted Shares. No dividends are paid on Performance Rights  prior to vesting. For Performance Rights that do vest, a dividend equivalent payment will be paid by Woodside for  dividends paid during the period between allocation and vesting. The dividend equivalent payment will be paid in  cash unless the Board determines otherwise.                                                                                      |\n|                          | Restricted Shares have voting rights in the same way as other Woodside shareholders.

Where the company is required to prepare an accounting  restatement due to material non-compliance with any financial reporting requirements under the securities laws,  the Company will recoup the amount of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation in accordance with  such Mandatory Clawback Policy. |\n| Control event            | The Board has the discretion to determine the treatment of any EIS award on a change of control event. If an  actual change of control occurs during the performance year, an Executive will generally receive at least a pro- rata cash payment in respect of the unallocated cash and Restricted Share components of the EIS award for that  performance year, assessed at target.                                                                                                  |\n|                          | If an actual change of control occurs during the vesting period for equity awards, unless the Board determines  otherwise Restricted Shares will vest in full whilst Performance Rights, will vest on a pro-rata basis having regard  to the portion of the vesting period elapsed.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Cessation of employment  | During a performance year, should an Executive resign or be terminated for cause, no EIS award will be provided  (unless the Board determines otherwise). In any other case, Woodside will have regard to performance against  target and the portion of the performance year elapsed in determining any EIS award.                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|                          | During a deferral or performance period, should an Executive resign or be terminated for cause, any EIS award will  be forfeited or lapse (unless the Board determines otherwise). In any other case, any Restricted Shares will vest in  full from a date determined by the Board while any Performance Rights will remain on foot and vest in the ordinary  course subject to the satisfaction of applicable conditions, unless the Board determines otherwise.                     |\n| No retesting             | There will be no retest applied to EIS awards.

The terms applying to prior year grants are described in past Woodside Annual Reports.\n\n## Supplementary Woodside Equity Plan (SWEP)\n\nIn October 2011, the Board approved the establishment of the SWEP to enable the o/ffering of targeted retention awards of Equity Rights (ERs) for key capability.\n\nThe SWEP was updated in 2022 to broaden eligibility to all employees of a subsidiary of Woodside Energy Group Ltd and ensure compliance in all jurisdictions in which Woodside operates. This facilitated the o/ffer of replacement unvested incentives as required under transitional arrangements for eligible heritage BHP employees transitioning from BHP Group Long-Term Incentive (LTI) plans to VAR o/ffered under Woodside's VAR arrangements.\n\nThe SWEP awards have service conditions and no performance conditions. Each ER entitles the participant to receive a Woodside share on the vesting date.\n\nERs under the SWEP may vest prior to the vesting date on a change of control or on a pro-rata basis, at the discretion of the CEO, limited to the following circumstances; redundancy, retirement (after six months' participation), death, termination due to illness or incapacity or total and permanent disablement of a participating employee. An employee whose employment is terminated by resignation or for cause prior to the vesting date will forfeit all their unvested ERs.\n\nIn relation to the applicable cessation of employment treatment for SWEP ERs granted as replacement awards to heritage BHP employees, unless the Board determines otherwise, unvested SWEP ERs will vest on a pro-rata basis in the following circumstances; redundancy, death, termination due to medical illness or incapacity or total and permanent disablement of the participant. For cessation in other circumstances, (and other than where employment is terminated by resignation or for cause), Woodside's CEO (or Committee of the Board, as applicable) has discretion to permit pro-rata vesting.\n\nThere is no entitlement to dividends on ERs and ERs do not carry voting rights.\n\n## Minimum Shareholding Requirements (MSR) Policy\n\nThe Executive MSR Policy reflects the long-term focus of management and aims to further strengthen alignment with shareholders.\n\nThe MSR Policy requires Senior Executives to have acquired and maintained Woodside shares for a minimum total purchase price of at least 100% of their FAR after a period of five years, and in the case of the CEO a minimum of 200% of FAR after a period of five years.\n\nOf the Executive KMP, Ms O'Neill, Mr Tiver and Ms McMahon meet the MSR requirements. Ms Westcott commenced with Woodside in 2023 and will acquire Woodside shares to meet the MSR requirements. See Table 14 for details.",

The benchmarking conducted by KPMG included ASX 20 companies, selected peers in the Australian materials and energy sector and international oil and gas companies. Meridian benchmarked 18 companies with global operations, primarily in the oil and gas energy sector.\n\nWith reference to market benchmarks, the Board has set Ms O'Neill's FAR at A$2,472,000 e/ffective 1 January 2024. This increase of three percent (compared to Ms O'Neill's FAR of A$2,400,000 in 2023) recognised the expertise, knowledge and performance of Ms O'Neill and brings the total remuneration to a competitive position in the selected peer groups.\n\nIn 2022 the Board approved an increase to the target opportunity for the CEO's VAR and structure of the EIS. This has applied to the assessment of the CEO's performance from 1 June 2022 and the 2023 performance year. No changes are proposed to the target opportunity or structure of EIS for 2024.\n\nBenchmarking indicates Ms O'Neill's remuneration is positioned competitively in the selected peer groups. CEO FAR is comparable to median of the ASX 20 peer group and the upper quartile of global oil and gas peers. CEO Total Target Remuneration (TTR), which includes FAR and at target VAR, is aligned to the upper quartile of the ASX peer group and is below the median compared to global oil and gas peers.\n\nTo support the review of Senior Executive remuneration the Board engaged KPMG to provide benchmarking and remuneration recommendations. Following this review, the FAR for Mr Tiver and Ms McMahon was increased by five percent e/ffective 1 April 2023.

The 2024 Scorecard has five individually weighted measures which assess safe, reliable, and e/fficient operations, implementation of our strategic plan and delivery of sustainable business priorities.\n\nTo focus Executives on their leadership contribution to Woodside's safety performance and delivery against climate plans, each objective has been elevated a standalone measure in 2024.\n\n## Financial\n\n## Base business\n\n## Growth\n\n## Safety\n\n## Climate\n\nEBITDA is a key contributor to annual profitability and controlling Operating Expenditure brings a focus on e/fficient operations, cost competitiveness and shareholder returns.\n\n30 %\n\n20 %\n\n20 %\n\n15 %\n\n15 %\n\nRevenue is maximised and value generated from our assets when they are fully utilised in production.\n\nGrowth focuses on achievement of capital project milestones and business developments aligned to our strategic plan.\n\nProtecting the health and safety of our people, our contractors and our host communities is a top priority.\n\nEnsures appropriate emphasis on meeting Scope 1 and 2 emissions targets and progress of new energy projects.\n\nSafety metrics make up 15% of the total 2024 scorecard to ensure a focus on our aim to prevent all injuries and the critical importance of e/ffective process safety management and leadership to avoid major accident and environmental events.\n\nClimate metrics make up 15% of the total 2024 scorecard to ensure appropriate emphasis on meeting Scope 1 and 2 emissions targets as well as progress of new energy projects.",

EBITDA is closely aligned with short-term shareholder value creation. EBITDA is underpinned by e/fficient operational performance and outcomes are exposed to the upside and downside of oil and gas price and foreign exchange fluctuations, as are returns to shareholders. Controlling Operating Expenditure brings a focus on e/fficient operations; cost competitiveness; and shareholder returns.\n\n2023 performance: EBITDA excluding impairments was US$9,363 million, below the target of US$11,860 million due to lower realised prices, partially o/ffset by higher production. Operating Expenditure was US$2,255 million, US$47 million higher than the target of US$2,208 million due to higher operating costs on Pluto and Gulf of Mexico assets. Operating Expenditure excludes the foreign exchange impact of a weaker US dollar, and the commodity price and volume impacts on Pluto-KGP Interconnector Operating Expenditure.\n\n## Base business (25%)\n\nOutcome\n\n6.1\n\nMID-POINT\n\nMAX\n\nRevenue is maximised and value generated from Woodside's assets when they are fully utilised in production. Production must be carefully managed throughout the year to optimise value from the assets. The production target for Corporate Scorecard purposes is set relative to the company's annual budget and market guidance.\n\n2023 performance: Production of 187.2 MMboe was within production guidance of 180 - 190 MMboe due to higher Pluto-KGP Interconnector production and continued Pluto Train 1 reliability, Mad Dog Phase 2 first oil achieved in April 2023 and strong field performance for Trinidad and Tobago. This is o/ffset by turnaround activities and lower than planned gas demand at Bass Strait.\n\nThe Board considers performance across material sustainability issues including personal and process safety, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, and our social licence to operate. Strong performance in this area creates and protects value in four ways; it reduces the likelihood of major accident events and catastrophic losses; it maintains Woodside's licence to operate which enables the development of its growth portfolio; it reflects e/fficient, optimised and controlled business processes that generate value; and it supports the company's position as a partner of choice.\n\n2023 performance: The health and safety performance measure, which contributes to 10% of the overall scorecard outcome, was zero. This reflects safety performance below target with a TRIR of 1.86 (compared to a target of 1), which included one fatality at the North Rankin Complex and process safety performance below target with three Tier 1 or 2 process safety events recorded against a maximum target of 1. Gross equity Scope 1 and 2 emissions performance was 6,190kT CO2-e, 5% better than the target.

These metrics, outlined in Table 4, were chosen because the Board considers successful performance in each area to be a key driver of superior shareholder returns.\n\nThe same metrics were cascaded to the Senior Executives to measure individual performance.\n\nAt the end of the year, the Board reviewed the CEO's performance for 2023. The CEO was given an individual performance score between 0 and 5, which together with the Corporate Scorecard determined the VAR outcome. This resulted in an EIS award at 104% of the target opportunity. The CEO proposed to the Board her final EIS award be reduced by 5% in light of the fatality at our North Rankin Complex. The Board exercised its discretion to reduce the EIS award to 99% of the target opportunity (66% of the maximum opportunity). The Board will consider whether any further action is appropriate as Woodside's response to the fatality continues.\n\nInformation on the individual performance of the CEO is shown in Table 4.\n\nThe 2023 EIS award for the CEO is detailed in Table 7.\n\nIn June 2023, Ms O'Neill was paid the second tranche of a oneo/ff cash bonus approved by the Board in 2022, in recognition of Ms O'Neill's significant contribution towards the merger of Woodside and BHP's petroleum business.

Ms Westcott's FAR on appointment was A$1,090,000.\n\nManagement will continue to monitor market developments to ensure FAR for Senior Executives remains competitive and benchmarks appropriately against peer companies.\n\n## Senior Executive VAR and other incentives\n\nFor 2023, the individual performance of each Senior Executive was evaluated against the same performance measures as the CEO, with individual KPIs set relevant to each Executive's area of responsibility. These metrics aim to align individual performance with the achievement of Woodside's corporate strategy while fostering collaboration between Executives.\n\nThe Board approved EIS awards to Senior Executives based on the Corporate Scorecard result and their individual performance assessment.\n\nInformation on the individual performance of Senior Executives who were KMP as at 31 December 2023 is shown in Table 4.\n\nDetails of the EIS award for each Senior Executive who were KMP as at 31 December 2023 are set out in Table 7.",

        "page_content": "## NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS (NEDS)\n\n## Remuneration policy\n\nWoodside's Remuneration Policy for NEDs aims to attract, retain, motivate and to remunerate fairly and responsibly having regard to:\n\n- \u00b7  the level of fees paid to NEDs relative to other major Australian listed companies.\n- \u00b7  the size and complexity of Woodside's operations.\n- \u00b7  the responsibilities and work requirements of Board members.\n\nFees paid to NEDs are recommended by the Human Resources & Compensation Committee (Committee) based on benchmarking from external remuneration consultants and determined by the Board. In 2023, the Board determined that there would be no increase to the Board or committee fees or any other benefits.\n\nFees paid to NEDs are subject to an aggregate limit of A$4.675 million per financial year, which was approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM.\n\n## Minimum Shareholding Requirements (MSR) Policy\n\nNEDs are required to have acquired shares for a total purchase price of at least 100% of their pre-tax base annual fee after five years on the Board. The NEDs may utilise the Non-executive Directors' Share Plan (NEDSP) to acquire the shares on market at market value. As the shares are acquired after tax, the shares in the NEDSP are not subject to any forfeiture conditions.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, all NEDs met the MSR, except Mr Wyatt who joined Woodside in 2021 and Mr Breuillac and Ms Minas who joined Woodside in 2023. Mr Wyatt, Mr Breuillac and Ms Minas are participating in the NEDSP to assist with acquiring shares. See Table 14 for details.\n\n## NEDs remuneration structure\n\nNEDs remuneration consists of base Board fees and committee fees, plus statutory superannuation contributions or payments in lieu (currently 11%). Other payments may be made for additional services outside the scope of Board and Committee duties. NEDs do not earn retirement benefits other than superannuation and are not entitled to any form of performance-linked remuneration in order to preserve their independence.\n\nTable 9 shows the 2023 annual base Board and committee fees for NEDs.\n\nIn addition to these fees, NEDs are entitled to reimbursement of reasonable travel, accommodation and other expenses incurred attending meetings of the Board, committees or shareholders, or while engaged on Woodside business. NEDs are not entitled to compensation on termination of their directorships.\n\nAn allowance is paid to any NED required to travel internationally to attend Board commitments, compensating for factors related to long-haul travel. Where travel is between six and ten hours, an allowance of A$5,000 gross per trip is paid. Where travel exceeds 10 hours, an allowance of A$10,000 gross per trip is paid.\n\nBoard fees are not paid to the CEO, as the time spent on Board work and the responsibilities of Board membership are considered in determining the remuneration package provided as part of the normal employment conditions.\n\nThe total remuneration paid to, or in respect of, each NED in 2023 is set out in Table 13.\n\nTable 9 - Annual base Board and committee fees for NEDs 1\n\n| Position                 | Board 2 A$   | Audit & Risk  Committee  A$   | Human Resources  & Compensation  Committee  A$   | Sustainability  Committee  A$   | Nominations  & Governance  Committee  A$   |\n|--------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Chair of the Board3      | 759,465      | -                             | -                                                | -                               | -                                          |\n| Non-executive directors4 | 230,137      | -                             | -                                                | -                               | -                                          |\n| Committee chair          | -            | 62,328                        | 54,600                                           | 49,770                          | Nil                                        |\n| Committee member         | -            | 33,562                        | 27,825                                           | 24,885                          | Nil                                        |\n\n- 1 Fees in this table reflect 2023 annual base Board and committee fees for NEDs.\n- 2 NEDs receive Board and committee fees plus statutory superannuation (or payments in lieu where statutory superannuation is not required to be paid).\n- 3 Inclusive of committee work.\n- 4 Board fees paid to NEDs other than the Chair.",

        "page_content": "## HUMAN RESOURCES & COMPENSATION COMMITTEE\n\nThe Committee assists the Board to determine appropriate remuneration policies and structures for NEDs and Executives. Further information on the role of the Committee is described in the Corporate Governance section of the Annual Report.\n\n## LOANS AND TRANSACTIONS\n\nNo loans or transactions (other than as described in this report) have been made, guaranteed or secured, directly or indirectly, by Woodside or any of its subsidiaries at any time throughout the year, to any KMP including to a KMP related party.\n\n## USE OF REMUNERATION CONSULTANTS\n\nFrom time-to-time, the Committee directly engages independent external advisers to provide input to the process of reviewing the remuneration for NEDs and Executives. The Committee may receive executive remuneration advice directly from external independent remuneration consultants for Executive KMP.\n\nUnder communications and engagement protocols adopted by the Company, market data reports are provided directly to the Committee Chair, and a consultant provides a statement to the Committee that reports have been prepared free of undue influence from Executive KMP. This process ensures the Committee has full oversight of the review process and therefore it, and the Board, can be satisfied that the work undertaken by external independent remuneration consultants is free from undue influence by Executive KMP.\n\nIn 2023, KPMG was engaged to provide remuneration recommendations related to remuneration packages of Senior Executives, as defined by the Corporations Act 2001 . KPMG was engaged in accordance with the Corporations Act and advice was provided directly to the Human Resources & Compensation Committee through the Committee Chair. Remuneration recommendations were provided to the Board as an input into decision-making only, and the Board considered the recommendations, along with other factors, when making remuneration decisions.\n\nBoth KPMG and the Board are satisfied that the remuneration recommendations were made free from undue influence from the Executive KMP to whom the remuneration recommendations applied. The Board was satisfied that the remuneration recommendations provided were free from undue influence because of the communications and engagement protocols adopted by the Company, and because the Senior Executives whose remuneration was the subject of the recommendation were not involved in any aspect of the engagement of KPMG to provide such advice or the process of Woodside receiving the advice.\n\nKPMG was paid A$15,000 in relation to remuneration recommendations related to remuneration packages of Senior Executives. KPMG was paid US$6,319,793 for other services not related to remuneration recommendations.\n\nExternal benchmarking was obtained from external independent remuneration consultants KPMG and Meridian in support of the 2023 review of CEO and Senior Executive remuneration and from KPMG in support of the 2023 NED fee review. No remuneration recommendations were received for the CEO or NEDs during 2023.\n\n## REPORTING NOTES\n\n## Reporting in United States dollars\n\nIn this report, the remuneration and benefits reported have been presented in US dollars, unless otherwise stated. This is consistent with the functional and presentation currency of the Company.\n\nCompensation for Australian-based employees and Australianbased KMP is paid in Australian dollars and, for reporting purposes, converted to US dollars based on the exchange rate reflective of the service period. Compensation for US-based employees and US-based KMP is paid in US dollars. Valuation of equity awards is converted at the spot rate applying when the equity award is granted.",

Amounts were translated to USD using the closing spot rate on 31 December.\n- 3 Cash incentives earned by Ms O'Neill include an accrual (US$52,125) for the second tranche of a one-o/ff cash bonus payment (US$130,817) paid during the year in relation to significant contribution towards the merger of Woodside and BHP's petroleum business.\n- 4 In 2022, cash incentives earned, by Mr Tiver (US$33,677), Mr Gregory (US$61,941) and Ms Hick (US$41,294) include a one-o/ff cash bonus payment in relation to their significant contribution towards the merger of Woodside BHP's petroleum business. Mr Tiver's cash incentives include a further cash bonus payment (US$355,948) as a sign-on benefit to compensate for benefits forgone on leaving the BHP Group.\n- 5 In accordance with the requirements of AASB 2 Share-based Payment, the fair value of equity instruments as at their date of grant has been determined with reference to the closing share price at grant date, or by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing technique or applying the binomial valuation method combined with a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value of equity instruments is amortised over the vesting period from the commencement of the service period, such that 'total remuneration' includes a portion of the fair value of unvested equity compensation during the year. The portion of the expense relating to the 2023 EIS has been measured using estimated fair values as disclosed in footnote 2 in Table 7. The amount included as remuneration is not indicative of the benefit (if any) that individual Executives may ultimately realise should these equity instruments vest.\n- 6 The total remuneration in AUD is converted from USD using the exchange rate reflective of the service period. This non-IFRS unaudited information is included for the purposes of showing the total annual cost of benefits to the company in Australian dollars for the service period.\n- 7 Performance related outcome percentage is calculated as total variable annual reward divided by the USD total remuneration figure.\n- 8 Ms M O'Neill elected to receive a cash payment in lieu of all superannuation contributions in accordance with the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992, on the basis of being a Senior Foreign Executive. The cash payment is subject to (PAYG) income tax and paid as part of Ms O'Neill's normal monthly salary. The amount is included in salaries, fees and allowances.\n- 9 Mr G Tiver commenced employment with Woodside on 1 February 2022.\n- 10  Ms S McMahon commenced employment with Woodside on 1 June 2022.\n- 11 Ms L Westcott commenced employment with Woodside on 1 June 2023.\n- 12  Mr S Gregory ceased being an Executive KMP on 31 May 2022.\n- 13  Ms F Hick ceased being an Executive KMP on 28 November 2022. Ms Hick's termination benefit of US$152,531 includes salaries, fees and allowances received for the period of 29 November 2022 to 24 February 2023 while on gardening leave.\n- 14  Ms S Duhe ceased being an Executive KMP on 4 February 2022.",

Each Performance Right and Equity Right is a right to receive a fully paid ordinary share in Woodside (or, at the Board's discretion, as cash equivalent). No amount is payable by the Executive on the grant or vesting of a Performance Right or Equity Right.\n- 2 Vesting date and exercise date are the same. Vesting is subject to satisfaction of vesting conditions. Full details of the vesting conditions for all prior year equity grants to Executive KMP are included in the remuneration report for the relevant year.\n- 3 Vesting of Restricted Shares and Performance Rights granted in 2024 will occur following the release of full-year results in the relevant vesting year. Where the vesting date is not yet known the estimated vesting month is shown.\n- 4 In accordance with the requirements of AASB 2 Share-based Payment, the fair value of Performance Rights and Equity Rights as at their date of grant has been determined by applying the BlackScholes option pricing technique or binomial valuation method combined with a Monte Carlo simulation. The amount included as remuneration is not indicative of the benefit (if any) that individual Executives may ultimately realise should these equity instruments vest.\n- 5 The fair value of Restricted Shares as at their date of grant has been determined by reference to the share price at acquisition. The fair value is not indicative of the benefit (if any) that individual Executive KMP may ultimately realise should these equity instruments.\n- 6 Fair values for the 2023 EIS with grant date being 27 February 2024 and expected to be 24 April 2024 have been estimated as disclosed in footnote 2 of Table 7. Fair values for the 2022 EIS with grant dates of 27 February 2023 and 28 April 2023 have been trued-up as disclosed in footnote 3 of Table 7.\n- 7 The maximum value of the equity instruments awarded for future financial years has been determined as the fair value amount at grant date multiplied by the number of equity instruments awarded, less what has been amortised to date. The minimum total value of the equity instruments awarded for future financial years is nil if relevant vesting conditions are not satisfied.\n- 8 Ms M O'Neill was granted Performance Rights and Restricted Shares on 28 April 2023 as approved by shareholders at the 2023 Woodside Annual General Meeting under Listing Rule 10.14. The grant of the Performance Rights and Restricted Shares components of Ms O'Neill's 2023 EIS award is subject to shareholder approval at the 2024 Woodside Annual General Meeting. The grant date for Performance Rights and Restricted Shares is the date of shareholder approval.",

During the year ended 31 December 2023, Mad Dog Phase 2 produced 3.1 MMboe of hydrocarbons.\n- \u00b7   In April 2023, conditions precedent were achieved in the long-term gas sale and purchase contract (GSPA) with Perdaman. The contract price contains an embedded derivative linked to the price of urea, which is recognised as a net liability of $35 million at 31 December 2023 (refer to Note D.6).\n- \u00b7  On 20 June 2023, the Group made a final investment decision (FID) to develop the Trion resource in Mexico. Related exploration and evaluation assets were transferred to oil and gas properties (refer to Notes B.2 and B.3). Upon FID, the Group recognised a deferred tax asset (DTA) of $319 million (refer to Note A.5).\n- \u00b7  On 8 August 2023, the Group and LJ Scarborough Pty Ltd (LNG Japan) entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement for LNG Japan to acquire a 10% non-operating participating interest in the Scarborough Joint Venture. The transaction is expected to complete in the first quarter of 2024. As a result, $823 million of assets have been reclassified as assets held for sale and $94 million of liabilities have been reclassified to liabilities directly associated to assets held for sale (refer to Note B.8). A reduction in the deferred tax liability due to the change to a held for sale basis resulted in a tax benefit of $78 million being recognised for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n- \u00b7  During the year ended 31 December 2023, the Group reduced the Pluto petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) DTA by $637 million ($446 million post-tax) on the basis of future taxable profits not being available to utilise the deductible expenditure. This is primarily driven by decreases in forecast pricing assumptions and actual pricing realised during the year ended 31 December 2023 (refer to Note A.5).\n- \u00b7  The Group recognised pre-tax impairments of $1,917 million for the Shenzi, Wheatstone and Pyrenees cash-generating units (refer to Note B.4).\n- \u00b7   In 2023, the Group completed the purchase price accounting for the BHPP merger (refer to Note B.5).",

Its shares are publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), on the Main Market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) (with trades settled in the form of UK Depository Interests) and on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) (in the form of Woodside American Depositary Shares). The nature of the operations and the principal activities of the Group are described in the Directors' Report and in the segment information in Note A.1.\n\nThe financial statements were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 27 February 2024.\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe financial statements are general purpose financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 , Australian Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB). The financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. They also include additional disclosures required for foreign registrants by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (US SEC).\n\nThe Group's accounting policies are consistent with those disclosed in the Group's 2022 Financial Statements. Adoption of new or amended standards and interpretations e/ffective 1 January 2023 did not result in any significant changes to the Group's accounting policies.\n\nEstimates have been revised, where required, to reflect current market conditions including the impact of climate change. Updated assumptions used for depreciation methodology and asset useful lives, impairment assessments, business combinations and restoration obligations are disclosed in Notes B.3, B.4, B.5 and D.5 respectively; these assumptions could change in the future. New estimates and judgements relating to the sell-down of the Scarborough joint venture and an embedded commodity derivative are disclosed in Notes B.8 and D.6 respectively.\n\n## Currency\n\nThe functional and presentation currency of Woodside and all its material subsidiaries is the US dollar.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of the transacting entity at the exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at that date. Exchange di/fferences in the consolidated financial statements are taken to the income statement.\n\n## Rounding of amounts\n\nThe amounts contained in these financial statements have been rounded to the nearest million dollars under the option available to the Group under Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Corporations (Rounding in Financial/ Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and certain other financial assets and financial liabilities, which have been measured at fair value or amortised cost adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risks that are being hedged in e/ffective hedge relationships. Where not carried at fair value, if the carrying value of financial assets and financial liabilities does not approximate their fair value, the fair value has been included in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nThe financial statements comprise the financial position and results of the Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2023 (refer to Note E.8).\n\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date at which the Group ceases to have control.\n\nThe material subsidiaries of the Group apply the same reporting period and accounting policies as the parent company in their financial statements. All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.\n\nNon-controlling interests are allocated their share of the net profit after tax in the consolidated income statement and their share of other comprehensive income net of tax in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, and are presented within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position, separately from parent shareholders' equity.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements provide comparative information in respect of the previous periods. Where required, a reclassification of items in the financial statements of the previous periods has been made in accordance with the classification of items in the financial statements of the current period.\n\n## CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY TRANSITION\n\n## Climate considerations\n\nWoodside has considered the impact of climate and the energy transition in assessing the carrying values of its assets and liabilities. This note describes climate-related assumptions that underpin key areas of the financial statements and the potential short-term and long-term impacts di/ffering scenarios could have on the financial results and financial position of Woodside.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY TRANSITION (CONT.)\n\n## Financial planning and assumptions\n\nWoodside considers a range of climate and macroeconomic scenarios to help benchmark our long-term price assumptions and inform our decision-making to maintain a resilient financial position. These scenarios are informed by a wide range of externally published data, including Paris-aligned and nonParis-aligned outcomes, and are part of a broad consideration of risks, opportunities, competitiveness and resilience. The assumptions applied in assessing amounts within the financial statements require significant judgement and are in each case calculated in accordance with the requirements of the applicable accounting standards.\n\nOur long-term price assumptions reflect management's current 'best estimate' scenario in which global governments pursue decarbonisation goals as well as other goals such as energy security and economic development. Price assumptions consider current legislation in the locations where Woodside operates and place some weight on scenarios in which the transition to a lower carbon energy system is su/fficiently rapid to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as scenarios in which the transition is not, or may not be, su/fficiently rapid. They also place some weight on a range of other assumptions which can drive prices (e.g. inflation) and which are not related to the Paris goals.\n\nWoodside's facilities are subject to physical risks such as oceanic conditions and are located in regions that experience tropical cyclones, hurricanes and high ambient temperatures. Woodside has significant experience designing and operating facilities located in challenging environments.\n\nThe high degree of uncertainty around the nature, timing and magnitude of climate-related risks, and the uncertainty as to how the energy transition will evolve, makes it di/fficult to determine the risks and their potential impacts with precision.\n\nWoodside continues to monitor the uncertainty around climate change risks and expects to take into account ongoing developments into its assumptions, including assumptions concerning commodity and carbon pricing, as considered appropriate. Oil and gas investment cases include a carbon price assumption which takes into consideration uncertainty around the impact of climate change. Commodity pricing assumptions are key value drivers with greater significance to assets and liabilities than carbon pricing.\n\n## Impairment of exploration and evaluation, oil and gas properties and goodwill\n\nIn accordance with the Group's accounting policies and applicable accounting standards, elements of Woodside's financial statements are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management's current best estimate of the range of economic conditions that may exist in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe estimation of recoverable amounts for impairment testing includes estimating what an independent market participant would pay to acquire the asset as at the reporting date. Market participants will be guided by their own views on future economic and technical conditions and therefore Woodside considers a range of data sources in determining a future price forecast, including industry and market benchmarks along with asset sales transaction data to support the recoverable amount. The sale of the 10% non-operating participating interest in the Scarborough Joint Venture to LNG Japan announced in August 2023 is a clear example of an independent market valuation fully supporting the carrying value of the multi-decade asset.\n\nPrice forecasts are adjusted for premiums and discounts based on the nature and quality of the product. Commodity oil price estimates have considered the impacts of climate policies along with other factors such as industry investment and cost trends. There remains significant uncertainty around how society will respond to the climate challenge.\n\nThe energy transition is expected to bring volatility and there is uncertainty as to how commodity prices will develop. The IEA's World Energy Outlook 2023 (WEO) explores three main climate change scenarios. The IEA scenarios are not predictions and the IEA does not have a single view on the future of the energy system. There is significant uncertainty as to whether any of these scenarios will eventuate. Because Woodside considers what a market participant would pay to acquire an asset in assessing impairments, these external scenarios are not necessarily consistent with the pricing assumptions used for the Group's impairment assessment as disclosed in Table A below and Note B.4.",

The impact of the benchmark pricing assumptions may be addressed to varying degrees by decisions Woodside could make in response such as acquisitions, divestments or cost reductions as well as other consequential changes. The scenarios must therefore not be interpreted as Woodside's investment guidance. These are scenarios, not forecasts, and no likelihood is assigned to any of these scenarios eventuating.\n\n## Impact on remaining life of assets\n\nOil and gas properties relating to transferred exploration and evaluation and o/ffshore plant and equipment are depreciated using the unit of production basis over either proved or proved\n\nplus probable reserves. The energy transition may result in changes to the expected useful life of oil and gas properties and economically recoverable reserves and resources thereby accelerating depreciation charges or resulting in an impairment.\n\n## Restoration and other provisions\n\nThe energy transition may result in restoration activities occurring earlier than expected. 55% (2022: 54%) of the Group's non-current restoration liabilities are expected to be settled more than 10 years in the future.\n\nRestoration cost estimates require judgemental assumptions regarding removal date, environmental legislation and regulations and the extent of restoration activities required.\n\nThese cost estimates may change in the future, as a result of increased regulatory scrutiny and the energy transition. This includes the demand and related costs for o/ffshore services which can be influenced by renewable energy construction. Woodside continues to monitor the uncertainty around climate change risks to assess if additional changes to restoration provisions should be recognised.\n\n## Long-term contracts\n\nClimate risks may impact underlying assumptions used to assess the forecast cash flows of long-term contracts. These judgemental assumptions include pricing forecast and discount rate adjustments based on the nature of the product.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Corpus Christi contract has a positive value and therefore is not currently onerous (2022: not onerous). This and other contractual arrangements could be impacted by adverse market conditions arising from climate-related factors.\n\nGiven the uncertainty in climate events, Woodside continues to review the forecast cash flows of long-term contracts.\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nThe Group has determined that it is probable that su/fficient future taxable income will be available to utilise the deferred tax assets relating to carry forward unused tax losses and credits recognised as at 31 December 2023. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Group's future taxable income which can be impacted by the uncertainty of commodity and carbon pricing.\n\n## Regulatory environment\n\nRegulation of climate-related emissions can change over time. The Australian Government has passed reforms to its Safeguard Mechanism which applies to regulatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions from Woodside's Australian facilities. Some elements of the reform, such as the method for determining limits at new facilities, continue to be developed. In December 2023, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule to establish performance standards for methane and other emissions from existing and new oil and gas operations. Woodside is not aware of any proposal that would materially a/ffect the information in these financial statements.",

The Board of Directors and the Audit and Risk Committee have oversight of the Group's internal control system and risk management process, including oversight of the internal audit function.\n\nThe Group's management of financial and capital risks is aimed at ensuring that available capital, funding and cash flows are su/fficient to:\n\n- \u00b7  meet the Group's financial commitments as and when they fall due;\n- \u00b7  maintain the capacity to fund its committed project developments;\n- \u00b7  pay a reasonable dividend; and\n- \u00b7  maintain a long-term credit rating of not less than 'investment grade'.\n\nThe Group monitors and tests its forecast financial position against these criteria and, in general, will undertake hedging activity when necessary to ensure that these objectives are achieved.\n\nOther circumstances that may lead to hedging include the management of exposures relating to trading activities. It is, and has been throughout the period, the Group Treasury policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. Refer to section 3.9 - Risk factors for more information on the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing financial risk.\n\nThe below risks arise in the normal course of the Group's business. Risk information can be found in the following sections:\n\nSection A\n\nCommodity price risk management\n\nPage 115\n\nSection A\n\nForeign exchange risk management\n\nPage 115\n\nSection C\n\nCapital risk management\n\nPage 140\n\nSection C\n\nLiquidity risk management\n\nPage 140\n\nSection C\n\nInterest rate risk management\n\nPage 140\n\nSection D\n\nCredit risk management\n\nPage 144\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\nIn applying the Group's accounting policies, management regularly evaluates judgements, estimates and assumptions based on experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that may have an impact on the Group. All judgements, estimates and assumptions made are believed to be reasonable based on the most current set of circumstances known to management, and actual results may di/ffer. Significant judgements, estimates and assumptions made by management in the preparation of these financial statements are found in the following notes:\n\n| Note A.1   | Revenue from contracts with customers                                          | Page 116   |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Note A.5   | Taxes                                                                          | Page 121   |\n| Note B.2   | Exploration and evaluation                                                     | Page 127   |\n| Note B.3   | Oil and gas properties                                                         | Page 128   |\n| Note B.4   | Impairment of exploration and evaluation,  oil and gas properties and goodwill | Page 130   |\n| Note B.5   | Business combination                                                           | Page 136   |\n| Note B.6   | Goodwill                                                                       | Page 137   |\n| Note B.7   | Significant production and growth asset  acquisitions                          | Page 137   |\n| Note B.8   | Disposal of assets                                                             | Page 138   |\n| Note D.5   | Provisions                                                                     | Page 146   |\n| Note D.6   | Other financial assets and liabilities                                         | Page 148   |\n| Note D.7   | Leases                                                                         | Page 151   |\n| Note E.6   | Joint arrangements                                                             | Page 158   |",

Earnings for the year\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## IN THIS SECTION\n\nThis section addresses financial performance of the Group for the reporting period including, where applicable, the accounting policies applied and the key estimates and judgements made. This section also includes the tax position of the Group for and at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## A.  Earnings for the year\n\nA.1 Segment revenue and expenses\n\nPage 116\n\nA.2  Finance costs\n\nPage 120\n\nA.3  Dividends paid and proposed\n\nPage 120\n\nA.4  Earnings per share\n\nPage 120\n\nA.5  Taxes\n\nPage 121\n\n## KEY FINANCIAL AND CAPITAL RISKS IN THIS SECTION\n\n## Commodity price risk management\n\nThe Group's revenue is exposed to commodity price fluctuations through the sale of hydrocarbons. Commodity price risks are measured by monitoring and stress testing the Group's forecast financial position to sustained periods of low oil and gas prices. This analysis is regularly performed on the Group's portfolio and as required for discrete projects and transactions.\n\nThe Group's management of commodity price risk includes the use of commodity derivatives to hedge its exposure (refer to Note D.6). The hedged exposure includes oil-linked revenue related to produced volumes and revenues derived from trading operations. Commodity derivatives protect the Group against downside price risk within its corporate and trading portfolios.\n\nAs at the reporting date, the Group held commodity hedging financial instruments with a net asset carrying value of $123 million (2022: $557 million net liability) exposed to commodity price risk. An increase in relevant commodity prices of 10% would decrease the instruments' carrying value by $172 million, the e/ffect of which would be recognised within reserves and/or the income statement in accordance with hedge accounting application. A 10% decrease would have the same but opposite e/ffect. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant (including the price on underlying physical exposures).\n\n## Foreign exchange risk management\n\nForeign exchange risk arises from future commitments, financial assets and financial liabilities that are not denominated in US dollars. The majority of the Group's revenue is denominated in US dollars. The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk arising from operating and capital expenditure incurred in currencies other than US dollars, particularly Australian dollars.\n\nThe Group's management of foreign exchange risk relating to capital expenditure includes the use of forward exchange contract derivatives to hedge its exposure (refer to Note D.6).\n\nThe Group entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to fix the Australian dollar to US dollar exchange rate in relation to a portion of the Australian dollar denominated capital expenditure incurred or expected to be incurred under the Scarborough development (refer to Note D.6). Through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts, the Group also hedged its Australian dollar to US dollar exchange rate exposure in relation to the Australian dollar denominated tax payments which have matured.\n\nAs at the reporting date, the Group held hedging foreign currency financial instruments with a net asset carrying value of $8 million (2022: net liability carrying value of $17 million) exposed to foreign exchange risk.\n\nMeasuring the exposure to foreign exchange risk is achieved by regularly monitoring and performing sensitivity analysis on the Group's financial position.\n\nA reasonably possible change in the exchange rate of the US dollar to the Australian dollar (+12%/-12% (2022: +12%/-12%)), with all other variables held constant, would not have a material impact on the Group's equity or the income statement. Refer to Notes C1, C2, D2, D4 and D7 for details of the denominations of cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing liabilities, receivables, payables and lease liabilities held at 31 December 2023.",

Earnings for the year\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## A.1 SEGMENT REVENUE AND EXPENSES\n\n## Operating segment information\n\nThe Group has identified its operating segments based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Chief Executive O/fficer (Chief Operating Decision Maker) in assessing performance and determining the allocation of resources.\n\nThe disclosed operating segments in 2023 remain consistent to 2022. In the prior reporting period, the 2021 amounts were restated to be presented on the same basis.\n\nOperating segments outlined below are identified by management based on the nature and geographical location of the business and venture.\n\n## Australia:\n\nExploration, evaluation, development, production and sale of liquified natural gas, pipeline gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids in Australia.\n\n## International:\n\nExploration, evaluation, development, production and sale of pipeline gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids in international jurisdictions outside of Australia.\n\n## Marketing:\n\nMarketing, Shipping and Trading of Woodside's oil and gas portfolio (including purchased volumes) and optimisation activities attributed to Marketing which generate incremental value.\n\n## Corporate/Other items:\n\nCorporate/Other items comprise primarily corporate nonsegmental items of revenue and expenses and associated assets and liabilities not allocated to operating segments as they are not considered part of the core operations of any segment.\n\n## Customer concentration\n\nThe Group has two major customers which respectively account for 8% and 7% of the Group's external revenue. The sales are generated by the Australia and Marketing operating segments (2022: two major customers; 12% and 9% generated by the Australia and Marketing operating segments and 2021: two major customers; 8% and 6% generated by the Australia operating segment).\n\n## Geographical information\n\n| Geographical  information   | Revenue from external  customers 1   | Revenue from external  customers 1   | Revenue from external  customers 1   | Non-current assets 2   | Non-current assets 2   |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                             | 2023                                 | 2022                                 | 2021                                 | 2023                   | 2022                   |\n|                             | US$m                                 | US$m                                 | US$m                                 | US$m                   | US$m                   |\n| Asia Pacific                | 9,823                                | 12,521                               | 6,342                                | 36,060                 | 36,966                 |\n| Americas                    | 2,564                                | 1,545                                | -                                    | 7,171                  | 7,057                  |\n| Africa                      | -                                    | -                                    | -                                    | 5,295                  | 4,049                  |\n| Europe                      | 1,607                                | 2,751                                | 620                                  | -                      | -                      |\n| Consolidated                | 13,994                               | 16,817                               | 6,962                                | 48,526                 | 48,072                 |\n\n- 1. Revenue is attributable to geographic location based on the location of the customers.\n- 2.  Non-current assets exclude deferred tax of $1,717 million (2022: $1,959 million).\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue is recognised when or as the Group transfers control of products or provides services to a customer at the amount to which the Group expects to be entitled. If the consideration includes a variable component, the Group estimates the amount of the expected consideration receivable. Variable consideration is estimated throughout the contract and is recognised to the extent that it is highly probable a significant reversal will not occur.\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue from sale of hydrocarbons - Revenue from the sale of hydrocarbons is recognised at a point in time when control of the product is transferred to the customer. Revenue from take or pay contracts is recorded as unearned revenue until the product has been drawn by the customer (transfer of control), at which time it is recognised in earnings.\n- \u00b7 Other operating revenue - Revenue earned from LNG processing and other services is recognised over time as the services are rendered.\n\n## Expenses\n\n- \u00b7 Royalties, excise and levies -Royalties, excise and levies are considered to be production-based taxes and are therefore accrued on the basis of the Group's entitlement to physical production.\n- \u00b7 Depreciation and amortisation - Refer to Note B.3.\n- \u00b7 Impairment and impairment reversals - Refer to Note B.4.\n- \u00b7 Leases - Refer to Note D.7.\n- \u00b7 Employee benefits - Refer to Note E.2.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## (a) Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nThe transaction price at the date control passes for sales made subject to provisional pricing periods in oil and condensate contracts is determined with reference to quoted commodity prices.\n\nJudgement is also used to determine if it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur in relation to revenue recognised during open pricing periods in LNG contracts. The Group estimates variable consideration based on available information from contract negotiations and market indicators.",

Earnings for the year\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## A.5  TAXES (CONT.)\n\n## Tax transparency code\n\nWoodside participates in the Australian Board of Taxation's voluntary Tax Transparency Code (TTC). To increase public confidence in the contributions and compliance of corporate taxpayers, the TTC recommends public disclosure of tax information. Part A of the recommended disclosures is addressed within this Taxes note and Part B disclosed within the Sustainability section on our website.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised. The tax rates and laws used to determine the amount are based on those that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period. Income taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity.\n\n## Current taxes\n\nCurrent tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the current year and any adjustment to tax paid in respect of previous years.\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred tax expense represents movements in the temporary di/fferences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated statement of financial position and its tax base.\n\nWith the exception of those noted below, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary di/fferences.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary di/fferences, unused tax losses and tax credits only if it is probable that su/fficient future taxable income will be available to utilise those temporary di/fferences and losses.\n\nDeferred tax is not recognised if the temporary di/fference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that a/ffects neither accounting profit nor the taxable profit.\n\nIn relation to PRRT, the impact of future augmentation on expenditure is included in the determination of future taxable profits when assessing the extent to which a deferred tax asset can be recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## O/ffsetting deferred tax balances\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are o/ffset only if there is a legally enforceable right to o/ffset current tax assets and liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or di/fferent taxable entities that the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. Refer to Notes E.8 and E.9 for detail on the tax consolidated groups.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## (a) Income tax classification\n\nJudgement is required when determining whether a particular tax is an income tax or another type of tax. PRRT is considered, for accounting purposes, to be an income tax. Accounting for deferred tax is applied to income taxes as described above, but is not applied to other types of taxes, e.g. North West Shelf royalties, excise and levies which are recognised in cost of sales in the income statement.\n\n## (b)  Deferred tax asset recognition\n\nThe Group has two separate USA Tax Consolidation Groups (USA TCG) as at 31 December 2023.\n\nIncome tax losses and credits: Deferred tax assets (DTAs) relating to carry forward unused tax losses and credits arising from the USA TCG of $1,248 million (2022: $1,371 million) and $333 million (2022: $93 million) arising from countries other than Australia and the USA have been recognised. The Group has determined that it is probable that su/fficient future taxable income will be available to utilise those losses and credits within those countries. Refer to Note E.9(a) for details of tax consolidated groups.\n\nDTAs relating to carry forward unused tax losses and credits of $232 million (2022: $250 million) from the USA TCG, $189 million (2022: $146 million) from USA entities outside of the USA TCG and $763 million (2022: $1,061 million) from countries other than Australia and the USA have not been recognised as it is not currently probable that the losses and credits will be utilised based on current planned activities in those countries.\n\nAs a result of the FID to develop the Trion resource in 2023, the Group has recognised deferred tax assets of $319 million.\n\nPRRT: The recoverability of PRRT deferred tax assets is primarily assessed with regard to future oil price assumptions impacting forecast future taxable profits. During the year ended 31 December 2023, the Group reduced the Pluto PRRT DTA by $637 million ($446 million post-tax) on the basis of future taxable profits not being available to utilise the deductible expenditure. This is primarily driven by decreases in forecast pricing assumptions and actual pricing realised during the year ended 31 December 2023. In determining the amount of DTA that is considered probable and eligible for recognition, forecast future taxable profits are risk-adjusted where appropriate by a market premium risk rate to reflect uncertainty inherent in long-term forecasts. A long-term bond rate of 3.2% (31 December 2022: 3.2%) was used for the purposes of augmentation.\n\nCertain deferred tax assets on deductible temporary di/fferences have not been recognised on the basis that deductions from future augmentation of the recognised deductible temporary di/fference will be su/fficient to o/ffset future taxable profits. $7,428 million (2022: $6,523 million) relates to the North West Shelf Project, $872 million (2022: $189 million) relates to remaining Pluto quarantined exploration expenditure and $758 million (2022: $831 million) relates to Wheatstone. A long-term bond rate of 3.2% (31 December 2022: 3.2%) was used for the purposes of augmentation.\n\nHad an alternative approach been used to assess recovery of the deferred tax assets, whereby future augmentation was not included in the assessment, additional deferred tax assets would be recognised, with a corresponding benefit to tax expense. It was determined that the approach adopted provides the most meaningful information on the implications of the PRRT regime, whilst ensuring compliance with AASB 112/IAS 12 Income Taxes .",

(c)  Uncertain tax positions\n\nThe Group has tax matters, litigation and other claims, for which the timing of resolution and potential economic outflows are uncertain. Where the Group assesses an outcome for any tax matter, litigation or other claim as more likely than not to be accepted by the relevant tax authority, the position is adopted in the reported tax balances.\n\nBecause of the complexity of some of these positions, the ultimate outcome may di/ffer from the current estimate of the position. These di/fferences will be reflected as increases or decreases to tax expense in the period in which new information is available. Tax matters without a probable economic outflow and/or presently cannot be measured reliably are contingent liabilities and disclosed in Note E.1 Contingent liabilities and assets.",

All exploration and evaluation expenditure, including general permit activity, geological and geophysical costs and new venture activity costs, is expensed as incurred except for the following:\n\n- \u00b7  where the expenditure relates to an exploration discovery for which the assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable hydrocarbons is not yet complete; or\n- \u00b7  where the expenditure is expected to be recouped through successful exploitation of the area of interest, or alternatively, by its sale.\n\nThe costs of acquiring interests in new exploration and evaluation licences are capitalised. The costs of drilling exploration wells are initially capitalised pending the results of the well.\n\nCosts are expensed where the well does not result in the successful discovery of economically recoverable hydrocarbons and the recognition of an area of interest.\n\nSubsequent to the recognition of an area of interest, all further evaluation costs relating to that area of interest are capitalised. Upon approval for the commercial development of an area of interest, accumulated expenditure for the area of interest is transferred to oil and gas properties.\n\nIn the consolidated statement of cash flows, those cash flows associated with capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure, including unsuccessful wells, are classified as cash flows used in investing activities.\n\n## Exploration commitments\n\nThe Group has exploration expenditure obligations which are contracted for, but not provided for in the financial statements. These obligations may be varied from time to time and are expected to be fulfilled in the normal course of the Group's operations.\n\n## Impairment\n\nRefer to Note B.4 for details on impairment, including any write-o/ffs.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements (a) Area of interest\n\nTypically, an area of interest (AOI) is defined by the Group as an individual geographical area whereby the presence of hydrocarbons is considered favourable or proved to exist. The Group has established criteria to recognise and maintain an AOI.\n\n## (b) Transfer to projects in development\n\nDevelopment activities commence after project sanctioning by the appropriate level of management. Judgement is applied by management in determining when the project is technically feasible and economically viable to transfer to projects in development.",

Production and growth assets\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## B.3  OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES (CONT.)\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nOil and gas properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. Oil and gas properties include the costs to acquire, construct, install or complete production and infrastructure facilities such as pipelines and platforms, capitalised borrowing costs, transferred exploration and evaluation assets, development wells and the estimated cost of dismantling and restoration.\n\nSubsequent capital costs, including major maintenance, are included in the asset's carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be reliably measured.\n\n## Depreciation and amortisation\n\nOil and gas properties are depreciated to their estimated residual values at rates based on their expected useful lives.\n\nUpstream oil and conventional gas assets have been depreciated using the unit of production basis over proved reserves (2022: proved plus probable, except for certain assets considered late life). Upstream LNG assets are depreciated over proved plus probable reserves. Multi-product assets are assessed on a case-by-case basis and aligned to the most appropriate representation of useful life.\n\nThe depreciable amount for the unit of production basis excludes future development costs necessary to bring probable reserves into production. Downstream assets (primarily onshore plant and equipment) are depreciated using a straight-line basis over the lesser of useful life and the life of proved plus probable reserves. On a straight-line basis the assets have an estimated useful life of 5-50 years.\n\nAll other items of oil and gas properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over their useful life. They are depreciated as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Buildings - 24-50 years;\n- \u00b7  Plant and equipment - 2-40 years; and\n- \u00b7  Land is not depreciated.\n\n## Impairment\n\nRefer to Note B.4 for details on impairment.\n\n## Capital commitments\n\nThe Group has capital expenditure commitments contracted for, but not provided for in the financial statements, of $4,245 million as at 31 December 2023 (revised 20221: $6,469 million). Capital expenditure commitments relate predominantly to the Scarborough and Sangomar projects.\n\n- 1. The 2022 Financial Statements disclosed capital expenditure commitments of $7,762 million which duplicated certain amounts post-merger. This has now been revised to reflect the Group's share of commitments.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## (a) Reserves\n\nThe estimation of reserves requires significant management judgement and interpretation of complex geological and geophysical models in order to make an assessment of the size, shape, depth and quality of reservoirs, and their anticipated recoveries.\n\nEstimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used to calculate depreciation and amortisation charges for the Group's oil and gas properties. Judgement is used in determining the economic reserve base applied to each asset.\n\nEstimates are reviewed at least annually or when there are changes in the economic circumstances impacting specific assets or asset groups. These changes may impact depreciation, asset carrying values, restoration provisions and deferred tax balances. If reserves estimates are revised downwards, earnings could be a/ffected by higher depreciation expense or an immediate write-down of the asset's carrying value.\n\n## (b) Depreciation and amortisation\n\nJudgement is required to determine when assets are available for use to commence depreciation and amortisation. Depreciation and amortisation generally commences on first production.\n\n## (c)  Change in depreciation methodology and asset useful lives\n\nThe Group has undertaken a review of the depreciation methodology and asset useful lives for oil and gas properties in accordance with its accounting policies and the accounting standards, considering the scale and diversity of the postmerger portfolio.\n\nIn assessing useful lives of certain oil and gas assets, these have been determined with reference to either their proved (1P) or proved plus probable (2P) reserves, which is then used in the units of production depreciation calculation.\n\nFrom 1 January 2023, upstream oil and conventional gas assets have been depreciated over proved reserves (previously proved plus probable, except for certain assets considered late life). Upstream LNG assets have continued to be depreciated over proved plus probable reserves. Multi-product assets are assessed on a case-by-case basis and aligned to the most appropriate representation of useful life.\n\nThe changes in depreciation methodology and asset useful lives have been applied from 1 January 2023, resulting in an increase in depreciation expense of $416 million for the year ended 31 December 2023.",

Production and growth assets\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## B.4   IMPAIRMENT OF EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION, OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES AND GOODWILL\n\n## Exploration and evaluation\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nThe recoverability of the carrying amount of exploration and evaluation assets is dependent on successful development and commercial exploitation, or alternatively sale of the respective AOI.\n\nEach AOI is reviewed half-yearly to determine whether economic quantities of hydrocarbons have been found, or whether further exploration and evaluation work is underway or planned to support continued carry forward of capitalised costs. Where a potential impairment is indicated for an AOI, an assessment is performed using a fair value less costs to dispose (FVLCD) method to determine its recoverable amount. Upon approval for commercial development, exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment before they are transferred to oil and gas properties.\n\n## Impairment calculations\n\nIf the carrying amount of an AOI exceeds its recoverable amount, the AOI is written down to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Oil and gas properties Impairment testing\n\nThe carrying amounts of oil and gas properties are assessed halfyearly to determine whether there is an indicator of impairment or impairment reversal for those assets which have previously been impaired. Indicators of impairment and impairment reversals include changes in reserves, expected future sales prices or costs.\n\nOil and gas properties are assessed for impairment indicators and impairments on a cash-generating unit (CGU) basis. CGUs are determined as o/ffshore and onshore facilities, infrastructure and associated oil and/or gas fields.\n\nIf there is an indicator of impairment or impairment reversal for a CGU, its recoverable amount is calculated and compared with the CGU's carrying value (refer to impairment calculations below).\n\n## Goodwill\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Impairment of goodwill is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU to which the goodwill relates and comparing it with its carrying value, which includes deferred taxes (refer to impairment calculations below and Note B.5).\n\nWhen part of an operation is disposed of, any goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation in determining the gain or loss on disposal.\n\n## Goodwill and oil and gas impairment calculations\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is determined as the higher of its value in use (VIU) and FVLCD.\n\nVIU is determined by estimating future cash flows after taking into account the risks specific to the asset and discounting to present value using an appropriate discount rate.\n\nFVLCD is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants and does not reflect the e/ffects of factors that may be specific to the Group. In determining FVLCD, recent market transactions are considered. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model, such as discounted cash flow techniques, is applied on a post-tax basis using an appropriate discount rate and estimates are made about the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or CGU.\n\nIf the carrying amount of an asset or CGU, including any allocated goodwill, exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset or CGU is written down to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement. Any impairment losses are first allocated to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated, with the remaining impairment losses allocated to the relevant assets.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its carrying amount, and that asset has previously been impaired, the impairment is reversed. The carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the carrying amount does not exceed the value that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment had been recognised. Impairments of goodwill are not reversed.",

The carrying amount of each CGU includes all assets allocated to the respective CGU. Refer to key estimates and judgements for further details.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nRecoverable amount valuations are sensitive to changes in certain key accounting estimates and judgements (refer to key estimates and judgements for further details). Reasonably possible changes to these key assumptions are set out below:\n\n- \u00b7  Post-tax discount rate - plus or minus 1.0% (representing a change of 100 basis points)\n- \u00b7  Commodity pricing - plus or minus 10%\n- \u00b7   Foreign exchange (FX) rate - plus or minus 12%\n- \u00b7  Production volumes - plus or minus 4%\n\nManagement's analysis on the impact of reasonably possible changes to these assumptions on recoverable amounts is detailed below.\n\n## CGUs with impairment or impairment reversals\n\nChanges in the following key assumptions have been estimated to result in a higher or lower carrying amount1 than what was determined as at 31 December 2023:\n\n|            | Sensitivity (US$m)2      | Sensitivity (US$m)2      | Sensitivity (US$m)2        | Sensitivity (US$m)2        | Sensitivity (US$m)2   | Sensitivity (US$m)2   | Sensitivity (US$m)2   | Sensitivity (US$m)2   |\n|------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| CGU        | Discount rate  increase3 | Discount rate  decrease3 | Commodity  price increase3 | Commodity  price decrease3 | FX increase3          | FX decrease3          | Production  increase3 | Production  decrease3 |\n| Shenzi     | (67)                     | 71                       | 359                        | (359)                      | N/A                   | N/A                   | 47                    | (46)                  |\n| Wheatstone | (88)                     | 94                       | 431                        | (370)                      | (36)                  | 87                    | 90                    | (42)                  |\n\nA change in any of the above assumptions would likely have an impact on other assumptions which, when considered together, may o/ffset. This does not incorporate decisions management may take in order to mitigate the change in assumptions.\n\n## CGUs with goodwill\n\nThe valuation of CGUs with goodwill are most sensitive to changes in commodity prices and discount rates. Reasonably possible changes in these estimates which could result in the estimated recoverable amount being equal to the carrying amount, assuming all other variables are held constant, are as follows:\n\n|                        | CGU               | Commodity price 1 % change   | Nominal discount rate (absolute terms)   |\n|------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Oil and gas properties | Pluto-Scarborough | N/A2                         | N/A2                                     |\n| Oil and gas properties | NWS Gas           | N/A2                         | N/A2                                     |\n| Oil and gas properties | Atlantis          | (5%)                         | N/A2                                     |\n\nA change in any of the above assumptions would have an impact on other assumptions which when considered together may o/ffset. This does not incorporate decisions management may take in order to mitigate the change in assumptions. Management considers there to be no reasonably possible changes in production volumes, carbon prices or foreign exchange rates that would, in isolation, result in the estimated recoverable amount being equal to the carrying amount. Analysis of key assumptions which could result in the carrying value to equal the recoverable value provides a basis to assess the magnitude of a reasonably possible change to the carrying amounts of respective CGUs.",

This represents less than one percent of net assets as at 31 December 2022.\n\n## Recognised impairment and impairment reversals\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group assessed each AOI and CGU to determine whether an indicator of impairment or impairment reversal existed. The Group identified the following indicators of impairment reversals:\n\n- \u00b7  Wheatstone CGU - revision in short-term and long-term LNG price assumptions and updated cost and production profiles.\n\nFor CGUs where goodwill has been allocated, no impairment was recognised as the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the CGU.\n\nAn impairment reversal was recognised for Wheatstone (refer to Note A.1), with results as follows:\n\n|           |            |                      | Impairment reversal Oil and gas properties   | Impairment reversal Oil and gas properties   | Impairment reversal Oil and gas properties   | Impairment reversal Oil and gas properties   |\n|-----------|------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n|           |            | Recoverable   amount | Land and   buildings                         | Transferred  exploration and   evaluation    | Plant and   equipment                        | Total                                        |\n| Segment   | CGU        | US$m                 | US$m                                         | US$m                                         | US$m                                         | US$m                                         |\n| Australia | Wheatstone | 3,456                | 87                                           | 30                                           | 783                                          | 900                                          |\n\nRecoverable amounts have been determined using the FVLCD method using discounted cash flow projections, classified as Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy. The carrying amount of each CGU includes all assets allocated to the respective CGU. Refer to key estimates and judgements for further details.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nRecoverable amount valuations are sensitive to changes in certain key accounting estimates and judgements (refer to key estimates and judgements for further details). Reasonably possible changes to these key assumptions are set out below:\n\n- \u00b7  Post tax discount rate - plus or minus 1.5% (representing a change of 150 basis points)\n- \u00b7  Commodity pricing - plus or minus 10%\n- \u00b7  Foreign exchange (FX) rate - plus or minus 12%\n- \u00b7  Production volumes - plus or minus 4%\n\nManagement's analysis on the impact of reasonably possible changes to these assumptions on recoverable amounts is detailed below.",

This does not incorporate decisions management may take in order to mitigate the change in assumptions.\n\n## CGUs with goodwill\n\nThe valuation of CGUs with goodwill are most sensitive to changes in commodity prices and discount rates. Reasonably possible changes in these estimates which could result in the estimated recoverable amount being equal to the carrying amount, assuming all other variables are held constant, are as follows:\n\n|                        | CGU               | Commodity price 1 % change   | Nominal discount rate (absolute terms)   |\n|------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Oil and gas properties | Pluto-Scarborough | N/A2                         | N/A2                                     |\n| Oil and gas properties | NWS Gas           | N/A2                         | N/A2                                     |\n| Oil and gas properties | Shenzi            | (7%)                         | N/A2                                     |\n| Oil and gas properties | Atlantis          | (2%)                         | 10%                                      |\n\nA change in any of the above assumptions would have an impact on other assumptions which when considered together may o/ffset. This does not incorporate decisions management may take in order to mitigate the change in assumptions. Management considers there to be no reasonably possible changes in production volumes, carbon prices or foreign exchange rates that would, in isolation, result in the estimated recoverable amount being equal to the carrying amount. Analysis of key assumptions which could result in the carrying value to equal the recoverable value provides a basis to assess the magnitude of a reasonable possible change to the carrying amounts of respective CGUs.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements (a) CGU determination\n\nIdentification of a CGU requires management judgement. Management has determined CGUs based on the smallest group of assets that generate significant cash inflows that are independent from other assets or groups of assets.\n\n## (b) Allocation of goodwill\n\nAllocation of goodwill to the relevant CGUs requires management judgement. The goodwill arising from the merger has been allocated to relevant CGUs which are expected to benefit from the expected synergies as a result of the merger.\n\n## (c)  Recoverable amount calculation key assumptions\n\nIn determining the recoverable amount of CGUs, estimates are made regarding the present value of future cash flows when determining the FVLCD. These estimates require significant management judgement and are subject to risk and uncertainty, and hence changes in economic conditions can also a/ffect the assumptions used and the rates used to discount future cash flow estimates.\n\nThe basis for each estimate used to determine recoverable amounts as at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 is set out below:\n\n- \u00b7  Resource estimates - 2P and a portion of 2C reserves (where applicable) for oil and gas properties. The reserves are as disclosed in the Reserves and Resources Statement in the 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 Annual Reports.\n- \u00b7  Inflation rate - an inflation rate of 2.0% (2022: 2.0%) has been applied for US based assets and 2.5% (2022: 2.5%) for Australian based assets.\n- \u00b7  Foreign exchange rates - a rate of $0.75 (2022: $0.75) US$:AU$ is based on management's view of long-term exchange rates.",

Production and growth assets\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## B.4   IMPAIRMENT OF EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION, OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES AND GOODWILL (CONT.)\n\n## Key estimates and judgements (cont.)\n\n## (c)  Recoverable amount calculation key assumptions (cont.)\n\n- \u00b7  Discount rates - a range of post-tax discount rates between 8.5% and 10.5% (2022: 8% and 11.5%) for CGUs has been applied. The discount rate reflects an assessment of the risks specific to the asset.\n- \u00b7  Carbon pricing - a long-term price of US$80/tonne (2022: US$80/tonne) of emissions (real terms 2022) is based on management's assumptions on carbon cost pricing and incorporates an evaluation of climate risk. This is applicable to Australian emissions that exceed facility-specific baselines in accordance with Australian regulations, as well as global emissions that exceed voluntary corporate net emissions targets. Woodside continues to monitor the uncertainty around climate change risks and will revise carbon pricing assumptions accordingly. Refer to Climate change and energy transition section within the basis of preparation for further information.\n- \u00b7  LNG price - the majority of LNG sales contracts are linked to an oil price marker and therefore dependent on oil price assumptions. LNG sold into spot markets is typically based on a gas-hub linked price (for example the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) or JKM) and therefore these pricing assumptions are also of relevance in forecasting future revenues.\n- \u00b7  Brent oil prices - derived from long-term views of global supply and demand, building upon past experience of the industry and consistent with external sources. Prices are adjusted for premiums and discounts based on the nature and quality of the product. Brent oil price estimates have considered the risk of climate policies along with other factors such as industry investment and cost trends. There is significant uncertainty\n\naround how society will respond to the climate challenge; Woodside's pricing assumptions reflect a 'best estimate' scenario in which global governments pursue decarbonisation goals as well as other goals such as energy security and economic development. As with carbon pricing, Woodside continues to monitor this uncertainty and will revise its oil pricing assumptions accordingly in its transition to a lower carbon economy. Further information on climate change risk is provided in the Climate change and energy transition section within the basis of preparation.

Production and growth assets\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## B.5  BUSINESS COMBINATION\n\n## BHP Petroleum merger\n\nRefer to the 2022 Financial Statements for details of the BHPP merger. Except for changes noted below, the disclosures are consistent with Note B.5 of the 2022 Financial Statements.\n\nOn 1 June 2022, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of BHP Petroleum International Pty Ltd (subsequently renamed Woodside Energy Global Holdings Pty Ltd), which held BHP Group's (BHP) oil and gas business. In exchange, the Group issued 914,768,948 new Woodside shares to BHP as part of the merger consideration. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination with an acquisition date of 1 June 2022. The Group had 12 months from the acquisition date to make adjustments to the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and the resultant value of goodwill. As at 1 June 2023, the Group finalised the purchase price allocation which has resulted in goodwill of $4,669 million, a net increase of $55 million from the provisional amount reported at 31 December 2022.\n\nDetails of the purchase consideration and the fair value of goodwill, identifiable assets and liabilities of BHPP acquired are as follows:\n\n| Fair value of net identifiable assets and goodwill arising on  acquisition date   | US$m    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                                         | 399     |\n| Receivables                                                                       | 1,164   |\n| Inventories                                                                       | 295     |\n| Investments accounted for using the equity method                                 | 267     |\n| Other financial assets                                                            | 59      |\n| Other assets                                                                      | 284     |\n| Exploration and evaluation assets                                                 | 180     |\n| Oil and gas properties                                                            | 19,353  |\n| Lease assets                                                                      | 142     |\n| Payables                                                                          | (1,035) |\n| Provisions                                                                        | (4,827) |\n| Tax payable                                                                       | (365)   |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                                          | (653)   |\n| Lease liabilities                                                                 | (268)   |\n| Other liabilities                                                                 | (1,054) |\n| Net identifiable assets acquired                                                  | 13,941  |\n| Goodwill arising on acquisition                                                   | 4,669   |\n| Purchase consideration                                                            | 18,610  |\n\n| Purchase consideration                    | US$m   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Shares issued, at fair value              | 19,265 |\n| Other reserves (share replacement awards) | 18     |\n| Locked box payment received1              | (683)  |\n| Adjustments to locked box payment         | 10     |\n| Total purchase consideration              | 18,610 |\n\n| Analysis of cash flows on acquisition   | US$m   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|\n| Cash acquired on acquisition            | 399    |\n| Locked box payment received             | 683    |\n| Net cash flow on acquisition            | 1,082  |\n\n## Shares issued, at fair value\n\nThe fair value of 914,768,948 shares issued as part of the consideration paid to BHP was $19,265 million. This was based on the published share price on 1 June 2022 of US$21.06 per share.\n\n## Locked box payment received\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022, the Group received $683 million as part of the merger consideration which includes the locked box payment of $1,513 million representing the positive net cash flow generated by BHPP assets from the e/ffective date of the transaction to completion date o/ffset by the notional dividend distribution of $830 million paid to BHP. The initial purchase consideration was subsequently adjusted by $10 million against the locked box payment received.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising from the acquisition has been recognised as the excess of consideration paid above the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the business combination. $2,035 million of the goodwill arises from the deferred tax liability recognised on acquisition as a consequence of asset tax bases received in the merger being lower than the fair value of the assets acquired. The remaining goodwill of $2,634 million reflects the value expected to be generated from the Pluto-Scarborough CGU as a result of the merger. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## (a) Fair value determination for net assets acquired\n\nJudgement is required to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, which can have a material impact on resultant goodwill. This includes the use of a cash flow model to estimate the expected future cash flows of the oil and gas assets acquired, based on reserves and resources at acquisition date and the discount rate used. The expected future cash flows are based on estimates of future production, commodity and carbon prices, operating costs, and forecast capital expenditures at acquisition date.\n\nRestoration provisions require judgemental assumptions regarding removal date, environmental legislation and regulations and the extent of restoration activities required in determining the cost estimate.\n\nCarry forward tax losses are recognised only if it is probable that su/fficient future taxable income will be available to utilise the losses.",

For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's CGUs or groups of CGUs no larger than an operating segment that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.\n\nWhere goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal.\n\nGoodwill is not amortised but will be assessed at least annually for impairment and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## (a) Goodwill allocation\n\nJudgement is required in the allocation of goodwill to the Group's CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Refer to Note B.4 for the details of the goodwill allocation.\n\n## B.7  SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION AND GROWTH ASSET ACQUISITIONS\n\n## Sangomar - Acquisition from FAR Senegal RSSD SA\n\nOn 7 July 2021, Woodside completed the acquisition of FAR Senegal RSSD SA's interest in the RSSD Joint Venture (13.67% interest in the Sangomar exploitation area and 15% interest in the remaining RSSD evaluation area), for an aggregate purchase price of $212 million. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition.\n\nAdditional payments of up to $55 million are contingent on future commodity prices and timing of first oil. The contingent payments terminate on the earliest of 31 December 2027, three years from first oil being sold, and a total contingent payment of $55 million being reached.\n\nWith first oil in Sangomar targeted in mid-2024, the Group has recognised the additional payments as a provision for the year ended 31 December 2023. For the years ended 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021, the contingent payments were accounted for as contingent liabilities in accordance with the Group's accounting policies.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, Woodside held an 82% interest in the Sangomar exploitation area (2020: 68.33%) and a 90% interest in the remaining RSSD evaluation area (2020: 75%).\n\n## Assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n\nThe identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as at the date of the acquisition inclusive of transaction costs are:\n\n|                                              | US$m   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Oil and gas properties                       | 205    |\n| Exploration and evaluation                   | 7      |\n| Cash acquired                                | 3      |\n| Payables                                     | (13)   |\n| Net other assets and liabilities assumed     | 10     |\n| Total identifiable net assets at acquisition | 212    |\n\n## Cash flows on acquisition\n\n|                                  | US$m   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|\n| Purchase cash consideration      | 212    |\n| Transaction costs                | -      |\n| Total purchase consideration     | 212    |\n| Net cash outflows on acquisition | 212    |\n\n## Key estimates and judgements (a) Nature of acquisition\n\nJudgement was required to determine if the transaction was the acquisition of an asset or a business combination. The Sangomar project was in the early phase of development and a substantive process that had the ability to convert inputs to outputs was not present and therefore the acquisition in 2021 was treated as an asset acquisition.",

Production and growth assets\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## B.8  DISPOSAL OF ASSETS\n\n## (a) Sell-down of Scarborough Joint Venture\n\nOn 8 August 2023 the Group entered into a sale and purchase agreement with LNG Japan for the sale of a 10% non-operating participating interest in the Scarborough Joint Venture.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group has reclassified $823 million of assets, being the carrying value of the 10% interest in the Scarborough Joint Venture within the Australia segment, to assets held for sale. Liabilities of $94 million have been reclassified to liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale. No impairment of assets occurred on reclassification to held for sale.\n\nThe following assets and liabilities were reclassified as held for sale as at 31 December 2023:\n\n|                                                                 | US$m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Assets classified as held for sale                              |        |\n| Inventories                                                     | 4      |\n| Oil and gas properties                                          | 618    |\n| Lease assets                                                    | 3      |\n| Goodwill                                                        | 197    |\n| Other assets                                                    | 1      |\n| Total assets held for sale                                      | 823    |\n| Liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale       |        |\n| Payables                                                        | (26)   |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                        | (61)   |\n| Lease liabilities                                               | (7)    |\n| Total liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale | (94)   |\n\nThe purchase price is $500 million, subject to adjustments. The total proceeds from the sale are expected to exceed the net carrying value of the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale as LNG Japan will reimburse the Group for its share of expenditure for the Scarborough project from the e/ffective date of 1 January 2022. Delays to the first cargo or cost overruns in specific circumstances may result in payments by Woodside to LNG Japan of up to a maximum of $50 million. The transaction is expected to complete in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nCompletion of the transaction is subject to the remaining Western Australian Government approvals.\n\nIn addition to the above, a reduction in the deferred tax liability due to the change to a held for sale basis resulted in a tax benefit of $78 million being recognised for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nThe Group classifies assets and liabilities as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to dispose. Costs to dispose are the incremental costs directly attributable to the sale, excluding finance costs and income tax expense.\n\nThe criteria for held for sale classification are considered met only when the sale is highly probable, and the asset is available for sale in its present condition. Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn. Management must be committed to the sale, expected within one year from the date of the classification.\n\nAssets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the statement of financial position.\n\n## Assets and liabilities reclassified as held for sale\n\nIn addition to the assets and liabilities reclassified as held for sale for the Scarborough Joint Venture, the Group has reclassified $3 million for the North West Shelf vessels to assets held for sale. There are no recognised liabilities associated with the North West Shelf vessels.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## (a) Goodwill allocation\n\nIn accordance with AASB 136/IAS 36 Impairment of assets , if goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and the entity disposes of an operation within that unit, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed shall be included in the carrying value of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal and measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the CGU retained.\n\nThe Pluto-Scarborough CGU includes goodwill allocated from the merger with BHPP in 2022. Judgement is required to determine the amount of goodwill allocated to the 10% participating interest in the Scarborough assets being disposed.\n\nThe Group used fair value measurements of Pluto and Scarborough assets within the CGU as basis to allocate goodwill between the Pluto and Scarborough assets. The goodwill associated with the participating interest of the Scarborough assets being disposed of was determined based on the percentage participating interest disposed of in proportion to the participating interest being retained.",

Production and growth assets\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## B.8 DISPOSAL OF ASSETS (CONT.)\n\n## (b) Sell-down of Train 2\n\nOn 15 November 2021 the Group entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) for the sale of a 49% non-operating participating interest in the Pluto Train 2 Joint Venture. As at 31 December 2021, the Group reclassified the carrying value of the 49% interest in the Pluto Train 2 assets to assets held for sale. There were no recognised liabilities associated with the assets held for sale.\n\nThe transaction completed on 18 January 2022, reducing the Group's participating interest from 100% to 51%. The Group recognised an initial pre-tax gain on sale of $427 million for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\nThe arrangements require GIP to fund its 49% share of capital expenditure from 1 October 2021 and an additional amount of construction capital expenditure of $822 million on behalf of the Group. If the total capital expenditure incurred is less than $5,800 million, GIP will pay Woodside an additional amount equal to 49% of the under-spend. In the event of a cost overrun, Woodside will fund up to $822 million of GIP's share of the overrun. Delays to the expected start-up of production will result in payments by Woodside to GIP in certain circumstances. The arrangements include provisions for GIP to be compensated for exposure to additional Scope 1 emissions liabilities above agreed baselines, and to sell its 49% interest back to Woodside if the status of key regulatory approvals materially changes.\n\nGiven judgement was used to determine the consideration received, the Group is required to remeasure the variable consideration at each reporting period. As at 31 December 2023, the variable consideration has been reassessed with no revaluation gain or loss being recognised (2022: $71 million revaluation gain recognised as other income, with a corresponding reduction to other liabilities). The fair value of the remaining unpaid funding from GIP has been netted against the other liabilities and will be recognised as oil and gas properties in the future.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## (a) Sell-down of Train 2\n\nGiven the arrangements include provisions for GIP to sell its 49% interest back to Woodside if the status of key regulatory environmental approvals materially changes and the requirement for Woodside to fund up to $822 million of GIP's share in the event of a cost overrun, judgement is required to determine if the sell-down of Train 2 constitutes a sale and if a portion of the transaction price should be considered as variable consideration.\n\nJudgement was used to determine that the sell-down of Train 2 constituted a sale given the various conditions included in the sale and purchase agreement. The Group determined that a sale occurred as control of the 49% interest was passed to GIP on completion date. Control is determined as the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of, the associated interest.\n\nJudgement was used to determine if it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur in relation to the consideration received. The Group estimated the variable consideration based on the construction capital expenditure cost profile, the development schedule, and assessing the probability and impact of any event which may result in a significant reversal. The constraining estimates of variable consideration have been applied resulting in the initial pre-tax gain on sale of $427 million for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\nThe variable consideration is remeasured at each reporting period with any changes recognised through the consolidated income statement. As at 31 December 2023, the variable consideration has been reassessed with no revaluation gain or loss being recognised (2022: $71 million revaluation gain recognised as other income).",

Debt and capital\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## IN THIS SECTION\n\nThis section addresses cash, debt and the capital position of the Group at the end of the reporting period including, where applicable, the accounting policies applied and the key estimates and judgements made.\n\n## C.

Capital management is undertaken to ensure that a secure, cost-e/ffective and flexible supply of funds is available to meet the Group's operating and capital expenditure requirements. A stable capital base is maintained from which the Group can pursue its growth aspirations, whilst maintaining a flexible capital structure that allows access to a range of debt and equity markets to both draw upon and repay capital.\n\nThe Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2003 for activation as required to fund future growth. The DRP was reactivated in 2019 and suspended by the Board of Directors on 27 February 2023.\n\nA range of financial metrics are monitored, including gearing and cash flow leverage, and Treasury policy breaches and exceptions.\n\n## Liquidity risk management\n\nLiquidity risk arises from the financial liabilities of the Group and the Group's subsequent ability to meet its obligations to repay financial liabilities as and when they fall due. The liquidity position of the Group is managed to ensure su/fficient liquid funds are available to meet its financial commitments in a timely and cost-e/ffective manner.\n\nThe Group's liquidity is continually reviewed, including cash flow forecasts to determine the forecast liquidity position and maintain appropriate liquidity levels. At 31 December 2023, the Group had a total of $7,790 million (2022: $10,239 million) of available undrawn facilities and cash at its disposal. The maturity profile of interest-bearing liabilities is disclosed in Note C.2, trade and other payables are disclosed in Note D.4 and lease liabilities are disclosed in Note D.7. Financing facilities available to the Group are disclosed in Note C.2.\n\n## Interest rate risk management\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the Group's financial position will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.\n\nThe Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to financial instruments with floating interest rates including long-term debt obligations, cash and short-term deposits. The Group manages its interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To manage the ratio of fixed rate debt to floating rate debt, the Group may enter into interest rate swaps. The Group holds interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the $600 million syndicated facility. Refer to Notes C.2 and D.6 for further details.\n\nAt the reporting date, the Group was exposed to various benchmark interest rates that were not designated in cash flow hedges, primarily through $1,605 million (2022: $6,143 million) on cash and cash equivalents, nil (2022: $83 million) on interest-bearing liabilities (excluding transaction costs), nil (2022: $167 million) of other financial assets and nil (2022: $5 million) on cross-currency interest rate swaps.\n\nA reasonably possible change in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) (+2.0%/-2.0% (2022: USD London Interbank O/ffered Rate (USD LIBOR) +1.5%/-1.5%)), with all variables held constant, would not have a material impact on the Group's equity or the income statement in the current period.\n\nDuring the period, the Group has completed the transition of its financial liabilities from USD LIBOR to SOFR. The transition during the year ended 31 December 2023 did not result in a material impact to the Group.",

Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any di/fference between the proceeds received and the redemption amount is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the e/ffective interest method.\n\nBorrowings designated as a hedged item are measured at amortised cost adjusted to record changes in the fair value of risks that are being hedged in fair value hedges. The changes in\n\nthe fair value risks of the hedged item resulted in a loss of $16 million being recorded (2022: gain of $7 million), and a loss of $6 million being recorded on the hedging instrument (2022: loss of $7 million).\n\nAll bonds, notes and facilities are subject to various covenants and negative pledges restricting future secured borrowings, subject to a number of permitted lien exceptions. Neither the covenants nor the negative pledges have been breached at any time during the reporting period.",

Debt and capital\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## C.2   INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES AND FINANCING FACILITIES (CONT.)\n\n## Fair value\n\nThe carrying amount of interest-bearing liabilities approximates their fair value, with the exception of the Group's unsecured bonds and the medium term notes. The unsecured bonds have a carrying amount of $4,087 million (2022: $4,084 million) and a fair value of $3,936 million (2022: $3,852 million). The medium term notes have a carrying amount of $200 million (2022: $385 million) and a fair value of $188 million (2022: $372 million). Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date and classified as Level 1 on the fair value hierarchy. Where these cash flows are in a foreign currency, the present value is converted to US dollars at the foreign exchange spot rate prevailing at the reporting date. The Group's repayment obligations remain unchanged.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nAll interest-bearing liabilities are denominated in US dollars, excluding the CHF175 million medium term note which was settled in December 2023.\n\n## Maturity profile of interest-bearing liabilities\n\nThe table below presents the contractual undiscounted cash flows associated with the Group's interest-bearing liabilities, representing principal and interest. The figures will not necessarily reconcile with the amounts disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n|                     | 2023 US$m   | 2022 US$m   |\n|---------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Due for payment in: |             |             |\n| 1 year or less      | 212         | 483         |\n| 1-2 years           | 1,181       | 206         |\n| 2-3 years           | 962         | 1,181       |\n| 3-4 years           | 907         | 962         |\n| 4-5 years           | 883         | 908         |\n| More than 5 years   | 1,534       | 2,416       |\n|                     | 5,679       | 6,156       |\n\nAmounts exclude transaction costs.\n\n## Liquidity facilities\n\nIn October 2023, the Group obtained 12-month liquidity facilities to the value of $1,800 million in aggregate. Interest rates are based on daily SOFR plus credit adjustment spread (CAS) and margins, fixed at the commencement of the drawdown period.\n\n## Bilateral facilities\n\nThe Group has 15 bilateral loan facilities totalling $2,250 million (2022: 14 bilateral loan facilities totalling $2,050 million). Details of bilateral loan facilities at the reporting date are as follows:\n\n|   Number of  facilities | Term (years)    | Currency   | Extension option   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|------------|--------------------|\n|                       1 | 5-6             | US$        | Evergreen          |\n|                       5 | 4-5             | US$        | Evergreen          |\n|                       4 | 3-4             | US$        | Evergreen          |\n|                       5 | 3 years or less | US$        | Evergreen          |\n\nInterest rates are based on SOFR plus CAS and margins are fixed at the commencement of the drawdown period. Interest is paid at the end of the drawdown period. Evergreen facilities may be extended continually by a year subject to the bank's agreement.\n\n## Syndicated facility\n\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2022, Woodside refinanced and increased the existing facilities to $2,000 million, with $800 million expiring on 11 October 2024, $600 million expiring on 12 July 2025 and $600 million expiring on 12 July 2027. Interest rates are based on SOFR plus CAS and margins are fixed at the commencement of the drawdown period.\n\nOn 17 January 2020, the Group completed a $600 million syndicated facility with a term of seven years. Interest is based on SOFR plus CAS plus 1.2%. Interest is paid on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) facility\n\nOn 24 June 2008, the Group entered into a two tranche committed loan facility of $1,000 million and $500 million respectively. The $500 million tranche was repaid in 2013. There is a prepayment option for the remaining balance. Interest rates are based on LIBOR. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears and the principal amortises on a straight-line basis, with equal instalments of principal due on each interest payment date (every six months).\n\nUnder this facility, 90% of the receivables from designated Pluto LNG sale and purchase agreements are secured in favour of the lenders through a trust structure, with a required reserve amount of $30 million.\n\nTo the extent that this reserve amount remains fully funded and no default notice or acceleration notice has been given, the revenue from Pluto LNG continues to flow directly to the Group from the trust account.\n\nThis facility was settled in July 2023. During the period, the Group repaid $83 million on the JBIC facility.\n\n## Medium term notes\n\nOn 28 August 2015, the Group established a $3,000 million Global Medium Term Notes Programme listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. One note is currently issued under this programme as set out below:\n\n| Maturity date   | Currency   |   Carrying amount  (million) | Nominal   interest rate   |\n|-----------------|------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| 29 January 2027 | US$        |                          200 | 3.07%                     |\n\nThe unutilised program is not considered to be an unused facility.\n\nThe CHF medium term note was settled in December 2023. During the period, the Group repaid $201 million of the CHF medium term note.\n\n## US bonds\n\nThe Group has four series of unsecured bonds issued in reliance on Rule 144A of the US Securities Act of 1933 as set out below:\n\n| Maturity date     | Carrying amount  US$m   | Nominal   interest rate   |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|\n| 5 March 2025      | 1,000                   | 3.65%                     |\n| 15 September 2026 | 800                     | 3.70%                     |\n| 15 March 2028     | 800                     | 3.70%                     |\n| 4 March 2029      | 1,500                   | 4.50%                     |\n\nInterest on the bonds is payable semi-annually in arrears.",

Other assets and liabilities\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## IN THIS SECTION\n\nThis section addresses the other assets and liabilities position at the end of the reporting period including, where applicable, the accounting policies applied and the key estimates and judgements made.\n\n## D.

Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Group, which comprise trade and other receivables, loans receivables and deposits with banks and financial institutions.\n\nThe Group manages its credit risk on trade receivables and financial instruments by predominantly dealing with counterparties with an investment grade credit rating. Su/fficient financial security is obtained to mitigate the risk of financial loss when transacting with counterparties with below investment grade credit ratings. Customers who wish to trade on unsecured credit terms are subject to credit assessment procedures. Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis. As a result, the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group's maximum credit exposure is limited to the carrying amount of its financial assets.\n\nCustomer credit risk is managed by the Treasury function subject to the Group's established policy, procedures and controls relating to customer credit risk management. The credit quality of a customer is assessed based on various credit metrics, including its credit rating, and individual credit limits and requirements are defined in accordance with this assessment. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group had nineteen customers (2022: nineteen customers) that owed the Group more than $10 million each and accounted for approximately 82% (2022: 79%) of product-related trade receivables. Depending on the product, standard settlement terms are 7 to 30 days from the date of invoice or bill of lading.\n\nThe Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of the asset and whether there has been a significant depreciation in credit quality on an ongoing basis. A significant decrease in credit quality is defined as a debtor being greater than 30 days past due in making a contractual payment. Credit losses for trade receivables (including lease receivables) and contract assets are determined by applying the simplified approach and are measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected loss. Under the simplified approach, determination of the loss allowance provision and expected loss rate incorporates past experience and forwardlooking information, including the outlook for market demand and forward-looking interest rates. A default on other financial assets is considered to be when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments within 60 days of when they fall due.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group had a provision for credit losses of nil (2022: nil). Subsequent to 31 December 2023, 97% (2022: 99%) of product-related trade receivables balance of $885 million (2022: $1,067 million) has been received.\n\nCredit risk from balances with banks is managed by the Treasury function in accordance with the Group's policy. The Group places funds from time to time as short-term deposits with reputable financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. At 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group and financial instruments are spread amongst a number of financial institutions to minimise the risk of counterparty default. The maximum exposure to financial institution credit risk is represented by the sum of all cash deposits plus accrued interest, bank account balances and fair value of derivative assets. The Group's counterparty credit policy limits this exposure to commercial and investment banks, according to approved credit limits based on the counterparty's credit rating.",

Other receivables are initially recognised at fair value. Receivables that satisfy the contractual cash flow and business model tests are subsequently measured at amortised cost less an allowance for uncollectable amounts. Uncollectable amounts are determined using the expected loss impairment model. Collectability and impairment are assessed on a regular basis.\n\nSubsequent recoveries of amounts previously written o/ff are credited against other expenses in the consolidated income statement. Certain receivables that do not satisfy the contractual cash flow and business model tests are subsequently measured at fair value (refer to Note D.6).\n\nThe Group's customers are required to pay in accordance with agreed payment terms. Depending on the product, settlement terms are 7 to 30 days from the date of invoice or bill of lading and customers regularly pay on time. There are no significant overdue product-related trade receivables as at the end of the reporting period (2022: nil).\n\n## Fair value\n\nThe carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group held $305 million of receivables at 31 December 2023 (2022: $174 million) in currencies other than US dollars (predominantly Australian dollars).\n\n## Loans receivable\n\nOn 9 January 2020, Woodside Energy Finance (UK) Ltd entered into a secured loan agreement with Petrosen (the Senegal National Oil Company), to provide up to $450 million for the purpose of funding Sangomar project costs. The facility has a maximum term of 12 years and semi-annual repayments of the loan are due to commence at the earlier of 12 months after RFSU or 30 June 2025. The carrying amount of the loan receivable is $435 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: $408 million), which approximates its fair value. The remaining balance of loans receivable is due from non-controlling interests.\n\n## D.3  INVENTORIES\n\n|                                | 2023 US$m   | 2022 US$m   |\n|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| (a) Inventories (current)      |             |             |\n| Petroleum products             |             |             |\n| Goods in transit               | 41          | 95          |\n| Finished stocks                | 93          | 103         |\n| Warehouse stores and materials | 476         | 480         |\n| Carbon credits1                | 6           | -           |\n|                                | 616         | 678         |\n| (b) Inventories (non-current)  |             |             |\n| Warehouse stores and materials | 3           | 11          |\n| Carbon credits1                | 117         | 54          |\n|                                | 120         | 65          |\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nInventories include hydrocarbon stocks, consumable supplies, maintenance spares and carbon credits expected to be utilised to o/ffset future emissions. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis and includes direct costs and an appropriate portion of fixed and variable production overheads where applicable. Inventories determined to be obsolete or damaged are written down to net realisable value, being the estimated selling price less selling costs.",

The nature of restoration activities includes the removal of facilities, abandonment of wells and restoration of a/ffected areas. Restoration provisions are updated annually, with the corresponding movement recognised against the related exploration and evaluation assets or oil and gas properties or expensed for late life projects with no corresponding asset.\n\nOver time, the liability is increased for the change in the present value based on a pre-tax discount rate appropriate to the risks inherent in the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recorded as an accretion charge within finance costs. The carrying amount capitalised in oil and gas properties is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset (refer to Note B.3).\n\nCosts incurred that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and which do not have a future economic benefit, are expensed.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements D. Other assets and liabilities\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## D.5  PROVISIONS (CONT.)\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nProvision is made for employee benefits accumulated as a result of employees rendering services up to the end of the reporting period. These benefits include wages, salaries, annual leave and long service leave.\n\nLiabilities in respect of employees' services rendered that are not expected to be wholly settled within one year after the end of the period in which the employees render the related services are recognised as long-term employee benefits.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements (a) Restoration obligations\n\nThe Group estimates the future decommissioning and remediation costs of o/ffshore oil and gas platforms, o/ffshore and onshore production facilities, wells and pipelines at di/fferent stages of the development and construction of assets or facilities. In many instances, decommissioning of assets occurs many years into the future.\n\nThe Group's restoration obligations are based on compliance with the requirements of relevant regulations which vary for di/fferent jurisdictions. For example Australian regulations require full removal for o/ffshore assets unless regulator approval is received to decommission in-situ. It is currently the Group's assumption that in some regulatory jurisdictions and environments, certain infrastructures are decommissioned in-situ where it can be demonstrated that this will deliver equal or better environmental outcomes than full removal and that regulatory approval is obtained where arrangements are satisfactory to the regulator. The Group maintains technical expertise to ensure that industry learnings, scientific research and local and international guidelines are reviewed in assessing its restoration obligations.\n\nThe restoration obligation requires judgemental assumptions regarding removal date, environmental legislation and regulations, the extent of restoration activities required, the engineering methodology for estimating cost, technologies used in determining the decommissioning cost, and liability-specific discount rates to determine the present value of these cash flows.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022, the Group applied either the 'expected outcome' approach or 'expected value' approach in assessing the cost estimate. Both approaches are supported by AASB137/IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets , produce reliable estimates and are widely used in practice. The 'expected outcome' approach was used for heritage Woodside assets (assets held by the Group prior to the BHPP merger) and those assets commonly held by both heritage entities. The 'expected value' approach was used for heritage BHPP assets (assets acquired from BHP) but excludes assets held by both heritage entities.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023, the Group has aligned to the 'expected value' approach and consistently applied it across all assets. This has not resulted in a material change to the prior estimate. The alignment reflects a change to the estimate and not a policy change, therefore no retrospective restatement is required.\n\nThese liabilities are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflow to the employees using the projected unit credit method. Liabilities expected to be wholly settled within one year after the end of the period in which the employees render the related services are classified as short-term benefits and are measured at the amount due to be paid.\n\n## Onerous contract provision\n\nProvision is made for loss-making contracts at the present value of the lower of the net cost of fulfilling and the cost arising from failure to fulfill each contract.\n\n## Expected value approach\n\nFor both onshore and o/ffshore assets, provision has been made taking into consideration a risked range of possible removal outcomes, including full removal of certain assets or project-specific risks (where applicable). Individual site provisions are an estimate of the expected value of future cash flows required to rehabilitate the relevant site using current restoration standards and techniques and taking into account risks and uncertainties. Individual site provisions are discounted to their present value using risk free country-specific discount rates aligned to the estimated timing of cash outflows. This approach takes into consideration the possibility that full removal of all assets may be required.\n\n## Inherent uncertainties\n\nThe basis of the restoration obligation provision for assets with approved decommissioning plans or general directions issued by the regulator can di/ffer from the assumptions disclosed above. Whilst the provisions reflect the Group's best estimate based on current knowledge and information, further studies and detailed analysis of the restoration activities for individual assets will be ongoing to ensure that the most accurate information is available when detailed decommissioning plans are required to be submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities. Actual costs and cash outflows can materially di/ffer from the current estimate as a result of changes in regulations and their application, prices, analysis of site conditions, further studies, timing of restoration and changes in removal technology. These uncertainties may result in actual expenditure di/ffering from amounts included in the provision recognised as at 31 December 2023.\n\nA range of pre-tax discount rates between 3.7% and 5.0% (2022: 3.4% to 4.7%) has been applied. If the discount rates were decreased by 0.5% then the provision would be $365 million higher. If the cost estimates were increased by 10% then the provision would be $718 million higher. The proportion of the non-current balance not expected to be settled within 10 years is 55% (2022: 54%).",

Other assets and liabilities\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## D.5  PROVISIONS (CONT.)\n\n## (b) Onerous contracts\n\nThe onerous contract provision assessment requires management to make certain estimates regarding the unavoidable costs and the expected economic benefits from the contract. These estimates require significant management judgement and are subject to risk and uncertainty, and hence changes in economic conditions can a/ffect the assumptions.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Corpus Christi contract has a positive value and therefore is not currently onerous (2022: nil onerous contract provision). Changes in assumptions predominantly relating to the narrowing of the spread between the sales price and purchase price could result in the contract becoming onerous in the future.\n\nAssumptions used to determine the present value as at 31 December 2023 are set out below:\n\n- \u00b7  Discount rate - a pre-tax, risk free US government bond rate of 4.04% (2022: 4.10%) has been applied.\n- \u00b7  LNG pricing - forecast sales and purchase prices are subject to a number of price markers. Price assumptions are based on the best information on the market available at measurement date and derived from short- and long-term views of global supply and demand, building upon past experience of the industry and consistent with external sources. The forecasted sales are linked to gas hub prices (Title Transfer Facility (TTF)) at which physical sales are expected to occur and incorporate known sales pricing information1. The long-term gas sales price is estimated on the basis of the Group's Brent price forecast. The estimated purchase price is linked to US gas hub prices (Henry Hub (HH)) at which physical purchases are expected to occur. The nominal TTF, Brent oil prices and HH gas prices used at 31 December 2023 were:\n\n|                 |   2024 |   2025 |   2026 |   2027 |   2028 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| TTF (US$/MMBtu) |   13.9 |   14.2 |    8.8 |    8.9 |   9.1  |\n| Brent (US$/bbl) |   82   |   80   |   76   |   77   | 792    |\n| HH (US$/MMBtu)  |    3.4 |    3.5 |    3.5 |    3.5 |   3.63 |\n\n## D.6  OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\n|                                                                                                | 2023 US$m   | 2022 US$m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Other financial assets                                                                         |             |             |\n| Financial instruments at fair value through  profit and loss                                   |             |             |\n| Derivative financial instruments designated  as hedges                                         | 248         | 207         |\n| Other financial assets                                                                         | 53          | 22          |\n| Financial instruments at amortised cost                                                        |             |             |\n| Hedge collateral (including interest)                                                          | -           | 509         |\n| Other financial assets                                                                         | -           | 30          |\n| Financial instruments at fair value through  other comprehensive income Other financial assets | 28          | 29          |\n| Total other financial assets                                                                   | 329         | 797         |\n| Current                                                                                        | 209         | 677         |\n| Non-current                                                                                    | 120         | 120         |\n| Net carrying amount                                                                            | 329         | 797         |\n| Other financial liabilities                                                                    |             |             |\n| Financial instruments at fair value through  profit and loss                                   |             |             |\n| Derivative financial instruments designated  as hedges                                         | 74          | 721         |\n| Embedded derivative                                                                            | 35          | -           |\n| Total other financial liabilities                                                              | 109         | 721         |\n| Current                                                                                        | 67          | 654         |\n| Non-current                                                                                    | 42          | 67          |\n| Net carrying amount                                                                            | 109         | 721         |\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\n## Other financial assets and liabilities\n\nReceivables subject to provisional pricing adjustments are initially recognised at the transaction price and subsequently measured at fair value with movements recognised in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments that are designated within qualifying hedge relationships are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into. For relationships designated as fair value hedges, subsequent fair value movements of the derivative are recognised in the consolidated income statement.\n\nFor relationships designated as cash flow hedges, subsequent fair value movements of the derivative for the e/ffective portion of the hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in reserves in equity; fair value movements for the ine/ffective portion are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. Costs of hedging have been separated from the hedging arrangements and deferred to other comprehensive income and accumulated in reserves in equity. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the consolidated income statement in the periods when the hedged item a/ffects profit or loss.",

Other assets and liabilities\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## D.6  OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (CONT.)\n\n## Derivative financial instruments (cont.)\n\nHedge e/ffectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective e/ffectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged exposure and the hedging instrument. The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship has been, and is expected to be, e/ffective in o/ffsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged exposure using the hypothetical derivative method.\n\nIne/ffectiveness is recognised where the cumulative change in the designated component value of the hedging instrument on an absolute basis exceeds the change in value of the hedged exposure attributable to the hedged risk.\n\nIne/ffectiveness may arise where the timing of the transaction changes from what was originally estimated such as delayed shipments or changes in timing of forecast sales. This may also arise where the commodity swap pricing terms do not perfectly match the pricing terms of the revenue contracts.\n\n## Fair value\n\nExcept for the other financial assets and other financial liabilities set out in this note, there are no material financial assets or financial liabilities carried at fair value.\n\nThe fair value of commodity derivative financial instruments is determined based on observable quoted forward pricing and swap models and is classified as Level 2 on the fair value hierarchy. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models that use present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and forward rate curves of the underlying commodity.\n\nThe fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms of maturity of each contract, using market interest rates for a similar instrument at the reporting date, and is classified as Level 2 on the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date and present value calculations based on high credit quality yield curves in the respective currencies and is classified as Level 2 on the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe fair values of other financial assets and other financial liabilities are predominantly determined based on observable quoted forward pricing and are predominantly classified as Level 2 on the fair value hierarchy.\n\nEmbedded commodity derivatives are classified as Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy with no market observable inputs.\n\n## Foreign exchange\n\nThe derivative financial instruments include foreign exchange forward contracts that are denominated in Australian dollars. The Group had no material other financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than US dollars.\n\n## Hedging activities\n\nDuring the period, the following hedging activities were undertaken:\n\n- \u00b7  As at 31 December 2023, the Group hedged approximately 29.3 MMboe of 2024 production at an average price of approximately $75.7 per barrel.\n- \u00b7  Through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts, the Group hedged its Australian dollar to US dollar exchange rate in relation to a portion of the Australian dollar denominated capital expenditure expected to be incurred under the Scarborough development.\n- \u00b7  In 2022, the Group placed $506 million (excluding interest) as collateral against the oil hedge positions to reduce counterparty credit risk exposure. The collateral was returned to the Group in 2023.\n- \u00b7  Through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts, the Group also hedged its Australian dollar to US dollar exchange rate in relation to the Australian dollar denominated tax payments which have matured.",

In 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that the three-month and six-month LIBOR will be phased out and eventually replaced by June 2023. The Group had exposures to IBORs on its financial instruments that were impacted as part of these market-wide initiatives.\n\nDuring the period, the Group has transitioned its financial liabilities from USD London Inter-Bank O/ffered Rate (USD LIBOR) to SOFR. The transition of a number of the Group's financial liabilities from USD LIBOR to SOFR during the year ended 31 December 2023 did not result in a material impact to the Group.\n\n## Embedded commodity derivative\n\nIn 2023, the Group entered into a revised long-term gas sale and purchase contract (GSPA) with Perdaman with conditions precedent being satisfied during the year, where a component of the selling price is linked to the price of urea. The contract has been assessed to contain an embedded commodity derivative that is required to be separated and recognised at fair value through profit and loss. The carrying value of the embedded derivative at 31 December 2023 amounted to a net liability of $35 million (31 December 2022: nil). The derivative is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date in accordance with the Urea price at that date. As at 31 December 2023, the unrealised loss of $35 million has been recognised through other expenses.",

Other assets and liabilities\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## D.6  OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\n## AND LIABILITIES (CONT.)\n\n## Hedging activities (cont.)\n\n## Key estimates and judgements (a) Embedded commodity derivative\n\nThe fair value of the Perdaman embedded derivative has been estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The assessment requires management to make certain assumptions about the model inputs, including forecast cash flows, discount rate, credit risk and volatility. These assumptions require significant management judgement and are subject to risk and uncertainty. The present value of the embedded derivative was estimated using the assumptions set out below.\n\n- \u00b7  Inflation rate - 2.5% has been applied.\n- \u00b7  Discount rate - a pre-tax interest rate curve (range: 5.39% to 7.12%).\n- \u00b7  Domestic gas pricing - forecast sales are subject to urea pricing. Price assumptions are based on the best market information available at measurement date and derived from short- and long-term views of global supply and demand, building upon past experience of the industry and consistent with external sources. The long-term urea price is determined with reference to the prevailing gas hub (Title Transfer Facility (TTF)) prices available in the market at reporting date.\n\nThe embedded derivative is most sensitive to changes in discount rates and pricing, which may result in unrealised gains or losses recognised in other income/expenses in the future.

Other assets and liabilities\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## D.7  LEASES (CONT.)\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nWhen a contract is entered into, the Group assesses whether the contract contains a lease. A lease arises when the Group has the right to direct the use of an identified asset which is not substitutable and to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period of use. The leases recognised by the Group predominantly relate to LNG vessels, property and drilling rigs.\n\nThe Group separates the lease and non-lease components of the contract and accounts for these separately. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.\n\n## Leases as a lessee\n\nLease assets and lease liabilities are recognised at the lease commencement date, which is when the assets are available for use. The assets are initially measured at cost, which is the present value of future lease payments adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any make-good obligations and initial direct costs incurred.\n\nLease assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of their useful life and the lease term. Refer to Note B.3 for the useful lives of assets. Periodic adjustments are made for any re-measurements of the lease assets and for impairment losses, assessed in accordance with the Group's impairment policies.\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of future minimum lease payments, discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate if the rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest rate. Minimum lease payments are fixed payments or index-based variable payments incorporating the Group's expectations of extension options and do not include non-lease components of a contract. A portfolio approach was taken when determining the implicit discount rate for LNG vessels with similar terms and conditions on transition.\n\nThe lease liability is remeasured when there are changes in future lease payments arising from a change in rates, index or lease terms from exercising an extension or termination option. A corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the lease assets, with any excess recognised in the consolidated income statement.\n\nThere are no restrictions placed upon the lessee by entering into these leases.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low value\n\nShort-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets are recognised as incurred as an expense in the consolidated income statement. Low value assets comprise plant and equipment.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group held $447 million of lease liabilities at 31 December 2023 (2022: $441 million) in currencies other than the US dollar (predominantly Australian dollars).\n\n## Maturity profile of lease liabilities\n\nThe table below presents the contractual undiscounted cash flows associated with the Group's lease liabilities, representing principal and interest. The figures will not necessarily reconcile with the amounts disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n|                     | 2023 US$m   | 2022 US$m   |\n|---------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Due for payment in: |             |             |\n| 1 year or less      | 415         | 433         |\n| 1-2 years           | 240         | 272         |\n| 2-3 years           | 194         | 199         |\n| 3-4 years           | 180         | 186         |\n| 4-5 years           | 181         | 176         |\n| More than 5 years   | 1,032       | 966         |\n|                     | 2,242       | 2,232       |\n\n## Lease commitments\n\nThe table below presents the contractual undiscounted cash flows associated with the Group's future lease commitments for non-cancellable leases not yet commenced, representing principal and interest.\n\n|                                             | 2023 US$m   | 2022 US$m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Due for payment:                            |             |             |\n| Within one year                             | 33          | 67          |\n| After one year but not more than five years | 889         | 263         |\n| Later than five years                       | 1,242       | 1,288       |\n|                                             | 2,164       | 1,618       |\n\nPayments of $121 million (2022: $162 million) for short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and payments of $12 million (2022: $12 million) for leases of low value assets were expensed in the consolidated income statement. Total payments for leases in the consolidated statement of cash flows are $575 million (2022: $525 million), with $361 million (2022: $258 million) included in financing activities.\n\nThe Group has short-term and/or low value lease commitments for marine vessels and carriers, property, drill rigs and plant and equipment contracted for, but not provided for in the financial statements, of $232 million (2022: $60 million).",

Other assets and liabilities\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## D.7  LEASES (CONT.)\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## (a) Control\n\nJudgement is required to assess whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception by assessing whether the Group has the right to direct the use of the identified asset and obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of that asset.\n\n## (b) Lease term\n\nJudgement is required when assessing the term of the lease and whether to include optional extension and termination periods. Option periods are only included in determining the lease term at inception when they are reasonably certain to be exercised. Lease terms are reassessed when a significant change in circumstances occurs. On this basis, possible additional lease payments amounting to $2,000 million (2022: $2,323 million) were not included in the measurement of lease liabilities.\n\n## (c)  lnterest in joint arrangements\n\nJudgement is required to determine the Group's rights and obligations for lease contracts within joint operations, to assess whether lease liabilities are recognised gross (100%) or in proportion to the Group's participating interest in the joint operation. This includes an evaluation of whether the lease arrangement contains a sublease with the joint operation.\n\n## (d) Discount rates\n\nJudgement is required to determine the discount rate, where the discount rate is the Group's incremental borrowing rate if the rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined. The incremental borrowing rate is determined with reference to the Group's borrowing portfolio at the inception of the arrangement or the time of the modification.",

The Group operates in complex tax and legislative regimes. The amounts disclosed above include estimates made in relation to ongoing disputes with various tax and government authorities. Assessing a value of contingent liabilities requires a high degree of judgement. The contingent liabilities relating to tax matters are estimated based on notices received from authorities before interest and penalties. The possibility of further claims related to the same matters cannot be ruled out and the judicial processes may take extended periods to conclude. Additionally, there are a number of other claims and possible claims that have arisen in the course of business against entities in the Group, the outcome of which cannot be estimated at present and for which no amounts have been included in the table above.\n\nThe Group has contingent assets of $47 million as at 31 December 2023 (2022: $199 million).\n\n## E.2  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n\n|                                 |   2023 US$m |   2022 US$m |   2021 US$m |\n|---------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Employee benefits               |         494 |         415 |         217 |\n| Share-based payments            |          39 |          26 |          12 |\n| Defined contribution plan costs |          53 |          41 |          26 |\n| Defined benefit plan expense    |          17 |           9 |           1 |\n|                                 |         603 |         491 |         256 |\n\n## (a) Employee benefits\n\nEmployee benefits for the reporting period are as follows:\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nThe Group's accounting policy for employee benefits other than superannuation is set out in Note D.5. The policy relating to share-based payments is set out in Note E.2(c).\n\nAll employees of the Group are entitled to benefits on retirement, disability or death from the Group's retirement plans. The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world. Employees entitled to defined contribution schemes receive fixed contributions from Group companies and the Group's legal or constructive obligation is limited to these contributions. Contributions to defined contribution funds are recognised as an expense as they become payable. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payment is available.\n\n## (b) Compensation of key management personnel\n\nKey management personnel (KMP) compensation for the financial year was as follows:\n\n|                               | 2023 US$   | 2022 US$   | 2021 US$   |\n|-------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Short-term employee benefits1 | 5,245,763  | 5,730,340  | 6,626,354  |\n| Post-employment benefits1     | 215,856    | 155,086    | 88,396     |\n| Share-based payments2         | 3,693,072  | 3,114,043  | 5,697,529  |\n| Long-term employee benefits   | 213,562    | 4,300      | 717,223    |\n| Termination benefits          | -          | 152,531    | 2,447,525  |\n|                               | 9,368,253  | 9,156,300  | 15,577,027 |\n\n## (c) Share plans\n\nThe Group provides benefits to its employees (including KMP) in the form of share-based payments (equity-settled transactions).\n\n## Woodside equity plan (WEP) and supplementary Woodside equity plan (SWEP)\n\nThe WEP is available to all permanent employees, but since 1 January 2018 has excluded Executive Incentive Scheme (EIS) participants. The number of Equity Rights (ERs) o/ffered to each eligible employee is determined by the Board, and based on individual performance as assessed under the performance review process. The linking of performance to an allocation allows the Group to recognise and reward eligible employees for high performance. The ERs have no further ongoing performance conditions after allocation, and do not require participants to make any payment in respect of the ERs at grant or at vesting. Each ER entitles the participant to receive a Woodside share on the vesting date three years after the grant date.\n\nFor awards made in 2023 and 2022, participants are entitled to receive a Woodside share on the vesting date, three years after the grant date. Awards made in 2021 will vest under the terms of the plan at that time, which provided for 75% vesting of the ERs three years after the grant date and the remaining 25% of the ERs five years after the grant date.\n\nIn October 2011, the Board approved the establishment of the SWEP to enable the o/ffering of targeted retention awards of ERs for key capability. The SWEP was updated in 2022 to broaden eligibility to all employees of a subsidiary of Woodside Energy Group Ltd and ensure compliance in all jurisdictions in which Woodside operates. This facilitated the o/ffer of replacement unvested incentives, as required under transitional arrangements for eligible heritage BHP employees transitioning from BHP Group Long-Term Incentive (LTI) plans to VAR o/ffered under Woodside's VAR arrangements.",

Participants do not make any payment in respect of the ERs at grant or at vesting.\n\n## Executive Incentive Scheme (EIS)\n\nThe EIS was introduced for the 2018 performance year for all Executives including Executive KMP. The EIS is delivered in the form of a cash incentive, Restricted Shares and Performance Rights. The grant date of the Restricted Shares and Performance Rights has been determined to be subsequent to the performance year, being the date of the Board of Directors' approval. Accordingly, the 2022 Restricted Shares and Performance Rights were granted on 27 February 2023 for Executives and 28 April 2023 for the CEO and have been included in the table below. The expense estimated as at 31 December 2022 in relation to the 2022 performance year was updated to the fair value on grant date during the period.\n\nThe 2023 Restricted Shares and Performance Rights have not been included in the table below as they have not been approved as at 31 December 2023. An expense related to the 2023 performance year has been estimated for the Restricted Shares and Performance Rights, using fair value estimates based on inputs at 31 December 2023.\n\n## Performance Based Pay Plus (PBP Plus)\n\nPBP Plus is available to senior, permanent employees who are not Executives. Participants receive an annual award of cash and Restricted Shares based on corporate and individual performance, recognising and rewarding eligible employees for high performance.\n\nThe grant date of the Restricted Shares has been determined to be subsequent to the performance year, being the date of the Board of Directors' approval. Accordingly, the 2022 Restricted Shares were granted on 27 February 2023 and have been included in the table below. The expense estimated as at 31 December 2022 in relation to the 2022 performance year was updated to the fair value on grant date during the period.\n\nThe 2023 Restricted Shares have not been included in the table below as they have not been approved as at 31 December 2023. An expense related to the 2023 performance year has been estimated for the Restricted Shares, using fair value estimates based on inputs at 31 December 2023.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nAll compensation under WEP, SWEP, PBP Plus and EIS Restricted Shares and Performance Rights is accounted for as share-based payments to employees for services provided. The cost of equitysettled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair values of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of share-based payments is recognised, together with the corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the vesting conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employee becomes fully entitled to the shares. At each balance sheet date, the Group reassesses the number of awards that are expected to vest based on service conditions. The expense recognised each year takes into account the most recent estimate.\n\nThe fair value of the benefit provided for the WEP and SWEP is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing technique.\n\nThe fair value of the Restricted Shares is estimated as the closing share price at grant date. The fair value of the benefit provided for the relative total shareholder return Performance Rights is calculated using the Binomial or Black-Scholes option pricing technique combined with a Monte Carlo simulation methodology, where relevant, using historical volatility to estimate the volatility of the share price in the future.",

Depending upon the facts and circumstances in each case, Woodside may obtain control, joint control or significant influence over the entity or arrangement. Judgement is applied when determining the relevant activities of a project and if joint control is held over it.\n\nRelevant activities include, but are not limited to, work program and budget approval, investment decision approval, voting rights in joint operating committees, amendments to permits and changes to joint arrangement participant holdings. Transactions which give Woodside control of a business are business combinations. If Woodside obtains joint control of an arrangement, judgement is also required to assess whether the arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture. If Woodside has neither control nor joint control, it may be in a position to exercise significant influence over the entity, which is then accounted for as an associate.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nJoint arrangements are arrangements in which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractual agreed sharing of control of the arrangement which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Joint arrangements are classified as either a joint operation or joint venture, based on the rights and obligations arising from the contractual obligations between the parties to the arrangement.\n\nTo the extent the joint arrangement provides the Group with rights to the individual assets and obligations arising from the joint arrangement, the arrangement is classified as a joint operation, and as such the Group recognises its:\n\n- \u00b7  assets, including its share of any assets held jointly;\n- \u00b7  liabilities, including its share of any liabilities incurred jointly;\n- \u00b7  revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising from the joint operation;\n- \u00b7  share of revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation; and\n- \u00b7  expenses, including its share of any expenses incurred jointly.\n\nTo the extent the joint arrangement provides the Group with rights to the net assets of the arrangement, the investment is classified as a joint venture and accounted for using the equity method.\n\nJoint arrangements acquired which are deemed to be carrying on a business are accounted for applying the principles of AASB 3/IFRS 3 Business Combinations . Joint arrangements which are not deemed to be carrying on a business are treated as asset acquisitions.",

Other items\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2023\n\n## E.9  OTHER ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## (a) Summary of other material accounting policies\n\n## Australia tax consolidation\n\nThe parent and its wholly owned Australian controlled entities have elected to enter a tax consolidation, with Woodside Energy Group Ltd as the head entity of the tax consolidated group. The members of the Australian tax consolidated group are identified in Note E.8(a).\n\nThe tax expense/benefit, deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets arising from temporary di/fferences of the members of the tax consolidated group are recognised in the separate financial statements of the members of the tax consolidated group, using the stand-alone approach.\n\nEntities within the tax consolidated group have entered into a tax funding arrangement and a tax sharing agreement with the head entity. Under the tax funding agreement, Woodside Energy Group Ltd and each of the entities in the tax consolidated group have agreed to pay or receive a tax equivalent payment to or from the head entity, based on the current tax liability or current tax asset of the entity.\n\nThe tax sharing agreement entered into between members of the tax consolidated group provides for the determination of the allocation of income tax liabilities between the entities, should the head entity default on its tax payment obligations. No amounts have been recognised in the financial statements in respect of this agreement as payment of any amounts under the tax sharing agreement is considered remote.\n\n## US tax consolidation\n\nWoodside Energy USA Operations Inc and its wholly owned USA controlled entities have elected to file a consolidated tax return, with Woodside Energy USA Operations Inc as the parent of the tax consolidated group.\n\nThe tax expense/benefit, deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets arising from temporary di/fferences of the members of the tax consolidated group are computed on a separate company basis.\n\nEntities within the tax consolidated group have entered into a tax sharing agreement. Under the tax sharing agreement, the tax liability for the consolidated group or the utilisation of tax attributes are settled periodically between the members of the group. No amounts have been recognised in the financial statements in respect of this agreement as payment of any amounts under the tax sharing agreement is considered remote.\n\n## (b) New standards and interpretations\n\n## New and amended accounting standards adopted\n\nA number of amended standards became applicable for the current reporting period. The Group did not make any significant changes to its accounting policies and did not make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these amended standards. These amendments did not materially impact the accounting policies or amounts disclosed in the year end financial statements of the Group.\n\n## New standards and interpretations not yet adopted\n\nCertain new accounting standards, amendments to accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for the 31 December 2023 reporting period and have not been early adopted by the Group. These standards, amendments or interpretations are not expected to have a material impact to the Group in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions with the exception of the amendments to AASB 112/IAS 12 Income Taxes where the impact is under assessment.\n\n## Pillar Two reforms\n\nIn December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published its Pillar Two model rules. The Pillar Two model rules:\n\n- \u00b7  aim to ensure that large multinational groups pay a minimum amount of tax on income arising in each jurisdiction in which they operate; and\n- \u00b7  would achieve a minimum e/ffective tax rate in each jurisdiction of 15% from the reporting period commencing 1 January 2024.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023, the Group paid $2,916 million of income tax and PRRT and reported a global e/ffective income tax rate of 27.5%.\n\nThe Group's impact assessment will depend on the extent to which the Pillar Two legislation has been enacted in the various jurisdictions the Group operates in and when it comes into e/ffect. The Group will continue to monitor and assess the expected impact of the Pillar Two reform.",

Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial report as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management structure of the Group, its accounting processes and controls and the industry in which it operates.\n\n## Audit scope\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- \u25cf Our audit focused on where the Group made subjective judgements; for example, significant accounting estimates involving assumptions and inherently uncertain future events.\n- \u25cf The Group has major business units in Australia and the United States of America. In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed by us, as the Group engagement team, and by component auditors under our instruction.\n- \u25cf Amongst other relevant topics, we communicated the following key audit matters to the Audit & Risk Committee:\n- -Carrying value of cash generating units (CGUs) with goodwill and oil and gas properties - Shenzi and Wheatstone,\n- -Valuation of the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) deferred tax assets (DTAs) - Pluto.\n- \u25cf These are further described in the Key audit matters section of our report.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report for the current period. The key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, any commentary on the outcomes of a particular audit procedure is made in that context.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nCarrying value of cash generating units (CGUs) with goodwill and oil and gas properties - Shenzi and Wheatstone\n\nAs described in Note B.4 to the Group financial report, the Group conducted its annual goodwill impairment testing for CGUs with goodwill and estimated the recoverable amount of CGUs with an impairment indicator at 31 December 2023. This resulted in the recognition of pre-tax impairment charges of $1,383 million for the Shenzi CGU and $466 million for the Wheatstone CGU. The recoverable amounts for the Shenzi and Wheatstone CGUs were estimated using the fair value less costs of disposal approach utilising\n\nOur procedures included, among others:\n\n- (i) testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Group's assessment of the significant estimates and assumptions included within the impairment models,\n- (ii) assessing the appropriateness of significant estimates and assumptions applied by the Group,\n\nW",

The Group's cash flow models included significant judgements and assumptions relating to oil and gas reserves and resources, estimates of future production and commodity prices, forecast expenditures incorporating expected inflation and foreign exchange rates, discount rate assumptions, and estimates of carbon costs.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the assessment of the carrying value of the Shenzi and Wheatstone CGUs is a key audit matter are:\n\n- (i) there is a significant level of judgement applied by the Group, including the use of the Group's experts, in the determination of the significant estimates and assumptions included in the impairment models,\n- (ii)  this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgement, effort and subjectivity in performing procedures and evaluating the Group's significant assumptions and estimates, and\n- (iii)  the nature and extent of audit effort required to perform the procedures and evaluate the Group's significant assumptions and estimates required the use of professionals with specialised skill and knowledge.\n\n## Valuation of the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) deferred tax assets (DTAs) - Pluto\n\nAs described in Note A.5 to the Group financial report, the Group has recognised deferred tax assets of $1,717 million as of 31 December 2023, of which $1,101 million relates to PRRT, including the Pluto PRRT DTA which reduced by $637 million during the year on the basis of future taxable profits not being available to utilise the deductible expenditure. PRRT is considered, for accounting purposes, to be an income tax. PRRT DTAs are based on estimates of future taxable profits available to recover incurred general and exploration expenditure.\n\n- (iii)  evaluating the work of the Group's experts involved in the determination of significant estimates and assumptions,\n- (iv)  evaluating the disclosures made regarding the impairment of goodwill and oil and gas properties in the Group financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards, and\n- (v)  professionals with specialised skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the Group's recoverable amount estimates.\n\nOur procedures included, among others:\n\n- (i) testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Group's assessment of the significant judgements and assumptions included within the PRRT modelling and recoverability assessment,\n- (ii) assessing the appropriateness of significant judgements and assumptions applied by the Group to estimate the recoverable amount of DTAs,\n- (iii)  evaluating the work of the Group's experts involved in the determination of significant judgements and estimates,",

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial report is located at the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board website at:\n\nhttps://www.auasb.gov.au/admin/file/content102/c3/ar1\\_2020.pdf. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Report on the remuneration report\n\n## Our opinion on the remuneration report\n\nWe have audited the remuneration report included in the directors' report for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\nIn our opinion, the remuneration report of Woodside Energy Group Ltd for the year ended 31 December 2023 complies with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001.",

The reserve estimates on which the Standard measure is based are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available or economic conditions change.\n\nDiscounted future net cash flows like those shown below are not intended to represent estimates of fair value. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves, anticipated future changes in commodity prices, exchange rates, development and production costs as well as alternative discount factors representing the time value of money and adjustments for risk inherent in producing oil and gas.\n\n## Woodside standardised measure year ended 31 December\n\n|                            | Australia  US$m   | International  US$m   | Total  US$m   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------|\n| 2023                       |                   |                       |               |\n| Future cash inflows        | 114,168           | 41,307                | 155,475       |\n| Future production costs    | (31,945)          | (11,344)              | (43,289)      |\n| Future development costs 1 | (10,758)          | (8,216)               | (18,974)      |\n| Future income taxes        | (27,527)          | (5,375)               | (32,902)      |\n| Future net cash flows      | 43,938            | 16,372                | 60,310        |\n| Discount at 10% per annum  | (20,024)          | (8,133)               | (28,157)      |\n| Standardised measure       | 23,914            | 8,239                 | 32,153        |\n| 2022                       |                   |                       |               |\n| Future cash inflows        | 197,194           | 38,256                | 235,450       |\n| Future production costs    | (31,157)          | (9,698)               | (40,855)      |\n| Future development costs 1 | (12,259)          | (4,487)               | (16,746)      |\n| Future income taxes        | (62,182)          | (4,823)               | (67,005)      |\n| Future net cash flows      | 91,596            | 19,248                | 110,844       |\n| Discount at 10% per annum  | (48,924)          | (7,777)               | (56,701)      |\n| Standardised measure       | 42,672            | 11,471                | 54,143        |\n| 2021                       |                   |                       |               |\n| Future cash inflows        | 76,202            | 5,695                 | 81,897        |\n| Future production costs    | (22,193)          | (899)                 | (23,092)      |\n| Future development costs 1 | (8,296)           | (2,481)               | (10,777)      |\n| Future income taxes        | (16,266)          | (90)                  | (16,356)      |\n| Future net cash flows      | 29,447            | 2,225                 | 31,672        |\n| Discount at 10% per annum  | (14,793)          | (1,142)               | (15,935)      |\n| Standardised measure       | 14,654            | 1,083                 | 15,737        |",

Areas of interest are based on a geographical area for which the rights of tenure are current. All exploration and evaluation expenditure, including general permit activity, geological and geophysical costs and new venture activity costs, is expensed as incurred except for the following:\n\n- \u00b7  where the expenditure relates to an exploration discovery for which the assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable hydrocarbons is not yet complete; or\n- \u00b7  where the expenditure is expected to be recouped through successful exploitation of the area of interest, or alternatively, by its sale.\n\nThe costs of acquiring interests in new exploration and evaluation licences are capitalised. The costs of drilling exploration wells are initially capitalised pending the results of the well. Costs are expensed where the well does not result in the successful discovery of economically recoverable hydrocarbons and the recognition of an area of interest. Subsequent to the recognition of an area of interest, all further evaluation costs relating to that area of interest are capitalised.\n\nUpon approval for the commercial development of an area of interest, accumulated expenditure for the area of interest is transferred to oil and gas properties.\n\nIn the consolidated statement of cash flows, those cash flows associated with capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure, including unsuccessful wells, are classified as cash flows used in investing activities.\n\nThe following table provides the changes to the capitalised exploratory well costs that were pending the determination of proved reserves for the three years ended 31 December 2023, 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021.\n\n|                                                                                                                                    | 2023  US$m   | 2022  US$m   | 2021  US$m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Movement in capitalised exploratory well costs 1                                                                                   |              |              |              |\n| At the beginning of the year                                                                                                       | 807          | 614          | 2,045        |\n| Acquisitions to the capitalised exploratory well costs   pending the determination of proved reserves                              | -            | 180          | -            |\n| Additions to the capitalised exploratory well costs   pending the determination of proved reserves                                 | 169          | 111          | 501          |\n| Capitalised exploratory well costs expensed 2                                                                                      | (4)          | (62)         | (268)        |\n| Capitalised exploratory well costs reclassified to wells, equipment   and facilities based on the determination of proved reserves | (304)        | (36)         | (1,664)      |\n| Sale of suspended wells                                                                                                            | -            | -            | -            |\n| At the end of the year                                                                                                             | 668          | 807          | 614          |\n\n- 2 Includes amortisation of licence acquisition costs.",

        "page_content": "## Three-year financial analysis\n\n## THREE-YEAR PRICING OVERVIEW\n\nWoodside's results from operations are significantly influenced by global energy market conditions. Over the last three years, oil and gas prices have experienced significant volatility. In 2021, prices began recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic as economic activity increased. In 2022 gas prices hit record highs driven by years of underinvestment and the supply shock caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In 2022 there was a significant increase in the scale of Woodside's production portfolio, with the completion of the merger with BHP's petroleum business on 1 June 2022. In 2023, prices declined below summer 2021 levels, however remained above historic averages with the decline triggered by milder weather\n\nconditions and higher stock levels across Europe. After three years of volatility global energy markets have returned to a degree of stability reflecting normalising levels of demand and price, though uncertainty remains, particularly in light of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and geopolitical events in the Middle East.\n\n## SEASONALITY\n\nWoodside's revenue is exposed to commodity price fluctuations through the sale of hydrocarbons. Commodity pricing can be a/ffected by seasonal energy demand movements in di/fferent markets.\n\n| Financial results                            | 2023  US$m   | 2022  US$m   | 2021  US$m   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Operating revenue                            | 13,994       | 16,817       | 6,962        |\n| Cost of sales                                | (7,519)      | (6,540)      | (3,845)      |\n| Gross profit                                 | 6,475        | 10,277       | 3,117        |\n| Other income                                 | 322          | 735          | 139          |\n| Other expenses                               | (1,573)      | (2,726)      | (811)        |\n| Impairment losses                            | (1,917)      | -            | (10)         |\n| Impairment reversals                         | -            | 900          | 1,058        |\n| Profit before tax and net finance costs      | 3,307        | 9,186        | 3,493        |\n| Net finance costs                            | (34)         | (12)         | (203)        |\n| Total tax expense                            | (1,551)      | (2,599)      | (1,254)      |\n| Profit after tax                             | 1,722        | 6,575        | 2,036        |\n| Attributable to equity holders of the parent | 1,660        | 6,498        | 1,983        |\n| Attributable to non-controlling interests    | 62           | 77           | 53           |\n| Profit for the period                        | 1,722        | 6,575        | 2,036        |\n\nWoodside's profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the parent decreased to $1,660 million in 2023 from $6,498 million in 2022 and $1,983 million in 2021.\n\nOperating revenue of $13,994 million decreased by $2,823 million, or -17%, from 2022. The decrease was driven by lower average Brent, TTF and JKM price markers and planned turnaround activities at Ngujima-Yin, North West Shelf and Pluto, designed to support future asset reliability. This decrease was partly o/ffset by an additional five months of production from BHP's petroleum business acquired on 1 June 2022. Operating revenue increased by $9,855 million, or 142% from 2021 to 2022, driven primarily by the merger with BHP's petroleum business which completed on 1 June 2022, the Pluto-KGP interconnector, strong operational performance and higher realised prices across all products.\n\nCost of sales increased by $979 million, or 15%, to $7,519 million compared to 2022. The increase was driven by planned turnaround activity at Pluto, Ngujima-Yin and North West Shelf, which is intended to form a solid base for increased future asset reliability, combined with additional five months activity from the assets acquired as part of the merger with\n\nBHP's petroleum business. Cost of sales increased by $2,695 million from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to an additional seven months of volumes as a result of the merger with BHP Petroleum and the Pluto-KGP Interconnector, as well as higher costs related to Corpus Christi and Pluto cargoes.\n\nOther income decreased by $413 million, or 56%, to $322 million from 2022, primarily due to profit on the sell-down of Pluto Train 2 in 2022, which was also the primary reason for the increase of $596 million, or 429% from 2021 to 2022.\n\nOther expenses decreased by $1,153 million, or 42%, to $1,573 million from 2022, primarily due to lower losses on hedging activities and the incurrence of merger transaction costs in 2022. Other expenses increased $1,915 million, or 236% from 2021 to 2022, driven by higher losses on hedging activities and repurchase agreements and transaction and integration costs relating to the merger with BHP Petroleum. The increased activity that comes with a larger, more diverse portfolio of assets also led to an increase in expenses associated with exploration activity and restoration movements from 2021 to 2022.",

        "page_content": "In 2023, an impairment loss totalling $1,917 million was recognised for the Shenzi, Wheatstone and Pyrenees assets, compared to an impairment reversal of $900 million for the Wheatstone asset in 2022. For more information on impairment refer to Note B.4 Impairment of exploration and evaluation, oil and gas properties and goodwill in section 5 - Financial Statements.\n\nNet finance costs increased by $22 million, or 183%, from 2022, to $34 million. This was primarily due to higher restoration accretion, driven by an additional five months activity from the assets acquired as part of the merger with BHP's petroleum business, o/ffset by higher interest rates on cash deposits. Net finance costs decreased $191 million, or 94% from 2021 to 2022 as a result of higher interest income generated from higher interest rates and cash balances and a reduction in finance costs due to higher capitalised borrowing costs.\n\nTotal tax expense comprises income tax and petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT). Income tax expense decreased in 2023 primarily due to lower assessable income and the recognition of a DTA on the Trion FID. PRRT expense increased from 2022 to 2023 due to the partial de-recognition of the Pluto PRRT DTA. Both income tax expense and PRRT expense increased from 2021 to 2022 before recognising additional PRRT deferred tax assets. Higher realised prices in 2022 led to additional PRRT payments but also supported the recognition of additional Pluto deferred tax assets ($1,362 million) which resulted in a 2022 net PRRT tax benefit. PRRT expense therefore decreased from 2021 by $610 million due to the Pluto deferred tax asset recognition and the impairment reversal in 2021 not present in 2022.\n\nIncome tax decreased by $2,259 million, or 78%, to $653 million. The decrease is primarily related to lower profits driven by lower prices. Income tax expense increased $1,955 million, or 204% from 2021 to 2022, primarily due to higher profits driven by higher prices and additional production.\n\n## VOLUMES, REALISED PRICES AND OPERATING REVENUES BY PRODUCT\n\nThe following describes movements in Woodside's operating revenues including a discussion of production volumes, sales volumes and realised prices for the years ended 31 December 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n|                          | Units   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Production volumes       |         |        |        |        |\n| LNG                      | MMboe   | 88.6   | 85.1   | 70.8   |\n| Pipeline gas             | MMboe   | 39.7   | 28.6   | 2.5    |\n| Crude oil and condensate | MMboe   | 51.8   | 38.7   | 1 7. 3 |\n| NGLs                     | MMboe   | 7.1    | 5.3    | 0.5    |\n| Total production volumes | MMboe   | 187.2  | 1 57.7 | 91.1   |\n| Sales volumes            |         |        |        |        |\n| LNG                      | MMboe   | 104.5  | 96.6   | 91.2   |\n| Pipeline gas             | MMboe   | 39.6   | 28.4   | 2.5    |\n| Crude oil and condensate | MMboe   | 50.3   | 39.3   | 1 7. 2 |\n| NGLs                     | MMboe   | 7.1    | 4.6    | 0.7    |\n| Total sales volumes      | MMboe   | 201.5  | 168.9  | 111.6  |\n\n|                           | Units   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Average realised prices   |         |        |        |        |\n| LNG                       | $/boe   | 78.2   | 116.9  | 58.8   |\n| Pipeline gas              | $/boe   | 34.7   | 47.8   | 1 7. 0 |\n| Crude oil and condensate  | $/boe   | 79.0   | 95.8   | 76.4   |\n| NGLs                      | $/boe   | 39.5   | 44.4   | 82.4   |\n| Volume - weighted average | $/boe   | 68.6   | 98.4   | 60.7   |\n| Operating revenue         |         |        |        |        |\n| LNG                       | $m      | 8,165  | 11,289 | 5,359  |\n| Pipeline gas              | $m      | 1,374  | 1,362  | 43     |\n| Crude oil and condensate  | $m      | 3,981  | 3,758  | 1,316  |\n| NGLs                      | $m      | 281    | 206    | 60     |\n| Other revenue             | $m      | 193    | 202    | 184    |\n| Operating revenue         | $m      | 13,994 | 16,817 | 6,962  |\n\n## LNG\n\nRevenue from the sale of LNG in 2023 decreased by $3,124 million, or 28%, to $8,165 million for 2023 from 2022, primarily due to gas prices which decreased in the second half of 2022 which continued in the first half of 2023 before stabilising in the second half of 2023 (TTF price markers decreased by 62% from 31 December 2022 to 31 December 2023).

The increase in volumes was primarily as a result of the merger with BHP Petroleum and the contribution of the Pluto-KGP interconnector.\n\nProfit before tax and net finance costs in 2022 increased by $5,704 million, or 154%, from 2021 primarily due to increased operating revenue and the profit on the sell-down of Pluto Train 2 ($427 million) and an impairment reversal recognised on Wheatstone ($900 million), partially o/ffset by increased cost of sales ($1,693 million) and increased restoration provisions ($154 million). The increased cost of sales was driven by production and price-linked costs ($808 million) and increased depreciation ($777 million) primarily relating to the assets acquired as a result of the merger with BHP's petroleum business.\n\n## Production\n\nThe Australia segment achieved an increase in production volumes of 8.5 MMboe in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to strong reliability of Pluto, additional interconnector cargoes and five additional months of increased volumes following the merger with BHP Petroleum.\n\nProduction volumes for the Australia segment increased by 45.5 MMboe in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to the merger with BHP Petroleum and the Pluto-KGP Interconnector along with strong operational performance.\n\n## International\n\nFinancial and operating information for our international operations comparing 2023, 2022 and 2021 is detailed below.\n\n| Key metric                               | Units   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Operating revenue                        | $m      | 2,549  | 1,570  | -      |\n| (Loss) before tax and net  finance costs | $m      | (808)  | 125    | (317)  |\n| Total production                         | MMboe   | 42.1   | 21.1   | -      |\n| Average realised prices                  |         |        |        |        |\n| Pipeline gas                             | $/boe   | 24.7   | 49.0   | -      |\n| Crude oil and condensate                 | $/boe   | 76.8   | 88.7   | -      |\n| Natural gas liquids                      | $/boe   | 21.1   | 31.3   | -      |\n\n## Financial results\n\nOperating revenue of $2,549 million in 2023 increased by $979 million in 2023 from 2022 primarily due to five additional months of increased volumes following the merger with BHP Petroleum and the start of production at Argos in the Gulf of Mexico. For more information refer to Note A.1 Segment revenue and expenses in section 5 - Financial Statements.\n\nLoss before tax and net finance costs of $808 million primarily due to the pre-tax impairment of the Shenzi asset $1,383 million.\n\nOperating revenue increased by $1,570 million in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to the introduction of sales volumes as a result of the merger with BHP Petroleum.

These new investments are intended to generate future operating cash flows and returns across the price cycle.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2022 decreased $676 million, or 23%, to $2,265 million from 2021, primarily due to cash receipts from the merger with BHP Petroleum ($1,082 million), payments made to acquire joint arrangements in 2021 not present in 2022 ($212 million), higher proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment ($123 million) and lower payments made to Petrosen under a loan facility ($158 million) o/ffset in part by higher capital expenditure predominantly related to Scarborough and Pluto Train 2, excluding the e/ffect of GIP additional contribution to Pluto Train 2.\n\n## Net cash used in financing activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2023 increased $1,636 million, or 49%, to $5,000 million from 2022, primarily due to higher final prior year dividend paid to shareholders ($1,695 million) due to the higher 2022 NPAT; and higher repayment of the principal portion of lease liabilities ($92 million) predominantly due to Sangomar.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $1,940 million, or 136%, to $3,364 million from 2021 to 2022, primarily due to higher dividends paid to shareholders as a result of the increased NPAT in the current year ($2,269 million), higher repayments for the purchase of shares under the dividend reinvestment plan ($144 million) and lower repayments of borrowings predominantly due to the repayment of the 2021 US bond in 2021 ($501 million).",

Completion refers to the installation of permanent equipment for production of oil or gas, or, in the case of a dry well, to reporting to the appropriate authority that the well has been abandoned.\n\nAn exploratory well is a well drilled to find oil or gas in a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir. A development well is a well drilled within the limits of a known oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.\n\nA productive well is an exploratory, development or extension well that is not a dry well. Productive wells include wells in which hydrocarbons were encountered and the drilling or completion of which, in the case of exploratory wells, has been suspended pending further drilling or evaluation. A dry well (hole) is an exploratory, development, or extension well that proves to be incapable of producing either oil or gas in su/fficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well.\n\nDuring 2023, productive development wells included a sidetrack and dual lateral at Pyrenees in Australia, the Mad Dog Phase 2 development wells in the US Gulf of Mexico (GOM), an Atlantis infill well, the Shenzi North development wells and the conversion of injection wells to production wells in Trinidad and Tobago. A successful appraisal well was drilled at Mad Dog Southwest. Dry exploratory wells included the Spinel well in the GOM and Gemtree in Australia and a dry infill well was drilled at Atlantis.\n\n## PRESENT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES CONTINUING AS OF 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\nThe number of wells in the process of drilling and/or completion as of 31 December 2023 was as follows:\n\n|                 | Exploratory wells   | Exploratory wells   | Development wells   | Development wells   | Total   | Total   |\n|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------|---------|\n|                 | Gross               | Net                 | Gross               | Net                 | Gross   | Net     |\n| Australia       | -                   | -                   | -                   | -                   | -       | -       |\n| International 1 | -                   | -                   | 19                  | 12.1                | 19      | 12.1    |\n| Total           | -                   | -                   | 19                  | 12.1                | 19      | 12.1    |\n\nDevelopment wells in progress include Sangomar wells in Senegal, Mad Dog Phase 2 wells, Atlantis wells, and a Mad Dog A spar well in the GOM. The Sangomar development is installing a waterflood recovery scheme as part of the ongoing project, and in the Gulf of Mexico a waterflood recovery scheme is included in the Mad Dog Phase 2 project.",

        "page_content": "## OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES, WELLS, OPERATIONS AND ACREAGE\n\nThe following tables show the number of gross and net productive crude oil and natural gas wells and total gross and net developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas acreage as at 31 December 2023. A gross well or acre is one in which a working interest is owned, while a net well or acre exists when the sum of fractional working interests owned in gross wells or acres equals one.\n\nProductive wells are producing wells and wells mechanically capable of production. Developed acreage is comprised of leased acres that are within an area by or assignable to a productive well. Undeveloped acreage is comprised of leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether such acres contain proved reserves.\n\nThe number of productive crude oil and natural gas wells in which Woodside held an interest at 31 December 2023 was as follows:\n\n|                 | Crude oil wells   | Crude oil wells   | Natural gas wells   | Natural gas wells   | Total   | Total   |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------|---------|\n|                 | Gross             | Net               | Gross               | Net                 | Gross   | Net     |\n| Australia       | 223               | 116.2             | 198                 | 93.0                | 421     | 209.2   |\n| International 1 | 87                | 41.7              | 16                  | 7.7                 | 103     | 49.4    |\n| Total           | 310               | 157.9             | 214                 | 100.7               | 524     | 258.6   |\n\nOf the productive crude oil and natural gas wells, 156 (net: 75) wells had multiple completions. The number of wells with multiple completions refers to wells that have downhole equipment installed that allows zonal insolation or controlled commingling of production as permitted and approved by the applicable regulator.\n\nDeveloped and undeveloped acreage (including both leases and concessions) held at 31 December 2023 was as follows:\n\n|                    | Developed acreage   | Developed acreage   | Undeveloped acreage   | Undeveloped acreage   |\n|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Thousands of acres | Gross               | Net                 | Gross                 | Net                   |\n| Australia          | 2,441               | 1,217               | 3,767                 | 3,192                 |\n| International 1,2  | 141                 | 68                  | 17,215                | 7,077                 |\n| Total              | 2,582               | 1,285               | 20,982                | 10,269                |\n\nWoodside has initiated exits from our Myanmar, Peru and Ireland positions, totalling approximately 8,426 thousand acres gross (3,670 thousand acres net). Approximately 248 thousand acres gross (200 thousand acres net), 1,333 thousand acres gross (615 thousand acres net) and 784 thousand acres gross (452 thousand acres net) of undeveloped acreage will expire in the years ending 31 December 2024, 2025 and 2026 respectively if Woodside does not establish production or take any other action to extend the terms of the licences and concessions.\n\n## DELIVERY COMMITMENTS\n\nWoodside has contracts that require delivery of fixed volumes of crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGL. Woodside intends to fulfill its short-term and long-term obligations with its production or from purchases of third-party volumes.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, delivery commitments were as follows:\n\n|                                        | Natural gas (MMboe)   | Crude oil (MMbbl)   | Condensate (MMbbl)   | NGLs (MMbbl)   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------|\n| Year ended 31 December                 |                       |                     |                      |                |\n| 2024 to 2028                           | 336.5                 | 7. 2                | 2.2                  | 3.8            |\n| Thereafter                             | 327.6                 | -                   | -                    | -              |\n| Total oil and gas delivery commitments | 664.1                 | 7.2                 | 2.2                  | 3.8            |",

The increase in the number of employees from 2022 was due to general workforce growth to support Woodside's operations and projects.\n\nWoodside regularly engages with our workforce and supports freedom of association. Our employees are free to join or not to join a labour union. Woodside strives to maintain a positive relationship with employees and labour unions. Woodside believes that the relationship between its management and labour unions is generally positive.\n\n## Employment region (number of sta/ff by region) 1,2\n\n|                                    | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Australia                          | 3,563  | 3,338  | 3,660  |\n| Africa and Middle East             | 57     | 50     | 35     |\n| Asia                               | 77     | 71     | 48     |\n| Caribbean 3                        | 105    | 108    | NPR    |\n| Europe                             | 24     | 11     | 8      |\n| Americas 4                         | 841    | 849    | 13     |\n| Total                              | 4,667  | 4,427  | 3,764  |\n| Total number of contractors (TPCs) | 474    | 394    | 267    |\n\n## QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nIn the normal course of business, Woodside is exposed to commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact Woodside's financial position and results of operations. Woodside's risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments. Woodside uses derivative contracts to manage commodity price volatility, foreign exchange rate volatility on capital expenditure plans and interest rate exposure on financing activities.\n\nActual gains and losses in the future may di/ffer materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and Woodside's actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change, as well as the e/ffectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure.\n\n## Commodity price risk management\n\nWoodside's revenues are primarily derived from sales of LNG, crude oil, condensate, pipeline gas and NGLs. Consequently, Woodside's results of operations are strongly influenced by the prices it receives for these products, which in the case of oil and condensate are primarily determined by prevailing crude oil prices and in the case of pipeline gas, NGLs and LNG are primarily determined by prevailing crude oil prices as well as some fixed pricing and other price indexes (such as Henry Hub and the Japan Korea Marker). For the year ended 31 December 2023, the majority (approximately 72%) of Woodside's production was attributed to natural gas, comprising LNG, NGLs and pipeline gas and the remaining portion (approximately 28%) of Woodside's production was attributed to oil and condensate.",

        "page_content": "LNG market conditions including, but not limited to, supply and demand, are unpredictable and are beyond Woodside's control. In particular, supply and demand for and pricing of LNG, remain sensitive to energy prices, external economic and political factors, weather, climate conditions, natural disasters (including pandemics), timing of FIDs for new operations, construction and start up and operating costs for new LNG supply, buyer preferences for LNG, coal or crude oil and evolving buyer preferences for di/fferent LNG price regimes, and the energy transition. Buyers and sellers of LNG are increasingly more flexible with the way they transact, and contracts may involve hybrid pricing that is linked to other indices such as the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) Brent Crude deliverable futures contract (oil price) or the Japanese Crude Cocktail, which is the average price of customs-cleared crude oil imports into Japan as reported in customs statistics. Typically, only LNG supplied from the US was based on a component linked to movements in the US Henry Hub plus certain fixed and variable components. This type of pricing structure may become a component of the weighted average price into Asia and other markets. This is since LNG supply and trade has globalised and increasingly the lowest cost supply is setting the floor for long-term average global natural gas prices with transportation costs accounting for regional di/fferences. This marginal supply is predominantly from the United States, indirectly pegging global gas prices and Asian spot LNG prices to the Henry Hub marker which could adversely a/ffect the pricing of new LNG contracts and potential future price reviews of existing LNG contracts. Tenders may also be used by suppliers and buyers, typically for shorter-term contracts. In addition, longterm LNG contracts typically contain price review mechanisms which sometimes need to be resolved by expert determination or arbitration. The use of these independent resolution mechanisms is likely to be more prevalent in volatile commodity markets. Alternatives to fossil fuel-based products for the generation of electricity, for example nuclear power and renewable energy sources, are continually under development and, if these alternatives continue to gain market share, they could also have a material impact on demand for LNG, which in turn may negatively impact Woodside's business, results of operations and financial condition in the longer-term.\n\nOil prices can be very volatile, and periods of sustained low prices could result in changes to Woodside's carrying value assumptions and may also reduce the reported net profit for the relevant period. The price of crude oil may be a/ffected by factors beyond Woodside's control. These include worldwide oil supply and demand, the level of economic activity in the markets Woodside serves, regional political developments and military conflicts (including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict), weather conditions and natural disasters, conservation and environmental protection e/fforts, the level of crude oil inventories, the ability of OPEC and other major oil-producing or oil-consuming nations to influence global production levels and prices, sanctions on the production or export of oil, governmental regulations and actions, including the imposition of taxes, trade restrictions, market uncertainty and speculative activities by those who buy and sell oil and gas on the world markets, commodity futures trading, availability and capacity of infrastructure, supply chain disruptions, processing facilities and necessary transportation, the price and availability of new technology, the availability and\n\ncost of alternative sources of energy, and the impact of climate change considerations and actions towards energy transition on the demand for key commodities which Woodside produces.\n\nThe transition to lower carbon sources of energy in many parts of the world (driven by ESG and climate change concerns) may a/ffect demand for Woodside's products including crude oil, natural gas and LNG. In turn, this may a/ffect the price received (or expected to be received) for these products. Material adverse price impacts (including as a result of the energy transition) may a/ffect the economic performance (including as to margins and cash flows) of, and longevity of production from, Woodside's existing and future production assets, and ultimately the financial performance of Woodside.\n\nIt is impossible to predict future crude oil, LNG and natural gas price movements with certainty. A low crude oil price environment or declines in the price of crude oil, LNG and natural gas prices, could adversely a/ffect Woodside's business, results of operations and financial condition and liquidity. They could also negatively impact its ability to access sources of capital, including equity and debt markets. Those circumstances may also adversely impact Woodside's ability to finance planned capital expenditures, including development projects, and may change the economics of operating certain wells, which could result in a reduction in the volume of Woodside's reserves. Declines in crude oil, LNG and natural gas prices, especially sustained declines, may also reduce the amount of oil and gas that it can produce economically, reduce the economic viability of planned projects or assets that it plans to acquire or has acquired, and may reduce the expected value and the potential commerciality of exploration and appraisal assets. Those reductions may result in substantial downward adjustments to Woodside's estimated proved reserves and require additional write-downs of the value of its oil and gas properties.\n\nSales contracts with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago relating to production from Woodside's Trinidad and Tobago operations are partially linked to ammonia pricing. In addition there is a Western Australian domestic gas sales contract linked to urea pricing. Similar to crude oil, LNG and natural gas, it is impossible to predict future ammonia and urea prices with certainty.\n\nThere can be no assurance that Woodside will successfully manage its exposure to commodity prices. There is also counterparty risk associated with derivative contracts. If any counterparty to Woodside's derivative instruments were to default or seek bankruptcy protection, it could subject a larger percentage of Woodside's future oil and gas production to price changes and could have a negative e/ffect on Woodside's financial performance, including its ability to fund future projects. Whether Woodside engages in hedging and other oil and gas derivative contracts on a limited basis or otherwise, Woodside will remain exposed to fluctuations in crude oil prices.\n\n## Foreign exchange and interest rate risk management\n\nRefer to note A and note C in the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information on foreign exchange and interest rate risks.",

        "page_content": "## CYBERSECURITY\n\n## Our Cyber Resilience Process and Risk Management\n\nWoodside's approach to managing material risks from cybersecurity threats is integrated into our overall risk management processes as disclosed in section 4.1.6 - Risk management and internal control.\n\nWoodside's cybersecurity resilience and risk management strategy and process are based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework.\n\nWoodside's Cyber Resilience Process consists of various Group-wide policies, procedures and guidelines concerning cybersecurity matters. These documents are published within the Woodside Management System (WMS) and aim to:\n\n- 1. Design, build and maintain Woodside's Information Technology (IT), Operational Technology (OT) and Industrial Internet of Things systems with the right cybersecurity controls to support confidentiality, integrity and availability.\n- 2. Monitor and strengthen Woodside's cybersecurity posture while preventing, detecting, analysing and responding to cybersecurity incidents.\n- 3. Embed a cyber-safe culture across Woodside and foster industry collaboration.\n- 4. Enable compliance with all applicable legislation.\n\nThe process involves five key activities: identify, protect, detect, respond and recover.\n\nIn addition to the Cyber Resilience Process, the Data, Information and Systems Management process documented within the WMS, includes the Woodside Information Technology Systems Conditions of Use Procedure. This procedure sets out Woodside's mandatory conditions applicable to the use of Woodside's IT, OT and digital Systems.\n\nWoodside manages cybersecurity risks utilising the same Woodside risk management process as described in section 3.9 - Risk factors.\n\n## Our Cyber Resilience Process Assurance\n\nWoodside's Cybersecurity team engages third-party vendors as part of our Cyber Resilience Process to perform a variety of technical assessments such as penetration testing. As part of these assessments, the third parties test our internal and external defenses, and help us with identifying any weaknesses and vulnerabilities within our environment. These assessment findings are risk ranked and prioritised for remediation.\n\nWoodside internal audit team conducts audits on cybersecurity on a biennial basis. The internal audit function engages external expertise to conduct the audits. The most recent cybersecurity audit concluded in 2023.\n\n## Third Party Cybersecurity Risk Management\n\nWoodside identifies and manages risks from cybersecurity threats associated with third parties accessing, storing and processing Woodside data, through up-front cybersecurity assessment processes that leverage independently verified security programs including ISO 27001 certification and SOC 2 compliance, and through contractual terms and conditions.\n\nWoodside manages risk of third-party access to Woodside systems through on-boarding and induction processes for personnel including mandatory training. Third-party personnel accessing Woodside systems are subject to the same cyber security controls as Woodside sta/ff. This includes the requirement to complete annual cybersecurity training. Higher risk scenarios such as direct network connectivity from third-party networks are not permitted.\n\n## Material Impact from cybersecurity risks, threats or previous cybersecurity incidents\n\nRisk from cybersecurity threats have the potential to materially a/ffect Woodside's business strategy, results of operations and financial conditions. This risk is described in section 3.9 - Risk factors.\n\nWoodside continuously monitors its digital information landscape and has various threat detection measures in place. Woodside is not aware of any cybersecurity incidents or threats that have materially a/ffected or are reasonably likely to materially a/ffect our business strategy, results of operations or financial conditions.\n\n## GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS\n\nWoodside's assets and exploration, development, extraction and production operations are subject to a wide range of laws and regulations imposed by governments and regulatory bodies. These regulations touch all aspects of our assets, including how we extract, process and explore for oil and natural gas and how we conduct our business, including regulations governing matters such as environmental protection, land rehabilitation and facilities decommissioning, occupational health and safety, human rights, the rights and interests of First Nations peoples, competition, foreign investment, export, marketing of oil and natural gas, royalties and taxes.\n\nThe ability to extract and process oil and natural gas is fundamental to our business. In most jurisdictions, the rights to explore for and extract petroleum deposits are owned by the government. We obtain the right to access the land and extract the product by entering into licences or leases with the government that owns the oil or natural gas deposit. Usually, the right to explore for oil and natural gas carries with it the obligation to spend a defined amount of money on the exploration, or to undertake particular exploration activities.\n\nWe also rely on governments to grant the rights necessary to transport and treat the extracted petroleum to prepare it for sale. The terms of the right, including the time period of the right, vary depending on the laws of the relevant government or terms negotiated with the relevant government.\n\nIn certain jurisdictions where we have assets, such as Trinidad and Tobago and Senegal, a production sharing contract (PSC) governs the relationship between the government and companies (typically referred to as 'Contractor') concerning, among other things, how much of the oil and gas extracted from the country each party will receive. Under PSCs, the government awards exclusive rights for the execution of exploration, development and production activities to the Contractor in accordance with the PSC's terms. Generally speaking, the Contractor bears the financial risk of the initiative to explore, develop and ultimately produce the field. When successful, the Contractor is permitted to use a certain",

        "page_content": "set percentage of produced oil and gas to recover its capital and operational expenditures, often called 'cost oil.' The remaining production is split between the government and the Contractor at a rate determined by the government and set out in the PSC.\n\nThe PSC may also include additional fiscal terms such as royalties, production bonuses and tax treatment, and other contractual terms addressing domestic supply obligations, local content, measurement and valuation. PSCs are bilateral contracts negotiated between the Contractor and the government and so each is necessarily on di/fferent terms.\n\nApplicable laws and regulations, and any permits that Woodside is required to obtain under these laws, may obligate Woodside to identify, avoid, mitigate and disclose environmental risks in various operational practices, including, among others, through pursuing and obtaining permits before commencing activities, restricting air and water emissions and waste discharges, limiting the type, quantity and concentration of various substances that can be utilised or released into the environment, addressing potential or actual impacts to protected species or cultural resources, monitoring or remediating contamination under certain circumstances, establishing and following certain inspection, testing, maintenance and decommissioning protocols, and disclosing certain operational practices. Moreover, environmental permits required for our operations may be subject to legal challenges by third parties, and such challenges can materially and adversely a/ffect our operations to the extent they delay or prevent obtaining approvals or permits required for our operations, or otherwise require incurring increased costs in order to obtain such approvals or permits. Applicable environmental laws and regulations may also dictate worker health and safety and community notification procedures.\n\nIn addition, from time to time, certain trade sanctions are adopted by the United Nations (UN) Security Council and/ or various governments, including in the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union (EU), China and Australia against certain countries, entities or individuals, that may restrict our ability to sell extracted minerals, oil or natural gas to, and/or our ability to purchase goods or services from, these countries, entities or individuals.\n\nThis summary focuses on the Australian and United States regulatory regimes, as well as certain regulations in Senegal. It is not a full summary of the regulatory regimes in those jurisdictions nor is it a complete list of the legislation and regulation that applies to Woodside. Woodside is also subject to environmental and other regulations to varying degrees in each of the jurisdictions in which it has assets and operations.\n\n## Australia\n\nIn Australia, petroleum exploration and development takes place within a legal framework characterised by a division of responsibilities between the federal and the state or territory governments. Exploration and production activities conducted onshore and within three nautical miles of the territorial sea baseline of the relevant state or territory are the responsibility of the individual state or territory governments. The Australian Federal government has legislative responsibility for Australian o/ffshore petroleum exploration and production beyond the three nautical mile territorial sea, which encompasses the area of most relevance to Woodside's o/ffshore activities. In addition, Woodside has certain onshore operations in Victoria and Western Australia which are subject to various state legislation.\n\n## Environmental regulation\n\nWoodside's Australian operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. For o/ffshore petroleum activities, these laws and regulations generally require the acquisition of an approval before an activity commences, and require that for an activity, environmental risks are identified and controls put in place to reduce or eliminate the risks. For exploration drilling and seismic activities in the federal jurisdiction, this is outlined in an Environment Plan accepted by the National O/ffshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA), an independent statutory authority; as an operation goes into construction, commissioning and production, a whole o/ffshore project proposal and new or revised environment plan is required as the initial document to be submitted for approval. Subsequent environment plans for each activity are required to be submitted after the o/ffshore project proposal has been approved. These laws and regulations also restrict the type, quantity and concentration of various substances that can be utilised or released into the environment in connection with marine and land-based activities; limit or prohibit drilling and seismic or production activities in and near certain environmentally sensitive or protected areas; and impose criminal and civil liabilities for pollution or other unauthorised impacts to the environment resulting from oil, natural gas and petrochemical operations.\n\nThe National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (Cth) requires corporations that meet certain reporting thresholds to report company information about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy production and consumption as part of a single, national reporting scheme and establishes the Safeguard Mechanism which aims to keep certain GHG emissions at or below legislated limits, known as baselines, for Australia's largest industrial facilities. In March 2023, the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2023 was passed, which applied reforms to the Safeguard Mechanism from 1 July 2023 intended to reduce Scope 1 GHG emissions from Australia's largest industrial facilities on a trajectory consistent with achieving Australia's GHG emission reduction targets of 43% below 2005 levels by 2030 and net zero by 2050. There is ongoing public pressure in Australia on the government to accelerate its carbon emissions reduction program. As such, there remains significant uncertainty regarding the future of climate change regulation in Australia and the e/ffect it may have on Woodside's business.",

        "page_content": "In addition, Australian environmental laws and regulations also include restrictions on air emissions and water discharges resulting from the operation of drilling equipment, processing facilities, pipelines and transport vessels. These laws also regulate the use, management and disposal of hazardous materials and general waste; prohibit the clearing of native vegetation without approval; manage biodiversity and manage and authorise impacts to Aboriginal heritage; and require Woodside to prepare and implement safety and environmental management plans.\n\nWoodside is required to provide bonds or maintain other forms of financial assurance for rehabilitation, clean-up or pollution prevention work that may be necessary as a result of the construction, operation, decommissioning or removal of a pipeline or other infrastructure and to report, monitor or remediate contamination under certain circumstances. Woodside is subject to 'strict liability' for oil spills, rendering it liable without regard to potential negligence or fault and may be subject to fines and other penalties for breaches of laws, regulations, licences or other approvals.\n\nThe requirements imposed by environmental laws and regulations are subject to change and have tended to become increasingly restrictive over time. The modification of existing foreign or domestic laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or development drilling for oil and gas for economic, political, social, environmental or other reasons could have a material adverse e/ffect on Woodside's business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## Fair Work Act and other related amendments\n\nA significant number of changes to the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) (FW Act) and other related laws have been introduced over the past year.\n\nIn December 2022, the Australian Federal Government passed the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Act 2022 (Cth) (SJBP Act) which introduced a raft of amendments into the FW Act with phased commencement dates over the course of 2023. All key provisions of the SJBP Act have now become e/ffective.\n\nKey material employment changes to the FW Act arising from the SJBP Act included expanded rights for employees to enforce flexible working arrangements, new restrictions on the use of fixed term (including 'maximum term') employment contracts, prohibitions against pay secrecy, expanding the protected attributes (namely gender identity, intersex status and breastfeeding) against which discriminatory and other conduct are prohibited, broadening the ability of employees to extend and enforce unpaid parental leave, and providing additional avenues for workers to seek recourse against sexual harassment. The sexual harassment-related amendments in particular complement the commencement in December 2022 of a new positive duty to prevent sexual harassment in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) which the Australian Human Rights Commission can enforce from 12 December 2023. Additionally, the Australian Human Rights Commission Amendment (Costs Protection) Bill 2023 (Cth) is currently before Parliament and, if passed, will reduce the financial barriers for sexual harassment complainants to bring claims.\n\nThe SJBP Act also introduced a series of significant industrial relations changes to enterprise bargaining, including expanding the ability of employees and unions to seek multi-employer enterprise agreements, broadening the power of the Fair Work Commission to resolve (through mediation or conciliation) bargaining disputes before industrial action is taken and to intervene and make workplace determinations where bargaining becomes 'intractable'. Other changes to bargaining introduced by the SJBP Act included amendments making it easier for employee bargaining representatives to commence bargaining to renew existing single-enterprise agreements, changes to the Fair Work Commission's enterprise agreement approval-related requirements (including consideration of whether a proposed agreement has been genuinely agreed to and passes the 'better-o/ff-overall' test) and substantially restricting the ability of employers to terminate nominally-expired enterprise agreements.\n\nIn June 2023, the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Protecting Worker Entitlements) Act 2023 (Cth) was introduced, bringing further changes to the FW Act. Key changes arising from this Act include the expansion of unpaid parental leave rights (from 1 July 2023) and enshrining superannuation payments as an enforceable National Employment Standard under the FW Act (from 1 January 2024).\n\nA further package of significant reforms is contained in the Australian Federal Government's Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Act 2023 (Cth) (Closing Loopholes Act). While various key aspects of the Closing Loopholes Act are the subject of a Senate Committee Inquiry (to be concluded from February 2024 onwards), numerous reforms contained in this reform package passed both houses of Parliament on 7 December 2023. Key provisions that have passed include new 'same job, same pay' provisions which give the Fair Work Commission the ability to make orders upon application requiring employers (excluding service contractors) to pay their employees who perform work for a 'regulated host' the same rate of pay as employees of that host (provided that the host's employees perform work of the same kind). Among other provisions, new rights for workplace delegates to paid time o/ff to attend training as well as reasonable time and access to employer facilities to communicate with eligible union members have also passed, as has a new criminal wage theft o/ffence in respect of intentional underpayments.\n\nThe Closing Loopholes Act received Royal Assent on 14 December 2023. As such, many of the amendments from the Closing Loopholes Act - excluding the provisions relating to wage theft - commenced on 15 December 2023 (although same job, same pay-related regulated labour hire arrangement orders can only take e/ffect on and after 1 November 2024). Proposed outstanding amendments that are the subject of the Senate Committee Inquiry, include changes to the definition of employment (including casual employment), increased civil penalties for underpayment contraventions, new right of entry rights relating to suspected underpayments and further limitations to the Fair Work Commission's powers to reduce employee entitlements in the context of intractable bargaining disputes.",

        "page_content": "Woodside believes that it is well placed to confirm its compliance with the numerous new employment and industrial relations obligations that have been introduced over the past year. Moving forward, increased compliance-related demands are expected, especially given the further reforms that are anticipated in 2024.\n\n## Decommissioning liability amendments\n\nOn 2 September 2021, the Australian Federal parliament passed the O/ffshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Titles Administration and Other Measures) Act 2021 (Cth) which, among other changes, amends the O/ffshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act (Cth) (OPGGSA) to expand the trailing liability provisions. The amendments took e/ffect from 2 March 2022. The expanded trailing liability regime gives NOPSEMA and the responsible Commonwealth Minister the ability to recall any titleholders, former titleholders and their respective related bodies corporate and 'related persons' to undertake decommissioning activities on a title area. These powers are retrospective in their application and apply to titles that are currently in force as well as to titles that ceased to be in force on or after 1 January 2021.\n\n## Santos Barossa decision and Environment Plans\n\nIn December 2022, the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia handed down its decision in Santos NA Barossa Pty Ltd v Tipakalippa [2002] FCAFC 193 (Appeal Decision). The Appeal Decision decided certain aspects of the requirements for consultation associated with the acceptance of environment plans for o/ffshore petroleum activities by NOPSEMA, as required under the OPGGSA. Subsequently, NOPSEMA published a guideline for industry entitled 'Consultation in the course of preparing an environment plan'. As a consequence of these events, Woodside has experienced delays in obtaining Environment Plans for petroleum activities in Commonwealth waters.\n\nIn September 2023, the Federal Court of Australia, in Cooper v National O/ffshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (No. 2) [2023] FCA 1158, found that NOPSEMA's decision to accept, with conditions, Woodside's environment plan for seismic surveys associated with the Scarborough project was invalid. Woodside was a party to this matter. Woodside submitted a revised environment plan for this activity in October 2023. Woodside's revised environment plan was accepted by NOPSEMA in December 2023 and work was completed under the accepted environment plan in December 2023.\n\nRefer to section 3.9 - Risk factors for further information on risks related to government regulations and other legal developments.\n\n## Domestic gas reservation policy\n\nUnder a Western Australian State Government policy (WA Domestic Gas Policy), introduced in 2006, gas equivalent to 15% of LNG production from LNG export projects is required to be reserved for domestic use as a condition of State approvals required for LNG projects. The policy is typically implemented through domestic gas commitment agreements entered into between project proponents and the State, allowing negotiations to occur on a case-by-case basis regarding the method by which the LNG project proponents fulfil their domestic gas commitments, including from alternative sources.\n\nWoodside and (where applicable) its joint venture participants have domestic gas contractual commitments in place with the Western Australian State Government in respect to the North West Shelf (NWS), Pluto LNG, Scarborough and Wheatstone projects. In 2015, the NWS State Agreement (North West Gas Development (Woodside) Agreement 1979) was amended to include a new domestic gas commitment of 15% (or lesser approved amount) of total LNG quantity approved for use, supply or sale overseas to bring the NWS Project in line with the WA Domestic Gas Policy. In 2006, in connection with the final investment decision taken in respect of the Pluto LNG project, Woodside entered into an arrangement with the Western Australian State Government to market and make available for supply a quantity of domestic gas from Pluto, provided that Woodside was not required to supply domestic gas if it is not commercially viable to do so. In January 2021, Woodside signed a further agreement with the Western Australian State Government in which Woodside agreed to market and make available 45.6 PJ of additional domestic gas from its share of NWS Project gas, separate and in addition to the 2015 commitment from the NWS Joint Venture. In November 2021, Woodside signed a further domestic gas commitment agreement with the Western Australian State Government with respect to the Scarborough project pursuant to which, consistent with the WA Domestic Gas Policy, the Scarborough Joint Venture will make gas equivalent to 15% of its LNG exports available to the domestic market. In January 2021, Woodside signed a further domestic gas commitment agreement with the Western Australian State Government with respect to the Pluto acceleration project pursuant to which, consistent with the WA Domestic Gas Policy, Woodside will make gas equivalent to 15% of its LNG exports processed at the NWS Project as part of the Pluto acceleration project available to the domestic market. Woodside also has domestic gas commitments in respect to its interest in the Wheatstone LNG Project under a 2011 agreement with the Western Australian State Government.\n\n## Additional major legislation and regulations\n\nWoodside's Australian o/ffshore operations beyond coastal waters are primarily governed by the OPGGSA and related legislation, which establishes a joint authority (Joint Authority) whereby relevant Australian state, territory and federal governments cooperate in the administration and supervision of petroleum activities in o/ffshore areas beyond coastal waters. The OPGGSA provides for the grant of exploration permits, retention leases, production licences, pipeline licences and facilities licences within the areas of the OPGGSA's jurisdictional operation. Within the coastal waters, petroleum operations are covered by the relevant state or Northern Territory legislation that is substantively similar to the OPGGSA.\n\nThe O/ffshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Resource Management and Administration) Regulations 2011 (Cth) contain resource management provisions, including a requirement for the holder of a production licence to have in place a Field Development Plan approved by the Joint Authority before petroleum production can commence.",

        "page_content": "Many of Woodside's operations rely on pipeline licences to transport oil and gas from the point of production to processing facilities and relevant markets. As mentioned above, the OPGGSA also provides for the grant of pipeline licences within the areas of the OPGGSA's jurisdictional operation. Pipelines within the coastal waters of Western Australia are licensed under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1982 (WA) and pipelines within the coastal waters of Victoria are licensed under the O/ffshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2010 (Vic). Onshore pipelines in Western Australia are licensed under the Petroleum Pipelines Act 1969 (WA) and onshore pipelines in Victoria are licensed under the Pipelines Act 2005 (Vic).\n\nWoodside is also subject to the following laws, among others:\n\n- \u00b7  Various petroleum taxes, including royalties, excise taxes, temporary levies, and the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT). In May 2023, the Australian Government announced rules aimed at ensuring o/ffshore LNG projects make minimum PRRT payments once 7 years from first production have elapsed. The rules are intended to be e/ffective from 1 July 2023. The related amendments to PRRT legislation were introduced into the Federal parliament on 16 November 2023. It is not yet clear when these amendments will receive Royal Assent. Subject to becoming law, these rules are expected to apply to the Pluto LNG Project from 1 July 2023 and the Wheatstone LNG Project from 1 July 2024. The announcement also included a commitment to remake the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Regulation 2015 (Cth) (GTP Regulation). The price of sales gas, which is processed into LNG, and the treatment of tolling arrangements are determined under the GTP Regulation. On 22 December 2023, the Australian Government released an Exposure Draft of a remade GTP Regulation for consultation.\n- \u00b7  Australia's competition laws contained in the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth), which prohibit, among other things, engaging in conduct with the purpose or e/ffect of substantially lessening competition, price fixing, cartel conduct, market sharing, concerted practices or bid rigging. The Act was also recently amended by the Competition and Consumer (Gas Market Code) Regulations 2023 (Cth) (Gas Code), which became e/ffective on 11 July 2023, to allow for the imposition of gas price controls in the eastern Australian gas market. Currently, the price of gas produced by Woodside and supplied into the eastern Australian gas market is capped at $12/ GJ until 1 July 2025. The price cap may be updated by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission every two years. The Gas Code also introduces a mandatory code of conduct that establishes minimum conduct and process standards for commercial negotiations for wholesale gas contracts, including good faith obligations and a 'reasonable pricing' provision.\n- \u00b7  The Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism (ADGSM), established pursuant to the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 (Cth) and the Customs (Prohibited Exports) (Operation of the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism) Guidelines 2023 (Cth), by which the Australian Government can require LNG projects to prohibit exports or find o/ffsetting sources of gas, to ensure that there are su/fficient supplies of natural gas for domestic use. The ADGSM is intended to be a measure of last resort where market based solutions and other regulatory interventions have failed.\n\n- \u00b7  Laws protecting the rights and interests of First Nations Australians and their cultural heritage. Since 1992, Australian common law has recognised that, in certain circumstances, First Nations Australians may have rights and interests over land and waters in accordance with their traditional laws and customs. The Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (NTA) and complimentary state legislation recognise and protect the native title rights and interests of native title holders and registered native title claimants. Multiple pieces of Australian state and federal government legislation protect Aboriginal cultural heritage, rights and access to land in Australia and many of these laws are subject to review and change to ensure a greater level of involvement of First Nations Australians in decisions that may impact cultural heritage and other rights and interests.\n- \u00b7  The Greater Sunrise Special Regime (GSSR), established pursuant to the Maritime Boundaries Treaty which came into force on 30 August 2019. Woodside holds production sharing contracts and retention leases covering its petroleum interests within GSSR under joint Australian/Timor-Leste administrative control.\n- \u00b7  The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (Cth) (FATA), regulations under the FATA and Australia's Foreign Investment Policy, which are intended to encourage foreign investment in Australia that is not contrary to the Australian national interest. As Woodside is a reporting entity of a critical gas asset within the meaning of the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (Cth), it is considered a 'national security business' under the FATA, meaning that certain investments by foreign investors (including foreign government investors) must be notified to the Australian Government and require prior approval from the Australian Treasurer in accordance with the FATA.\n- \u00b7  There is legislation covering work health and safety (WHS) in both state and federal jurisdictions, with separate onshore and o/ffshore regulation. WHS laws aim to protect workers' health and safety by imposing obligations on all parties who are in a position to contribute to the management of workplace risks, including manufacturers and suppliers of equipment and substances, as well as employers and workers (including employees and contractors). Among other things, Woodside, as operator of both onshore and o/ffshore facilities, is required to develop and comply with a comprehensive 'safety case' which describes the facility and provides details on the hazards and risks associated with the facility, the risk controls and the safety management system that will be used to minimise relevant risks.\n- \u00b7  State legislation regulates matters such as long service leave, workers' compensation, as well as anti-discrimination and equal opportunity.\n- \u00b7  The OPGGSA also provides the legislative framework for CCS and CCUS projects in o/ffshore areas beyond coastal waters and the grant of assessment permits, holding leases and injection licences. Within Western Australian coast waters, on 29 November 2023, the Western Australian Government recently introduced the Petroleum Legislation Amendment Bill 2023 (WA) to enable the transportation and geological storage of GHG in Western Australia.",

        "page_content": "## United States\n\nIn the United States, numerous federal agencies regulate specific portions of the industry and Woodside's US operations. The US Federal Government directly regulates the development of hydrocarbon interests on federal lands, including those in the US Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and elsewhere in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Federal leasing activities in recent years have been subject to political scrutiny and motivations, material uncertainties, delays, and legal challenges relating to potential impacts from climate change related to new o/ffshore exploration and production or the adequacy of federal environmental reviews performed in connection with GOM lease auctions. Woodside is also subject to the following laws and regulatory agencies, among others.\n\n## OCS regulation\n\nThe Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) governs Woodside's hydrocarbon activities on federal o/ffshore oil and natural gas leases in the GOM. The OCSLA empowers the Department of the Interior (DOI), through its agencies the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR), to administer and create regulations concerning the exploration and development of minerals in the OCS.\n\nLeases on the OCS, which contain relatively standardised terms, are awarded under OSCLA authority through scheduled lease sales by BOEM based on competitive bidding and require compliance with detailed BSEE and BOEM regulations and orders issued pursuant to various federal laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA). For certain exploration and development activities, lessees are also required to obtain environmental permits from agencies such as the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nCertain OCS activities are also subject to regulation under US Maritime Law by the US Coast Guard. In addition, o/ffshore pipelines, including those located in the GOM, are subject to federal regulation including under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), under the US Department of Transportation. BSEE has also adopted regulations for o/ffshore pipelines under its jurisdiction covering similar matters.\n\nMoreover, our US operations in the GOM are subject to extensive requirements related to the plugging and abandonment of wells and decommissioning of o/ffshore structures and equipment. We may be required to post substantial financial assurance, such as surety bonds, or to otherwise demonstrate financial capability to support these decommissioning obligations, such as through access to insurance, the costs of which could be material. Further, BOEM is currently considering, through proposed updated financial assurance regulations, increasing its supplemental bonding requirements. Any such increase could generally drive up our operating costs by increasing the amount of security we are required to post and, in turn, stress the capacity of the surety bond market to provide sufficient bonds to meet resulting demands from the o/ffshore oil and gas industry.\n\n## Environmental regulation\n\nThe Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations govern emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and other authorisation requirements. Since 2009, the EPA has been monitoring and regulating GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, from certain sources in the oil and gas sector due to their association with climate change. In addition, international climate e/fforts, including the 2015 Paris Agreement and the 2021 and 2022 Conferences of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change have resulted in commitments from many countries to reduce GHG emissions and have called for parties to eliminate certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue further action on non-carbon dioxide GHGs.\n\nIn August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), which expands policy support and incentives for deployment of CCUS, hydrogen and other lowcarbon projects, including several enhancements to federal tax credits. The IRA also establishes a charge on methane emissions above a certain methane intensity threshold for facilities that report their GHG emissions under the EPA's GHG Emissions Reporting Program Part 98 regulations. The methane emissions charge will be imposed beginning with respect to emissions reported for calendar year 2024. The methane emissions charge could increase our operating costs, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nIn December 2023, the EPA published a final rule to reduce methane and other pollution from oil and natural gas operations. Among other things, the final rule will phase out routine flaring of natural gas from new oil wells, require all well sites and compressor stations to be routinely monitored for leaks and provide companies greater flexibility to use innovative and coste/ffective methane detection technologies. The IRA and the final rule will impact Woodside's Shenzi asset and any future acquired GOM-operated assets.\n\nThe exploration, production, and transportation of crude oil and natural gas involves risk that hazardous liquids or flammable gases may be released into the environment and may cause substantial harm to the environment, natural resources, or human health and safety. Such incidents, as well as failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, may result in material expenditures for response actions, significant government civil or criminal fines and penalties, liability to government agencies for natural resources damages, and significant business interruption. In addition, a spill on or related to our properties and operations could expose us to joint and several and strict liability, without regard to fault. Existing and new laws and regulations could require us to evaluate and upgrade existing infrastructure and operational practices on an accelerated basis or pursue additional capital projects, any or all of which could result in increased operating costs, which in turn could have a material adverse e/ffect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nLaws and regulations are frequently subject to change, and the general trend in the United States has been for these governmental agencies to continue to evaluate and, as necessary, develop and implement new, more restrictive permitting, performance and disclosure requirements, particularly with respect to the protection of the environment, GHG emissions, natural resources, and worker health and safety. The 2024 US election cycle (including a presidential election) contributes to uncertainty on the future",

In addition, o/ffshore wind and carbon sequestration have the potential to increase competing uses of the OCS, which may limit future opportunities for o/ffshore oil and gas operations. The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing or imposing greater restrictions on exploratory or development drilling for oil and gas for economic, political, social, environmental or other reasons could have a material adverse e/ffect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## Senegal\n\nIn Senegal, Woodside's PSC and the prospecting, exploration, exploitation and transportation of hydrocarbons, as well as the tax rules for such activities, are primarily governed by Law no. 9805 dated 8 January 1998 (Petroleum Code) and its implementing decree no. 98-810 dated 6 October 1998. The Petroleum Code determines that the Senegalese Ministry of Petroleum and Energy is the competent authority for its implementation and is responsible for authorising activities for oil and gas prospecting, exploration, exploitation and transportation. While a revised Petroleum Code was introduced in 2019, the terms of that legislation state that any PSC issued prior to the introduction of the 2019 Petroleum Code retain their legal regime, and as such, the 1998 Petroleum Code continues to apply to Woodside's PSC. There is also other legislation and regulation that applies to Woodside's activities in Senegal including, without limitation, in respect of the environment and local content requirements.\n\n## MATERIAL LIMITATIONS\n\nWoodside has certain obligations as part of its operations in Western Australia to provide natural gas into the Western Australian domestic market. Please refer to 'Government regulations - Domestic gas reservation policy' in this section for further information.\n\nWoodside is subject to ordinary course production sharing contract limitations in Senegal. Refer to 'Government regulations\n\n- - Other jurisdictions' in this section for further information.\n\n## SUMMARY OF MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nWoodside is involved from time to time in legal proceedings and governmental investigations of a character normally incidental to its business, including claims and pending actions against it seeking damages, or clarification or prosecution of legal rights and regulatory inquiries regarding business practices. Insurance or other indemnification protection may o/ffset the financial impact on Woodside of a successful claim.\n\nExcept as set forth below, there are no governmental, legal or arbitral proceedings (including any such proceedings which are pending or threatened and of which Woodside is aware) which may have, or have had during the 12 months prior to the date of this report, a significant e/ffect on Woodside's financial position or profitability:\n\n- \u00b7  In June 2022, the Australian Conservation Foundation Incorporated (ACF) (represented by the Environmental Defenders O/ffice Ltd) commenced Federal Court of Australia proceedings in relation to the environmental assessment of the Scarborough project. The ACF is seeking a final injunction to restrain Woodside from carrying out o/ffshore project activities for the Scarborough project. The trial has been set down for an estimate of three weeks, commencing on 2 September 2024.\n- \u00b7  In addition, the proceedings arising from the application filed by the Conservation Council of Western Australia (CCWA) seeking judicial review of a decision by the CEO of the Western Australian Department of Water and Environmental Regulation to grant Woodside a works approval for the Pluto Train 2 project were settled in 2023.",

Holders are required to pay all fees for general depositary services provided by Citibank in each of our ADR programs, as set forth in the table below.\n\n| Service                                                                             | Fees                                                                                       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Issuance of ADSs upon deposit  of shares.                                           | Up to $0.05 per ADS issued.                                                                |\n| Cancellation of ADSs.                                                               | Up to $0.05 per ADS cancelled.                                                             |\n| Distribution of cash dividends or  other cash distributions.                        | Up to $0.05 per ADS held.                                                                  |\n| Distribution of securities other  than ADSs or rights to purchase  additional ADSs. | Up to $0.05 per ADS held.                                                                  |\n| ADS Services.                                                                       | Up to $0.05 per ADS held on  the applicable record date(s)  established by the Depositary. |\n| Registration of ADS transfers.                                                      | Up to $0.05 per ADS transferred.                                                           |\n| Conversion of ADSs of one series  for ADSs of another series.                       | Up to $0.05 per ADS converted.                                                             |\n\n## FEES PAYABLE BY THE DEPOSITARY TO THE ISSUER\n\nCitibank reimburses Woodside for certain expenses Woodside incurs in connection with its ADR program, subject to certain ceilings. These reimbursable expenses currently include, but are not limited to, legal, accounting and reserve engineer fees, listing fees, expenses related to investor relations in the United States, fees payable to service providers for the distribution of material to ADR holders and expenses to remain in compliance with applicable US laws and NYSE listing standards. Citibank\n\nhas further agreed to waive certain fees in connection with Woodside's ADR program. These waived expenses currently include, but are not limited to, standard costs associated with the administration of the ADR program and certain fees in connection with issuance of ADRs under Woodside's equity compensatory plans. For the year ended 31 December 2023, direct reimbursements and waived fees totalled approximately US$1,633,000. Under certain circumstances, including termination of our ADS program or removal of our Depositary, we may be required to repay to the Depositary a portion of the amounts reimbursed in prior periods.\n\nThe ADSs issued under our ADR programs trade on the NYSE under the stock ticker WDS. As of 13 February 2024, there were 47,844,455 ADSs on issue and outstanding in the Woodside ADS program.\n\nADR holders should deal directly with Citibank on all matters related to their ADRs, using the details below.\n\nEnquiries should be directed to:\n\n## Citibank Shareholder Services\n\nAddress:\n\nPO Box 43077\n\nProvidence Rhode Island\n\n02940-3077\n\nUSA Toll Free:\n\n1-877-CITI-ADR\n\nInternational:\n\n+1 781 575 4555\n\nEmail:\n\ncitibank@shareholders-online.com\n\n## Investor Relations enquiries\n\nAddress:\n\nWoodside Energy Group Ltd\n\nMia Yellagonga\n\n11 Mount Street\n\nPerth WA 6000\n\nPostal address:\n\nGPO Box D188 Perth WA 6840\n\nTelephone:\n\n+61 8 9348 4000\n\nEmail:\n\ninvestor@woodside.com\n\nWebsite:\n\nwoodside.com\n\n## EXCHANGE CONTROLS\n\nUnder Australian foreign exchange controls currently in e/ffect, transfers of capital to and from Australia are not subject to prior government approval and, except as described below, Australia does not restrict the flow of currency into or out of the country. Regulations may be made under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) of Australia (AML/CTF Act) prohibiting the entering into of transactions involving prescribed foreign countries. As of the date of this report, no such regulations are in place. To control tax evasion and money laundering, the AML/CTF Act also requires certain transactions to be reported to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) and prohibits reporting entities from providing certain 'designated services' to customers without having complied with certain obligations under the AML/CTF Act (for example 'know your customer' checks). In addition, the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth) (FTR Act) imposes certain obligations on solicitors and 'cash dealers' to report 'significant cash transactions'. The Autonomous",

There are no specific restrictions regarding the remittance of profits, dividends or capital.\n\n## TAXATION\n\nThis section describes the material United States and Australian Federal income tax consequences to a US holder (as defined below) of owning shares or ADSs (together, 'Woodside Securities'). It applies to you only if you acquire your shares or ADSs and you hold your shares or ADSs as capital assets for tax purposes. This discussion addresses only United States and Australian Federal income taxation and does not discuss all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your individual circumstances, including foreign, state or local tax consequences, estate and gift tax consequences, and tax consequences arising under the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax. This section does not apply to you if you are a member of a special class of holders subject to special rules, including:\n\n- \u00b7  a dealer in securities,\n- \u00b7  a trader in securities that elects to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for securities holdings,\n- \u00b7  a tax-exempt organisation,\n- \u00b7  a life insurance company,\n- \u00b7  a person that actually or constructively owns 10% or more of the combined voting power of our voting stock or of the total value of our stock,\n- \u00b7  a person that holds shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction,\n- \u00b7  a person that purchases or sells shares or ADSs as part of a wash sale for tax purposes, or\n- \u00b7  a person whose functional currency is not the US dollar.\n\nThis section is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations, published rulings and court decisions, all as currently in e/ffect, as well as on the Convention Between the United States of America and Australia (the 'Treaty'). These authorities are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. In addition, this section is based in part upon the representations of the Depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.\n\nYou are a US holder if you are a beneficial owner of shares or ADSs and you are, for United States Federal income tax purposes:\n\n- \u00b7  a citizen or resident of the United States,\n- \u00b7  a domestic corporation,\n- \u00b7  an estate whose income is subject to United States Federal income tax regardless of its source, or\n- \u00b7  a trust if a United States court can exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one or more United States persons are authorised to control all substantial decisions of the trust.\n\nIf an entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for United States Federal income tax purposes holds the shares or ADSs, the United States Federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership. A partner in a partnership holding the shares or ADSs should consult its tax advisor with regard to the United States Federal income tax treatment of an investment in the shares or ADSs.\n\nYou should consult your own tax advisor regarding the United States Federal, state and local and Australian Federal tax consequences of owning and disposing of shares and ADSs in your particular circumstances. In particular, you should confirm whether you qualify for the benefits of the Treaty and the consequences of failing to do so.\n\nIn general, and taking into account the earlier assumptions, for United States Federal income tax purposes, if you hold ADRs evidencing ADSs, you will be treated as the owner of the shares represented by those ADRs.\n\nExchanges of shares for ADRs, and ADRs for shares, generally will not be subject to United States Federal income tax.\n\n## Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences\n\nThe tax treatment of your shares or ADSs will depend in part on whether or not we are classified as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for United States Federal income tax purposes. Except as discussed below under 'PFIC Classification', this discussion assumes that we are not classified as a PFIC for United States Federal income tax purposes.\n\n## Taxation of Distributions\n\nUnder the United States Federal income tax laws, the gross amount of any distribution we pay out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for United States Federal income tax purposes), other than certain pro-rata distributions of our shares, will be treated as a dividend that is subject to United States Federal income taxation. If you are a non-corporate US holder, dividends that constitute qualified dividend income will be taxable to you at the preferential rates applicable to long-term capital gains provided that you hold the shares or ADSs for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date and meet other holding period requirements.\n\nDividends we pay with respect to the shares or ADSs generally will be qualified dividend income provided that, in the year that you receive the dividend, we are eligible for the benefits of the Treaty. We believe that we are currently eligible for the benefits of the Treaty and we therefore expect that dividends on the shares and ADS will be qualified dividend income, but there can be no assurance that we will continue to be eligible for the benefits of the Treaty.\n\nYou must include any Australian tax withheld from the dividend payment in this gross amount even though you do not in fact receive it. The dividend is taxable to you when you, in the case",

        "page_content": "of shares, or the Depositary, in the case of ADSs, receive the dividend, actually or constructively. The dividend will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to United States corporations in respect of dividends received from other United States corporations. The amount of the dividend distribution that you must include in your income will be the US dollar value of the Australian dollar payments made, determined at the spot Australian dollar/US dollar rate on the date the dividend is distributed, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into US dollars. Generally, any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the date the dividend is distributed to the date you convert the payment into US dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the special tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income. The gain or loss generally will be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for United States Federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of your basis in the shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain. However, we do not expect to calculate earnings and profits in accordance with United States Federal income tax principles. Accordingly, you should expect to generally treat distributions we make as dividends.\n\nSubject to certain limitations, the Australian tax withheld in accordance with the Treaty and paid over to Australia will generally be creditable against your United States Federal income tax liability. To the extent a reduction or refund of the tax withheld is available to you under Australian law or under the Treaty, the amount of tax withheld that could have been reduced or that is refundable will not be eligible for credit against your United States Federal income tax liability.\n\nDividends will generally be income from sources outside the United States and will generally be 'passive' income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to you.\n\n## Taxation of Capital Gains\n\nIf you are a US holder and you sell or otherwise dispose of your shares or ADSs, you will recognise capital gain or loss for United States Federal income tax purposes equal to the di/fference between the US dollar value of the amount that you realise and your tax basis, determined in US dollars, in your shares or ADSs. Your tax basis would generally equal the cost of your shares or ADSs, or if you received the shares or ADSs pursuant to a taxable distribution, the fair market value of the shares or ADSs at the time of such distribution, reduced by any distributions on the shares or ADSs that were treated as a return of capital for United States Federal income tax purposes. Capital gain of a noncorporate US holder is generally taxed at preferential rates where the property is held for more than one year. The gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Your ability to deduct capital losses is subject to limitations.\n\n## PFIC Classification\n\nWe believe that we should not be currently classified as a PFIC for United States Federal income tax purposes and we do not expect to become a PFIC in the foreseeable future. However, this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus may be subject to change. It is therefore possible that we could become a PFIC in a future taxable year.\n\nIn general, we will be a PFIC in a taxable year if:\n\n- \u00b7  at least 75% of our gross income for the taxable year is passive income; or\n- \u00b7  at least 50% of the value, determined on the basis of a quarterly average, of our assets in such taxable year is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income.\n\nIf we were to be treated as a PFIC and you are a US holder, gain realised on the sale or other disposition of your shares or ADSs would in general not be treated as capital gain. Instead, you would generally be treated as if you had realised such gain and certain 'excess distributions' ratably over your holding period for the shares or ADSs and would be taxed at the highest tax rate in e/ffect for each previous year to which the gain was allocated in which we were a PFIC with respect to you, together with an interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such year. With certain exceptions, your shares or ADSs will be treated as stock in a PFIC if we were a PFIC at any time during your holding period in your shares or ADSs. Dividends that you receive from us will not be eligible for the special tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income if we are a PFIC or are treated as a PFIC with respect to you either in the taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year, but instead will be taxable at rates applicable to ordinary income. If you own shares or ADSs during any year that we are a PFIC with respect to you, you may be required to file Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') Form 8621.\n\n## Material Australian tax considerations\n\nThis section is based on the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations, published rulings and court decisions, all as currently in e/ffect, as well as on the Convention Between the United States of America and Australia (the 'Treaty'). These authorities are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.\n\nDividends (including other distributions treated as dividends for Australian tax purposes) paid by Woodside to a US Holder that is not an Australian resident for Australian tax purposes will generally not be subject to Australian withholding tax if they are fully franked (broadly, where a dividend is franked, tax paid by Woodside is imputed to the shareholders).",

        "page_content": "Dividends paid to such US Holders, which are not fully franked, will generally be subject to Australian withholding tax not exceeding 15% only to the extent (if any) that the dividend is neither:\n\n- \u00b7  franked; nor\n- \u00b7  declared by Woodside to be conduit foreign income. (Broadly, this means that the relevant part of the dividend is declared to have been paid out of foreign source amounts received by Woodside that are not subject to tax in Australia, such as dividends remitted to Australia by foreign subsidiaries).\n\nThe Australian withholding tax outcome described above applies to US Holders who are eligible for benefits under the Tax Convention between Australia and the US as to the Avoidance of Double Taxation (the Australian Tax Treaty). Otherwise, the rate of Australian withholding tax may be 30%.\n\nIn contrast, dividends (including other distributions treated as dividends for Australian tax purposes) paid by Woodside to a US Holder may instead by taxed by assessment in Australia if the US Holder:\n\n- \u00b7  is an Australian resident for Australian tax purposes (although tax will generally not exceed 15% where the US Holder is eligible for benefits under the Australian Tax Treaty as a treaty resident of the US and any franking credits may be creditable against their Australian income tax liability); or\n- \u00b7  carries on business in Australia through a permanent establishment as defined in the Australian Tax Treaty, or performs personal services from a fixed base in Australia, and the shareholding in respect of which the dividend is paid is e/ffectively connected with that permanent establishment or fixed base, (however, in such a case any franking credits may be creditable against the Australian income tax liability).\n\nThe treatment of dividends outlined above may be modified where the shareholding in Woodside is held through a trust, limited partnership, limited liability company, pension fund, sovereign wealth fund or other investment vehicle. A/ffected US Holders should seek their own advice in relation to such arrangements.\n\n## Material Australian tax considerations-disposals of Woodside Securities\n\nGains made by US Holders on the sale of Woodside Securities will generally not be taxed in Australia.\n\nHowever, the precise Australian tax treatment of gains made by US Holders on the sale of Woodside Securities generally depends on whether or not the gain is an Australian sourced gain of an income nature for Australian income tax purposes.\n\nWhere the gain is of an income nature, a US Holder will generally only be liable to Australian income tax on an assessment basis (whether or not they are also an Australian resident for Australian tax purposes) if:\n\n- \u00b7  they are not eligible for benefits under the Australian Tax Treaty and the gain is sourced in Australia for Australian tax purposes; or\n- \u00b7  they are eligible for benefits under the Australian Tax Treaty but the gain constitutes any of the following (in which case the gain will be deemed to have an Australian source):\n- \u203a business profits of an enterprise attributable to a permanent establishment situated in Australia through which the enterprise carries on business in Australia; or\n- \u203a income or gains from the alienation of property that form part of the business property of a permanent establishment of an enterprise that the US Holder has in Australia, or pertain to a fixed base available to the US Holder in Australia for the purpose of performing independent personal services; or\n- \u203a income derived from the disposition of shares in a company, the assets of which consist wholly or principally of real property (which includes rights to exploit or to explore for nature resources) situated in Australia, whether such assets are held directly or indirectly through one or more interposed entities.\n\nWhere the gain is not taxed as Australian sourced income, the US Holder will generally only be liable to Australian capital gains tax on an assessment basis if they acquired (or are deemed to have acquired) their Woodside Securities after 19 September 1985 and one or more of the following applies:\n\n- \u00b7  the US Holder is an Australian resident for Australian tax purposes; or\n- \u00b7  the Woodside Securities have been used by the US Holder in carrying on a business through permanent establishment in Australia; or\n- \u00b7  the Woodside Securities constitute an 'indirect Australian real properly interest' for Australian CGT purposes - this will generally be the case if the US Holder (either alone or together with associates) directly or indirectly owns or owned 10% or more of the issued share capital of Woodside at the time of disposal or throughout a 12-month period during the two years prior to the time of disposal and, at the time of the disposal, the sum of market values of Woodside's assets (held directly or through interposed entities) that are not taxable Australian real property at that time (which, for these purposes includes mining, quarrying or prospecting rights in respect of minerals, petroleum or quarry materials situated in Australia); or\n- \u00b7  the US Holder is an individual who is not eligible for benefits under the Australian Tax Treaty as a treaty resident of the US and elected on becoming a non-resident of Australia to continue to have the Woodside Securities subject to Australian capital gains tax.\n\nIn certain circumstances, if the Woodside Securities constitute an 'indirect Australian real property interest' for Australian CGT purposes, the purchaser may be required to withhold under the non-resident CGT withholding regime an amount equal to 12.5% of the purchase price in situations including where the acquisition is undertaken by way of an o/ff-market transfer. It has been announced this withholding rate will be increased to 15% in respect of sale contracts entered into on or after 1 January 2025. A/ffected US Holders should seek their own advice in relation to how this withholding regime may apply to them.\n\nThe comments above on the sale of Woodside Securities do not apply:\n\n- \u00b7  to temporary residents of Australia who should seek advice that is specific to their circumstances; or\n- \u00b7  if the Investment Management Regime (IMR) applies to the US Holder, which exempts from the Australian income tax and capital gains tax gains made on disposal by certain categories of non-resident funds - called IMR entities - of (relevantly) portfolio interests in Australian public companies (subject to a number of conditions). The IMR exemptions broadly apply to widely held",

In addition to the financial information contained in this report presented in accordance with IFRS, certain 'non-IFRS financial measures' (which also constitute non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K under the US Securities Act on 1933, as amended) have been included in this report. These measures include EBIT, EBITDA, EBITDA excluding impairment, Gearing, Underlying NPAT, Net debt, Free cash flow, Operating cash flow, Capital expenditure, Exploration expenditure, return on equity and return on average capital employed. Net tangible assets, Net tangible asset per ordinary security. These nonIFRS financial measures are defined in section 6.7 - Glossary, units of measure and conversion factors. This section provides a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS in Woodside's Financial Statements.\n\nWoodside's management uses these measures to monitor Woodside's financial performance alongside IFRS measures to improve the comparability of information between reporting periods and business units and Woodside believes that the non-IFRS financial measures it presents provide a useful means through which to examine the underlying performance of its business. Undue reliance should not be placed on the nonIFRS financial measures contained in this report. The non-IFRS financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or alternative to, or as superior to, measures of financial performance, financial position or cash flows reported in accordance with, or other figures determined in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures are not uniformly defined by all companies, including those in Woodside's industry. Accordingly, such measures may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies.\n\nAlthough certain non-IFRS data has been extracted or derived from Woodside's Financial Statements, this data has not been audited or reviewed by Woodside's independent auditors. You are urged to read carefully the audited Full-year Financial Statements and related notes thereto.\n\n## DEFINITION AND CALCULATION OF NON-IFRS FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\n| Non-IFRS financial  information            | Why is the non-IFRS financial information useful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Calculation methodology                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| EBIT                                       | Used to assess the Group's operational profitability excluding net finance costs  and taxation expense.

        "page_content": "## Information about this report\n\n## UNREASONABLE PREJUDICE\n\nAs permitted by sections 299(3) and 299A(3) of the Corporations Act 2001 , we have omitted certain information from our operating and financial review and Directors' report in relation to our business strategy, future prospects and likely developments in our operations and the expected results of those operations in future financial years. We have done this on the basis that such information, if disclosed, would be likely to result in unreasonable prejudice to Woodside (for example, because the information is premature, commercially sensitive, confidential or could give a third-party a commercial advantage). The omitted information relates to our internal budgets, forecasts and estimates, details of our business strategy, and LNG contractual pricing.\n\n## FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements with respect to Woodside's business and operations, market conditions, results of operations and financial condition, including, for example, but not limited to, outcomes of transactions, statements regarding long-term demand for Woodside's products, development, completion and execution of Woodside's projects, expectations regarding future capital expenditures, the payment of future dividends and the amount thereof, future results of projects, operating activities and new energy products, expectations and plans for renewables production capacity and investments in, and development of, renewables projects, expectations and guidance with respect to production, capital and exploration expenditure and gas hub exposure, and expectations regarding the achievement of Woodside's net equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions reduction and new energy investment targets and other climate and sustainability goals.\n\nAll statements, other than statements of historical or present facts, are forward-looking statements and generally may be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as 'guidance', 'foresee', 'likely', 'potential', 'anticipate', 'believe', 'aim', 'aspire', 'estimate', 'expect', 'intend', 'may', 'target', 'plan', 'strategy', 'forecast', 'outlook', 'project', 'schedule', 'will', 'should', 'seek' and other similar words or expressions. Similarly, statements that describe the objectives, plans, goals or expectations of Woodside are forward-looking statements.\n\nForward-looking statements in this report are not guidance, forecasts, guarantees or predictions of future events or performance, but are in the nature of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions.\n\nThose statements and any assumptions on which they are based are subject to change without notice and are subject to inherent known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other\n\nfactors, many of which are beyond the control of Woodside, its related bodies corporate and their respective o/fficers, directors, employees, advisers or representatives.\n\nImportant factors that could cause actual results to di/ffer materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in commodity prices, actual demand for Woodside products, currency fluctuations, geotechnical factors, drilling and production results, gas commercialisation, development progress, operating results, engineering estimates, reserve and resource estimates, loss of market, industry competition, environmental risks, climate related risks, physical risks, legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, changes in accounting standards, economic and financial markets conditions in various countries and regions, political risks, the actions of third parties, project delay or advancement, regulatory approvals, the impact of armed conflict and political instability (such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine) on economic activity and oil and gas supply and demand, cost estimates, the e/ffect of future regulatory or legislative actions on Woodside or the industries in which it operates, including potential changes to tax laws, the impact of general economic conditions, inflationary conditions, prevailing exchange rates and interest rates and conditions in financial markets, and risks associated with acquisitions, mergers and joint ventures, including di/fficulties integrating businesses, uncertainty associated with financial projections, restructuring, increased costs and adverse tax consequences, and uncertainties and liabilities associated with acquired and divested properties and businesses.\n\nA more detailed summary of the key risks relating to Woodside and its business can be found in section 3.9 - Risk factors. You should review and have regard to these risks when considering the information contained in this report.\n\nIf any of the assumptions on which a forward-looking statement is based were to change or be found to be incorrect, this would likely cause outcomes to di/ffer from the statements made in this report.\n\nInvestors are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Actual results or performance may vary materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements. None of Woodside nor any of its related bodies corporate, nor any of their respective o/fficers, directors, employees, advisers or representatives, nor any person named in this report or involved in the preparation of the information in this report, makes any representation, assurance, guarantee or warranty (either express or implied) as to the accuracy or likelihood of fulfilment of any forward-looking statement, or any outcomes, events or results expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement in this report.",

It should not be relied on as, and is not necessarily, a reliable indicator of future performance, including future security prices.\n\n## CLIMATE STRATEGY AND EMISSIONS DATA\n\nAll greenhouse gas emissions data in this report are estimates, due to the inherent uncertainty and limitations in measuring or quantifying greenhouse gas emissions, and our methodologies for measuring or quantifying greenhouse gas emissions may evolve as best practices continue to develop and data quality and quantity continue to improve.\n\nWoodside 'greenhouse gas' or 'emissions' information reported are net equity Scope 1 GHG emissions, Scope 2 GHG emissions, and/or Scope 3 GHG emissions, as the context requires.\n\nThe glossary and footnotes to this report provide further clarification of 'lower carbon' where applicable. Woodside uses the term 'lower-carbon services' to describe technologies, such as CCUS or o/ffsets, that may be capable of reducing the net greenhouse gas emissions of our customers.\n\nFor more information on Woodside's climate strategy, including references to 'lower carbon' as part of that strategy, and emissions data refer to Woodside's Climate Transition Action Plan and 2023 Progress Report available at woodside.com.\n\n## INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA\n\nThis report contains industry, market and competitive position data based on industry publications and studies conducted by third parties, as well as Woodside's internal estimates and research. These industry publications and third-party studies generally state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. While Woodside believes that each of these publications and third-party studies is reliable and has been prepared by a reputable source, Woodside has not independently verified the market and industry data obtained from these third-party sources and cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such data. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on any of the industry, market and competitive position data contained in this report.\n\nForecasts and other forward-looking information obtained from these sources are subject to the same qualifications and uncertainties as the other forward-looking statements contained in this report and may di/ffer among third-party sources. These forecasts and forward-looking information are subject to uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those\n\ndescribed in section 3.9 - Risk factors and in this section, section 6.8 - Information about this report. These and other factors could cause results to di/ffer materially from those expressed in Woodside's forecasts or estimates or those of independent third parties. While Woodside believes its internal research is reliable and its selection of industry publications and third-party studies and the description of its market and industry are appropriate, neither such research nor these descriptions have been verified by any independent source.\n\n## BASIS OF PRESENTATION\n\nWoodside's Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with the Australian Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and comply with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\n## OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION\n\nIn this report, references to a year are to the calendar and financial year ended 31 December 2023 unless otherwise stated.\n\nAll references to dollars, cents of $ in this report are references to US currency and are stated in Woodside share, unless otherwise stated.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all Woodside results set out in this Annual Report 2023 include the performance of the interests acquired as part of the merger with BHP's petroleum business from 1 June 2022.",
