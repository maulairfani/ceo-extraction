        "page_content": "Review of the Year\n\n## Chair's statement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt is an honour to be writing to you for the first time as Chair of Unilever PLC. Unilever is a great company with a long and distinguished history. There are many strengths on which we can build for the future: great brands, well positioned in fast-growing markets; a geographic footprint that reaches across the developed and emerging world; and a talented and committed workforce. With these strengths, I believe we can deliver attractive levels of growth over both the short and the long term to meet the needs of all our stakeholders.\n\nUnfortunately, results going back several years have not met our and the markets' expectations. We have underperformed relative to a number of our principal competitors. We see this reflected in the share price, with Unilever shares down compared to five years ago, having performed unfavourably against both the FTSE100 and our peer group average.\n\nWhile there were positive and encouraging aspects to the Group's financial results in 2023, as covered in this report, our performance overall was variable. In some areas we are doing reasonably well, such as Beauty & Wellbeing in the US and Home Care in Latin America. Our global Deodorants and Food Solutions businesses also both did well last year. But Ice Cream performed poorly, while Home Care European volumes declined double-digit. Nutrition also saw volumes in Europe decline in the face of rising costs and increased competition. I do believe we have the resource and expertise needed to get our brands growing consistently and competitively. Demonstrating this ability will be a key priority for all of us in 2024 and beyond.\n\n## Results\n\nThe Group delivered underlying sales growth in 2023 of 7%. This was driven mainly by price growth in response to continuing high levels of inflation, although the year did see a welcome return to volume growth as prices began to moderate. Turnover growth was down (0.8)% due to adverse currency and net disposals. Underlying operating margin was\n\nI believe we have the resource and expertise needed to get our brands growing consistently and competitively again. \" \"\n\nIan Meakins Chair\n\nup 60bps on the prior year, to 16.7%, driven by improvements in gross margin. However, overheads were up by 10bps highlighting the opportunity to drive further productivity. Operating margin was down 150bps due to the one-off gain on disposal of the global tea business in 2022.\n\nUnderlying earnings per share (EPS) was up only 1.4% because of a negative currency impact of 9.6%, driven by our exposure to emerging markets. The lack of EPS growth is the primary reason why our share price has been flat over recent years.\n\nCash flow performance was strong. We returned \u20ac5.9 billion to shareholders in 2023 through dividends and share buybacks, having completed the final two \u20ac750 million tranches of our \u20ac3 billion buyback programme during the year. We have announced a further buyback programme of \u20ac1.5 billion for 2024.\n\n## Growth Action Plan\n\nOrganic growth of our brands is the number one priority and our CEO, Hein Schumacher - who took over on 1 July 2023 has wasted no time in putting into effect a concrete action plan to accelerate growth, drive productivity and simplicity, and sharpen Unilever's performance edge.\n\nThe plan will drive action by focusing on fewer, bigger priorities and by applying a more rigorous approach to execution and delivery. For example, our Power Brands will be prioritised for investment, particularly when it comes to delivering large-scale, differentiated, science-backed innovations. The unmissable brand superiority process will also be rolled out rapidly to ensure we have the right diagnosis and action plans to deliver brand growth and share gains. We will continue to increase brand investment, funded by cost savings and productivity gains. Changes to the organisation will give greater clarity in driving P&L accountability into the five Business Groups. Better management of costs, including a switch to measuring net productivity - rather than gross savings - will help to fund the investments needed to accelerate growth while ensuring we also meet our objective of margin expansion.",

        "page_content": "## Review of the Year\n\nWhile organic growth is the number one priority, the Board will continue to evaluate opportunities to improve Unilever's portfolio to deliver faster growth, as we have done most recently, for example, with the agreement to acquire the fastgrowing K18 prestige hair care brand in the US and with the planned disposal of the non-strategic Elida Beauty personal care brands. Until we have delivered faster organic growth, we do not think we should be considering large-scale acquisitions. We know that accelerated growth through the disciplined implementation of the Growth Action Plan is by far the best route to value creation.\n\n## Climate Transition Action Plan\n\nWe will continue to work hard to become a more sustainable business having made progress again in 2023. We go into 2024 with a sharpened focus around four major platforms that most support our sustainability agenda and our commercial objectives - climate, nature, plastics and livelihoods. Our plans are now fully integrated into the Business Group strategies, which we believe will enable us to make progress on sustainability while also delivering better performance.\n\nClimate change represents one of the biggest threats to the global economy and in March 2024 we published our updated Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP), in advance of an advisory shareholder vote at our Annual General Meeting in May 2024. While there was overwhelming support for our first CTAP at our AGM in 2021, we take nothing for granted and know that the updated CTAP will need to measure up to the higher levels of accelerated delivery now demanded.\n\n## Board and Governance\n\nResponsibility for transforming Unilever's performance will be driven by Hein Schumacher and his Executive team. The Board's role will be to provide appropriate support and challenge to Hein and his team. Ensuring we have a highcalibre Board that approaches this task with energy and conviction will be a key priority for me in 2024 and beyond.\n\nGood governance is vital for all businesses. At times of geopolitical and economic instability like this, it plays a particularly important role in building and retaining trust among a diverse base of stakeholders. Unilever operates to a high level of governance and the Board will maintain this approach going forward.\n\nFollowing widespread consultation, we will bring forward a revised Remuneration Policy for shareholders to consider at the 2024 AGM. The proposals address the constructive feedback we have received, and will form an important part of the measures being taken to sharpen Unilever's performance.\n\nI would like to thank the Board members for their work in 2023. A special thank you to those colleagues who will be stepping down from the Board at the 2024 AGM: Nils Andersen as our former Chair, Judith Hartmann, Youngme Moon and Strive Masiyiwa. Thanks also to Feike Sijbesma, who stepped down in October 2023. Finally, thank you to our two Executive Directors who stood down in 2023: Alan Jope as CEO, on 30 June, and Graeme Pitkethly as Chief Financial Officer, on 31 December.\n\nThe Board is delighted to be working with the new Executive team that Hein has put together, and especially our new CFO, Fernando Fernandez, who was appointed after an extensive internal and external search. From 1 March 2024, we are also very pleased to welcome Judith McKenna to the Board. Judith brings a wealth of experience, most recently as President and CEO of Walmart International.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nThe Board and management of the company are all totally committed to deliver a significant step-up in Unilever's longterm performance, starting in 2024. We have the necessary talent and resources and by focusing hard on driving growth, I am confident we can achieve the step-up required.\n\nI am delighted and honoured to be taking up this role and excited about the possibilities ahead. Unilever is a business with great assets, not least our talented and dedicated workforce. I want to thank each and every one of them for their considerable efforts in 2023. I look forward to meeting more of our Unilever team and working alongside them in 2024.\n\n## Ian Meakins\n\nChair",

I have returned to a company possessing many of the qualities needed to win in today's consumer goods environment: great brands, leading market positions and talented people.\n\nToday, Unilever is also one of the world's most global fastmoving consumer goods businesses, with nearly 60% of turnover in 2023 coming from emerging markets. That is a huge strength in such a highly competitive global environment. A sharpening of the portfolio over recent years and an overhaul of the company's organisational structure have underpinned these strengths further.\n\nThis is key because there is an urgent need now to transform performance in line with Unilever's potential. After a lengthy period in which the share price has underperformed, it is important that we move fast to rebuild investor confidence. That means delivering higher quality, competitive, top- and bottom-line growth, year in, year out. Work to achieve this is well underway with early signs of progress apparent in the results delivered for 2023.\n\n## Results and performance 2023\n\nUnderlying sales growth of 7% was broad-based, across each of the five Business Groups, with two - Beauty & Wellbeing and Personal Care - also delivering good volume growth. Managing the balance of price and volume growth in a period of more normalised inflation will be a key priority for the year ahead. Turnover was \u20ac59.6 billion, down (0.8)% versus the prior year, including (5.7)% adverse foreign exchange translation and (1.7)% from disposals net of acquisitions.\n\nOn the bottom line, underlying operating margin was up 60bps, driven by an improvement of 200bps in gross margin, with 330bps coming in the second half of the year. This enabled us to step up much needed investment behind our brands, by \u20ac0.7 billion in 2023. Free cash flow delivery was strong, at \u20ac7.1 billion, with 111% cash conversion,\n\nre-affirming the financial health of the business. Cash flow from operating activities increased by \u20ac1.5 billion compared to the prior year.\n\nThe quality of growth varied across the Business Groups. Taken across the Group, growth was not competitive. We lost market share and finished the year with the percentage of the business winning share - an imperfect but nevertheless important measure of competitiveness - at only 37% (see page 12). We know this is not good enough and we are moving quickly to address it.\n\nTo that end, we set out a comprehensive and detailed action plan in October to accelerate Unilever's growth and strengthen our competitive position (see pages 4-5).\n\n## Growth Action Plan\n\nThe plan is highly operational, reflecting the need to step up both the quality and the consistency of our execution. It is divided into three elements but is underpinned by one simple premise: the need to do fewer things, better, with greater impact. This idea of greater focus permeates everything we are doing and will remain our lodestar in the months and years ahead. It applies first and foremost to our most important objective - faster growth.\n\n## Faster growth\n\nOur top 30 Power Brands represent our biggest opportunity. They account for around three-quarters of turnover and delivered underlying sales growth of 8.6% in 2023. We are therefore devoting more of our energy and resource to these proven drivers of growth.\n\nWe are not only prioritising these brands for investment whether in marketing support, R&D or in the building of digital capabilities and platforms - but also in ensuring they appeal to consumers across multiple dimensions, making them what we are calling 'unmissably superior'. The initial focus on these",

        "page_content": "## Review of the Year\n\n30 brands is to ensure our plans are executed brilliantly. We will then drive the plans across the wider portfolio.\n\nUnder the Growth Action Plan, we will also scale our innovations more systematically and over longer time horizons, leveraging Unilever's strengths in science and technology more effectively. This will help to fuel the growth of our brands, not least by ensuring we develop and expand the categories in which they compete.\n\nWe have world-leading brands, which we are convinced with the right focus and attention - can drive accelerated levels of growth. Hence, we see no need to pursue transformational acquisitions at this stage. However, we will continue to take opportunities wherever we can to optimise the portfolio. We did this last year with the acquisition of the premium ice cream brand, Yasso, and with the agreement to acquire the prestige hair care brand, K18 (completed in February 2024). We sharpened the portfolio further in 2023 with the disposal of Suave in North America and Dollar Shave Club, and we expect to complete the sale of the Elida Beauty brands by the middle of 2024.\n\n## Productivity and simplicity\n\nStronger growth will be enabled through a combination of higher productivity and reduced complexity - the second pillar of our action plan.\n\nWe are making a number of interventions here, first by restoring gross margin to pre-pandemic levels. This is being done through tighter cost control, including shifting focus from gross savings to net productivity, thereby enabling us to determine more accurately the true level - and impact of costs on profitability. We made progress towards this objective last year with gross margin rising to 42.2%, but have a lot more to do to meet our ambitions and return to more competitive levels.\n\nBy highlighting more clearly where the accountability for costs lies, our new organisational structure is facilitating the delivery of this goal. The implementation of the changes to the organisation are now complete and we are squarely focused on reaping the full benefits of the new simplified model.\n\nThe concept of fewer things, done better, with greater impact applies equally to our sustainability goals. That is why we are honing our sustainability efforts around four critical platforms - climate, nature, plastics and livelihoods - and doing so on the basis of exacting, short-term, measurable and transparent goals, complementing our more long-term objectives.\n\nIn many ways this is a natural extension of the pioneering work led by my predecessors, which has established Unilever as a leader in the field. I am determined we should retain that leadership role, primarily through enhancing our reputation for delivery and for demonstrating even more clearly how progress on sustainability drives business performance.\n\n## Leadership changes and performance culture\n\nWe are approaching the opportunities and challenges ahead with a refreshed leadership team having made a significant number of changes at the most senior levels of the company.\n\nI am excited to be working alongside our new and highly experienced Chair, Ian Meakins. We share a belief in Unilever's potential, as well as a desire to turn potential into performance as soon as possible. I am also delighted to be partnered by our new CFO, Fernando Fernandez, whose experience and knowledge of the consumer goods industry make him well placed to help lead a step-up in Unilever's performance.\n\nFernando is one of a number of changes to the executive team. We have assembled a top team eminently capable of unlocking Unilever's potential through a combination of promoting exceptionally capable internal candidates, by matching experience closely to requirements, as with Peter ter Kulve's appointment as President Ice Cream, and by bringing in world leading talent from outside - such as the announced appointments of Heiko Schipper as President Nutrition and Mairead Nayager as Chief People Officer. See page 87 for more on ULE appointments.\n\nLeadership changes are a necessary condition for achieving the step-up in performance we need, but are not enough by themselves. A key task for the new executive team will be to oversee a dialling-up of Unilever's performance edge. We will do this by making some important shifts in the way we think about, approach and reward performance. Going forward, the emphasis will be on a series of actions designed to achieve a stronger link between performance and reward. Our work here will also be shaped and guided by a streamlined set of leadership behaviours. Again, fewer things, done better, with greater impact.\n\n## Outlook\n\nIt is likely the world economy will remain in a state of flux over the year ahead. The increased volatility brought about by geopolitical tensions and the effects of climate change will continue to bear down on global growth. Consumers across the world will continue to feel the effects of multi-year inflation, although we see inflation easing to more normalised and historic levels in most of our markets. Some of our emerging market geographies were hit last year by significant currency devaluations. We expect to see a slow recovery there in 2024. In Europe, growth will remain subdued, although we remain positive in our outlook for this important Unilever market.\n\nDespite these pressures and uncertainties, we expect underlying sales growth for 2024 to be within our multi-year 3-5% growth range, with more balance between volume and price growth. We have a robust plan and set of responses in place, not just to weather the economic storms, but to put Unilever on the road to more sustained levels of volume-led, competitive growth. The potential at Unilever is significant. We are all focused on doing what is needed to unlock that potential and ensure we deliver improved returns to shareholders.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nFinally, I want to thank my predecessor, Alan Jope, and our outgoing CFO, Graeme Pitkethly, for all their support and for their long service to Unilever. My thanks also to Nils Andersen for his guidance and support during his time as Chair.\n\nIn re-joining Unilever, I have received a very warm and generous reception from colleagues across the company. My appreciation goes to everyone at Unilever for that, as well as for the hard work and commitment that went into delivering the results for 2023. I am confident that together we can go on to achieve great things in the years ahead.\n\nHein Schumacher Chief Executive Officer",

We are now focused on executing the Growth Action Plan, to realise Unilever's full potential. \" \"\n\nFernando Fernandez Chief Financial Officer\n\n## Highlights\n\nTurnover growth down 0.8% due to adverse currency and net disposals.\n\nUSG of 7.0% with a return to positive volumes of 0.2%.\n\n30 Power Brands accretive to growth and margins, with underlying sales up 8.6% and increased brand and marketing investment behind them.\n\nStrong cash conversion of 111% with Free Cash Flow up \u20ac1.9 billion to \u20ac7.1 billion.\n\n## Year in summary\n\nEconomic volatility, continued inflationary and cost of living pressures continued in 2023. While these eased in the second half of the year, uncertainty remained amid geopolitical tensions.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we delivered an improving financial performance, with the return to volume growth and margin rebuilding. The Group generated turnover of \u20ac59.6 billion, operating profit of \u20ac9.8 billion, net profit of \u20ac7.1 billion and free cash flow of \u20ac7.1 billion during the year.\n\n## Growth\n\nTurnover for the year was \u20ac59.6 billion, down (0.8)% versus 2022. Underlying sales growth contributed 7.0%, and we saw a negative impact from acquisitions and disposals of (1.7)%, with the disposals of Tea and Suave partially offset by the inclusion of Nutrafol and Yasso.\n\nBeauty & Wellbeing grew underlying sales by 8.3%, with strong volume growth of 4.4%. Prestige Beauty and Health & Wellbeing continued to grow double-digit and now account for a quarter of Beauty & Wellbeing's turnover. Personal Care grew underlying sales 8.9%, with 3.2% from volume and 5.5% from price, led by strong sales growth of Deodorants. Home Care grew underlying sales 5.9%, driven by 6.8% from price and (0.9)% from volume, with positive volumes in emerging markets offset by a double-digit decline in Europe. Nutrition grew underlying sales 7.7%, with 10.1% from price and volumes down (2.2)% as we responded to higher input costs and a challenging European market. Ice Cream's underlying sales growth was disappointing at 2.3%, with price growth of 8.8% and a volume decline of (6.0)%, reflecting the impact of downtrading in the in-home channels. See page 14 to 33 for more on Business Group performance.\n\nOur 30 Power Brands, identified as a key focus in the Growth Action Plan, contributed around 75% of the Group's turnover and grew 8.6%. The percentage of our business winning market share (a) on a rolling 12-month basis was disappointing at 37%. This poor performance reflects share losses to private label in Europe, consumer shifts to super-premium segments in North America and a significant reduction of unprofitable active SKUs globally. Our competitiveness is not good enough and we are moving quickly to address it.\n\nAcquisition and disposal activities had a negative impact of (1.7)% to turnover, driven by the Tea business disposal, partly offset by strong growth in Nutrafol, which we acquired in 2022. More details on acquisitions and disposals are in note 21 on pages 220 to 222.\n\nEmerging markets (58% of Group turnover) grew underlying sales 8.5%, with 1.6% from volume and 6.9% from price. Latin America, Turkey and Africa delivered double-digit growth. India grew midsingle digit led by volume, with lower input costs that led to negative pricing in the fourth quarter. Sales in China grew lowsingle digit led by volume while the market recovery continued to be uneven and slower than expected. Growth in South East Asia was impacted by a sales decline in Indonesia in the fourth quarter as consumers avoided the brands of multinational companies in response to the geopolitical situation in the Middle East.\n\nUnderlying sales in developed markets (42% of Group turnover) grew 4.8% in the full year with 6.7% from price and (1.8)% from volume. North America delivered strong growth of 5.8% with 2.5% from volume and 3.3% from price, with continued double-digit underlying sales growth in Prestige Beauty and Health & Wellbeing. Volume growth in North America accelerated throughout the year leading to volume growth of 6.3% in the fourth quarter. In Europe, underlying sales growth was 4.1%, driven by 12.8% from price given its higher exposure to categories with significant cost inflation, and a volume decline of (7.7)%.",

        "page_content": "## Review of the Year\n\n## Margin\n\nOperating profit was \u20ac9.8 billion which included a gain on disposal of \u20ac0.5 billion mainly related to the disposal of our Suave portfolio spread across Beauty & Wellbeing and Personal Care categories. Meanwhile, there were \u20ac0.5 billion in restructuring costs from transformation technology and supply chain projects, and continued investment to embed the Group's category-focused organisation model. This was down (9.3)% from the prior year primarily due to a gain of \u20ac2.3 billion recognised on the disposal of the global tea business in 2022.\n\nUnderlying operating profit was \u20ac9.9 billion, up 2.6% versus the prior year. Underlying operating margin increased 60bps to 16.7%, with gross margin improving by 200bps to 42.2%. The impact of net material inflation, of around \u20ac1.8 billion was more than mitigated through improved productivity, price and mix. Brand and marketing investment was 14.3% of turnover which was an increase of 130bps. Overheads marginally increased as we continued to invest in the expansion of our Prestige Beauty and Health & Wellbeing businesses.\n\n## Cash, capital allocation and earnings\n\nWe delivered strong cash conversion of 111% and generated free cash flow of \u20ac7.1 billion, an increase of \u20ac1.9 billion compared to 2022. This increase was largely driven by higher underlying operating profit and improved working capital, and included \u20ac0.4 billion linked to a tax refund in India.\n\nIn 2023, we returned \u20ac5.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We completed the final two \u20ac750 million tranches of our \u20ac3 billion share buyback programme. Dividend payments were maintained in line with prior year. Reflecting the Group's continued strong cash generation we announced a share buyback programme of \u20ac1.5 billion to be conducted during 2024.\n\nDiluted earnings per share were \u20ac2.56, a (14.2)% reduction versus prior year which included the gain on the disposal of our Tea business. Underlying earnings per share increased 1.4% to \u20ac2.60, including (9.6)% of adverse currency. Constant EPS increased by 11.0%, reflecting strong operational performance, lower net finance costs and a reduction in the number of shares as a result of the share buyback programme, partially offset by a higher underlying effective tax rate of 25.6%.\n\n## Portfolio reshaping\n\nWe continued to reshape the portfolio, allocating capital to premium segments through selective bolt-on acquisitions and divesting lower-growth businesses while balancing investment in the business and shareholder returns.\n\nWe acquired Yasso Holdings, Inc., a premium frozen Greek yogurt brand in the US, which completed on 1 August, and K18, a premium biotech hair care brand, which completed on 1 February 2024. We also announced three disposals during the year: Suave in North America, which completed on 1 May; Dollar Shave Club, which completed on 1 November; and Elida Beauty, which is expected to complete by mid-2024.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nWe are confident that the Growth Action Plan, which we set out in October 2023, will strengthen our performance within our multiyear financial framework. We will focus on further rebuilding gross margin to reinvest behind our 30 Power Brands, stepping up volume growth and delivering improved competitiveness. Our financial ambition is to deliver Total Shareholder Return (TSR) in the top third of our peer group.\n\n## Our Multi-Year Financial Framework\n\nOur financial framework is to deliver long-term value creation through our Growth Action Plan which will drive earnings growth, a strong cash flow and a growing dividend. Our 2023 results against the framework are below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In Hair Care we compete for global leadership, and our Skin Care portfolio is particularly strong in Asia. Our Prestige Beauty and Health & Wellbeing businesses have a strong presence in high-growth areas including Prestige Skin Care and Hair Care, Colour Cosmetics, and Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements.\n\n## Our performance in 2023\n\nIn 2023 we delivered a strong full year performance. Turnover increased by 1.8%, while underlying sales growth was 8.3% balanced between good volume growth at 4.4% and price at 3.8%, with an unfavourable currency impact of (6.2)% driven by the weakening of currencies in key markets such as India and US.\n\nThe strong full year performance reflects continued doubledigit growth in Prestige Beauty and Health & Wellbeing as well as innovations in our Skin Care and Hair Care brands. Europe delivered strong growth driven by price with slightly negative volume.\n\nOperating profit was \u20ac2.2 billion, which was flat compared to the prior year. Non-underlying items were \u20ac122 million from acquisition and disposal related costs, and restructuring spend, offset by a gain from the disposal of our Suave business in North America. Underlying operating profit was flat compared to the prior year at \u20ac2.3 billion.\n\n## Our strategic priorities\n\nThe enduring consumer trends which make beauty and wellbeing an attractive industry remained in 2023, notably demand for more premium science-backed products, and a desire for inclusive beauty. Our strategy is firmly rooted in these trends and focuses on three key priorities: premiumising our core Hair Care and Skin Care brands; accelerating our high-growth Prestige Beauty and Health & Wellbeing portfolios; and ongoing focus on gross margin through productivity, complexity reduction and strengthening operational execution. Improving our competitiveness in terms of value is a key priority for the year ahead.\n\n## Premiumising our Power Brands\n\nOur Hair Care and Skin Care Power Brands - Sunsilk, TRESemm\u00e9, Dove, Clear, POND's and Vaseline - continue to use science and technology to elevate their superiority credentials, alongside market making to scale innovations. This year we prioritised investment in these brands across our key markets. Sunsilk's strong multi-market execution shows the effectiveness of this approach, with strong growth this year.\n\n## Breakthrough science\n\nMulti-year innovations which support premiumisation provide a key growth platform for our brands - and will help to restore competitiveness in Hair Care, especially in the US and India. This year we rolled out a number of new breakthrough innovations to support the ongoing premiumisation of our Hair Care and Skin Care portfolios.\n\nClear continued its transformation to a premium holistic scalp care offering with a new anti-dandruff formula - Clear Men Scalp Pro Anti-Hair Fall - which was first launched in China last year leading to market share gains. Along with Clear Scalpceuticals Hair Fall Resist, the brand has now expanded the range to three other key markets - Thailand, Turkey and Brazil. POND's also successfully launched an innovation in Indonesia, with further launches in 2024 planned. The POND'S Bright Miracle range includes patented technology for micro-repair.",

        "page_content": "## Review of the Year\n\n## Market-making at scale\n\nAlongside landing new innovations, we are stepping up our focus on market development. The success of Vaseline in recent years exemplifies our approach, following the launch of patented and clinically-proven Gluta Glow skin care technology in South East Asia two years ago. We have now expanded the range to India and a number of Middle Eastern markets, alongside launching another variant, Vaseline ProAge Restore, in Thailand and other South East Asian markets. In the US, Vaseline extended its offering to address the needs of melanin-rich skin, building on the award-winning 'See My Skin' initiative. Radiant X uses specially formulated premium skin care ingredients to fortify the skin and restore its natural radiance.\n\n## Accelerating high-growth portfolios\n\nWe have built our fast-growing Prestige Beauty and Health & Wellbeing portfolios over a number of years, through carefully selected bolt-on acquisitions. Our focus is on accelerating growth in the US, alongside selective international expansion.\n\n## Prestige Beauty\n\nOur Prestige Beauty business continues to deliver consistent double-digit growth and is growing ahead of the premium beauty market globally. We have a strong presence in highgrowth areas such as Prestige Skin Care, Colour Cosmetics and Hair Care, as well as digital commerce channels which accounted for over half of sales this year.\n\nOur Prestige Beauty portfolio includes science-backed skin care Power Brands such as Paula's Choice and Dermalogica, which continue to expand their ranges across specialist beauty and digital channels. Paula's Choice has one of the top selling products in the Amazon US beauty category, with strong growth momentum this year. Dermalogica strengthened its presence in the professional skin care therapist channel, supported by top tier media investment and the launch of new innovations in key markets - such as the LuminFusion treatment which restores skin luminosity and diminishes signs of skin ageing.\n\n## Health & Wellbeing\n\nOur Health & Wellbeing business continued its strong growth momentum in 2023. Liquid I.V. is the biggest health and wellbeing Power Brand in our portfolio. It is the number one functional hydration powder brand in the US, with an expanding range of products such as new sugar-free and kids' variants with essential vitamins, which launched this year. The brand also extended its presence outside of the US for the first time, following a successful launch in Canada - with further international roll-outs planned.\n\nAcquired in 2022, Nutrafol is the number one dermatologist recommended hair growth supplement brand in the US. As a Power Brand, it has strong value creation fundamentals and high-growth potential. To capitalise on this, we have initiated international expansion, starting with China. Nutrafol's brand proposition is supported by 'Shed the Silence', a social mission focused on destigmatising female hair thinning.\n\n## Optimising our portfolio\n\nWe have begun to unlock margin improvement opportunities for our acquired brands by providing access to our technology expertise, international expansion know-how and operational synergies. Our portfolio strategy is designed to increase exposure to higher growth areas and we continue to optimise our portfolio. In February, we made a major divestment through the sale of Suave (which included a Hair Care and Skin Care\n\nportfolio). And at the end of 2023, we signed an agreement to acquire the premium biotech hair care brand K18.\n\n## Focused on gross margin\n\nThis year we delivered a step up in gross margin, supported by our end-to-end productivity and savings programmes, and the new category-focused organisation. We are focused on ensuring that all our brands, and especially our Power Brands, have strong bottom line value creation fundamentals.\n\n## Productivity and savings\n\nIn our supply chain, we have achieved savings through competitive buying of key ingredients such as silicones, as well as vertical integration of supply for surfactants and palm oil. We have also begun work to optimise our North America factory network, alongside investment in our logistics operations to improve customer service and productivity. As part of our simplification agenda, we reduced active SKUs in our portfolio by 27% in 2023.\n\n## Strengthening operational execution\n\nImproving the consistency of our execution and the capabilities that underpin this, remains an important area of focus. In line with our strategy to deliver unmissable superiority, we are investing in competitively differentiated product experience capabilities that are critical to winning in the market - such as packaging and product sensorials - with the support of strategic partners.\n\nThis year, we formed a dedicated team of digital commerce experts to drive growth across our Hair Care and Skin Care Power Brands globally. We are also using our expertise in social and live commerce in China to create new growth opportunities in other key markets, such as Indonesia and the US. And in the modern retail channel, we are working closely with strategic retail partners to create multi-year value creation roadmaps which leverage our portfolio, data, supply chain and digital capabilities.\n\n## Accelerating action on sustainability\n\nOur sustainability agenda is focused on climate, nature and plastic. This year, we initiated a number of long-term partnerships to develop lower GHG alternative ingredients alongside a series of strategic investments through the Climate & Nature Fund to support our brands - see page 40. We continue to explore alternative packaging materials and formats to reduce our use of virgin plastic, leveraging our enhanced packaging and design capabilities.\n\nPOND's successfully launched the Bright Miracle range this year, a multi-market innovation with patented technology.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are the number one Skin Cleansing and Deodorants business, and in Oral Care, we are number four globally, with strong positions in our key markets.\n\n## Our performance in 2023\n\nIn 2023, we delivered positive growth momentum. Turnover increased by 1.4% and we delivered underlying sales growth of 8.9%, good volume growth of 3.2% and 5.5% from price, including an unfavourable currency impact of 6.1% driven by weakening currencies in key markets such as the US and India.\n\nLatin America, Middle East & Turkey, South East Asia and Europe delivered accelerated growth. The turnaround in Europe was particularly notable, following increased focus and investment in key categories.\n\nOperating profit increased by 30.6% compared to the prior year, to \u20ac3.0 billion. A net gain in non-underlying items of \u20ac165 million included a gain on disposal of Suave business in North America offset by restructuring costs. Underlying operating profit increased by 4.2% to \u20ac2.8 billion, driven by a recovery in gross margin from price growth and a slowdown in inflation - partially offset by an increase in brand and marketing investment.\n\n## Our strategic priorities\n\nOur strategic priorities are to: premiumise our portfolio through superior science and technology which meets the needs of our consumers; leverage partnerships for category growth; and step up our impact through gross margin, portfolio optimisation and our sustainability priorities. Restoring competitiveness in the US and India is also a key priority.\n\n## Winning with science-led brands\n\nWe continue to develop our portfolio using breakthrough innovations, supported by science-backed claims and superior fragrance. Our focus is on premium products that offer enhanced functional benefits such as health and hygiene, superior skin cleansing, as well as more tailored benefits including sweat protection.\n\n## Premiumising through superior science and technology\n\nSkin Cleansing is our largest category. This year, we continued to assert our market-leading position through superior technology and value-adding consumer benefits. We launched Dove Body Wash in the US, with 24-hour Renewing MicroMoisture - powered by proprietary technology with moisturising microdroplets which helps to retain moisture and nourish the skin for 24 hours. Lifebuoy, the world's number one hygiene soap brand consolidated its category leadership with the launch of a new Vitamin+ range of hand wash and body wash in South East Asia which boosts the skin's natural immunity.\n\nOur Deodorants portfolio continued to cement its marketleading positions through science-backed technologies and an expanded range of products with tailored benefits. Powered by patented micro-technology, Rexona's multi-year 72-hour sweat protection innovation is now available in multiple markets across the world. Dove Men+Care's new range of deodorants now uses a version of this technology, and is available across a number of North American, European and Latin American markets.",

        "page_content": "## Review of the Year\n\nDove's Advanced Care antiperspirant range for women also launched in the UK and Europe with a patented formula and triple moisturising technology, while Axe launched a Fine Fragrance Collection to compete with super premium branded variants in North America and a number of European markets.\n\nOur Oral Care brands, which include Pepsodent and Closeup, continued to focus on strengthening their core anti-cavity and freshness propositions. Pepsodent relaunched its toothpaste range in a number of key South East Asian markets, supported by science-backed dental claims and free teledentistry. The brand is also expanding its premium range to offer more advanced benefits such as therapeutics and whitening.\n\n## Partnerships for category growth\n\nWe are working with our customers and strategic partners to create category growth opportunities for our brands.\n\n## Growing with key customers\n\nModern retail is our largest channel. We are now consistently recognised as top third tier by the majority of customers in most of the key markets surveyed by an independent customer service benchmark - a significant improvement versus the prior year. This was achieved through more focus on creating category growth opportunities, using our enhanced customer and strategy planning capabilities, as well as building supply chain capacity to support engagement with key hypermarket and supermarket customers.\n\n## Strategic brand partnerships\n\nTo drive category growth with our customers, we have put in place a number of strategic partnerships to support deeper collaboration on brand innovations and in-store activations. For example, we have rolled out a new deodorant category initiative - from premium to value. And in Indonesia, Pepsodent is working with a number of local stores and larger supermarkets through in-store Oral Care Centres to build brand awareness.\n\nThis year, we significantly stepped up our brand and marketing investment through several high-profile football sponsorships. Our first sponsorship deal was with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) for the FIFA Women's World Cup 2023 TM . Rexona, Dove, Lux and Lifebuoy worked with over 30,000 retail stores globally to create a multi-brand, multichannel marketing campaign - engaging a global audience to inspire the next generation of female footballers. The campaign delivered strong results, raising brand awareness and driving incremental growth. Further activations are planned in 2024.\n\nIn late 2023, Rexona, Dove Men+Care, Axe and Radox were also announced as Official Sponsors of UEFA EURO 2024 TM , along with several Nutrition brands.\n\n## Accelerating digital commerce\n\nDigital commerce remains a priority focus in the US, China, India and our largest emerging markets. In China, where around a third of our Personal Care sales come from digital commerce platforms, we launched our new Dove scrub range with a 'social-first' approach, using social platforms and influencer collaborations.\n\n## Stepping up our impact\n\nWe continue to drive savings programmes to support gross margin, as well as optimising our portfolio through disposals.\n\n## End-to-end productivity\n\nOur gross margin recovered this year, following a period of high inflation. Ongoing Net Revenue Management and a focus on our end-to-end productivity programme continue to support margin progression. We have delivered savings across a number of areas, including competitive buying and operational efficiencies in our factories and logistics warehouses. To support the transformation of our end-to-end customer experience, we have implemented new tools and automated systems such as a promotion planning tool.\n\n## Optimising our portfolio\n\nThis year, we made significant progress in the ongoing optimisation of our portfolio. In February, we made a major divestment following the sale of Suave (which included a Skin Cleansing and Deodorant portfolio) and in October we announced the sale of Dollar Shave Club to Nexus Capital Management LP. We also received a binding offer from Yellow Wood Partners LLC to acquire Elida Beauty, with completion expected by mid-2024. We have further simplified our portfolio by delisting a number of brands, as well as reducing active SKUs by around 29% in 2023.\n\n## Innovation-focused sustainability\n\nSustainability is an important part of our strategy and includes a focus on palm oil, plastic and climate. Building on Unilever's goal to deliver a deforestation-free supply chain for five key commodities, including palm oil (see page 40), we are exploring new technology which has the potential to reduce the amount of palm-derived ingredients in our soap bars as well as lowering GHG emissions - without compromising superiority for consumers. Plastic remains an important priority and we continue to focus on reducing the amount of virgin plastic in our portfolio focused on packaging innovations. See page 41 and 46 for more on climate and plastic.\n\nSome of our biggest brands are leveraging their long-term commitment to social issues to drive impact, as a core part of their brand propositions. Dove, Lifebuoy and Pepsodent continued to engage consumers on self-esteem, handwashing and oral hygiene issues this year, through powerful TV advertising, digital activations and on-ground education programmes. Dove's Emmy Awards-nominated 'Cost of Beauty' campaign highlighted the mental health impacts of toxic beauty among young people. See page 66 for the combined reach of our brand purpose programmes.\n\nRexona, Dove, Lux and Lifebuoy worked with customers to create category growth opportunities, as part of our sponsorship of the FIFA Women's World Cup 2023 TM .\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our focus is on three key categories - Fabric Cleaning, Fabric Enhancers and Home & Hygiene.\n\n## Our performance in 2023\n\nIn 2023, we delivered good performance across growth and profile. Turnover decreased by 1.8%. Underlying sales growth was 5.9%, driven by 6.8% from price and offset by volume (0.9)%, with an unfavourable currency impact of (7.2)% driven by weakening of currencies in key markets such as Argentina, India, and Turkey. Emerging markets growth was led by a strong delivery in South Asia and Latin America. India grew volumes despite high pricing. Growth in developed markets was muted as consumers tightened their spending and competitive pressures stepped up, especially in Europe which was flat with double-digit price growth offset by volume declines.\n\nOperating profit for the year was \u20ac1.4 billion, an improvement of 33% compared to the prior year. Non-underlying items were \u20ac77 million, mostly driven by restructuring spends on significant network optimisation with strong delivery of our savings programme. Underlying operating profit was \u20ac1.5 billion, an improvement of 11% compared to the prior year, driven by gross margin expansion with a step-up in brand and marketing investment, and continued R&D investment to drive our Clean Future strategy.\n\n## Our strategic priorities\n\nOur track record of consistent performance provides strong foundations as we respond to increasing competitive pressures and high inflation which are particularly acute in Europe. These challenges, coupled with changing consumer expectations of home care products, demand an even more compelling offering. As well as stain removal and hygiene, consumers are looking for superior, sustainable products, at a price they can afford. Far from seeing cleaning as a chore, a growing number of people actively enjoy it - evidenced by the rise of 'cleanfluencers'.\n\nClean Future is our strategy to tap into the large segment of consumers who want superior products that are sustainable and great value. This is an integrated strategy to drive growth through our biggest brands, in our key markets and across traditional and modern retail, and digital commerce channels.\n\n## Unmissable superiority\n\nWe know that consumers want more than just functional cleaning and hygiene benefits, so our focus is on the whole product offering - from the ingredients and packaging, through to how people use and experience the products in their home.\n\nOMO encapsulates our approach to unmissable superiority. This year, we continued to expand our range of laundry liquids with superior benefits, launching the premium OMO Ultimate Liquid with naturally derived stain removers and enzymes that enhance efficacy, in three European markets. In Brazil, we successfully launched two new OMO variants - OMO Ultra Power with its high level of active ingredients, and OMO Expert Branco Absoluto (Absolute White) which includes shade whitening technology with sensorial fragrance and standout packaging for on-shelf appeal.",

        "page_content": "## Review of the Year\n\n## Standout innovation\n\nWith innovation sitting at the heart of unmissable superiority, this year we stepped up our R&D investment to drive category growth. Domestos Power Foam - a category-defining innovation designed to spray upside down for improved cleaning and convenience - was successfully launched in the UK. Supported by strong customer collaboration to ensure high penetration across the country's top retailers, it provides a blueprint for future roll-outs.\n\nWe are also using our science and technology capabilities to bring new consumer benefits to our products. For example, Comfort Beauty Perfume - which uses a fragrance innovation from our Beauty & Wellbeing Skin Care category - has performed well since its launch in Thailand. We expect to see more crosscategory fertilisation of innovation in the coming years.\n\n## Partnering for impact\n\nAn important driver of unmissable superiority is targeted brand and marketing across a wide range of consumer touchpoints. In 2023, Dirt Is Good, which includes OMO and Persil, signed a two-year commercial partnership with Arsenal men's and women's football teams. We also launched an exclusive multi-market partnership for our brands to reach new and next generation consumers in the #CleanTok cleaning community. This is one of TikTok's largest dedicated communities for its users and a source of home cleaning hacks and entertainment for millions of people who see cleaning as an enjoyable experience.\n\n## Great value\n\nWe are significantly affected by commodity inflation due to the nature of ingredients we use in our products. Creating top and bottom-line value is therefore an important area of focus. Firstly, by offering a range of products to consumers, from affordable to more premium formats, and secondly, through cost management and productivity improvements.\n\n## Value to consumers\n\nCreating a 'good-better-best' portfolio is a core element of our strategy to build a resilient business - from entry-level functional products like laundry soap bars, to laundry liquids and capsules. In India for example, our detergent range includes Wheel which is our mass market value brand, Rin which offers consumers a mid-tier option, and Surf Excel which offers advanced expert cleaning for the premium tier.\n\nWe are expanding our laundry range through new innovative formats. Laundry sheets are convenient, sensorial and made with plant-based and highly biodegradable ingredients. This year, we rolled out laundry sheets through our Robijn brand in the Netherlands, followed by Persil in the UK with an Amazon 'Climate Pledge Friendly' exclusive.\n\n## Focusing on productivity\n\nIn the face of ongoing macroeconomic and competitive pressures, it is imperative that we continue to focus on cost savings across our value chain. In the last two years we have removed around \u20ac1.5 billion in costs, reinvesting the savings to support our brands and innovation programme.\n\nThe Business Group structure has improved visibility of our overheads and created opportunities to become leaner and more agile. This year, we simplified our portfolio by removing around 19% of active SKUs, primarily in Latin America and Europe. Our integrated end-to-end business now also includes procurement, which puts us in a stronger position to buy more competitively.\n\nOur Home Care factories are embracing automation and artificial intelligence to improve productivity. In Brazil, our laundry detergent factory achieved the coveted World Economic Forum Lighthouse status for incorporating Fourth Industrial Revolution practices into its operations. Through digital twinning and machine learning, the factory has improved cost efficiency and agility, while cutting its environmental footprint. Beyond the factory gate, we are also making investments in our supply chain to bring further productivity improvements in the coming years. This includes improving our dispatch capabilities to reduce the distance our products travel to customers.\n\n## Growing with retail customers\n\nCreating value for customers goes beyond efficiencies - it is about partnering to drive mutual growth. According to Advantage Group, a leading benchmark of retailer and customer perceptions for the consumer goods industry, Unilever Home Care was top tier versus industry competitors for driving category growth in 16 out of 21 markets in scope.\n\nThe digitalisation of our customer operations is crucial to optimise the availability of our products in-store and online. In India, we continue to use the B2B Shikhar digital commerce platform to support our market development efforts with traditional 'mom and pop' stores.\n\n## More sustainable\n\nWe are determined to lead an industry-wide transition in the use of more renewable ingredients for our products. This year, we stepped up engagement with our suppliers, including through our first Clean Future Summits in India and China see page 44 for more information. Our multi-year partnership with Arzeda also made good progress with the development of new low carbon, naturally derived enzymes with increased stability, performance and sustainability benefits.\n\nReducing virgin plastic use remains an important area of focus and we continue to develop innovative packaging formats, including recycled plastic and plastic alternatives. We have now rolled out cardboard packaging for Persil and Skip laundry capsules in France and the UK.\n\nDomestos Power Foam launched this year - a categorydefining innovation designed to spray upside down for improved cleaning and convenience.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our biggest brands are Knorr and Hellmann's which focus on the Scratch Cooking and Dressings categories respectively. Together, they accounted for 60% of Nutrition's turnover this year.\n\nOur regional and local brands are focused on four other categories: Functional Nutrition, Healthier Snacking, Plantbased Meat, and Beverages. A number of our brands are sold through Unilever Food Solutions (UFS) which serves professional customers in away-from-home channels.\n\n## Our performance in 2023\n\nWhile turnover decreased by 5.0%, underlying sales growth was 7.7% driven by strong price of 10.1% and offset by volume decline of (2.2)%, with a negative impact of (6.9)% from disposals following the sale of the Tea business. Weakening of currencies in key markets such as Argentina, India, and the US resulted in an unfavourable currency impact of (5.2)%.\n\nGrowth continued to be price-led as we responded to higher food ingredient input costs especially in Europe where volumes were impacted by downtrading from our pricing actions, while South East Asia and South Asia were impacted by local markets factors in India and Indonesia respectively. However, other markets grew strongly including North America and Latin America.\n\nOperating profit was \u20ac2.4 billion, a decrease of (46.3)% compared to the prior year which included a \u20ac2.3 billion gain on the sale of our Tea business. Non-underlying items were \u20ac47 million, primarily driven by restructuring costs. Underlying operating profit was \u20ac2.5 billion, an increase of 0.4% compared to the prior year, driven by gross margin improvement which funded an increase in brand and marketing investment.\n\n## Our strategic priorities\n\nAs part of our multi-year portfolio transformation, over the last five years we have disposed of a number of under-performing businesses. We now have a more advantageous footprint, including a strong presence across faster-growing segments, channels and emerging markets.\n\nThis is reflected in our ambition to be 'a world-class force for good in food' - a growth strategy that aims to deliver consistent, profitable and responsible growth while reasserting our competitiveness. Our growth model is centred on reaching more consumers in strategic channels through our biggest brands offering holistically superior products which aim to satisfy consumer preference on taste, health, trusted ingredients and sustainability. In 2023, we evaluated approximately half of our turnover on these four measures versus competition with more than 80% delivering holistic superiority. (a) Growing profitability ahead of the top line is another important part of our strategy, delivered through end-to-end productivity, supply chain efficiency and strategic pricing.\n\n- (a) We will be evolving our approach to measuring superiority to align with the Unilever-wide focus on 'unmissable superiority' - see page 5.\n\n## Leveraging our Power Brands\n\nKnorr is a global powerhouse in Scratch Cooking Aids. It achieved \u20ac5 billion in turnover this year, largely due to the double-digit growth of bouillon and stock cubes, as well as introducing products tailored to local and regional taste profiles. In India for example, we launched Knorr K-Pots, offering a range of on-trend Korean-inspired mini meals to meet the growing appetite for convenient snacking options. We continue to develop targeted campaigns that inspire healthier diets,",

        "page_content": "## Review of the Year\n\nsuch as 'Knorr Taste Combos' in the US, which was supported by a Grammy award-winning US rapper.\n\nHellmann's is our iconic Dressings brand and the world's number one mayonnaise in terms of global market share, with leading positions in the US, the UK, Brazil and a number of other key markets. With disproportionate pricing required to offset input cost headwinds, Hellmann's market shares came under pressure in 2023, particularly in the US. To address this, we stepped up our investment with a focus on high consumption festivities and seasons as well as popular culture events. This year, for example, was our third consecutive US Super Bowl 'Make Taste, Not Waste' campaign, with around 9.8 billion earned media impressions. We have been rolling out this model to other markets such as in Brazil where Hellmann's signed a new partnership with the NBA - helping to deliver share gains as well as contributing to strong in-market turnover growth.\n\n## Boldly healthier diets\n\nAt the core of our holistic superiority framework is an ambition to be boldly healthier for people and the planet. We continue to increase the nutritional value of our products to align with Unilever Science-based Nutrition Criteria (USNC). This year, we reduced the salt content of Knorr Veggie Bouillon in France by around a quarter, improving its Nutri-Score profile from C to B. We also launched USNC-compliant Knorr Rice Cups in North America. In addition, we are working to double the number of products sold that deliver positive nutrition - foods and beverages that contain meaningful amounts of ingredients such as vegetables and fruits, or micronutrients. At the end of 2023, 81% of our Nutrition and Ice Cream servings sold met USNC and 52% of servings sold delivered positive nutrition. See page 66 for our progress.\n\nWe have also further strengthened our leading market share position in Functional Nutrition in India and returned to growth - with both our Horlicks and Boost brands contributing.\n\n## Growing plant-based\n\nWhile the meat replacement market growth has slowed down in the last year, driven partly by inflationary pressures, consumer interest in wider plant-based lifestyle and diets coupled with the strength of our plant-based portfolio make this an important area of focus that continues to deliver disproportionate growth for us.\n\nWe continued to expand our range of vegan and plant-based alternatives, such as Hellmann's Vegan Mayo which has doubled its turnover over the last three years and is now available in close to 40 markets. Together with our Ice Cream Business Group, we achieved \u20ac1.2 billion in sales from products in scope for our plant-based goal, growing double-digit before applying currency corrections - see page 66 for more. The Vegetarian Butcher grew strongly, supported by partnerships with fast food outlets such as Burger King and Domino's, a strong offer to professional kitchens through Unilever Food Solutions, and novel innovations - such as NoBacon 2.0 with a new plant protein technology and a plant-based meat skewer for restaurants and kebab chains in Europe.\n\n## Accelerating in strategic channels\n\nWe continue to focus on growing our key categories through retailer partnerships - including strong category-specific execution through our Customer Strategy & Planning capability. For example, this year Knorr and Hellmann's worked with Kroger in the US to inspire shoppers to create new recipes with leftover ingredients. And in Europe, we continued to partner with Albert Heijn on growing our share within the plant-based category.\n\nUnilever Food Solutions accounts for around 20% of Nutrition sales and grew double-digit this year with positive volume driven by our strong presence in Europe, North America and North Asia, despite the slow post-pandemic economic recovery in China. End-to-end UFS digitisation continued to deliver greater productivity. In 2023, we further increased the number of professional operators we reach and serve, while continuing to optimise sales force overheads through digital selling scale and efficiencies.\n\nIn addition to foodservice, we further scaled our sales in digital commerce channels, which grew a solid double-digit in 2023, and now represents more than 10% of Nutrition turnover. This was driven by 'top dish' penetration, an important part of our marketing approach which targets consumers with content on how our products can be used in popular local recipes.\n\n## Growing profitability and resilience\n\nInflationary pressures impacted agricultural commodity costs in 2023. The new category-focused organisation with full endto-end accountability and ownership has helped us counteract these pressures at scale - through our comprehensive savings programme and targeted pricing guided by Net Revenue Management - especially in Europe where inflation was particularly high. The savings generated have helped to increase our investment in growth areas - such as our snack pot and noodle factory in Poland to capitalise on the burgeoning premium noodle market in Europe.\n\nAdditionally, we continued to simplify our portfolio. In 2023, we delivered a further 14% reduction in active SKUs. We also reduced food waste in our factories and warehouses - see page 66.\n\nAdopting regenerative agriculture practices helps to build a more resilient supply chain and also reduces GHG emissions. We have initiated a number of projects for our key crops see page 40. Our efforts on nature and agriculture have been recognised externally. We achieved number one ranking in the World Benchmarking Alliance's Food and Agriculture Benchmark for the second consecutive time, and number two ranking in its first Nature Benchmark.\n\nHellmann's US Super Bowl activation entered its third year, generating 9.8 billion earned media impressions in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are focused on expanding operating profit and recovering our global market share, alongside building our brands and accelerating market development. \" \"\n\nPeter ter Kulve\n\nPresident, Ice Cream\n\n## Highlights\n\nVolumes impacted by high price elasticities and less favourable summer weather mainly in Europe.\n\nOut-of-home Ice Cream grew high single-digit driven by pricing moderately offset by volume decline.\n\nMarginal decline in In-home Ice Cream, with volumes down high single-digit broadly offset by pricing.\n\nContinued investment behind the four Ice Cream Power Brands, which generate almost 85% of Ice Cream turnover.\n\n## About Ice Cream\n\nWe are a global market leader in the Ice Cream category across developed and emerging markets, accounting for approximately one-fifth of the market. Our portfolio includes premium Power Brands, such as Magnum and Ben & Jerry's, which have a turnover in excess of \u20ac1 billion. The acquisition of Yasso - a premium frozen Greek yogurt brand in the US - adds to our portfolio strength. Our iconic mainstream brand portfolio includes Wall's and Breyers.\n\n## Our performance\n\nTurnover increased by 0.5%. Underlying sales growth was 2.3%, with a (6.0)% from volume and 8.8% from price, with an unfavourable currency impact of (2.7)% driven by the weakening of currencies in key markets such as Turkey, the US, and Russia.\n\n2023 was a challenging year with a second year of doubledigit material inflation impacting our input costs. The pricing actions we took to protect our margins led to volume decline, while consumer downtrading accelerated competitive pressure from private labels, impacting our overall grocery market share especially in Europe. In the latter part of the year, we started to regain market share in the US. Emerging markets delivered mid-single-digit growth, driven by a strong performance in Turkey.\n\nOperating profit was \u20ac760 million, a decrease of (2.1)% compared to the prior year. Non-underlying items were \u20ac92 million which included primarily restructuring items. Underlying operating profit was \u20ac852 million, a decrease of (7.3)% compared to the prior year driven by lower gross margin due to continued input cost inflation, while brand and marketing investment increased.\n\n## Our strategic priorities\n\nOur innovations have led the industry for many years, and we are convinced our strong fundamentals can sustain our leadership as category builders. Ice cream remains an attractive market with solid growth rates driven by new consumers, omni-channel distribution and a significant premiumisation opportunity - with new entrants accelerating market growth opportunities. Our immediate strategic priority is on global market share and the expansion of operating profit. We will do this by: building our brands; accelerating market development in emerging markets; and by stepping up our performance and productivity.\n\n## Building our Power Brands\n\nWe have a strong premium brand portfolio which is well positioned to meet consumers' desire for superior and indulgent ice cream products and experiences. With competitive pressures ongoing in our markets, we continue to prioritise growth opportunities for our biggest premium brands.\n\n## Premium indulgence\n\nWe have been at the forefront of ice cream innovation for many years and our aim is to continue to lead the category, especially on premium indulgence. Our focus is on creating bigger multi-year innovation platforms for our biggest brands such as Magnum. This year, we launched our biggest ever ice cream innovation: Magnum Double Sunlover and Magnum Double Starchaser - new flavour combinations for 'day and night-time indulgence'. A number of Magnum's product ranges were impacted by consumers temporarily trading down in a high inflationary environment. Our focus for 2024 is to reinforce Magnum's superiority credentials. We are also investing in technologies that allow us to keep our competitive edge - such as Ben & Jerry's newly launched Sundae range. Ben & Jerry's regained growth compared to 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Review of the Year\n\nOur premium Talenti brand consolidated its presence in the fast-growing US premium frozen snacking space, following the launch of four new Talenti Mini Gelato & Sorbetto Bars expanding the range from pints into snacking novelties. Our acquisition of Yasso in mid-2023, now also gives us a foothold in the fast-growing market for healthier and indulgent snacks. Yasso's indulgent low-carbohydrate brand proposition has shown its value creation potential and we see further growth opportunities.\n\n## Differentiated innovation\n\nAs market pressures persist, we are stepping up investment in technologies to help maintain our competitive edge. One area of focus is our expanding non-dairy range, fruit lollies and plantbased alternatives. This year we launched Ben & Jerry's Caramel Caf\u00e9 Sundae range, and Magnum Vegan Raspberry Swirl in Europe. Our plant-based portfolio continued to grow in 2023 - see page 66 for more. We continue to drive global innovation in our mini & bite-sized ice cream portfolio to generate new consumption occasions. This year we launched a new Cornetto & Magnum Minis range and expanded our Mochi portfolio with new flavours in several Asian markets.\n\n## Growing our iconic mainstream brands\n\nOur portfolio includes iconic favourites such as Cornetto. We are the market leader in cones in several key markets and continued to expand this format in Asia this year - notably India and China. We are also repositioning some of our heritage brands, including Wall's Viennetta, with the launch of Mini Viennetta on sticks and in cups in China.\n\n## Growing consumption and market development\n\nWe are the number one player in out-of-home consumption, and a first mover in the direct-to-consumer quick commerce and we see further growth potential. Our Ice Cream Now platform (ICNOW) continues to play a key role in creating consumption occasions throughout the year, and grew double-digit this year. We are working in partnership with digital aggregators and grocery players to ensure our mainstream brands are available, supported by joint retailer promotions. Our Ice Cream business in China is also capitalising on the growing trend of social commerce to create new sales opportunities for our brands.\n\nAround a third of our total Ice Cream turnover is from emerging markets, which had mid-single-digit growth in 2023. Low per-capita consumption coupled with a large consumer base, offer significant future growth opportunities for our iconic mainstream brands.\n\nWe are accelerating market development programmes in our eight biggest emerging markets. Despite currency devaluation and high inflation in Turkey, we are growing competitively and increasing volumes sold - by leveraging our portfolio and through strong sales execution. In China, against a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, we strengthened our competitive position by increasing availability of our brands, with a focus on digital commerce. And in Brazil, we delivered strong sales and margin progression following a multi-year transformation programme.\n\n## Stepping up performance and productivity\n\nA difficult year calls for reflection. Functional integration and especially productivity are the core drivers of our future growth and profitability. Through competitor benchmarking, we have identified significant productivity gaps. Tackling this is especially\n\nimportant to manage the seasonal variation in consumption and profitability. We have already started to implement plans to address these gaps and will continue to prioritize productivity in the coming year.\n\n## Optimising our operating model\n\nWe have put in place a new leadership team to drive competitive intensity and to unlock profitable growth. They have deep operational performance track records, and over half have multi-year Ice Cream category expertise. One of our key priorities is to reduce overheads and we have started work on a plan to deliver best-in-class overhead levels. We are also leveraging the end-to-end organisation launched in 2022 to run our Ice Cream supply chain as a more integrated function. Alongside this work, we are redesigning our distribution networks and optimising our portfolio through active SKU simplification.\n\n## Accelerating our digitalisation programmes\n\nAs the global leader in out-of-home ice cream, we continue to accelerate our digitalisation programmes to help drive faster growth and higher levels of productivity. While we have made some progress, there is more work to do and further value creation opportunities to capitalise on. One area of focus is on the digital interface with our retailers. Digital demand creation and order taking show promise and have already helped to increase the availability of our products in-store - as well as optimising deliveries and reducing costs. This year, we also extended the roll-out of AI image capturing within our cabinets to monitor stock levels and trigger automatic replenishment, as well as an AI tool to optimise the allocation of cabinets.\n\n## A commercial sustainability agenda\n\nSustainability has been an integral part of our Ice Cream brand for a number of years, and underpins our strategic priorities. Our focus is on commercial opportunities which create value for our business and our customers. For example, we are targeting electricity use in freezer cabinets and have seen encouraging results from our 'warming up the cold chain' pilots. To support wider efforts on decarbonisation, we have also shared some formulation patents with the industry and continue to work with dairy producers to reduce GHG emissions - see page 44 for more.\n\nThe acquisition of Yasso, a premium frozen Greek yogurt brand in the US, adds to our portfolio strength.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are now dialling up the performance edge in our culture to accelerate growth. \" \"\n\nNitin Paranjpe\n\nChief People and Transformation Officer\n\n## Highlights\n\nBegan work to dial up our performance edge focused on goal setting, reward and leadership behaviours.\n\nLaunched a global initiative equipping and empowering our people to shape their careers.\n\nEmbedded gender and diversity representation requirements into our executive search contracts for senior leadership roles.\n\nInvested in targeted capability building in our biggest markets including customer strategy and planning, digital marketing and generative AI.\n\n## Our transformation agenda\n\nLast year, we began an important transformation initiative to unlock the potential of our business. 2023 was our first full year operating under the new category-focused organisation structure and we have made good progress so far - but there is more work to do. To support the next critical stage of our transformation, we have set out a clear Growth Action Plan to dial up the performance edge of our culture. We already have a strong and identifiable culture. Building on this foundation, we believe that a greater focus on performance will help us to ultimately deliver more consistent and competitive growth.\n\nThis year, we relaunched our people strategy to harness the many positives of the new category-focused organisation and to target the areas that require further work. Our strategy focuses on four priority areas: dialling up the performance edge in our culture, creating a faster and simpler organisation, building a diverse talent powerhouse, and developing capabilities to sharpen our competitive edge.\n\n## Strong culture fundamentals\n\nOur annual UniVoice survey is a key measure of employee sentiment - and a helpful diagnostic of our culture today - to ensure we take the right actions for the future. The response rate increased this year, with 106,000 office-based and factory employees completing the survey. The results confirmed that employee engagement has increased to 84% (a) - versus 83% in 2022 - well above the industry benchmark. This demonstrates that Unilever has many enduring qualities, such as: belief in our products; trust in senior leadership; and support for our strategy.\n\nThis year's survey results also pointed to the many positive aspects of our culture: a strong commitment to safety, sustainability and integrity, and concern for inclusion and wellbeing. However, it also highlighted areas that have prevented us from executing consistently at scale, notably on aspects of our performance culture and operational effectiveness.\n\n## Linking behaviours to performance\n\nThis year, we began to take the first steps to dial up the performance edge in our culture. Our first priority has been to simplify our standards of leadership to make it clear what behaviours we expect of our people. We are now being more explicit about how these relate to business performance emphasising performance enablers such as agility versus our competitors, getting closer to consumers and partnering with customers. Our focus next year will be to embed these behaviours into our talent acquisition and management processes as well as continuing our work to foster psychological safety - a key enabler of performance culture. We will also be refining some of our reward mechanisms to increase the line of sight between reward and performance.\n\n## Faster and simpler organisation\n\nWe have seen tangible evidence in the past year that the new category-focused organisation we have put in place is starting to deliver quicker, more empowered decision-making by our leadership. For example, we have been able to take decisive action to reduce the number of active SKUs across our portfolio and have started to unlock efficiency improvements from the integration of end-to-end value chains into our Business Groups.\n\nWhile the latest UniVoice survey showed signs of improvement on the speed of our decision-making, we know there is more work to do in some critical parts of our business. One area of focus next year will be on making our go-to-market customer development operations as effective as possible.",

        "page_content": "## Review of the Year\n\n## Building a diverse talent powerhouse\n\nOur talent base is strong and diverse, and we are focused on continuing to develop this further. To support the development of our internal talent pipeline, we launched 'Shape Your Own Adventure' - a global initiative to empower employees to develop the skills, performance edge and leadership they need to progress in their careers. Our recent UniVoice survey showed that employee perceptions of career development opportunities have since improved.\n\nSecuring a strong pipeline of future talent is an important area of focus. We are the FMCG employer of choice for graduates and early career talent in 10 out of our 20 biggest markets, as well as having the highest number of followers on LinkedIn for our industry. Access to hybrid working is a key requirement for a growing number of jobseekers and so we continue to refine our hybrid approach, to strike the right balance between in-person time and remote working arrangements. We are also developing our approach to flexibility for employees to increase our access to talent and support business agility. Our 'U-Work' flexible employment model which combines the security of regular employment with the flexibility of contract work - is now active in 10 markets.\n\nCreating an inclusive and equitable workplace underpins our talent strategy - and supports our aim to become more consumer-centric. We continue to pilot our new Equity & Inclusion Advancement Framework and through this work have identified specific interventions to eliminate any unintended bias and discrimination in our people practices and policies across under-represented groups. This year, we maintained gender balance at management level and we are aiming to increase representation of women at more senior levels - which now stands at 36% - through targeted interventions such as embedding gender and diversity requirements into executive search for senior leadership roles.\n\n## Capabilities to sharpen competitive edge\n\nOur focus this year has been on senior leadership capabilities, including a bespoke multi-year programme for our top 140 leaders. This aims to drive a higher appetite for risk-taking and a focus on speed and agility. We are also investing in targeted capability building in our biggest markets to step up expertise in customer strategy and planning, digital marketing and generative AI. We also continue to roll out programmes to reskill and upskill our frontline workforce on digital capabilities.\n\n## Business integrity\n\nUnilever's Code of Business Principles and Code Policies are the non-negotiable expectations we set to ensure we grow responsibly. Our employees are required to submit an annual pledge to confirm they have understood, and commit to, and adhere to, the Code. It is embedded through comprehensive business integrity training programmes, covering issues such as countering corruption and harassment. Our zero-tolerance approach to bribery is supported by targeted mandatory training, including for those in frontline customer and supplier roles.\n\nAcross all areas of our Code, we received 1,390 Code reports this year - an increase of 21% versus last year. This reflects our efforts to encourage people to 'speak up' when they see Code breaches. We have also strengthened our procedures to check that employees have not experienced retaliation after reporting a breach of the Code. Following investigations by our Business Integrity teams, we closed 969 Code reports and confirmed 507 reports as breaches, resulting in 337 people leaving the business.\n\nIn November, employees from around the world joined a global Unilever Live webcast to learn more about the Growth Action Plan and the critical role they play in delivering this.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Safety-first\n\nHealth and Safety is a key part of our Code and ways of working. It is deeply embedded in our culture, governance and operating structures, with accountability at all levels. Our programmes and standards cover all employees and contractors who work on our sites. Strong safety leadership is key to our work. Since 2022, over 100 leaders have visited 30 countries as part of a safety leadership site visit programme showing their commitment to safety and encouraging people to speak up when they witness unsafe behaviour.\n\nWe have dedicated programmes to address key safety risks, including road safety which is a primary cause of injury among our employees. For example, we upgraded our global fleet procurement policy to ensure that all new Unilever vehicles purchased have the most advanced safety features, such as blind spot detection and anti-collision systems.\n\nBy continuing to strengthen our safety-first mindset and targeting key safety risks, our employee Total Recordable Frequency Rate (TRFR) improved by 13% versus 2022, to 0.58 accidents per million hours worked. Accidents involving our people are addressed with the utmost care and attention. A contractor sadly passed away while working at one of our factories. We responded with a full investigation and applied the lessons learned to sites worldwide to prevent a similar reoccurrence.\n\nAlongside our work on safety, we continue to support employees who are experiencing occupational and mental health challenges. This year, we grew our 4,000-strong network of trained Mental Health Champion volunteers as well as offering a wide range of mental health support resources.",

During that time, we have taken decisive action to embed sustainability into the core of our business. This Annual Report provides a review of our progress this year against the goals we set in 2021.\n\nWe are more certain than ever that it is the right time to focus our sustainability efforts on the four key priorities where we are best placed to drive impact: climate, nature, plastics and livelihoods. We will focus our resources on accelerating progress against these, and we intend to publish a smaller number of new or updated medium-term goals in 2024. Human rights will continue to underpin our sustainability agenda and we remain committed to issues such as Equity, Diversity & Inclusion - see page 42.\n\n## Climate\n\nOur Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) outlines the actions we are taking to reduce GHG emissions in our business and across our value chain, to reach net zero by 2039. This Annual Report contains our third CTAP Progress Report - see pages 43 to 47. We published our updated CTAP in March 2024, in advance of an advisory shareholder vote at our Annual General Meeting in May 2024.\n\n## Nature\n\nOur business depends on nature, including land, forests and water systems. We also recognise biodiversity loss as an emerging risk, so protecting these systems is important to ensure the resilience of our business and the communities where we operate. This year, we stepped up our efforts to deliver a deforestation-free supply chain and continued to make investments to protect and regenerate nature.\n\n## Deforestation-free supply chain\n\nIn 2020, we set a goal to achieve a deforestation-free supply chain in palm oil, paper and board, tea, soy and cocoa. By the end of 2023, we had put in place the infrastructure, monitoring and verification systems to manage a deforestation-free supply chain. For example, we have strengthened the traceability and transparency of our palm oil supply chain by using satellite imagery and geolocation data to measure deforestation. Additionally, 97.5% of our palm oil, paper and board, tea, soy and cocoa order volumes were deforestationfree by the end of 2023, based on Unilever's deforestation-free requirements.\n\nWe initiated a large-scale transformation programme within our supply chain to reach this milestone, including independently verifying our suppliers through audits. Strategic investments have helped to drive change - including a \u20ac131 million ($142 million) total investment in our Unilever Oleochemicals facility to source deforestation-free palm oil and palm kernel oil directly in the coming years. We have also worked with suppliers to support the transformation in our soy supply chain, including investment in a 'Green Refinery' in Brazil which will increase the availability of deforestation-free soy for our business and the wider industry.\n\n## Protecting and regenerating nature\n\nOur Climate & Nature Fund continues to support our work to protect and regenerate 1.5 million hectares of land, forests and oceans by 2030. By the end of 2023, the Fund had spent and committed \u20ac0.3 billion, which has helped to protect and regenerate 0.3 million hectares since 2021 - an increase of 0.1 million hectares since 2022.

        "page_content": "## Review of the Year\n\nCollective, Dove aims to enhance and protect rainforests in South East Asia as part of the 'Dove Nature Regeneration Project'. Hellmann's, in partnership with others, continues to work with soybean farmers in the US to encourage adoption of regenerative agriculture practices.\n\nEmpowering smallholder farmers to embrace new agricultural practices is another important part of our nature agenda. Magnum is creating a more resilient supply chain by working with cocoa farmers in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to adopt agroforestry practices improving soil health, increasing yields and boosting farmers' incomes. Our work to protect and regenerate nature is underpinned by sustainable sourcing. In 2023, 79% of our 12 key agricultural commodities were sourced sustainably versus 81% in 2022. As part of our work to improve supply chain traceability in support of our deforestation-free goal, we have invested in buying palm oil directly from smaller suppliers. This has impacted our certified palm oil volumes in the short-term.\n\n## Protecting water\n\nWater is a critical resource used to grow agricultural crops, and in the manufacture and use of our products. This year, we continued to roll out our water stewardship programmes to more water-stressed areas. By the end of 2023 we had implemented 13 programmes. We are also building long-term partnerships with suppliers to replace ingredients that do not meet our biodegradability standards with biodegradable alternatives that continue to deliver superior performance. In 2023, we continued to roll-out products with more biodegradable formulations such as Dove Body Wash in the US and Canada, and Simple Facial Cleansers in India.\n\n## Plastics\n\nTackling plastic waste and pollution is a critical priority for our business. Although there is more work to do, we continue to make progress against our goals. To accelerate action, we are refining our programmes and have invested in our Packaging R&D Centre which brings together materials scientists, packaging experts and digital modellers to develop nextgeneration packaging materials and formats.\n\n## Reducing virgin plastic\n\nWe have reduced the amount of virgin plastic in our packaging by 18% since 2019, an improvement of 5% versus last year. Using recycled plastic in our packaging is one of the biggest levers to reduce our virgin plastic footprint - as well as lowering Scope 3 GHG emissions (see page 44). In 2023, we increased our use of recycled plastic in our packaging to 22%. Some of our biggest Power Brands - such as Hellmann's, Dove and Sunlight - continue to drive the transition to recycled plastic across our portfolio. We are also finding new packaging solutions, such as ice cream wrappers which include 50% certified food-grade recycled plastic, with plans to roll this out further in 2024.\n\nAlternative packaging materials and formats also play an important role in reducing or removing plastic entirely. Our laundry brands have rolled out cardboard boxes for their 3-in-1 capsules across several European markets. And Pot Noodle is trialling paper-based pots in the UK, with an estimated 4,000-tonne saving of virgin plastic per year once fully launched.\n\nMaking our packaging lighter also supports our virgin plastic reduction efforts, while also lowering transport emissions. This year, we launched new lightweight packaging formats for our Sure, Rexona and Dove roll-on deodorants, using around a third less plastic. And our new toothpaste tubes in Indonesia and France are now designed for recycling and use less plastic than other toothpaste tubes in the market.\n\nWe are investing in our Packaging R&D Centre to develop next-generation packaging materials and formats.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Designing for recycling and reuse\n\nWe continue to design our packaging formats for recycling, such as using mono-material alternatives for our rigid packaging. In 2023, the 'actual recyclability' rate of our plastic packaging portfolio was 53%, compared to 55% in 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by lower sales volume of recyclable rigid packaging formats, such as bottles and jars in North America and Europe. The proportion of our plastic packaging which was 'technically recyclable' using existing technology, increased marginally to 72% versus 71% in 2022. We recognise that 'actual recyclability' at scale relies on the development of infrastructure to collect, sort and process the materials. We are also working with industry partners and other stakeholders to overcome challenges in the development of viable and scalable solutions to replace hard-to-recycle plastic sachets - with alternative formats, materials and business models.\n\nWe are working to increase the number of reusable and refillable formats, as well as strengthen refill business models. This year, we expanded our network of refill outlets in Indonesia to around 800, with our dish wash brands Rinso, Sunlight and Wipol now available. We are also collaborating with partners such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the Consumer Goods Forum to advocate for the systemic changes that will help make reuse-refill models scalable and economically viable. And with the World Economic Forum's Consumers Beyond Waste initiative, we are developing a standardised approach for reuse measurement and reporting to inform future policy.\n\n## Collecting and processing plastic\n\nThis year, we helped to collect and process 61% of our global plastic packaging footprint. Our businesses in Indonesia and Vietnam continued to collect and process more plastic than they sold, through physical collection and the inclusion of recycled plastic in packaging. In Latin America, we have invested in the Circulate Capital Ocean Fund to help scale waste management systems in the region and improve access to recycled materials.\n\n## Advocating for a global plastics treaty\n\nVoluntary initiatives alone will not solve the challenge of plastic pollution - policymakers play a key role in driving systemic change. As part of the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty, we are campaigning for an ambitious and effective UN treaty to end plastic pollution. This includes advocating for the establishment of well-designed extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes.",

In 2023, our livelihoods priorities were to: ensure our suppliers pay their employees a living wage; helping small and medium-sized businesses grow; and to advance equity, diversity and inclusion through our advertising and with our suppliers. Underpinning our livelihoods agenda is an ongoing commitment to embedding and promoting respect for human rights throughout our value chain.\n\n## Championing a living wage\n\nOne of the most impactful ways we can improve livelihoods is by ensuring workers who directly provide goods and services to us are paid a living wage. Since 2021, we have focused our efforts on ensuring that the contracts we sign with dedicated collaborative manufacturers include a requirement to pay a living wage. We plan to make a living wage a mandatory requirement in our Responsible Partner Policy (RPP). In advance of this, we have asked priority suppliers to voluntarily sign our Living Wage Promise. To help create a level playing field and mainstream living wage, we are also advocating for change through industry forums such as the UN Global Compact as well as supporting free, publicly accessible living wage data.\n\n## Helping small retailers grow\n\nOur work with small and medium-sized retailers focuses on scaling our digital commerce platforms so that they can buy directly from us. In 2023, 1.9 million small retailers across eight emerging markets were active on these platforms - for example, our long-running Shakti initiative now includes digital ordering through the Shikhar platform.\n\n## Opportunities for under-represented groups\n\nOur supplier diversity programme aims to enhance access to new capabilities at the same time as supporting our livelihoods work - and is focused on diverse businesses that are owned, managed and controlled by members of underrepresented or minority groups. The programme is now active in 25 markets following expansion to Colombia, Chile and the Philippines, with our total spend reaching \u20ac1.1 billion in 2023. In Latin America, we have partnered with an accelerator programme that supports diverse suppliers who are developing sustainability solutions, with potential to benefit our business.\n\nWe are one of the world's largest advertisers by spend. Our long-running Act 2 Unstereotype initiative aims to strengthen the participation of under-represented communities in our advertising. In 2023, we have focused on under-representation of people with disabilities in advertising production, launching an Inclusive Set Commitment to increase access and opportunities across the industry.\n\n## Human Rights\n\nRespecting human rights is fundamental to how we operate and underpins our four sustainability priorities. The United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGPs) on Business and Human Rights continue to inform our approach.\n\nThis year, we commissioned an external review of our human rights issues and concluded that the eight we identified in 2015 remain the most salient. However, we have broadened the scope of some salient issues such as harassment which now includes bullying, and health and safety which considers impacts beyond the workplace. We now also formally recognise the human rights impact of climate and gender across all our salient issues.\n\nIn response to growing pressure on human rights defenders we published new Principles in support of human rights defenders in our agriculture supply chain. Alongside targeted policy interventions, our RPP continues to play a key role in setting mandatory requirements for our suppliers across a range of human rights and sustainability issues. In 2023, 85% of our spend was with suppliers meeting RPP requirements, up from 76% in 2022.",

We published our updated CTAP in March 2024. This will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the Annual General Meeting in May 2024.\n\nThis report sets out the actions we have taken and progress we made towards our climate targets in 2023. It also explains how we continued to improve the measurement and accuracy of our GHG emissions for the reporting period 2021-2023. An analysis of our emissions and details of this revision are set out on page 47.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our progress this year\n\nIn 2023, we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in our operations by 74% against a 2015 baseline. This means we have achieved our interim target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 70% by 2025, two years ahead of our ambition.\n\nGHG emissions in scope of our net zero ambition (referred to as 'our GHG emissions', which excludes emissions from indirect consumer use) decreased by 1% in 2023 versus 2022. This reduction is net of increased emissions related to greater media and marketing spend, and increased HFC propellant emissions due to volume growth in US and Canadian aerosol products.\n\nIn addition, our full value chain Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions reduced by 3%, on a per consumer use basis, versus 2022, and by 21% against a 2010 baseline.\n\nMore detail on performance against our climate metrics and targets can be found on page 46.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Review of the Year\n\n## Raw materials and ingredients\n\nRaw materials and ingredients account for 52% of our GHG emissions and represent our largest emissions source. Raw material and ingredient emissions from Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) decreased by 1% in 2023 while Energy and Industrial (E&I) related emissions decreased by 2%.\n\nIn 2023, we started to establish the foundations for accelerated GHG emissions reductions in future years by scaling up our Supplier Climate Programme, reaching a key milestone in our deforestation-free goal, and by continuing to develop lower-emission ingredients in our cleaning and laundry products.\n\n## Supplier Climate Programme\n\nWe continue to support suppliers of raw materials, ingredients and packaging to deliver long-term reductions in GHG emissions. In 2023, we expanded our Supplier Climate Programme to reach more than 100 suppliers, with around 80 delivering on our asks. Our focus is on providing suppliers with access to tools and expert support to build key climate capabilities and to better measure their impact.\n\nOur suppliers with more mature climate programmes have now sent us around 240 Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) data points that meet industry standards and can be incorporated into our GHG measurement in the future. Alongside this, we are helping to shape industry standards for PCF data through the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's Partnership for Carbon Transparency programme.\n\n## Deforestation-free supply chain and regenerative agriculture\n\nTo achieve our goal of a deforestation-free supply chain, we have fundamentally reshaped the way we source the five key commodities in scope - palm oil, paper and board, tea, soy and cocoa. By the end of 2023, we had put in place the infrastructure, monitoring and verification systems to manage a deforestationfree supply chain. Additionally, by the end of 2023 97.5% of palm oil, paper and board, tea, soy and cocoa order volumes were deforestation-free, based on Unilever's deforestation-free requirements.\n\nOur regenerative agriculture programme plays an important role in transforming our value chain and reducing land-based emissions from raw material production, as well as increasing resilience within our supply chain.\n\nSome of our climate actions including deforestation-free supply chain and regenerative agriculture are closely linked to delivering our nature goals. See pages 40 to 41 for more information on the progress we have made this year.\n\n## Lower-carbon dairy\n\nReducing emissions from dairy products is a priority for our Ice Cream Business Group. Through our Ben & Jerry's brand, we have expanded a lower-carbon dairy pilot to 17 farms, to further test new technology and regenerative agricultural practices. The initiative, which began in 2022, aims to reduce GHG emissions from these dairy farms to half the industry average by 2025. We are supporting each farm to build a tailored roadmap based on their knowledge and experience of emissions reduction and the farming conditions at each location. We have also tested a feed additive that has the potential to reduce total GHG emissions by 12-15% per kilogram of milk.\n\n## Chemical ingredients\n\nOur Home Care Business Group relies on chemicals derived from fossil fuels and is working to reduce emissions by\n\ntransitioning to ingredients that use renewable or recycled carbon. In 2023, we successfully launched hand dish wash products with plant-based surfactants and zero petrochemical active agents in Indonesia. We also made good progress in developing lower carbon proteins and enzymes for use in our products in the future.\n\nIn August, we ran an event with suppliers based in India including a number who are part of our Supplier Climate Programme - to accelerate research into innovative ingredients and production processes. 18 of these suppliers pledged to reduce their GHG emissions and develop GHGreduction roadmaps. We are also working with two chemical companies to develop lower GHG soda ash and surfactants for use in laundry powders. Initial findings suggest that this could result in significant GHG emissions reductions.\n\n## Packaging materials\n\nEmissions associated with our packaging materials account for 11% of our GHG emissions. In 2023, GHG emissions from packaging decreased by 4% versus 2022, driven by a reduction in product volumes for the period measured (1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023), increased use of recycled plastic (PCR) and further lightweighting in our packaging formats. See page 41 for more on plastic.\n\n## Indirect procurement\n\nEmissions associated with indirect procurement make up 16% of our GHG emissions - and include emissions from media and marketing suppliers. In 2023, we conducted a more detailed review of our indirect procurement spend and the associated emissions in this category. The largest category of spend here is our advertising and media spend. We need to work with third parties and suppliers in these areas to reduce these emissions. Unilever has been encouraging the advertising industry to reduce media and marketing related emissions, helping to establish and continuing to support the industry initiatives Ad Net Zero with the Advertising Association, and the Planet Pledge with the World Federation of Advertisers.\n\n## Our operations\n\nAlthough our operations represent just 1% of our overall GHG emissions, it is the area where we have the most direct impact. By moving to renewable electricity and renewable heat, and focusing on energy efficiency improvements, we have reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 74% versus our 2015 baseline. Since 2015, energy efficiency in our manufacturing sites has improved by 15%. In 2023, we spent an additional \u20ac42 million of capital expenditure on sustainability investments in our factories, including energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.\n\n## Renewable electricity\n\nIn 2023, 92% of our electricity came from renewable sources, a decrease of 1% versus 2022. This was partly driven by more accurate data from our combined heat and power plants and increased on-site non-renewable electricity generation at some sites due to market conditions - such as grid electricity rationing in South Asia (known as 'load shedding'). We have also improved the quality of our Energy Attribute Certificate (EAC) sourcing and continue to align with RE100 criteria, meaning we only report electricity as 'renewable' when the certificate is issued from the same market in which the energy is used. In markets where EACs are not available, we purchase the equivalent amount of EACs from neighbouring markets to cover the energy used.",

        "page_content": "## Review of the Year\n\n## Renewable thermal energy\n\nIn 2023, 37% of our thermal energy came from renewable sources. We continue to switch to electric-powered heating technologies, such as heat pumps and to biofuels sourced in line with our Biofuel Sourcing Principles. For example, in 2023, we commissioned a new biomass-fuelled hot air generator at our Min Buri factory in Thailand which is expected to deliver a reduction in Scope 1 GHG emissions of over 8,000 tonnes per year.\n\n## Logistics\n\nLogistics emissions from upstream transport and distribution accounts for 3% of our GHG emissions and decreased by 13% versus 2022. In 2023 we reduced our total logistics emissions by 14% versus 2020. We are working to minimise the number and length of journeys, as well as maximising the number of pallets carried per truck - shipping directly to consumers where possible. This has resulted in a 7% reduction in kilometres travelled per tonne of products sold in 2023, versus 2022. We have reduced total kilometres travelled by 19% since 2020. We have started to transition the fuel used for some of our truck fleet in the US, UK, Netherlands, Italy and the United Arab Emirates to alternatives such as biofuels.\n\n## Ice cream cabinets\n\nThe ice cream cabinets that we lease to retail stores account for 4% of our GHG emissions. In 2023, cabinet emissions decreased by 22% versus 2022. This was partly driven by energy grid decarbonisation in the US, UK and some countries in the European Union. Reductions also came from the purchase of EACs to cover some of our cabinet electricity consumption in Turkey and Indonesia - which accounts for approximately half of the emission reduction from cabinets in 2023. We will continue to evaluate EACs and other options to support the transition of our cabinet fleet towards renewable energy sources.\n\nAdditionally, we continue to invest in more energy-efficient freezers, which has reduced average cabinet energy consumption by around 2% in 2023. We have launched a guide for our operating sales teams to train customers on how to run our freezers more efficiently, helping them to cut energy use and reduce their running costs.\n\n## Direct consumer use\n\nIn the majority of our markets, we use natural hydrocarbon propellant gases with a low global warming potential (GWP) - primarily in hairsprays, body sprays and spray deodorant. However, in the US and Canada, regulation on Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) restricts the use of these propellants. Instead, hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) propellants with a higher GWP tend to be used by industry to lower VOC levels. HFC propellant accounted for 3% of our GHG emissions in 2023, and make up the majority of our GHG emissions from direct consumer use of sold products.\n\nIn 2023, GHG emissions from direct consumer use of sold products increased by 1% versus 2022. This was driven by product volume growth in the US and Canada, and the use of a propellant system in our dry shampoo products, to comply with 2023 reduction VOC regulation targets in the USA. After many years of working with the California Air Resources Board to advocate for change, VOC regulations were updated in the US in 2022 to include provisions permitting the use of alternative propellant systems with lower GWPs.\n\nThis will allow us to begin reformulating some of our aerosol products in the US and will be a priority action to deliver GHG emission reductions in the future.\n\n## Product end of life\n\nThe disposal of product residuals and packaging, including the biodegradation of product formulations after their use, accounts for 6% of our GHG emissions. In 2023, our product end-of-life emissions fell by 2% versus 2022. We remain focused on increasing the use of renewable and recycled ingredients which lower GHG emissions as our products biodegrade. See chemical ingredients and packaging on page 44.\n\n## Indirect consumer use\n\nAround a half of our products' full value chain GHG emissions are indirect emissions associated with consumer use of our products. In 2023, indirect consumer use emissions decreased by 18% from 2022, as a result of reductions in product volumes for the period measured (1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023) and ongoing grid energy decarbonisation in the US, UK and European Union. In the run-up to COP28, we advocated for greater investment in renewable electricity generation to triple current capacity by the end of the decade.\n\n## GHG impact of products across product lifecycle\n\nOur full value chain GHG emissions target includes both direct and indirect consumer use emissions across the product lifecycle. This is calculated using Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions across the full value chain, and the number of consumer uses of our products (expressed as 'per consumer use' - single use, portion or serving). In 2023, our GHG emissions per consumer use reduced by 3% versus 2022, and by 21% since 2010 primarily due to reductions in indirect consumer use emissions.\n\n## Using our influence\n\nWe continue to engage on policy areas that will help limit global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C and unlock faster emissions reduction in our value chain. In 2023, this included:\n\n- \u25a0 Working with RE100 to advocate for investment in zero carbon electricity grids and the introduction of marketbased renewable electricity mechanisms.\n- \u25a0 Commissioning research by the University of Oxford identifying the policy interventions needed to address the carbon emissions of everyday cleaning, laundry, and home care products.\n- \u25a0 Ahead of COP28, we endorsed a 'call to action' with other organisations for the transition to include food systems in national climate plans. We also announced the Action Agenda on Regenerative Landscapes to accelerate the transition of large agri-food businesses to regenerative agriculture.\n\n## Governance and disclosure\n\nDetails on climate governance can be found in our TCFD statement on page 48. In addition to the climate disclosures in our Annual Report and Accounts, we provide annual submissions to CDP. In 2023, we received a rating of AAA- for our CDP Forests, Water and Climate disclosures (based on 2022 data).",

        "page_content": "## Review of the Year\n\n## Our climate metrics and targets\n\nWe use several key metrics and targets to assess and manage climate risks and opportunities across our full value chain. Two of our near-term targets are validated as science-based by the Science Based Targets initiative ('SBTi'):\n\n- \u25a0 Reduce in absolute terms our operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions by 100% by 2030 against a 2015 baseline and;\n- \u25a0 Halve the full value chain emissions (Scope 1 to 3) of our products on a per consumer use basis by 2030 against a 2010 baseline.\n\nIn addition, we have an interim target to reduce in absolute terms our operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 70% by 2025 against a 2015 baseline.\n\nWhile our operational target is validated by the SBTi as aligned with the 1.5\u00b0C ambition of the Paris Agreement, our full value chain target is validated by SBTi as aligned with limiting temperature increase to 2\u00b0C. This is because it was set in 2010 and validated by the SBTi before the 1.5\u00b0C validation was introduced. We intend to retire this target in 2024 once our new, more ambitious near-term 1.5\u00b0C-aligned Scope 3 targets have been validated by the SBTi. These are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Reduce absolute energy and industrial Scope 3 GHG emissions from Purchased Goods and Services (associated with ingredients and packaging), Fuel and Energy Related Activities, Upstream Transport and Distribution, direct emissions from Use of Sold Products (associated with HFC propellants), End-of-Life Treatment of Sold Products, and Downstream Leased Assets (associated with ice cream retail cabinets) by 42% by 2030 from a 2021 baseline year.\n- \u25a0 Reduce absolute Scope 3 Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) GHG emissions from Purchased Goods and Services (associated with ingredients) by 30.3% by 2030 from a 2021 baseline year.\n\nFor more details about this change, see our updated CTAP which is available on our website, and will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at our 2024 AGM.\n\nWe also set an ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2039 and have additional nature and plastic goals which play an important role in tackling climate change.\n\n## Progress against climate metrics and targets\n\nThe table below shows our progress against the key climate metrics and targets - see pages 43 to 45 for progress commentary.

The revised 2021 emissions are the baseline for our new 2030 Scope 3 emissions reduction targets.\n\nWe improved our Scope 1 and 2 emissions measurement with more complete and accurate data related to small office and logistics sites, fuel consumption from company vehicles, methane and N 2 O gases from both fossil fuels and biofuels and SF 6 gas from electrical insulators in grid connections. We also implemented a new measurement system for our most material Scope 3 emission categories which measures emissions from procured goods and services, using data on real volumes of procured raw materials/packaging and services combined with standard emissions factors for these materials, applying the latest guidance on the use of emissions factors (IPCC AR6) and the draft GHG Protocol Land Sector guidance.\n\nAs well as measuring emissions on a procurement basis, we are still using product footprint data - based on a representative sample of products including the impact on indirect consumer use emissions - as part of our product innovation decisions. Over time, we expect the new measurement system to be able to incorporate this data and provide product footprint information.\n\n## Note 2: Analysis of GHG emissions in our operations\n\n| Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (million tonnes CO2e)   |   2023 | 2022     | 2021     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|----------|\n| Scope 1 GHG emissions (a)                           |   0.62 | 0.66 (b) | 0.73 (b) |\n| Renewable energy                                    |   0.04 | 0.03     | 0.04     |\n| Non-renewable energy                                |   0.56 | 0.61     | 0.67     |\n| Refrigerants and other gases  (c)                   |   0.02 | 0.02     | 0.02     |\n| Scope 2 GHG emissions (a)                           |   0.11 | 0.15 (b) | 0.18 (b) |\n| Purchased renewable electricity                     |   0    | 0        | 0        |\n| Purchased non-renewable electricity                 |   0.03 | 0.06     | 0.09     |\n| Purchased renewable thermal energy                  |   0    | 0        | 0        |\n| Purchased non-renewable thermal energy              |   0.08 | 0.09     | 0.09     |\n| Total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions                   |   0.73 | 0.81     | 0.91     |\n\n## Note 3: Analysis of GHG emissions per consumer use\n\n| GHG per consumer use                                        | 2023   | 2022   | 2021    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|\n| GHG impact per consumer use (grams CO2e) (a)                | 40.0   | 41.4   | 43.6    |\n| Reduction in GHG impact per consumer use since 2010 (%) (a) | -21%   | '-19%  | '-14% \u25b3 |",

        "page_content": "## Review of the Year\n\n## Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures statement\n\nThe following statement, which Unilever believes is consistent with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures, details the risks and opportunities arising from climate change, the potential impact on our business and the actions we are taking to respond. We also integrate climate-related disclosures throughout this Annual Report and Accounts, including in our Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) Annual Progress Report on pages 43 to 47. A detailed breakdown of our emissions can be found on page 47. We have updated our CTAP, in advance of an advisory shareholder vote at our Annual General Meeting in May 2024. See our website for the latest CTAP.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe overall governance structure for managing Unilever's climate risks and opportunities is the same as for any of Unilever's other key risks and opportunities i.e. all of the following play a key role in governance: the Board, the Board subcommittees, ULE, ULE subcommittees, Business Group leadership teams, specialist management governance groups and specialist teams together with the support of relevant policies and procedures applied by everyone in the business (see page 88).\n\nWhilst the Board takes overall accountability for the management of all risks and opportunities, including climate change (see page 70), our CEO is ultimately responsible for oversight of our climate change agenda. The Board delegates specific climate change matters to each of the Board subcommittees:\n\n- \u25a0 The Corporate Responsibility Committee - oversees the development of Unilever's sustainability agenda (which includes climate matters), and the progress against that agenda, including performance against specific targets, whilst also reviewing sustainability-related risks, developments and opportunities (see page 114).\n- \u25a0 The Audit Committee - oversees the non-financial disclosures in our Annual Report and Accounts, which includes climate-related disclosures. This includes reviewing the scope and results of any internal and external assurance activities obtained over the disclosures (see page 109).\n- \u25a0 The Compensation Committee - supports the sustainability strategy which includes the climate strategy through alignment of Unilever's incentive plan to the sustainability agenda and ambitions (see page 128).\n- \u25a0 The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for ensuring that the composition of the Board provides sufficient skills and experience in sustainability matters including climate change to deliver on the sustainability agenda (see page 105).\n- \u25a0 The Board is supported by the ULE and the Sustainability Advisory Council. The Council is made up of seven independent external specialists in social and environmental matters, and it convened in 2023 to guide and critique our strategy. The ULE discuss key strategic sustainability matters at least quarterly. During 2023, climate change matters were discussed at each meeting including progress against our climate-related Compass goals. The specific topics discussed included our GHG emissions measurement and setting a new baseline for our total emissions, GHG reduction plans for our Business Groups, and implications of the changes in the SBTi guidelines on setting new targets.\n\nAdditional ULE subcommittees are also in place to support our climate agenda and ULE decision-making, including:\n\n- \u25a0 Business Operations Sustainability Steering Committee: Provides strategic guidance on implementation of our climate, nature and livelihoods goals within our extended supply chain. Chaired by our Chief Business Operations Officer, attended together with our Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), Chief Procurement Officer and Head of Sustainable Business and Reporting.\n- \u25a0 Climate and Nature Investment Committee: Evaluates and approves investment proposals and reviews progress against key milestones for the Climate & Nature Fund, our \u20ac1 billion commitment to fund disruptive transformations across our value chain. Chaired by our Chief Business Operations Officer together with our CSO, Chief R&D Officer, Head of Sustainable Business and Reporting, and our five Business Group Presidents.\n\nEach Business Group has a sustainability lead to ensure that sustainability risks and opportunities are embedded into their strategies and performance is monitored.\n\nWe also have a specialist corporate team, the Global Sustainability Function, led by our CSO. This team supports the Business Group teams in developing their business strategies whilst also driving transformational change across markets through advocacy and partnerships.\n\nIn addition, included within the Supply Chain, R&D and Finance corporate functions, we have teams of experts who are focused on the sustainability agenda which includes climaterelated matters. Their activities include developing relevant policies and procedures, e.g. responsible sourcing and metric definitions (scope and calculation methodologies).\n\nWe regularly engage with our investors on a wide range of sustainability matters including our climate strategy. In 2021, we achieved shareholder support for our CTAP through an advisory vote at our AGM. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we commenced our engagement with investors on our updated CTAP. We engaged with more than 20 of our largest institutional investors and have used their feedback to help shape the updated CTAP.\n\nRemuneration for management employees - up to and including the ULE - continues to be formally linked to performance against climate change goals. Their reward packages include fixed pay, a bonus as a percentage of fixed pay and eligibility to participate in a long-term Performance Share Plan (PSP).\n\nThe PSP is linked to financial and sustainability performance, guided by our Sustainability Progress Index (SPI), which accounts for 25% of the total PSP award. The SPI in 2023 was determined by considering performance against a number of sustainability goals - see page 136 for details.\n\nSee pages 136 to 137 for more on PSP including the role of the Board's Compensation Committee and Corporate Responsibility Committee in determining how the PSP operates, and the SPI outcome each year.",

        "page_content": "## Review of the Year\n\n## Strategy and risk management\n\nClimate change is a principal risk to Unilever which has the potential - to varying degrees - to impact our business in the short, medium and long term. We face potential physical environment risks from the effects of climate change on our business, including extreme weather and water scarcity.\n\nPotential regulatory and transition market risks associated with the shift to a low-carbon economy include changing consumer preferences and future government policy and regulation. These also present opportunities. The potential impacts of climate change are taken into account in developing the overall strategy, our Business Group strategies and financial plans.\n\nMore detail on these risks, opportunities and the mitigating and adaptation actions we are taking can be found on pages 50 to 55.\n\nThe process for assessing and identifying climate-related risks is the same for each of the principal risks and is described on page 70. The risks are reviewed and assessed on an ongoing basis and formally at least once per year. For each of our principal risks, we have a risk management framework detailing the controls we have in place, who is responsible for managing both the overall risk and the individual controls mitigating it. We monitor risks throughout the year to identify changes in the risk profile.\n\nWe regularly, where appropriate, carry out climate-related risk assessments at site level, supplier level, as well as innovationproject level. Climate-related risks are managed by the team relevant to where the risk resides. For example, climate risks in relation to commodities in the supply chain are managed by our procurement team.\n\n## Understanding financial impact: scenario analysis\n\nWe have conducted several high-level scenario analyses on the potential impacts of climate change to help us consider and adapt our strategies and financial planning. In prior years, we have reported the potential financial impacts of climate change on our business in 2030 if average global temperatures were to rise by 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. This analysis led us to understand that limiting warming to 2\u00b0C would primarily expose us to economic and regulatory transition risks, whereas a 4\u00b0C warming level would expose us to unprecedented physical risks. In 2021, as new scientific evidence was released by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the global consensus around the need for governments to commit to a 1.5\u00b0C world strengthened, we extended our scenario analyses to assess the impacts of a 1.5\u00b0C temperature increase above pre-industrial levels by 2100 on our business in 2030, 2039 and 2050.\n\n## Understanding and modelling the potential financial impact on the business in 2030, 2039 and 2050 of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C\n\nThe IPCC's sixth assessment report (AR6), the most up-to-date compendium from the global scientific community on climate change, states that limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels is necessary to prevent the severe environmental consequences that are likely to occur in a 2\u00b0C warmer world, and the catastrophic impacts that would materialise if temperatures rose by 4\u00b0C.\n\nHowever, it also noted that achieving a 1.5\u00b0C world would still imply major disruption and would necessitate a fast and aggressive transition of our global economy, encompassing policy and regulation, production and consumption systems, societal and economic structures and behaviours, and infrastructure development and deployment of new technologies.\n\nThe IPCC also sets out multiple pathways that the world could take to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. The nature of the pathway taken significantly impacts the risks and opportunities that a business will face.\n\nIn assessing the material risks and opportunities Unilever would face in a world focused on achieving 1.5\u00b0C, we have reviewed in detail two pathways, 'proactive' and 'reactive', that we assessed as more likely than other more extreme possible pathways. In the 'proactive' route, there is an early and steady reduction of emissions as a result of a fast response from all economic actors, meaning there is less dependence on technological advancements to remove carbon from the atmosphere in the second half of the century. Conversely, in the 'reactive' route, significant action by economic actors is delayed to 2030, after which a very rapid transition across all actors is required, accompanied by deployment at a very large scale of low-carbon energy and carbon removal activities and technology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Proactive route\n\n## Reactive route\n\n- \u25a0 Aggressive and persistent regulation from today\n- \u25a0 Dramatic changes to lifestyle from today, towards minimising climate impact and social inequality\n- \u25a0 Reliance on available and proven technologies\n- \u25a0 Lower reliance on carbon removal technologies\n- \u25a0 Gradual regulation by 2030; very aggressive post-2030\n- \u25a0 Continuation of historical societal trends until 2030, then rapid pivot\n- \u25a0 Major reliance on technologies that are not yet proven to scale\n- \u25a0 Higher reliance on carbon removal technologies",

        "page_content": "## Review of the Year\n\n## Risks and opportunities assessed in creating our 1.5\u00b0C scenario\n\nIn creating our 1.5\u00b0C scenario analysis, we took the two pathways and considered the five broad types of risks and opportunities using the TCFD risk framework: Regulatory risks; Market risks; Physical environment risks; Innovative products and services opportunities; and Resource efficiency, resilience, and market opportunities. We identified approximately 40 specific risk and opportunity areas which could impact us in 2030, 2039 and 2050, each of which we assessed qualitatively, supported where possible with high-level quantitative assessments. The assessments are based on financial scenarios and do not represent financial forecasts. They exclude any actions that we might undertake to mitigate or adapt to these risks.\n\nThe quantitative assessments were developed to understand high-level materiality and order of magnitude financial impact rather than perform detailed simulations or forecasts on the long-term future of markets and products.\n\nThe data used was from internal environmental, operational, and financial data and external science-based data, and assumptions from reputable and broadly used sources such as the IPCC or the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\n## Regulatory risks\n\n## Risk\n\n## Management of risk\n\n## Carbon tax\n\nThis includes carbon taxes and voluntary removal costs. Tightening regional or national regulations as well as climate commitments across individual businesses could drive widespread implementation of these taxes or market schemes. This could translate into rising direct and indirect costs linked to carbon emissions, where the strongest impact would likely be on costs of sales linked to raw materials, production, and distribution emissions. Carbon taxes on household emissions or costs passed through to our consumers linked to household emissions may impact their disposable income and ultimately their purchasing power.\n\nImpact on Business Groups: All Business Groups could be impacted by carbon taxes or voluntary removal costs. Per unit of consumption, our Ice Cream business has the highest carbon emissions from the use of dairy ingredients and the energy used in ice cream storage/transport/point-of-sale freezer cabinets. The highest absolute carbon emissions from sourcing materials, production and distribution is in Home Care whereas it is lowest in Beauty & Wellbeing.\n\nTimeframe: Medium term to long term\n\nActions: We have a CTAP which sets out in detail activities to reduce our carbon emissions. For example, our eco-design programmes will reformulate our products with alternative less carbon-intensive ingredients and, through our Supplier Climate Programme, we are working with our largest suppliers to help them build plans to decarbonise the products they supply to us. We also aim to cut emissions from energy use in more than 3 million point-of-sale ice cream cabinets. In 2023, we submitted a new 2030 absolute emissions reduction target to the SBTi which is awaiting approval.\n\nWe support the use of internal carbon pricing as a tool to help us achieve our net zero emissions goal. We use an internal carbon price of \u20ac70 per tonne to inform our investment decision-making.\n\n## Key targets:\n\n- \u25a0 Zero GHG emissions in our operations by 2030\n- \u25a0 Reduce absolute Scope 3 energy and industrial GHG emissions from Purchased Goods and Services (direct procurement), Fuel and Energy related activities, Upstream Transport and Distribution, direct emissions from Use of Sold Products (HFC propellants), End-of-Life Treatment of Sold Products, and Downstream Leased Assets (ice cream cabinets) by 42% by 2030 from a 2021 base year.\n- \u25a0 Reduce absolute Scope 3 FLAG (Forest, Land and Agriculture) GHG emissions from Purchased Goods and Services (ingredients) by 30.3% by 2030 from a 2021 base year.\n- \u25a0 Net zero GHG emissions ambition across our value chain by 2039\n\n## Key risks and opportunities\n\nOut of all the risks and opportunities we assessed as part of our 1.5\u00b0C scenario assessment, there are 11 which we believe are significant and could at some time in the future be material to our business. We have combined the outputs from the 'proactive' and 'reactive' analyses since the risks and opportunities are similar, with the differences only being in the size and timing of impact. Due to the nature of climate risks and opportunities we are monitoring them across a number of time horizons. Short term (up to three years) - this aligns with our three-year strategic plans, medium term (three to ten years) and long term (beyond ten years).\n\nWhere we have been able to quantify the risk, the ranges represent potential impacts of the different pathways.\n\nActions to mitigate and adapt to the risks and to capitalise on the opportunities have been consolidated into our sustainability goals (pages 65 to 66) and our CTAP progress update (pages 43 to 47).\n\nBelow we summarise the 11 risks and opportunities. Given the nature of our products, all of the risks noted below are applicable to all our Business Groups and there are only modest variations in their relative significance for each Business Group. For more details on key targets and goals, see pages 65 to 66.",

        "page_content": "## Review of the Year\n\n## Regulatory risks continued\n\n## Risk\n\n## Management of risk\n\n## Land use regulations\n\nThese could drive reforms to radically restructure current global land use patterns to conserve and expand forest land, serving as the main natural carbon removal solution. This could reduce land available for food crops, pasture and timber and hence access to our primary commodities which could drive reduced crop output and increase raw material prices.\n\nImpact on Business Groups: All Business Groups could be impacted by land use regulation. The majority of our products are derived from agricultural raw materials and thus any limitations placed on land use would have a similar impact across each Business Group. Specific land use regulations vis\u00e0-vis certain usages/crops could impact the Business Groups differently e.g. if dairy farming land was restricted and nothing else, then the Ice Cream business would be most impacted.\n\nTimeframe: Medium term to long term\n\n## Product composition regulations\n\nThese could restrict or ban the use of certain GHG-intensive components and ingredients in everyday products. This would require the redesign of products and packaging to comply, which could increase costs.\n\nImpact on Business Groups: All Business Groups could be impacted by product composition regulations. If there was a ban on the use of GHG-intensive ingredients/components, then there is a greater likelihood that the impact on our Personal Care and Home Care businesses would be greater than on our other businesses, as some personal care products in certain countries use HFC propellants and in home care, various chemicals such as soda ash are used.\n\nTimeframe: Medium term to long term\n\n## Sourcing transparency and product labelling regulations\n\nThese could increase significantly through pressure from regulators, consumers, and investors. This could lead to disclosure compliance risks and rising commodity costs linked to radical transition to transparent supply chains, as well as a potential loss of market share to more transparent competitors.\n\nImpact on Business Groups: All Business Groups could be impacted by sourcing transparency and product labelling regulations and, given the nature of all the raw materials used, the risk to each Business Group is equal.\n\nTimeframe: Medium term to long term\n\nActions: We monitor potential land use regulations to ensure we understand their implications so that we can adapt our raw material supply strategy. By the end of 2023 we had put in place the infrastructure, monitoring and verification systems to manage a deforestation-free supply chain. In addition, we are working with farmers across our supply chain to drive sustainable sourcing and regenerative agriculture.\n\nKey goals:\n\n- \u25a0 Deforestation-free supply chain in palm oil, paper and board, tea, soy and cocoa by 2023\n- \u25a0 Help protect and regenerate 1.5 million hectares of land, forests and oceans by 2030\n\nActions: We monitor regulatory developments to ensure that our product composition is compliant and that future innovations/products are designed to consider forthcoming climate-related legislation. As part of our CTAP, we are committed to reducing the GHG impact of our products and as part of this, we are reviewing our intensive GHG components and ingredients and looking for substitutions or how changes in their production processes can reduce their GHG emissions. We have a diverse portfolio of products and offer a range of formats to meet consumers' needs and this helps mitigate the potential impact of restrictions or bans on specific GHGintensive materials. Specifically, on HFC propellants, we have successfully advocated for a change in regulations in the US to allow the use of alternative less carbon-intensive propellants.\n\nKey goals:\n\n- \u25a0 Reduce emissions from aerosol propellants in the US and Canada\n\nActions: We monitor regulatory developments to ensure that our product labelling is compliant and that future innovations/ products are designed to consider forthcoming climate- related legislation. As part of our CTAP we are committed to improving sourcing transparency, through collaboration with our suppliers, and transparency with consumers through product labelling. We are currently working with the EcoBeautyScore Consortium to develop a common labelling convention that will allow consumers to compare the environmental impact of products. We have a diverse portfolio of products and offer a range of formats to meet consumers' needs and this helps mitigate the potential impact of product labelling regulations.\n\nKey goals:\n\n- \u25a0 100% sustainable sourcing for key agricultural crops",

        "page_content": "## Review of the Year\n\n## Regulatory risks continued\n\n## Risk\n\n## Management of risk\n\n## Extended producer responsibility (EPR)\n\nThis means that producers are held accountable for their environmental and social impacts across the product value chain. This could lead to improvements of lifecycle traceability from sourcing to managing end-of-life treatment of products and packaging. Circular product design and manufacturing practices could become a requirement in many regions to incentivise efficient and responsible resource extraction, and pass waste management costs through higher disposal and recycling fees to producers.\n\nImpact on Business Groups: All Business Groups could be impacted by the extended producer responsibility risk. Given the nature of our products and their packaging, the risk to each Business Group is equal with the exception of the Ice Cream business which does not sell product in single-use sachets. These sachets are difficult to collect and recycle.\n\nTimeframe: Short term to long term\n\n## Energy transition and rising energy prices\n\nThis could be driven by increased electrification, the deployment of renewable energy solutions, associated transmission, distribution and storage infrastructure, as well as the adoption of emerging low-carbon technologies such as biogas, green hydrogen and ammonia. This could increase our operations, suppliers, and end-consumers' utility costs.\n\nImpact on Business Groups: All Business Groups could be impacted by energy transition and rising energy prices and the likely impact would be equal across all the Business Groups.\n\nTimeframe: Short term to long term\n\n## Energy and commodity market volatility\n\nThis could potentially lead to increased uncertainty in financial planning and forecasting for key commodities, as well as a higher cost associated with risk management. Other considerations include potential manufacturing or supply disruptions linked to availability or higher cost of energy and sourced commodities.\n\nImpact on Business Groups: All Business Groups could be impacted by energy and commodity market volatility and the likely impact would be equal across all the Business Groups.\n\nTimeframe: Short term to long term\n\n## Physical environment risks\n\n## Risk\n\n## Management of risk\n\n## Water scarcity\n\nThis could lead to increased droughts while limited resources to irrigate soils could reduce crop outputs. Water shortages could also impact our manufacturing sites and our ability to supply water-based products. Our consumers could also face water shortages in their everyday activities in certain regions, creating a need for water-smart or waterless products or services.\n\nImpact on Business Groups: All Business Groups could be impacted by water scarcity. Given the nature of our products, the impact of drought on crop production would be equal across all Business Groups. However, the impact of water shortages on consumers would likely impact their washing behaviours and hence impact the Personal Care and Home Care businesses to a greater extent.\n\nTimeframe: Medium term to long term\n\nActions: We mitigate physical environment risks by investing in new products and formulations that work with less water, poor quality water or no water. Many of our hair care products now have fast-rinse technology as standard, using less water and we have developed concentrated home care products which reduce water use at our sites but also contribute to reduced packaging and distribution costs. We are working with local communities to develop water stewardship programmes. We monitor changing weather patterns on a short-term basis and integrate weather system modelling into our forecasting process.\n\nKey goals:\n\n- \u25a0 Implement water stewardship programmes in 100 locations in water-stressed areas by 2030\n\nActions: We support EPR policies and schemes and we are investing directly in waste collection, processing and capacitybuilding projects to recycle more plastic.\n\nInnovation is also critical to help develop:\n\n- \u25a0 Suitable packaging that is fully recyclable and more widely recyclable.\n- \u25a0 Product formats suitable for refill and reusable packaging solutions.\n- \u25a0 Higher levels of recycled material into our packaging and components.\n\nKey goals:\n\n- \u25a0 50% virgin plastic reduction by 2025\n- \u25a0 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025\n- \u25a0 25% recycled plastic by 2025\n- \u25a0 Collect and process more plastic than we sell by 2025\n\nActions: We mitigate our market risks by decarbonising our operations through eco-efficiency measures in our factories, powering our operations with renewables and transitioning heating and cooling for our factories to lower emission and renewable sources (see page 44).\n\nKey goals:\n\n- \u25a0 100% renewable electricity by 2030\n- \u25a0 Transition to 100% renewable heat by 2030\n\nActions: We manage commodity price risks through forwardbuying of traded commodities and other hedging mechanisms.\n\nKey goals:\n\n- \u25a0 100% sustainable sourcing for key agricultural crops",

Sustained high temperatures could lead to reduced crop outputs due to reduction in soil productivity which could translate into higher raw material prices. Weather events such as hurricanes or floods, which would become increasingly common and intense, could cause plant outages or disrupt our distribution infrastructure. Additionally, macroeconomic negative shocks, caused by extreme weather events, could reduce or destroy consumer demand and purchasing power among affected communities.\n\nImpact on Business Groups: All Business Groups could be impacted by extreme weather, the most likely significant impact being the reduction of crop outputs which, given the nature of our products, would impact the Business Groups equally.\n\nTimeframe: Medium term to long term\n\n## Innovative products and services opportunities\n\n## Opportunity\n\n## Capitalisation of opportunity\n\n## Growth in plant-based or lab-grown foods\n\nThis could increase rapidly in the coming years.

This could drive decarbonisation across the value chain, while opening up the opportunity to access the utility market as an off-grid generator and create new revenue streams from grid balancing or demand side response services, or providing excess renewable power of oversized capacity to supply chain partners.\n\nTimeframe: Short term to long term\n\nActions: We capitalise on resource efficiency opportunities by generating renewable electricity at our factory sites where feasible (see page 44), targeting emissions reduction from our logistics suppliers and own vehicle fleet (see page 45) and through product reformulations which make our products more resource efficient in use - for example, many of our laundry products are now low-temperature washing as standard (see page 25).\n\nKey targets:\n\n- \u25a0 Zero GHG emissions in our operations by 2030\n\nActions: We have extreme weather contingency plans which we implement as necessary to secure alternative key material supplies at short notice or transfer or share production between manufacturing sites. We manage commodity price risks through forward-buying of traded commodities and other hedging mechanisms. Our Regenerative Agriculture Principles and Sustainable Agriculture Code encourage our agricultural raw material suppliers to adopt practices which increase their productivity and resilience to extreme weather and we aim to increase the hectares of protected and regenerated land.\n\nKey goals:\n\n- \u25a0 Help protect and regenerate 1.5 million hectares of land",

The results are shown in the tables below. These assessments show the gross impact before any action which Unilever might take to respond. The ranges reflect the different results from the reactive (r) and proactive (p) pathways assessed. We first undertook scenario analysis in 2017 on 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios. In 2021, we completed a 1.5\u00b0C scenario analysis.\n\nThe results of this work on the way to 1.5\u00b0C is consistent with this previous work. The key differences are due to: the more extreme measures that would need to be taken to achieve a 1.5\u00b0C outcome; the evolution of the scientific assumptions contained within the IPCC's AR6 report; and a more detailed approach to the scenario analysis. The financial impact in 2030 is more significant in the 1.5\u00b0C scenario. However, the scenario avoids the greater negative impacts from the physical risks associated with higher temperature rise scenarios in 2050 and beyond. In 2023, we updated our financial impact assessment of carbon tax and voluntary carbon removal costs based on i) restated 2021 baseline emissions, ii) an assumption that we achieve 90% reduction by 2050 and iii) only carbon removals are used to achieve net zero goals (no offsets).\n\nOur current internal carbon price of \u20ac70 per tonne, reviewed annually, is based on the range and expected increase from the High-Level Commission on Carbon Pricing's report, released in 2017, concluding on a carbon price of $40-$80 per tonne of CO 2 e by 2020, rising to $50-$100 per tonne by 2030. The carbon prices used for our 1.5\u00b0C scenario analysis for the medium to long term (2030-2050) range from $90/tonne to $250/tonne across the proactive and reactive pathways. These are based on the IEA's Global Energy and Climate ('GEC') 2023 Model 'Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenarios' which assume that carbon prices rise rapidly across all advanced economies as well as in emerging economies with net zero emissions pledges. Our carbon pricing progression thus reflects the expectation from IEA modelling that carbon prices will increase from current prevailing levels.\n\nPotential financial impact on profit in the\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Financial quantification of assessed risks and opportunities year (\u20acbn) (a)                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Financial quantification of assessed risks and opportunities year (\u20acbn) (a)   |   Financial quantification of assessed risks and opportunities year (\u20acbn) (a) |   Financial quantification of assessed risks and opportunities year (\u20acbn) (a) |   Financial quantification of assessed risks and opportunities year (\u20acbn) (a) |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Regulatory and Market Risks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Key assumptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Sensitivity                                                                   |                                                                        2030   |                                                                        2039   |                                                                        2050   |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | \u25a0 Absolute zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions  by 2030 \u25a0 Scope 3 emissions taxes exclude  indirect consumer use emissions \u25a0 2021 baseline                                                                                                                                            | p                                                                             |                                                                          -5.4 |                                                                         -10.4 |                                                                          -1.8 |\n| 1.

The next level of impact would be as a result of the transition of the energy system with rising energy prices and market volatility. We would also experience the impact of physical environment risks associated with a warmer climate, even in a 1.5\u00b0C world. While the potential risks and financial impact of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C are significant if no mitigating actions are taken, the impact of the potential risks that would exist if we were not to reduce warming to 1.5\u00b0C is potentially even more significant.\n\nThe outcomes from our analysis provide us with initial high-level insights into these potential business and financial impacts. These form an important input to our strategic planning process and updated CTAP.\n\nIn summary, the radical and disruptive system-wide transformation we could face in the journey to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C by 2100, would present a significant range of material risks, where regulatory and economic risks would be the most disruptive. However, many opportunities would also emerge, which we would be well placed to seize given our ambitious goals and targets are aligned with a proactive route towards net zero by 2039.\n\nThere is still much to do to advance our understanding of the risks and opportunities facing our business and our industry, and our strategic responses to such a radically different future. This analysis represents an important step to continue to engage and challenge our business and our stakeholders to define how we can make sustainable living commonplace.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nOur CTAP includes key metrics and targets to assess and manage climate risks and opportunities across our value chain. Two of the targets are recognised as science-based targets by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We intend to retire our target to halve our greenhouse gas impact across the lifecycle by 2030 in 2024. Therefore, we have submitted two new Scope 3 near-term targets to the SBTi during 2023 which are awaiting approval - see page 46 for more details. A summary of the climate metrics and targets we are currently able to measure can be found on pages 46 to 47, and form part of these TCFD disclosures.",

This variance was primarily due to the cash proceeds received from the disposal of the global tea business in 2022 of \u20ac4.6 billion. The net cash outflow in 2023 was primarily the result of capital expenditure, purchase of financial assets and acquisitions, partly offset by proceeds from the disposals of Suave and Dollar Shave Club.

The impact from share buybacks was consistent with the prior year.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\n| \u20ac million                      | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Goodwill and intangible assets | 39,466 | 40,489 |\n| Other non-current assets       | 17,898 | 18,175 |\n| Current assets                 | 17,902 | 19,157 |\n| Total assets                   | 75,266 | 77,821 |\n| Current liabilities            | 23,507 | 25,427 |\n| Non-current liabilities        | 30,995 | 30,693 |\n| Total liabilities              | 54,502 | 56,120 |\n| Shareholders' equity           | 18,102 | 19,021 |\n| Non-controlling interest       | 2,662  | 2,680  |\n| Total equity                   | 20,764 | 21,701 |\n| Total liabilities and equity   | 75,266 | 77,821 |\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets were \u20ac39.5 billion. This was a decrease of \u20ac(1.0) billion compared to the prior year. The decrease was due to an adverse currency impact of \u20ac1.0 billion, with other movements from the acquisitions of Yasso and OZiva offset by the disposal of Suave and classification of Elida Beauty as held for sale. See note 21 on pages 220 to 222 and note 9 on pages 195 to 197 for more.\n\nOther non-current assets decreased by \u20ac(0.3) billion with a reduced net pension surplus mainly due to lower interest rates leading to increased pension liabilities, partly offset by the increased value of bonds and similar assets. Current assets decreased by \u20ac(1.3) billion led by trade and other current receivables, inventories and cash and cash equivalents, partly offset by an increase in other financial assets and assets held for sale following the announcement on the sale of the Elida Beauty business. Inventories decreased by \u20ac(0.8) billion due to currency movements, improved inventory days on hand and the impact of business disposals. Receivables decreased by \u20ac(1.3) billion, including the impact of \u20ac(0.6) billion due to currency movements and \u20ac(0.7) billion due to the exit of the TSA relating to the disposal of our global tea business. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by \u20ac(0.2) billion.\n\nNon-controlling interest was flat versus the prior year.\n\n## Net debt*\n\nClosing net debt was \u20ac23.7 billion, in line with 31 December 2022. Capital returns of \u20ac4.4 billion in dividends and \u20ac1.5 billion in share buybacks to PLC shareholders, as well as net spend on acquisition and disposal activity, were fully funded by the free cash flow delivery of \u20ac7.1 billion. Net debt to underlying earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (UEBITDA) was 2.1 as at 31 December 2023, in line with the prior year. Underlying EBITDA means operating profit before the impact of depreciation, amortisation and nonunderlying items within operating profit. This is primarily used to assess our leverage level.\n\n## Movement in net pension liability/asset\n\nThe table below shows the movement in net pension liability/ asset during the year. Pension assets net of liabilities were in surplus of \u20ac2.4 billion at the end of 2023 compared with a surplus of \u20ac2.6 billion at the end of 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by reductions in interest rates increasing liabilities more than assets.\n\n| \u20ac million                                         | 2023   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1 January                                         | 2,569  |\n| Gross service cost                                | (128)  |\n| Employee contributions                            | 11     |\n| Actual return on plan assets (excluding interest) | 131    |\n| Net interest income/(cost)                        | 110    |\n| Actuarial gain/(loss)                             | (870)  |\n| Employer contributions                            | 407    |\n| Currency retranslation                            | 186    |\n| Other movements (a)                               | (15)   |\n| 31 December                                       | 2,401  |",

        "page_content": "## Our Performance\n\n## Finance and liquidity\n\nApproximately \u20ac0.9 billion (or 21%) of the Group's cash and cash equivalents are held in central finance companies, for maximum flexibility. These companies provide loans to our subsidiaries that are also funded through retained earnings and third-party borrowings. We maintain access to global debt markets through an infrastructure of short- and long-term debt programmes. We make use of plain vanilla derivatives, such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, to help mitigate risks. More detail is provided in notes 16, 16A, 16B and 16C on pages 208 to 214. The remaining \u20ac3.3 billion (or 79%) of the Group's cash and cash equivalents are held in foreign subsidiaries which repatriate distributable reserves on a regular basis. For most countries, this is done through dividends which are in some cases subject to withholding or distribution tax. This balance includes \u20ac98 million (2022: \u20ac449 million, 2021: \u20ac83 million) of cash that is held in a few countries where we face cross-border foreign exchange controls and/or other legal restrictions that inhibit our ability to make these balances available in any means for general use by the wider business. The cash will generally be invested or held in the relevant country and, given the other capital resources available to the Group, does not significantly affect the ability of the Group to meet its cash obligations. We closely monitor all our exposures and counter-party limits. Unilever has committed credit facilities in place for general corporate purposes. The undrawn bilateral committed credit facilities in place on 31 December 2023 were $5,200 million and \u20ac2,600 million. Further information on liquidity management is set out in note 16A to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Material cash commitments from contractual and other obligations\n\nThe following table shows the amount of our contractual and other obligations as at 31 December 2023. The material cash commitments from contractual and other obligations arise from our borrowings which include bonds, commercial paper, bank and other loans, interest on these borrowings and trade payables and accruals.\n\n| \u20ac million                                                              | 2023   | Due  within 1  year   | Due in 1-3 years   | Due in 3-5 years   | Due in  over 5  years   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|\n| Bonds                                                                  | 25,782 | 2,595                 | 5,048              | 5,932              | 12,207                  |\n| Commercial paper,  bank and other  loans                               | 1,973  | 1,972                 | 1                  | -                  | -                       |\n| Interest on  financial liabilities                                     | 4,268  | 607                   | 1,032              | 805                | 1,824                   |\n| Trade payables  and accruals                                           | 16,245 | 16,113                | 86                 | 20                 | 26                      |\n| Lease liabilities                                                      | 1,691  | 407                   | 576                | 346                | 362                     |\n| Other lease  commitments                                               | 291    | 64                    | 42                 | 37                 | 148                     |\n| Purchase  obligations (a)  &  other long-term  commitments Others  (b) | 4,370  | 1,510                 | 1,806              | 789                | 265                     |\n|                                                                        | 715    | 306                   | 407                | -                  | 2                       |\n| Total                                                                  | 55,335 | 23,574                | 8,998              | 7,929              | 14,834                  |\n\nFurther details are set out in the following notes to the consolidated financial statements: note 10 on pages 197 to 199, note 15C on pages 206 to 207, and note 20 on pages 219 and 220. We are satisfied that our financing arrangements are adequate to meet our short-term and long-term cash requirements. In relation to the facilities available to the Group, borrowing requirements do not fluctuate materially during the year and are not seasonal.\n\n## Guaranteed US debt securities\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group had in issue US$11.2 billion (2022: US$10.8 billion; 2021: US$12.1 billion) bonds in connection with a US shelf registration. See page 255 for more information on these bonds and related commentary on guarantor information.\n\n## Non-GAAP measures\n\nCertain discussions and analyses set out in this Annual Report and Accounts (and the Additional Information for US Listing Purposes) include measures which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) such as IFRS. We believe this information, along with comparable GAAP measurements, is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring our operating performance, and our ability to retire debt and invest in new business opportunities. Our management uses these financial measures, along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating performance and value creation. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP. Wherever appropriate and practical, we provide reconciliation to relevant GAAP measures.\n\n## Explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures\n\nUnilever uses 'constant rate' and 'underlying' measures primarily for internal performance analysis and targeting purposes. We present certain items, percentages and movements, using constant exchange rates, which exclude the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We calculate constant currency values by translating both the current and the prior period local currency amounts using the prior year average exchange rates into euro, except for the local currency of entities that operate in hyperinflationary economies. These currencies are translated into euros using the prior year closing exchange rate before the application of IAS 29.\n\nThe table below shows exchange rate movements in our key markets.\n\n|                              | Annual average  rate in 2023   | Annual average  rate in 2022   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Brazilian real (\u20ac1 = BRL)    | 5.405                          | 5.414                          |\n| Chinese yuan (\u20ac1 = CNY)      | 7.635                          | 7.047                          |\n| Indian rupee (\u20ac1 = INR)      | 89.232                         | 82.303                         |\n| Indonesia rupiah (\u20ac1 = IDR)  | 16,457                         | 15,535                         |\n| Philippine peso (\u20ac1 = PHP)   | 60.110                         | 57.194                         |\n| UK pound sterling (\u20ac1 = GBP) | 0.870                          | 0.851                          |\n| US dollar (\u20ac1 = US$)         | 1.081                          | 1.050                          |",

        "page_content": "## Our Performance\n\nIn the following sections, we set out our definitions of the following non-GAAP measures and provide reconciliation to relevant GAAP measures:\n\n- \u25a0 underlying sales growth;\n- \u25a0 underlying price growth;\n- \u25a0 underlying volume growth;\n- \u25a0 non-underlying items;\n- \u25a0 underlying operating profit and underlying operating margin;\n- \u25a0 underlying earnings per share;\n- \u25a0 underlying effective tax rate;\n- \u25a0 constant underlying earnings per share;\n- \u25a0 free cash flow;\n- \u25a0 cash conversion;\n- \u25a0 net debt;\n- \u25a0 underlying return on invested capital; and\n- \u25a0 underlying return on assets.\n\n## Underlying sales growth\n\nUnderlying sales growth (USG) refers to the increase in turnover for the period, excluding any change in turnover resulting from acquisitions, disposals, changes in currency and price growth in excess of 26% in hyperinflationary economies. Inflation of 26% per year compounded over three years is one of the key indicators within IAS 29 to assess whether an economy is deemed to be hyperinflationary. We believe this measure provides valuable additional information on the underlying sales performance of the business and is a key measure used internally. The impact of acquisitions and disposals is excluded from USG for a period of 12 calendar months from the applicable closing date. Turnover from acquired brands that are launched in countries where they were not previously sold is included in USG as such turnover is more attributable to our existing sales and distribution network than the acquisition itself.\n\nThe reconciliation of changes in the GAAP measure of turnover to USG is as follows:\n\nBeauty &\n\n| 2023 vs 2022 (%)                                      | Wellbeing   | Personal Care   | Home Care   | Nutrition   | Ice Cream   | Group   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|\n| Turnover growth (a)                                   | 1.8         | 1.4             | (1.8)       | (5.0)       | 0.5         | (0.8)   |\n| Effect of acquisitions                                | 1.9         | -               | -           | -           | 0.9         | 0.5     |\n| Effect of disposals                                   | (1.7)       | (0.9)           | -           | (6.9)       | -           | (2.1)   |\n| Effect of currency-related items,                     | (6.2)       | (6.1)           | (7.2)       | (5.2)       | (2.7)       | (5.7)   |\n| of which:                                             |             |                 |             |             |             |         |\n| Exchange rate changes                                 | (7.5)       | (8.0)           | (10.3)      | (6.8)       | (5.4)       | (7.8)   |\n| Extreme price growth in hyperinflationary markets (b) | 1.5         | 2.1             | 3.4         | 1.7         | 2.8         | 2.2     |\n| Underlying sales growth (b)                           | 8.3         | 8.9             | 5.9         | 7.7         | 2.3         | 7.0     |\n| 2022 vs 2021 (%)                                      |             |                 |             |             |             |         |\n| Turnover growth (a)                                   | 20.8        | 15.9            | 17.3        | 6.1         | 14.8        | 14.5    |\n| Effect of acquisitions                                | 3.8         | -               | -           | 0.3         | -           | 0.8     |\n| Effect of disposals                                   | (0.1)       | -               | -           | (7.1)       | -           | (1.8)   |\n| Effect of currency-related items,                     | 8.1         | 7.4             | 4.9         | 4.9         | 5.4         | 6.2     |\n| of which:                                             |             |                 |             |             |             |         |\n| Exchange rate changes                                 | 6.9         | 6.2             | 2.6         | 3.6         | 3.9         | 4.7     |\n| Extreme price growth in hyperinflationary markets (b) | 1.0         | 1.1             | 2.2         | 1.2         | 1.5         | 1.4     |\n| Underlying sales growth (b)                           | 7.8         | 7.9             | 11.8        | 8.6         | 9.0         | 9.0     |\n| 2021 vs 2020 (%)                                      |             |                 |             |             |             |         |\n| Turnover growth (a)                                   | 11.6        | (2.3)           | 1.1         | 4.9         | 3.2         | 3.4     |\n| Effect of acquisitions                                | 6.0         | -               | -           | 1.3         | -           | 1.4     |\n| Effect of disposals                                   | -           | -               | (0.1)       | (0.3)       | (0.1)       | (0.1)   |\n| Effect of currency-related items,                     | (3.0)       | (2.6)           | (2.6)       | (1.5)       | (2.3)       | (2.4)   |\n| of which:                                             |             |                 |             |             |             |         |\n| Exchange rate changes                                 | (3.1)       | (2.9)           | (2.9)       | (1.8)       | (2.6)       | (2.6)   |\n| Extreme price growth in hyperinflationary markets (b) | 0.2         | 0.3             | 0.3         | 0.3         | 0.4         | 0.3     |\n| Underlying sales growth (b)                           | 8.5         | 0.3             | 3.9         | 5.5         | 5.7         | 4.5     |",

UVG therefore excludes any impact on USG due to changes in prices.\n\n## Underlying price growth\n\nUnderlying price growth (UPG) is part of USG and means, for the applicable period, the increase in turnover attributable to changes in prices during the period. UPG therefore excludes the impact to USG due to (i) the volume of products sold; and (ii) the composition of products sold during the period. In determining changes in price we exclude the impact of price growth in excess of 26% per year in hyperinflationary economies as explained in USG above.\n\nThe relationship between USG, UVG and UPG is set out below:\n\n|                              |   2023 vs 2022 | 2022 vs 2021   |   2021 vs 2020 |\n|------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Underlying volume growth (%) |            0.2 | (2.1)          |            1.6 |\n| Underlying price growth (%)  |            6.8 | 11.3           |            0.3 |\n| Underlying sales growth (%)  |            7   | 9.0            |            1.9 |\n\n## Non-underlying items\n\nSeveral non-GAAP measures are adjusted to exclude items defined as non-underlying due to their nature and/or frequency of occurrence:\n\n- \u25a0 Non-underlying items within operating profit are: gains or losses on business disposals, acquisition and disposal related costs, restructuring costs, impairments and other items within operating profit classified here due to their nature and frequency.\n- \u25a0 Non-underlying items not in operating profit but within net profi t are: net monetary gain/(loss) arising from hyperinflationary economies and significant and unusual items in net finance cost, share of profit/(loss) of joint ventures and associates and taxation.\n- \u25a0 Non-underlying items are both non-underlying items within operating profit and those non-underlying items not in operating profit but within net profit.\n\nThe breakdown of non-underlying items is shown below:\n\n|                                                                                    | \u20ac million 2023   | \u20ac million 2022   | \u20ac million 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Non-underlying items within operating profit before tax                            | (173)            | 1,072            | (934)            |\n| Acquisition and disposal-related costs (a)                                         | (242)            | (50)             | (332)            |\n| Gain on disposal of group companies (b)                                            | 489              | 2,335            | 36               |\n| Restructuring costs (c)                                                            | (499)            | (777)            | (632)            |\n| Impairments (d)                                                                    | (1)              | (221)            | (17)             |\n| Other (e)                                                                          | 80               | (215)            | 11               |\n| Tax on non-underlying items within operating profit                                | 207              | 273              | 219              |\n| Non-underlying items within operating profit after tax                             | 34               | 1,345            | (715)            |\n| Non-underlying items not in operating profit but within net profit before tax      | (153)            | (164)            | (64)             |\n| Interest related to the UK tax audit of intangible income and centralised services | (11)             | (7)              | 10               |\n| Net monetary gain/(loss) arising from hyperinflationary economies                  | (142)            | (157)            | (74)             |\n| Tax impact of non-underlying items not in operating profit but within net profit   | 12               | (121)            | (41)             |\n| Tax related to the separation of the Tea business                                  | (4)              | (35)             | -

For each division, operating margin is computed as operating profit divided by turnover and underlying operating margin is computed as underlying operating profit divided by turnover.\n\n## Underlying earnings per share\n\nUnderlying earnings per share (underlying EPS) is calculated as underlying profit attributable to shareholders' equity divided by the diluted average number of ordinary shares. In calculating underlying profit attributable to shareholders' equity, net profit attributable to shareholders' equity is adjusted to eliminate the post-tax impact of non-underlying items. This measure reflects the underlying earnings for each share unit of the Group.\n\nThe reconciliation of net profit attributable to shareholders' equity to underlying profit attributable to shareholders' equity is as follows:\n\n| \u20ac million                                                                                         | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Net profit                                                                                        | 7,140   | 8,269   | 6,621   |\n| Non-controlling interests                                                                         | (653)   | (627)   | (572)   |\n| Net profit attributable to shareholders'  equity - used for basic and diluted  earnings per share | 6,487   | 7,642   | 6,049   |\n| Post-tax impact of non-underlying  items                                                          | 101     | (1,074) | 790     |\n| Underlying profit attributable to  shareholders' equity - used for  underlying earnings per share | 6,588   | 6,568   | 6,839   |\n| Adjusted average number of shares  (millions of share units)                                      | 2,532.4 | 2,559.8 | 2,609.6 |\n| Diluted EPS (\u20ac)                                                                                   | 2.56    | 2.99    | 2.32    |\n| Underlying EPS - diluted (\u20ac)                                                                      | 2.60    | 2.57    | 2.62    |\n\n## Underlying effective tax rate\n\nThe underlying effective tax rate is calculated by dividing taxation excluding the tax impact of non-underlying items by profit before tax excluding the impact of non-underlying items and share of net profit/(loss) of joint ventures and associates.\n\nThis measure reflects the underlying tax rate in relation to profit before tax excluding non-underlying items before tax and share of net (profit)/loss of joint ventures and associates.\n\nTax impact on non-underlying items within operating profit is the sum of the tax on each non-underlying item, based on the applicable country tax rates and tax treatment.\n\nThis is shown in the table:\n\n| \u20ac million                                                                                                                     | 2023   | 2022    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Taxation                                                                                                                      | 2,199  | 2,068   |\n| Tax impact of:                                                                                                                |        |         |\n| Non-underlying items within operating profit                                                                                  | 207    | 273     |\n| Non-underlying items not in operating profit but  within net profit (a)                                                       | 12     | (121)   |\n| Taxation before tax impact of non-underlying                                                                                  | 2,418  | 2,220   |\n| Profit before taxation                                                                                                        | 9,339  | 10,337  |\n| Share of net (profit)/loss of joint ventures and  associates                                                                  | (231)  | (208)   |\n| Profit before tax excluding share of net profit/ (loss) of joint ventures and associates                                      | 9,108  | 10,129  |\n| Non-underlying items within operating profit  before tax (a)                                                                  | 173    | (1,072) |\n| Non-underlying items not in operating profit but  within net profit before tax                                                | 153    | 164     |\n| Profit before tax excluding non-underlying items  before tax and share of net profit/(loss) of joint  ventures and associates | 9,434  | 9,221   |\n| Effective tax rate                                                                                                            | 24.1   | 20.4    |\n| Underlying effective tax rate                                                                                                 | 25.6   | 24.1    |\n\n## Constant underlying earnings per share\n\nConstant underlying earnings per share (constant underlying EPS) is calculated as underlying profit attributable to shareholders' equity at constant exchange rates and excluding the impact of both translational hedges and price growth in excess of 26% per year in hyperinflationary economies divided by the diluted average number of ordinary share units.

The annual average is computed by adding the amounts at the beginning and the end of the calendar year and dividing by two.\n\n## \u20ac million\n\n| 2023                                         | Beauty &  Wellbeing   | Personal Care   | Home Care   | Nutrition   | Ice Cream   | Total    |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------|\n| Underlying operating profit before tax       | 2,331                 | 2,792           | 1,496       | 2,460       | 852         | 9,931    |\n| Tax on underlying operating profit           | (597)                 | (716)           | (383)       | (631)       | (218)       | (2,545)  |\n| Underlying operating profit after tax        | 1,734                 | 2,076           | 1,113       | 1,829       | 634         | 7,386    |\n| Property plant and equipment                 | 1,773                 | 2,340           | 1,979       | 1,976       | 2,639       | 10,707   |\n| Net assets held for sale                     | -                     | (31)            | -           | 15          | -           | (16)     |\n| Inventories                                  | 1,179                 | 1,128           | 785         | 1,090       | 937         | 5,119    |\n| Trade and other receivables                  | 1,208                 | 1,340           | 1,180       | 1,279       | 768         | 5,775    |\n| Trade payables and other current liabilities | (3,439)               | (3,746)         | (3,626)     | (3,646)     | (2,400)     | (16,857) |\n| Period-end assets (net)                      | 721                   | 1,031           | 318         | 714         | 1,944       | 4,728    |\n| Average assets for the period (net)          | 880                   | 1,164           | 420         | 866         | 1,910       | 5,241    |\n| Underlying return on assets (%)              | 197                   | 178             | 265         | 211         | 33          | 141      |\n| 2022                                         |                       |                 |             |             |             |          |\n| Underlying operating profit before tax       | 2,292                 | 2,679           | 1,344       | 2,449       | 919         | 9,683    |\n| Tax on underlying operating profit           | (552)                 | (644)           | (324)       | (590)       | (221)       | (2,331)  |\n| Underlying operating profit after tax        | 1,740                 | 2,035           | 1,020       | 1,859       | 698         | 7,352    |\n| Property plant and equipment                 | 1,775                 | 2,259           | 2,112       | 2,196       | 2,428       | 10,770   |\n| Net assets held for sale                     | -                     | 2               | -           | 20          | -           | 22       |\n| Inventories                                  | 1,386                 | 1,352           | 909         | 1,267       | 1,017       | 5,931    |\n| Trade and other receivables                  | 1,439                 | 1,601           | 1,457       | 1,632       | 927         | 7,056    |\n| Trade payables and other current liabilities | (3,562)               | (3,918)         | (3,955)     | (4,095)     | (2,493)     | (18,023) |\n| Period-end assets (net)                      | 1,038                 | 1,296           | 523         | 1,020       | 1,879       | 5,756    |\n| Average assets for the period (net)          | 979                   | 1,403           | 558         | 1,295       | 1,780       | 6,015    |\n| Underlying return on assets (%)              | 178                   | 145             | 183         | 144         | 39          | 122      |\n\n## Other information\n\n## Accounting standards and critical accounting policies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the UK and IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

        "page_content": "## Our Performance\n\n## EU Taxonomy disclosures\n\nThe EU Taxonomy sets out reporting obligations for certain European businesses. It outlines certain activities deemed to be environmentally sustainable and refers to them as 'eligible' and 'aligned' activities. For financial year 2023, businesses need to assess whether they have eligible activities within each of the six environmental objectives: i) climate change mitigation, ii) climate change adaptation, iii) sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, iv) transition to a circular economy, v) pollution prevention and control, and vi) protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. Eligibility reporting for objectives iii) to vi) is a new requirement for the financial year 2023 reporting.\n\nIf the eligible activities are considered to make a substantial contribution and do no significant harm in accordance with the criteria set out in the regulations, then the eligible activities are designated as 'aligned' as long as the business also meets a minimum set of criteria with respect to human rights, bribery and corruption, taxation and fair competition.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy remains a work in progress, and in creating the current list of environmentally sustainable activities, the European Commission have not yet considered our industry, focusing instead on the more carbon intensive industries where they believe there is the most potential for climate change mitigation or adaptation.\n\nUsing the current list of eligible activities and the alignment criteria, we have reviewed the Group's turnover, capital expenditure and operating expenditure (as defined by the EU Taxonomy) to identify the extent of any eligible and aligned activities within our business. The outcome of our review is presented below.\n\nAs the EU Taxonomy is not yet applicable to us and we are providing these disclosures voluntarily, we have chosen to set out the extent of our eligible and aligned activities in a simplified format instead of showing them in the tables prescribed by the EU Taxonomy.\n\n## Turnover\n\nNone of our turnover as detailed in our consolidated income statement (page 173) for the year ended 31 December 2023 is derived from eligible activities. As a consequence, none of our turnover can be classified as aligned.\n\n## Operating expenditure\n\nOperating expenditure as per the EU Taxonomy is defined as directly incurred, non-capitalised costs relating to research and development, building renovations, short-term leases and the repair and maintenance of property, plant and equipment. None of our operating expenditure for the year ended 31 December 2023 is in respect of eligible activities. As a consequence, none of our operating expenditure can be classified as aligned.\n\n## Capital expenditure (intangible assets and property, plant and equipment)\n\n17.7% of our capital expenditure for the year ended 31 December 2023, as detailed in our consolidated financial statements (pages 195 and 197 to 199) is in respect of eligible activities. There are eligible activities in respect to i) climate change mitigation, ii) climate change adaptation. The majority of this relates to the acquisition of buildings as shown in the tables below. There are no eligible activities in respect of iii) sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, iv) transition to a circular economy, v) pollution prevention and control, and vi) protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. We have determined that none this eligible capital expenditure can be classified as aligned. The principal reason is because we do not have sufficient detailed documentation to support that this expenditure makes a substantial contribution to either the climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation environmental objectives.

        "page_content": "## Our Principal Risks\n\n## Our Principal Risks\n\n## Our risk appetite and approach to risk management\n\nRisk management is integral to Unilever's strategy and the achievement of Unilever's long-term goals. Our success as an organisation depends on our ability to identify and exploit the opportunities generated by our business and in our markets. In doing this, we take an embedded approach to risk management which puts risk at the core of the Board agenda, which is where we believe it should be.\n\nUnilever's appetite for risk is driven by the following:\n\n- \u25a0 Our growth should be consistent, competitive, profitable and responsible.\n- \u25a0 Our actions on issues such as plastic and climate change must reflect their urgency, and not be constrained by the uncertainty of potential impacts.\n- \u25a0 Our behaviours must be in line with our Code of Business Principles and Code Policies.\n- \u25a0 Our ambition to continuously improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness.\n- \u25a0 Our aim to maintain a minimum A/A2 credit rating on a long-term basis.\n\nOur approach to risk management is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that our assets are safeguarded, the risks facing the business are being assessed and mitigated, and all information that may be required to be disclosed is reported to Unilever's senior management including, where appropriate, the CEO and CFO.\n\n## Organisation\n\nThe Board has overall accountability for the management of risk and reviewing the effectiveness of Unilever's risk management and internal control systems. The Board has established a clear organisational structure with well-defined accountabilities for the principal risks that Unilever faces in the short, medium and long term. In this structure, the Board has delegated the overall accountability for risk management to both the CEO and CFO. The distribution of accountabilities and responsibilities ensures that every segment (either Business Group or country) through which we operate has specific resources and processes for risk reviews and risk mitigation. This is supported by the ULE, which takes active responsibility for focusing on the principal areas of risk to Unilever, including any emerging areas of risks. The Board regularly review these risk areas, including consideration of environmental, social and governance matters, and retain responsibility for determining the nature and extent of the significant risks that Unilever is prepared to take to achieve its strategic objectives.\n\n## Foundation and principles\n\nUnilever's approach to doing business is framed by our purpose and values (see page 4). Our Code of Business Principles sets out the standards of behaviour that we expect all employees to adhere to. Day-to-day responsibility for ensuring these principles are applied rests with senior management across Business Groups, geographies and functions.\n\nA network of Business Integrity Officers and Committees supports the activities necessary to communicate the Code, deliver training, maintain processes and procedures (including support lines) to report and respond to alleged breaches, and to capture and communicate learnings. We have a framework of Code Policies that underpins the Code of Business Principles and sets out the non-negotiable standards of behaviour expected from all our employees.\n\nFor each of our principal risks we have a risk management framework detailing the controls we have in place and who is responsible for managing both the overall risk and the individual controls mitigating that risk. Unilever's functional standards define mandatory requirements across a range of specialist areas, which are key controls in mitigating these risks. Examples include health and safety, cyber, accounting and reporting, and financial risk management.\n\nOur assessment of risk considers both short-term and longterm risks, including how these risks are changing, together with emerging risk areas. These are reviewed on an ongoing basis, and formally by senior management and the Board at least once a year.\n\n## Processes\n\nUnilever operates a wide range of processes and activities across all its operations covering strategy, planning, execution and performance management. Risk management is integrated into every stage.\n\n## Assurance and re-assurance\n\nAssurance on compliance with the Code of Business Principles and our Code Policies is obtained annually from Unilever management via a formal Code declaration. In addition, there are specialist awareness and training programmes which are run throughout the year and vary depending on the business priorities. These specialist compliance programmes supplement the Code declaration. An integrated assurance map is maintained across the principal risks to confirm the mitigation in place through the three lines of defence. Our Corporate Audit function plays a vital role in providing to both management and the Board an objective and independent review of the effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems throughout Unilever.\n\n## Board assessment of compliance with the risk management frameworks\n\nThe Board, advised by the Committees where appropriate, regularly review the significant risks and decisions that could have a material impact on Unilever. These reviews consider the level of risk that Unilever is prepared to take in pursuit of the business strategy and the effectiveness of the management controls in place to mitigate the risk exposure.\n\nThe Board, through the Audit Committee, has reviewed the assessment of risks, internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures in operation within Unilever. They have also considered the effectiveness of any remedial actions taken for the year covered by this Annual Report and Accounts and up to the date of its approval by the Board.\n\nDetails of the activities of the Audit Committee in relation to this can be found in the Report of the Audit Committee on pages 107 to 111.\n\nFurther statements on compliance with the specific risk management and control requirements in the UK Corporate Governance Code (2018), the US Securities Exchange Act (1934) and the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) can be found on pages 100 to 101.",

        "page_content": "## Our Principal Risks\n\n## Principal Risks\n\nOur business is subject to risks and uncertainties. On the following pages we have identified the risks that we regard as the most material to Unilever's business and performance at this time.\n\nOur principal risks include risks that could impact our business in the short term (i.e. the next two years), medium term (i.e. the next three to ten years) or over the longer term (i.e. beyond ten years). As part of our process to review our principal risks, we also consider any additional risks that could emerge in the future.\n\nOur principal risks have remained consistent with previous years. We also reflect on whether we think the level of risk associated with each of our principal risks is increasing or decreasing. There are three principal risks where we believe there is an increased level of risk compared with last year:\n\n- \u25a0 Consumer preference: consumer choices and the manner in which they shop is rapidly evolving requiring us to be ahead of our competition.\n- \u25a0 Climate change: this risk has further intensified during 2023, as actions to address global warming are not moving at the pace anticipated and there has been an increase in physical climate risks seen by increased flooding and droughts together with the ongoing global energy crisis.\n- \u25a0 Systems and information: technology is disrupting the way we do business and we need to accelerate innovation to keep pace with the developments. The cyber threat landscape has increased in the recent past and continues to remain volatile.\n\nBiodiversity loss continues to be monitored as an emerging risk. A loss of forests and soil due to potential physical and regulatory risks could make future harvests more difficult and expensive in the long-term (see pages 51 to 53). Refer to our Climate Transition Action Plan: Annual Progress Report (pages 43 to 47) for steps taken to improve biodiversity. Technological advancements such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and augmented reality are disrupting the way we do business and connect with consumers. We do not consider this as a principal risk yet but do acknowledge that it is both a risk and an opportunity. We have an executive-level task force set up to identify the risks, opportunities and, at the same time, take responsible action to keep pace with technology.\n\nWe set out below certain mitigating actions that we believe help us to manage our principal risks. However, we may not be successful in deploying some or all of these mitigating actions. If the circumstances in these risks occur or are not successfully mitigated, our cash flow, operating results, financial position, business and reputation could be materially adversely affected. In addition, risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to vary from those described, which may include forward-looking statements, or could impact on our ability to meet our targets or be detrimental to our profitability or reputation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Risk                 | Risk description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Management of risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Level of risk   |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Consumer  preference | Our success depends on the value and  relevance of our brands and products to  consumers around the world and on our  ability to innovate and remain competitive.

This review incorporated the activities and key risks of the Group together with the factors likely to affect the Group's future development, performance, financial position, cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities as described on pages 1 to 64. In addition, we describe in notes 15 to 18 on pages 203 to 218 the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit and liquidity risk.\n\n## Assessment\n\nIn order to report on the long-term viability of the Group, the Directors reviewed the overall funding capacity and headroom available to withstand severe events and carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. This includes consideration of external factors such as rises in inflation and slowing GDP growth. The assessment also included reviewing and understanding the\n\nmitigation factors in respect of each principal risk. The risks and mitigating factors are summarised on pages 71 to 78.\n\nThe viability assessment has three parts:\n\n- \u25a0 First, the Directors considered the period over which they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue to operate and meet its liabilities;\n- \u25a0 Second, they considered the current debt facilities and debt headroom over the viability period, assuming that any debt maturing can be re-financed at commercially acceptable terms; and\n- \u25a0 Third, they considered the potential impact of severe but plausible scenarios over this period including:\n- \u25a0 assessing scenarios for each individual principal risk, for example the termination of our relationships with the three largest global customers; the loss of all material litigation cases; a major IT data breach; the lost cost and growth opportunities from not keeping up with technological changes and increase in physical climate risks including its impact on operational costs; and\n- \u25a0 assessing scenarios that involve more than one principal risk including the following multi-risk scenarios:\n\n| Multi-risk scenarios modelled                                                                                                                                                                 | Level of severity reviewed                                                                                                                                                                                           | Link to principal risk                                             |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Contamination issue with one of our  brands caused by regulated ingredients  and the temporary closure of three of  our largest factories.                                                    | Significant reduction in sales for some of the  Business Groups along with percolating impact  on other brands and closure of three of our  largest factories for a period of six months.                            | \u25a0 Safe and high-quality products \u25a0 Brand preference \u25a0 Supply chain |\n| Geopolitical tensions leading to a major  global incident affecting the availability  of key materials from a location and  increasing polarisation of issues leading  to loss of reputation. | Closure of a key geographic market impacting  availability of raw materials and impact on  turnover arising from reputational loss due to  polarisation of issues.                                                   | \u25a0 Economic and political  instability \u25a0 Supply chain               |\n| Climate change-related flooding  driving closure of a key sourcing unit  and significant water shortages in  key markets.                                                                     | Closure of a sourcing unit for a period of six  months and significant water shortages causing  supply chain disruption in water-stressed sites  and changing consumer preference towards  water-efficient products. | \u25a0 Climate change \u25a0 Supply chain \u25a0 Brand preference                 |\n| Cyber-attack causing a sustained  shutdown of manufacturing systems and  the impact on profit if management failed  to deliver a major transformation project.                                | Loss of turnover coupled with reduced margins  and ongoing reputational damage and loss of  confidence from our customers and consumers.                                                                             | \u25a0 Systems and information  \u25a0 Business transformation               |\n\n## Findings\n\n- \u25a0 Firstly, a three-year period is considered appropriate for this viability assessment because it is the period covered by the strategic plan; and it enables a high level of confidence in assessing viability, even in extreme adverse events, due to factors such as:\n- \u25a0 the Group has considerable financial resources together with established business relationships with many customers and suppliers in countries throughout the world;\n- high cash generation by the Group's operations and\n- \u25a0 access to the external debt markets;\n- \u25a0 flexibility of cash outflow with respect to significant marketing programmes and capital expenditure projects which usually have a two-to-three year horizon; and\n- \u25a0 the Group's diverse product and geographical activities which are impacted by continuously evolving technology and innovation.\n- \u25a0 Secondly, the Group's debt headroom and funding profile was assessed. None of the future outlooks considered resulted in significant liquidity headroom issues, primarily because:\n- \u25a0 the Group has a healthy balance of short-term and long-term debt programmes, with repayment profiles ensuring shortterm commercial paper maturities do not exceed \u20ac0.5 billion in any given week and long-term debt maturities do not exceed \u20ac4.0 billion in any given calendar year\n- \u25a0 the Group has the equivalent of \u20ac7.3 billion in committed credit facilities with a maturity of 364 days which are used for backing up our commercial paper programmes.\n- \u25a0 Thirdly, for each of our 14 principal risks, one of which is climate, worst-case plausible scenarios have been assessed together with multi-risk scenarios. None of the scenarios reviewed, either individually or in aggregate would cause Unilever to cease to be viable.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOn the basis described above, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period of their assessment.",

In doing so I must give further thanks to Nils Andersen, as Chair of the Company until the end of November, for the legacy of strong corporate governance at Unilever that he passes on to me.\n\nThe priority of the Board in relation to governance in the past year has been establishing effective succession and providing support to the Board changes. As I mentioned in my Chair's statement, Hein Schumacher became CEO on 1 July 2023 and I became Chair on 1 December 2023. We are also delighted that Fernando Fernandez became CFO on 1 January 2024. I am grateful for all the support that I have received and continue to receive from the other Board members in my new role and the Board gives its full support to Hein and Fernando.\n\nAlongside succession, the Board has conducted a review of strategy and approved the Growth Action Plan for the business as already set out in this report. The Growth Action Plan is designed to take Unilever on the next stage of its growth journey. Alongside this our sustainability goals have been clarified which are key to good stewardship and these are set out in our updated Climate Transition Action Plan which we are putting to shareholders at the 2024 AGM.\n\n## We have a continued commitment to strong corporate governance\n\nThe culture of strong governance within Unilever is a strength that I will strive to maintain. Looking externally we have consulted with shareholders this year on executive remuneration, including the revised Remuneration Policy, and the revised Climate Transition Action Plan and this has informed the changes that are being put to shareholders at the 2024 AGM. In addition, our Code of Business Principles establishes the foundation of our culture within the company, strengthened by our historical roots, and informs our way of working in everything that we do. We are committed to diversity and inclusion as not only reflecting our values but also what is best for the business.\n\nMy responsibility as Chair is to provide the leadership to ensure that the Board works effectively with the executive team to focus on the forward looking strategy of the Company and achieving high standards of corporate governance. I believe that the Board changes we have made together with the Growth Action Plan for performance provide a strong basis for success. Our refocused work on sustainability is designed to support both our corporate governance and our Growth Action Plan.\n\nIan Meakins Chair",

Unilever's shares are traded through its premium listing on the London Stock Exchange and its listing on the Amsterdam Exchange Index on Euronext. Unilever's shares are also traded on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American Depositary Shares.\n\n## Unilever's governance framework\n\nTo facilitate its oversight role, and to ensure that it retains decision-making power over material matters, the Board has put in place a governance framework to support the creation\n\nof long-term value for stakeholders. The Board discharges some of its responsibilities directly and others through four principal Committees ( Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and the Corporate Responsibility Committee) which it has established to provide dedicated focus on particular areas. The Reports of each of these Committees can be found on pages 102, 107, 112 and 116. The Report of the Audit Committee includes a description of the risk management and internal control arrangements for the Group. In addition, there are two management committees of the Board, the Disclosure Committee and the Global Code and Policy Committee. The Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE) supports the CEO in his work and members of the ULE attend Board meetings on relevant items by invitation.\n\n## Board\n\nThe Board's primary role is to ensure the long-term sustainable success of Unilever for the mutual benefit of all our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, the schedule of matters reserved for the Board, a comprehensive summary of how the Board operates and the terms of reference for the four principal Committees and the Disclosure Committee are available in the Governance of Unilever on the Company's website (www.unilever.com/board-and-managementcommittees).\n\nThe Chair leads the Board and is responsible for its overall effectiveness in directing the Unilever Group. The Chair sets the Board's agenda, ensures the Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information, promotes and facilitates constructive relationships and effective contribution of all the Executive and Non-Executive Directors, and promotes a culture of openness and debate. The Non-Executive Directors provide constructive challenge, strategic guidance, specialist advice and hold management to account. The Group Secretary supports the Board to ensure that it has the policies, processes, information, time and resources it needs to function effectively and efficiently.\n\n## Board and Committee meetings\n\nThere were six scheduled Board meetings in 2023. Two scheduled Board meetings were held outside the UK in the Netherlands and the US. Whilst the Board was in the US trade visits were organised alongside the local management team. The remainder of the meetings were held in the UK or virtually.\n\nWhen there is a Board meeting, the Non-Executive Directors usually also meet without the Executive Directors present. The Chair, or in his absence the Senior Independent Director (SID), chairs such meetings.\n\nAttendance during the year at each of the Committee meetings is also set out below. Further information is provided in the relevant Committee reports.\n\n## Site visits\n\nIn addition to the formal Board meetings, several Non-Executive Directors visited Unilever sites in the UK, Brazil and Argentina in order to better understand the businesses in these countries. These site visits allow the Non-Executive Directors to observe the Group's operations in action, they reinforce their knowledge and enable them to experience first-hand the culture of the Group.\n\nThe site visits involve intensive itineraries. The NonExecutive Directors receive presentations on a variety of topics, including financial performance, strategy, research and development, manufacturing, distribution and marketing. The Non-Executive Directors meet with local management teams, they visit markets and stores where Unilever products are sold, and meet, where possible, with external stakeholders. Local workforce engagement sessions are also organised wherever possible. Such sessions took place in the Netherlands and the UK in 2023 and others were held virtually.\n\n## Board and Committee attendance\n\n| Position                | Board   | NCGC   | AC   | CRC   | CC   |\n|-------------------------|---------|--------|------|-------|------|\n| Chair                   |         |        |      |       |      |\n| Ian Meakins 1           | 2/2     | -      | -    | -     | -    |\n| Non-Executive Directors |         |        |      |       |      |\n| Nils Andersen 2         | 6/6     | 6/6    | -    | -     | 6/6  |\n| Judith Hartmann         | 6/6     | 3/3    | 5/5  | -     | 2/2  |\n| Adrian Hennah           | 6/6     | -      | 8/8  | -     | -    |\n| Andrea Jung             | 5/6     | 5/6    | -    | -     | 6/6  |\n| Susan Kilsby            | 6/6     | -      | 8/8  | -     | -    |\n| Ruby Lu                 | 6/6     | 3/3    | 3/3  | -     | 4/4  |\n| Strive Masiyiwa         | 6/6     | -      | -    | 5/5   | -    |\n| Youngme Moon            | 6/6     | -      | -    | 5/5   | -    |\n| Nelson Peltz            | 6/6     | -      | -    | -     | 6/6  |\n| Executive Directors     |         |        |      |       |      |\n| Hein Schumacher 3       | 6/6     | -      | 5/5  | -     | -    |\n| Graeme Pitkethly        | 6/6     | -      | 8/8  | -     | -    |\n| Former Directors        |         |        |      |       |      |\n| Alan Jope 4             | 3/3     | -      | -    | -     | -    |\n| Feike Sijbesma 5        | 5/5     | 5/5    | -    | 4/4   | -    |\n\n- 1.

The Directors confirm that the deliberations of the Board incorporated appropriate consideration of the matters detailed in Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. The Board recognises that having regard to the needs and expectations of stakeholders is crucial, as it ensures that Unilever is well positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth for the benefit of all its stakeholders.\n\n## Strategy and business plan\n\n## Background\n\nA Strategic Review of Unilever's business was carried out by the Board led by the CEO and announced to the markets on 26th October 2023. The Strategic Review concluded that the business would implement an action plan for faster growth, greater productivity and simplicity with a stronger performance culture. The Board also reviewed M&A activity and confirmed that the approach of bolt-on acquisitions and strategic disposals of lesser performing businesses would continue.\n\n## Stakeholder considerations\n\nThe Strategic Review took into account the interests of shareholders in its aims to create value for shareholders. It also took in to account customers, consumers and employees in unlocking the potential for the business and in the continued development of a business model for long-term sustainable growth.\n\nFaster growth will involve greater focus on Unilever's top 30 Power Brands to drive brand superiority and increase brand investment and returns. The move to greater productivity and simplicity will assist in the delivery of gross margin and a more focused sustainability agenda. A stronger performance culture will involve clearer priorities and accountability and alongside this more differentiated reward.\n\nTogether these measures are intended to deliver greater returns for shareholders both in the short to medium term and also assist in building long-term sustainable brand positions through the investment in our brands.\n\n## Society and sustainability\n\n## Background\n\nUnilever has a long standing commitment to being at the forefront of global leadership in sustainable business and this is at the heart of what Unilever stands for. The Strategic Review by the Board looked at Unilever's societal and climate approach as an integral part of our way of doing business. Our Climate Transition Action Plan, first publicised and approved by shareholders in 2021, has been updated and is being put again to shareholders at the 2024 AGM. The Strategic Review and the revised Climate Transition Action Plan have been reviewed by and have the full support of the Board and the Unilever Leadership Executive.\n\n## Stakeholder considerations\n\nClimate change and environmental sustainability impact the lives and livelihoods of people all around the world and, as such, impact on all of the stakeholders of the Company from suppliers to customers and consumers. As stakeholders our employees wish to work in a company which values the environment and our shareholders benefit from best business practice in the area of sustainability. As a result of the Strategic Review, the Company will focus its sustainability efforts on areas of critical importance with the aim of achieving greater impact in a shorter time, the pillars of this focus being Climate, Nature, Plastics and Livelihoods. All of our brands will participate in this with each brand focusing its efforts on what is most meaningful for its brand purpose. Our approach to society and sustainability will therefore continue to assist, for example, our suppliers in the development of sustainable agriculture and our customers and consumers will continue to benefit from products that aim for the highest standards in sustainability. Ultimately we believe this will be good for our business with shareholders benefiting as a result.",

The Board also approved the appointment of Fernando Fernandez as an Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer of the Company with effect from 1 January 2024.\n\n## Stakeholder considerations\n\nThe Board considered Ian Meakins' significant global business experience leading companies as Chair and CEO across a diverse range of industries. The Board concluded that Unilever would benefit from this experience and that Ian would bring strong and effective leadership. The Board looked at Fernando Fernandez's impressive track record in his Unilever career with his deep financial and business experience. The strategic acumen and leadership qualities that Fernando would bring to the role of CFO would be key in delivering the action plan that the Board had approved. Overall the Board concluded that both of these appointments would be beneficial to Unilever, its shareholders and wider stakeholders.\n\n## Executive Pay\n\n## Background\n\nAt the 2023 AGM, the resolution to approve the advisory vote on the Directors' Remuneration Report received 42% of the vote and was not passed. In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018, the Company included in its AGM results announcement a commitment to listen to shareholder feedback and to publish a further statement detailing the outcome of such shareholder engagement and any actions taken as a result. The Company proceeded to conduct a wide ranging consultation with shareholders to understand the reasons behind this vote and the views of shareholders on executive remuneration. In addition further consultation with shareholders took place in relation to the proposed Directors' Remuneration Policy.\n\n## Stakeholder considerations\n\nFollowing the shareholder consultation it was decided that the fixed pay of the CEO would not be increased in 2024 and 2025 and this was announced on 30 October 2023. This is also included in the Directors' Remuneration Policy to be put to shareholders at the 2024 AGM. The additional consultation with shareholders was also used in preparing the Directors' Remuneration Policy.",

Non-Executive Directors offer strategic guidance and specialist advice based on the breadth of experience and knowledge they bring to the Board.\n\nOn appointment, our Non-Executive Directors complete an induction process including meetings with the Unilever Leadership Executive and senior members of management. These include understanding key risk areas in the business and providing an understanding of the culture of the organisation. There is also the opportunity to visit Unilever's operations in person. Non-Executive Directors are required to have sufficient time available to discharge their responsibilities effectively and to continuously develop their knowledge of the business. The role of the Non-Executive Directors incorporates the review of information in advance of Board meetings to ensure that thorough preparation for, and debate at, Board meetings is possible. Non-Executive Directors have full access to senior management and take opportunities to meet them on a regular basis. Site visits also give Non-Executive Directors the ability to meet members of the workforce from different levels of the organisation.\n\nAll Directors are expected to attend each Board meeting and each Committee meeting of which they are members, unless there are exceptional reasons preventing them from participating. Only members of the Committees are entitled to attend Committee meetings, but others may attend at the Committee Chair's discretion. Executive Directors attend Committee meetings by invitation only.\n\nIf Directors are unable to attend a Board or Committee meeting, they have the opportunity beforehand to discuss any agenda items with the Chair or the Committee Chair.\n\n## Board appointment\n\nThe report of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee on pages 102 to 106 describes the work of the Committee including in relation to Board appointments and recommendations for re-election. The procedure for the nomination and appointment of Directors is also contained within the document entitled 'Appointment procedure for PLC Directors' which is available on our website. Directors may be appointed by a simple majority vote of shareholders at a general meeting, or on an interim basis by the Board (in which case they will offer themselves for election at the next AGM).\n\n## Composition, balance and independence of the Board\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Unilever Board comprised 12 Directors: the Chair, two Executive Directors and nine independent Non-Executive Directors.\n\nThe balance of Directors on the Board ensures that no individual or small group of Directors can dominate the decision-making process. The biographies on pages 84 to 85 and the table on page 105 in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Report demonstrate a diverse Board with a broad range of sector experience, skills and knowledge.\n\nThe Board carries out an annual review of the performance of the Directors in addition to a thorough review of the NonExecutive Directors' and their related or connected persons' relevant relationships in line with the best practice guidelines in the UK and US. The criteria chosen by the Board to assess the independence of the Non-Executive Directors, which is set out in detail in the Governance of Unilever, includes in summary:\n\n- \u25a0 no additional remuneration or other benefits from any Group company;\n- \u25a0 no material business relationships within the last three years, including shareholder, customer, adviser and supplier relationships, with any Group company;\n- \u25a0 no cross-directorships or significant links with other Directors through involvement in other companies or bodies;\n- \u25a0 not more than nine years of service on the Board in normal circumstances;\n- \u25a0 not a former employee of any Group company within the last five years;\n- \u25a0 no close family ties with any of Unilever's advisers, Directors or senior management; and\n- \u25a0 no significant shareholdings in Unilever or any Group company.\n\nAll the Non-Executive Directors are considered to have the appropriate skills, knowledge, experience and character to bring objective and constructive judgement and valuable insights to the Board's deliberations. The Board has concluded that all the Non-Executive Directors were independent during the period covered by this report.\n\nThe Chair was considered to be independent on appointment and is committed to ensuring that the Board continues to comprise a majority of independent Non-Executive Directors.\n\nAdrian Hennah, Chair of Audit Committee (centre) Ruby Lu, member of the Audit Committee (left)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nDirectors have a statutory duty to avoid actual or potential conflicts of interest. The Board ensures that there are effective procedures in place to avoid conflicts of interest by Directors. A Director must without delay report any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest to the Chair and to the other Directors and the Group Secretary, or, in case any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest of the Chair, to the SID, the other Directors and the Group Secretary. The Director in question must provide all relevant information to the Board, so that the Board can decide whether a reported (potential) conflict of interest of a Director qualifies as a conflict of interest within the meaning of the relevant laws.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance overview\n\nUnless authorised by the Board, together with compliance with any restrictions that have been required of such a Director, a Director may not take part in the decision-taking process of the Board in respect of any situation in which he or she has a conflict of interest. The Board consider the procedures that have been put in place to deal with conflicts of interest operate effectively.\n\nThe interests of new Directors are reviewed during the recruitment process and authorised (if appropriate) by the Board at the time of their appointment. Directors have a continuing duty to update the Board on any changes to their external appointments which are also reviewed by the Board on a regular basis.\n\nUnilever recognises that the Executive Directors acting as directors of other companies is beneficial from a personal development perspective and therefore also beneficial to the Group. The number of external directorships of listed companies is generally limited to one per Executive Director to reduce the risk of excessive commitment and prior approval is required from the Chair.\n\nHein Schumacher, CEO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nEach year, the Board formally assesses its own performance, including with respect to its composition, diversity and how effectively its members work together to achieve objectives. In 2023 a self-evaluation of the Board's effectiveness was conducted.\n\nThe evaluation consisted of a questionnaire completed by each of the Directors followed by a Board discussion in November 2023, covering both the outcome of the evaluation and the proposed actions to enhance the effectiveness of the Board. The outcome of such discussions is taken into account in the assessment of Directors when proposals for the reelection of Directors is considered.\n\nThe evaluation looked at key areas of the functioning and operation of the Board. The directors considered the level of information provided to the Board and the timing and frequency of meetings. In particular the financial controls and risk assessments carried out by the Board and its Committees were reviewed. As succession planning had been a key part of the Board's business in 2023, with the appointment of a new Chair, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Board succession procedures were also reviewed. The overall composition of the Board was also considered together with the relevant expertise of Board members in relation to the strategic and other material issues facing the Company.\n\nIt was concluded that the Board operated effectively and that the Board processes on the provision of information worked well. The Board's knowledge and assessment of financial controls and key risks was strong and the processes for succession planning and the execution of those plans had been effective in 2023. With the ongoing development of the business from a strategic and simplicity perspective and the continued external challenges from digital commerce and geopolitical events in key markets, there was the opportunity to develop Board composition further. An initial step on this was the enhancement of the skills and experience matrix for directors which is included in the report of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee on page 105. The Board would also like to focus more on the key performance indicators used in the business to support the new performance culture that has been introduced.\n\nThe evaluation of the Board's principal Committees was performed under the supervision of the respective Chairs and the Chief Legal Officer & Group Secretary, taking into account the views of respective Committee members and the Board members. The key actions arising from these Committee evaluations can be found in each of the Committee Reports.\n\n## Board induction and training\n\nAll new Directors participate in a comprehensive induction programme when they join the Board. The induction programme typically includes site visits, meetings with the Group's businesses, with other Board Directors, senior executives and managers, advisers and the Group's internal and external auditors. This is supplemented with a wide range of information including historical Board and Committee papers, internal and external reports and presentations covering the key commercial, operational, financial and functional areas of the Group and relevant policies and governance procedures.\n\nThe Chair ensures that ongoing training is provided for Directors by way of presentations and circulated updates at and between Board and Committee meetings. The training covers, among other things, Unilever's business, environmental, social, corporate governance, regulatory developments and investor relations matters. For example, in 2023 the Directors received presentations on corporate governance reforms and Unilever's Code of Business Principles. In addition, outside of the scheduled Board meetings, several Directors visited Unilever businesses and met with local management in the UK, Brazil and Argentina.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nThe Board believes that taking into account feedback from the workforce widens the diversity of its views when making business decisions. In view of Unilever's global footprint and scope of operations, the Board decided that the most effective way of organising its engagement with employees is to share the responsibility among all Non-Executive Directors.\n\nUnilever's Workforce Engagement Policy provides for workforce engagement in a variety of ways both face-to-face and virtually through sessions with Non-Executive Directors, engaging with employee representatives, site visits, and employee surveys such as UniVoice (see below for further information). These engagement activities cover the entire workforce demographic in terms of geography, all Business Groups, length of service, work level/seniority and supply chain and office staff.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance overview\n\nIn 2023, Non-Executive Directors participated in eight workforce engagement events, both virtually and in person, in the UK as well as in the Netherlands. A wide range of topics were discussed including those that are personal to the workforce and those of a more business and strategic nature. Topics included: future fit skills; safety; equality, diversity and inclusion; sustainability; and research and development.\n\nPerspectives from the workforce have been taken into consideration in decision making. For example, employee survey results from 2023 indicated some ambiguity in experience of our operational model. Management intends to further clarify decision rights and cost ownership to address some of these concerns and speed up decision-making. Further action has been taken in response to feedback collected in workforce engagement sessions. For example in Nutrition, cross-functional working groups have been established to co-create the 2024 innovation strategy in response to feedback from the workforce to speed up ways of working and increase collaboration between teams.\n\nThe Board evaluates the effectiveness of workforce engagement on an annual basis and feedback is also sought from employees who take part in the workforce engagement sessions, thereby creating a feedback loop between the Board and employees.\n\n## Shareholder engagement\n\nThe Board values open and meaningful discussions with our shareholders on all matters.\n\nThe CFO has lead responsibility for shareholder engagement, with the active involvement of the CEO and supported by the Investor Relations department.\n\nIn 2023 the new Chair had introductory meetings with key shareholders comprising over 25% of the issued share capital of the Company. Following the announcement of the Company's Growth Action Plan in October 2023, the CEO held a series of roadshows with investors in the Netherlands, the UK and the US. In addition the SID had meetings with a wide number of investors in relation to the remuneration of the executive directors and the CFO held a roadshow with investors following the first half-year results.\n\nThe Board receives regular briefings on investor reactions to Unilever's quarterly, half- and full-year results announcements, on key issues such as the Climate Transition Action Plan and on any issues raised by shareholders that are relevant to their responsibilities. We maintain a frequent dialogue with our principal institutional shareholders and regularly collect feedback.\n\nPrivate shareholders are encouraged to give feedback via shareholder.services@unilever.com. Our shareholders are also welcome to raise any issues directly with the Chair or the SID. The Chair, the SID, the Executive Directors and other Directors are also available to answer questions from the shareholders at the AGM each year.\n\n## General meetings\n\nAt the AGM, the Chair and CEO give their thoughts on governance aspects of the preceding year, the Group's strategy together with a review of the performance of the Group over the last year. Shareholders are encouraged to attend the meeting and to ask questions at or in advance of the meeting. The external auditors attend the AGM and are entitled to address the meeting on any part of the business of the meeting which concerns them as auditors.\n\nUnilever's AGM in 2023 was a physical meeting and the proceedings were also streamed via a live webcast for shareholders. The Chair, CEO, CFO, SID, Committee Chairs, Susan Kilsby and Hein Schumacher were present and following the statements from the Chair and CEO, questions submitted by shareholders prior to the meeting and received during the meeting were addressed.\n\nAll 23 resolutions were put to a poll at the 2023 AGM to ensure an exact and definitive result and to facilitate maximum participation by Unilever's geographically spread shareholders. Of these 22 resolutions were passed with in excess of 80% votes cast in favour. Resolution 2 was not passed as noted on page 94. The Company consulted with shareholders on this and issued a statement on this on 30 October 2023. This confirmed that CEO fixed pay would not be increased in 2024 or 2025. In addition the Remuneration Policy will be put to shareholders at the AGM in 2024.\n\nThe 2024 AGM will be held on 1 May 2024 at Hilton, London Bankside, 2-8 Great Suffolk Street, London, SE1 0UG. The Notice of AGM and other documentation are enclosed with this Annual Report and Accounts and are available on the Company's website at www.unilever.com for those shareholders who have opted for electronic communication.\n\nStrive Masiyiwa, Chair of the Corporate Responsibility Committee and Professor Youngme Moon, member of the Corporate Responsibility Committee\n\n<!-- image -->",

Details of the employee share  schemes can be found on pages 116, 117, 130 to 132 and 135 to 144. |\n| Details of where a shareholder has agreed to waive future dividends                               | See below                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Statements relating to controlling shareholders and ensuring company                              | Not applicable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n\n## Results and dividends\n\nUnilever PLC publishes financial information on a quarterly basis and these reports can be found at www.unilever.com.

The Articles can be found on the Company's website at www.unilever.com.\n\n## Disclosure of information to the external auditor\n\nEach of the Directors who held office at the date of approval of this report confirm that, to the best of each of the Directors' knowledge and belief, and having made appropriate enquiries, all information relevant to enabling the auditors to provide their opinions on the Company's consolidated and parent company accounts has been provided, and each of the Directors has taken all reasonable steps to ensure their awareness of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditors are aware of any such information. This confirmation is given\n\nand should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Directors\n\nThe Company's Directors who served during the financial year ending 31 December 2023 are provided on pages 84 and 85.

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance overview\n\n## Directors' share interests\n\nDetails of the Directors' interests in shares can be found in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 132, 138 to 143 and 148.\n\n## Contracts of significance\n\nDuring the year, no Director had any interest in any shares or debentures in the Company's subsidiaries, or any material interest in any contract with the Company or a subsidiary being a contract of significance in relation to the Company's business. No member of the Group is party to any significant agreement that takes effect, alters or terminates upon a change of control or following a takeover of Unilever PLC. In addition, there are no agreements providing for compensation for loss of office or employment as the result of a takeover of Unilever PLC. There are no controlling shareholders of Unilever PLC.\n\n## Powers of the Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the management of the business of the Company and may exercise all powers of the Company subject to applicable legislation and regulation and the Company's Articles.\n\nThe Board has delegated certain of its powers, authorities and discretions to the CEO, CFO and to the Board Committees. Detailed information on the responsibilities and authorities of each of these is available in the Governance of Unilever on the Company's website. In addition, information on the Board's and the Committee's responsibilities and activities in the year to 31 December 2023 are available on pages 90, 103, 108 and 113.\n\n## Directors' indemnities and Directors' and Officers' insurance\n\nThe power to indemnify Directors, together with former Directors, the Company Secretary and the directors of subsidiary companies, is provided for in the Company's Articles of Association.\n\nUnilever maintains appropriate D&O insurance to the extent permitted by law. In addition, Unilever has granted indemnities to each Director and the Group Secretary, together with former Directors and Company Secretaries of Unilever and the directors of subsidiary companies, whereby the Company indemnifies these individuals in respect of any proceedings brought by third parties against them personally in their capacity as Directors or Officers of the Company or any Group company. These ''qualifying third party indemnity provisions'' were in force during the course of the financial year ended 31 December 2023 and remained in force at the date of this report. The Company would also fund ongoing costs in defending a legal action as they are incurred rather than after judgement has been given. In the event of an unsuccessful defence in an action against them, individual Directors would be liable to repay the Company for any damages and to repay defence costs to the extent funded by the Company. Neither the indemnity, nor the D&O insurance cover provides cover in the event a Director or Officer is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.\n\nIn addition, the Company provides indemnities (including, where applicable, a qualifying pension scheme indemnity provision) to the Directors of three subsidiaries, each of which acts or acted as trustee of a Unilever UK pension fund. Appropriate trustee liability insurance is also in place. As above, these indemnities were in force during the course of the financial year ended 31 December 2023 and remained in place at the date of this report.\n\n## Political donations\n\nAt the 2023 AGM, shareholders passed a resolution to authorise the Company and its subsidiaries to make political donations to political parties or independent election candidates, to other political organisations, or to incur political expenditure (in each case as defined in the Companies Act 2006). As the authority granted at the 2023 AGM will expire, renewal of this authority will be sought at this year's AGM. Further details are available in the Notice of AGM, available on the Company's website.\n\nIt is the policy of the Company not to make such political donations or to incur political expenditure (within the ordinary meaning of those words) and the Directors have no intention of changing that policy. However, as the definitions used in the Companies Act 2006 are broad, it is possible that normal business activities, which might not be thought to be political donations or expenditure in the usual sense, could be caught. On that basis, the authority is sought purely as a precaution.\n\nThe Board members have each confirmed compliance with Unilever's Code of Business Principles, as is required on an annual basis, and that there has been no political activity or payments by the Unilever Group.\n\n## Shares\n\n## Share capital\n\nUnilever's issued share capital on 31 December 2023 was made up of \u00a378,294,139 split into 2,516,597,338 ordinary shares of 3 1 / 9 p each and each carrying one vote. A total of 16,181,572 Unilever ordinary shares were held in treasury as at 31 December 2023 representing 0.64% of Unilever's issued share capital. A total of 49,770,289 ordinary Unilever PLC shares held in Treasury from share buy-backs were cancelled on 2 August 2023.\n\n## Share issues and purchase of shares\n\nAt the 2023 AGM held on 3 May 2023, Unilever's Directors were authorised to:\n\n- \u25a0 issue new shares, up to a maximum of \u00a326,226,666 nominal value (which at the time represented approximately 33% of Unilever's issued ordinary share capital);\n- \u25a0 disapply pre-emption rights up to a maximum of \u00a33,935,735 nominal value (which at the time represented approximately 5% of Unilever's issued ordinary share capital) for general corporate purposes and an additional 5% authority in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment; and\n- \u25a0 make market purchases of its ordinary shares, up to a maximum of 253,000,000 ordinary shares (which at the time represented just under 10% of PLC's issued ordinary share capital) and within the price limits prescribed in the resolution.\n\nIn 2022, Unilever commenced a \u20ac3bn share buyback programme over two years. The purpose of the share buyback programme was to reduce the capital of Unilever and in 2022 Unilever bought back 34,217,605 Unilever ordinary shares of 3 1 / 9 p each in two tranches, the total consideration for which was \u20ac1.5bn. Further in 2023, Unilever bought back 31,734,256 Unilever ordinary shares of 3 1 / 9 p each in two tranches, the total consideration for which was \u20ac1.5bn to complete such share buyback programme. The shares repurchased in 2023 comprised 1.26% of Unilever's issued share capital as at 31 December 2023. Outside of this share buyback programme, no other company within the Group purchased any Unilever ordinary shares or American Depositary Shares during 2023. During 2023 there were 100,000 Unilever ordinary shares of 3 1 / 9 p each issued in satisfaction of employee share scheme awards.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance overview\n\n## Right to hold and transfer ordinary shares\n\nUnilever's constitutional documents place no limitations on the right to hold or transfer Unilever ordinary shares. There are no limitations on the right to hold or exercise voting rights on the ordinary shares of Unilever imposed by English law. Unilever is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities which may result in restrictions on transfer or voting rights.\n\n## Right to receive dividends\n\nThe employee benefit trust, established by the Company to facilitate the settlement of various share plan awards, waives its entitlement to receive dividends in respect of shares that are the beneficial property of the trust.\n\n## Listings\n\nUnilever has ordinary shares listed on the London Stock Exchange (ULVR), on Euronext Amsterdam (UNA) and, as American Depositary Receipts 1 (UL), on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n- 1. One American Depositary Receipt represents one PLC ordinary share with a nominal value of 3 1 /9p.\n\n## Significant shareholders of Unilever\n\nAs far as Unilever is aware, the only holders of more than 3% of, or 3% of voting rights attributable to, Unilever's ordinary share capital ('Disclosable Interests') on 31 December 2023, were BlackRock, Inc. with a shareholding of 9.1% and Vanguard Holding with a shareholding of 4.9%.\n\nNo Disclosable Interests have been notified to Unilever between 1 January 2024 and 22 February 2024 (being a date not more than one month prior to the date of the Company's Notice of Annual General Meeting). As far as Unilever is aware, between 1 January 2021 and 22 February 2024, only BlackRock, Inc. and Vanguard Holding have held more than 3% of, or 3% of voting rights attributable to, Unilever's ordinary shares.\n\nSusan Kilsby, member of the Audit Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies, financial instruments and risk\n\nDetails of the Group's accounting policies, together with post balance sheet events and details of financial instruments and risk, are provided in Notes 1, 16, 18 and 26 to the Financial Statements.\n\n## Branch offices\n\nDetails of the Unilever Group's branches are listed on page 244.\n\n## Employment of disabled people\n\nDisability inclusion is deeply important to Unilever. It is critical that our brands live up to our values by understanding the lives, experiences and stereotypes facing persons with disabilities and reflecting their stories in our brand communications. In addition, Unilever has a range of employment policies which clearly detail the standards, processes, expectations and responsibilities of its people and the organisation. These policies are designed to ensure that everyone - including those with existing or new disabilities and people of all backgrounds - is dealt with in an inclusive and fair way from the recruiting process and ongoing through their career at Unilever. This includes access to appropriate training, development opportunities or job progression. Further details can be found on page 37.\n\n## Employee share plans\n\nThe Company operates a number of employee share plans, details of which are set out in note 4C and in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 116, 117, 130 to 132 and 135 to 144.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nThe Group's stakeholders are our shareholders, our workforce, consumers, customers, our suppliers and business partners, and the planet and society as a whole. The Board is aware that its actions and decisions impact our stakeholders. Effective engagement with stakeholders is important to the Board as it strengthens the business and helps to deliver a positive result for all our stakeholders. In order to comply with Section 172 of the Companies Act, the Board is required to take into consideration the interests of stakeholders and it must also include a statement setting out the way in which Directors have discharged this duty during the year. The Group's stakeholders are identified on pages 91 and 92 and information on how the Directors have had regard to the matters set out in Section 172 can be found on pages 93 and 94. Further information on workforce engagement can also be found on pages 96 and 97.\n\n## Related party transactions\n\nTransactions with related parties are conducted in accordance with agreed transfer pricing policies and include sales to joint ventures and associates. Other than those disclosed in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements (and incorporated herein as above), there were no related party transactions that were material to the Group or to the related parties concerned that are required to be reported in 2023 up to 22 February 2024 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report).\n\n## Corporate governance compliance\n\nWe conduct our operations in accordance with internationally accepted principles of good governance and best practice, while ensuring compliance with the corporate governance requirements applicable in the countries in which we operate. Unilever is subject to corporate governance requirements (legislation, codes and/or standards) in the UK and the US and in this section, we report on our compliance against these.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance overview\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nIn 2023, Unilever has applied the principles and complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. Further information on how Unilever has applied the five overarching categories of principles can be found on the following pages (i) Board Leadership: pages 82, 89, 93 to 95 and 97; (ii) Division of Responsibilities: pages 89 and 95; (iii) Composition, Succession and Evaluation: pages 95 to 97 and 103 to 104; (iv) Audit, Risk and Internal Controls: pages 107 to 111; and (v) Remuneration: pages 116 to 153. The UK Corporate Governance Code is available on the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) website.\n\n## Risk Management and Control:\n\nOur approach to risk management and systems of internal control is in line with the recommendations in the FRC's revised guidance 'Risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting' (the Risk Guidance). It is Unilever's practice to review acquired companies' governance procedures and to align them to the Group's governance procedures as soon as is practicable.\n\n## Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions:\n\nInformation on GHG emissions can be found on page 47.\n\n## Employee Involvement and Communication:\n\nUnilever's UK companies maintain formal processes to inform, consult and involve employees and their representatives.\n\nA National Consultative Forum comprising employees and management representatives from key locations meets regularly to discuss issues relating to Unilever sites in the UK. We recognise collective bargaining on a number of sites and engage with employees via the Sourcing Unit Forum, which includes national officer representation from the three recognised trade unions. A European Works Council, embracing employee and management representatives from countries within Europe, has been in existence for several years and provides a forum for discussing issues that extend across national boundaries. Further details on how the Board has engaged with the workforce can be found on pages 96 and 97.\n\n## Equal Opportunities and Diversity:\n\nConsistent with our Code of Business Principles, Unilever aims to ensure that applications for employment from everyone are given full and fair consideration and that everyone is given access to training, development and career opportunities.\n\nEvery effort is made to reskill and support employees who become disabled while working within the Group.\n\n## United States\n\nUnilever is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). As such, Unilever must comply with the requirements of US legislation, regulations enacted under US securities laws and the Listing Standards of the NYSE, that are applicable to foreign private issuers, copies of which are available on their websites.\n\nWe comply with the Listing Standards of the NYSE applicable to foreign private issuers.\n\nWe are required to disclose any significant ways in which our corporate governance practices differ from those required of US domestic companies listed on the NYSE. Our corporate governance practices are primarily based on the requirements of the UK Listing Rules and the UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nbut substantially conform to those required of US domestic companies listed on the NYSE. The only significant way in which our corporate governance practices differ from those required of US domestic companies under Section 303A Corporate Governance Standards of the NYSE is that the NYSE rules require that shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on all equity-compensation plans and material revisions thereto, with certain limited exemptions. The UK Listing Rules require shareholder approval of equity compensation plans only if new or treasury shares are issued for the purpose of satisfying obligations under the plan or if the plan is a longterm incentive plan in which a director may participate.\n\nAmendments to plans approved by shareholders generally only require approval if they are to the advantage of the plan participants.\n\nAttention is drawn to the Report of the Audit Committee on pages 107 to 111. In addition, further details about our corporate governance are provided in the document entitled 'The Governance of Unilever' which can be found on our website.\n\nAll senior executives and senior financial officers have declared their understanding of and compliance with Unilever's Code of Business Principles and the related Code Policies. No waiver from any provision of the Code of Business Principles or Code Policies was granted in 2023 to any of the persons falling within the scope of the SEC requirements.\n\nThe Code of Business Principles and related Code Policies are published on our website.\n\n## Risk Management and Control:\n\nFollowing a review by the Disclosure Committee, Audit Committee and Board, the CEO and the CFO concluded that the design and operation of the Group's disclosure controls and procedures, including those defined in the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 - Rule 13a - 15(e), as at 31 December 2023 were effective. Unilever is required by Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. This requirement is reported on within the section entitled 'Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting' on page 254.\n\nIan Meakins, Chair (third from the left)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Directors' Report has been approved by The Board, and signed on its behalf by Maria Varsellona, Chief Legal Officer and Group Secretary.",

The Committee itself was led by Nils Andersen until my appointment on 1 December 2023 and Nils will continue as a valued member of the Committee until he steps down from the Board at the AGM in 2024, as previously announced.\n\nIn 2023, the Committee had overseen the appointment of Hein Schumacher as CEO and this change became effective on 1 July 2023 with the retirement of Alan Jope at that time.\n\nIn May 2023, Graeme Pitkethly informed the Board of his intention to retire from Unilever. The Committee has therefore also overseen the appointment of a new CFO, Fernando Fernandez, whose appointment took effect on 1 January 2024. Fernando has an extensive track record in a variety of financial, marketing and general management roles in Unilever. His deep financial and business experience, strategic acumen and leadership qualities will be critical in helping to drive the step-up in Unilever's performance that we are all determined to deliver.\n\nGraeme Pitkethly remained as CFO until 31 December 2023, at which point he also stood down as a Director. Graeme is assisting with the transition of Fernando in to his new role until the end of May 2024.\n\nAt the end of October 2023, Feike Sijbesma stepped down as a Non-Executive Director having served nine years on the Board. On behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank Feike for his service to Unilever.\n\nFurther details of these Board changes are provided in this report on pages 103 and 104.\n\n## The Committee was engaged in Board succession and talent development in the Unilever Leadership Executive\n\nA number of changes to the Unilever Leadership Executive were also announced on 26 October 2023 and were effective on 1 January 2024. The Committee was involved in the consideration of the candidates for the Unilever Leadership positions.\n\nA diverse and inclusive workplace is a priority for the Board and Committee, and it underpins the appointment and recruitment processes at all levels in Unilever. Diversity and inclusion metrics for the Board and ULE are included in the report and, as at 31 December 2023, the Board was 42% female with one third ethnic minority representation.\n\nIn 2024 the Committee will continue to embed the new leadership and also continue to review Board succession in respect of independent Non-Executive Directors. The Committee will also monitor ongoing succession planning for the Unilever Leadership Executive.\n\nI would like to thank the members of the Committee through the year for their commitment and contribution.\n\n## Ian Meakins\n\nChair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee",

Nils Andersen, Judith Hartmann and Andrea Jung are independent Non-Executive Dircetors and members of the Committee. The Chief Legal Officer and Group Secretary is secretary to the Committee. Other attendees, including the CEO, the Chief People and Transformation Officer and Deputy Secretary, attend the meetings when invited to do so.\n\nThere were six meetings of the Committee in 2023 and the table above shows attendance at meetings of the Committee in the year. Given changes in the Committee membership this year, attendance is expressed as the number of meetings attended out of the number able to be attended during each director's respective tenure on the Committee during the year.\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is primarily responsible for:\n\n- \u25a0 periodically assessing the structure, size and composition of the Board;\n- \u25a0 evaluating the balance of skills, experience, independence, diversity and knowledge on the Board;\n- \u25a0 ongoing succession planning (including the development of a diverse pipeline for succession);\n- \u25a0 drawing up selection criteria and appointment procedures for Directors;\n- \u25a0 reviewing the feedback in respect of the role and functioning of the Board Committees arising from Board and Board Committee evaluations;\n- \u25a0 periodically reviewing and assessing Unilever's practices and procedures in relation to workforce engagement; and\n- \u25a0 considering current and developing corporate governance matters, which it brings to the attention of the Board where deemed necessary.\n\nThe Committee's terms of reference are set out in the Governance of Unilever, which can be found on the Company's website.\n\n## Activities of the Committee\n\nDuring the year, the Committee's key areas of focus included:\n\n- \u25a0 following a review of the performance of the Directors and, where relevant their independence, the Committee recommended the election and re-election of all Directors at the AGM in May 2023;\n- \u25a0 review of the composition of the Board and its Committees taking into account the experience, skills, knowledge, diversity and attributes of the Directors and the length of tenure of the Non-Executive Directors resulting in changes to the Committee memberships;\n- \u25a0 appointed Spencer Stuart to support the Committee in the search for a new Chair of the Board, culminating in the appointment of Ian Meakins;\n- \u25a0 appointed Russell Reynolds to support the Committee in the search for a new Chief Financial Officer, culminating in the appointment of Fernando Fernandez;\n- \u25a0 assessed best practice guidelines and preferences of certain institutional investors in relation to overboarding;\n- \u25a0 reviewed the ULE succession plan and talent pipeline;\n- \u25a0 conducted an annual review of the diversity policy applicable to the Board and more widely, the workforce engagement activities in the year and the plan for the following year, the terms of reference for the Committee and the annual workplan for the Committee;\n- \u25a0 considered the process and timetable for the Board evaluation and maintained oversight of the process (see page 96 for further information on the Board evaluation);\n- \u25a0 received updates on current and emerging corporate governance legislation, regulation and best practice guidelines including in relation to directors' duties; and\n- \u25a0 considered the Committee's draft report for inclusion in the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts.\n\n## Appointment and reappointment of Directors to the Board\n\nAll Directors (unless they are retiring) are nominated by the Board for election or re-election at the AGM each year on the recommendation of the Committee. The Committee takes into consideration the outcomes of the Chair's discussions with each Director on individual performance and the evaluation of the Board and its Committees. Non-Executive Directors normally serve for a period of up to nine years.\n\nThe Committee proposed the election or re-election of all Directors at the 2023 AGM.\n\nNelson Peltz and Hein Schumacher had been appointed by the Board as independent Non-Executive Directors on 20 July 2022 and 4 October 2022 respectively and were therefore put forward for election by shareholders for the first time at the 2023 AGM.\n\nAll the Directors were appointed by shareholders by a simple majority vote at the 2023 AGM.\n\nSubsequent to the 2023 AGM, Alan Jope stood down as a director and CEO on 1 July 2023. Hein Schumacher became an Executive Director on 1 June 2023 and took up the role of CEO on 1 July 2023 following a one month handover period.\n\nThe Committee also reviews the composition of the Board Committees. During the year, the Committee recommended in May that Ruby Lu be appointed a member of the Audit Committee and that Judith Hartmann be appointed a member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Compensation Committee. The Committee further recommended in October that Ian Meakins be appointed as Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, as a member of the Compensation Committee and the Chair of the Company effective from 1 December 2023.\n\nOn 31 October 2023, Feike Sijbesma stepped down as a Non-Executive Director of the Company, having served nine years on the Board.\n\nDuring the year, Graeme Pitkethly confirmed that he intended to step down from the Board as a Director and CFO by the end of 2023. The Committee appointed Russell Reynolds to assist it to identify suitable candidates for the position of CFO. Russell Reynolds is an independent executive search firm which has undertaken several executive, non-executive and management searches for the Group. Russell Reynolds do not have any connection to or provide any other services to the Directors or the Group except for normal course recruitment processes.",

        "page_content": "## Report of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\n\nIn January 2023, Unilever announced the appointment of Fernando Fernandez as a director and CFO with effect from 1 January 2024. Graeme Pitkethly stepped down from the Board on 31 December 2023.\n\nThe process to search for and appoint a new CFO was managed by the Committee, as summarised below:\n\n- \u25a0 the Committee agreed the appointment of a search firm which would be best placed to deliver a comprehensive candidate list;\n- \u25a0 a detailed candidate specification was agreed, setting out key responsibilities, experience and personal attributes together with a clearly defined search strategy;\n- \u25a0 a candidate longlist was mapped against the candidate specification taking into account Unilever's Board Diversity Policy; and\n- \u25a0 candidates with the strongest fit were reviewed by the Committee and met with the Chair and SID and preferred candidates were nominated to meet with members of the Board.\n\n## Overboarding\n\nAs part of the annual evaluation process for each Director, full consideration was given to the number of external positions held to ensure that the time commitment required did not compromise the Director's commitment to Unilever. The Committee took into account the views of various investor bodies and certain institutional investors to anticipate any perception of overboarding.\n\nThe Committee did not identify any instances of overboarding and concluded that all individual Directors had sufficient time to commit to their appointment as a Director of Unilever.\n\nThe full list of external appointments held by our Directors can be found in their biographies on pages 84 and 85.\n\n## Board Diversity Policy\n\nUnilever has long understood and actively promoted the importance of diversity and inclusion within our workforce. This commitment forms part of Unilever's Code of Business Principles and is embedded in the way we do business and conduct ourselves at all levels in the organisation.\n\nUnilever's Board Diversity policy, which is reviewed by the Committee each year, is available on the Company's website. The objective of the Board Diversity policy is to guide that the composition and quality of the Board should be in keeping with the size and geographical spread of Unilever, its portfolio, culture and status as a listed company. The Board Diversity policy is taken into account when making appointments to the Board by considering candidates on merit, on the basis of wide-ranging experience, backgrounds, skills, knowledge and insight with a continuing emphasis on diversity including, but not limited to, factors set out by applicable regulation, guidance and industry and government best practice.\n\nThe Board supports the recommendations of the FTSE Women Leaders Review on gender diversity and the Parker Review on ethnic diversity. Specifically:\n\n- \u25a0 As at 31 December 2023, we are proud to have a female Senior Independent Director and 42% female Board members (including Executive Directors). 11% of the Unilever Leadership Executive are female (excluding Executive Directors), due to two females stepping down from their roles prior to the end of 2023. However, as announced on 26 October 2023, two females have been appointed to the Unilever Leadership Executive from 1 January 2024. These appointments increase the female members of the Unilever\n\n- Leadership Executive to 30% (excluding Executive Directors). There is also a promising pipeline of talent, with 45% of Senior Management (direct reports to the Unilever Leadership Executive) being female as at 31 October 2023.\n- \u25a0 We have 33% ethnic minority Board membership (including Executive Directors), exceeding the Parker Review recommendation of one ethnic minority Board member. Our ethnic minority membership of the ULE stands at 67% (excluding Executive Directors). In accordance with the extended scope of the Parker Review for 2023, we carried out an anonymous survey of Senior Management (direct reports to the Unilever Leadership Executive) via an independent third-party company to determine ethnicity. 24% responded as minority ethnic, 24% as white and 52% undisclosed (including those based in countries where there are legal or cultural restrictions on collecting ethnicity data). Under the extended scope of the Parker Review, we set an ethnic minority target of 24% for the Board, Unilever Leadership Executive and Senior Management by 31 December 2027. This is based on our available baseline data, 2021 UK census statistics, the global nature of Unilever's business and benchmarking. We will keep this target under review and disclose progress against, and any revision of, the target in future annual reports. Our focus for 2024 is to increase the response rate for ethnicity data from Senior Management.\n\n## Succession planning\n\n## Board\n\nThe Committee reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of succession planning processes and the Board reviews the succession plan in conjunction with the Committee.\n\nThe succession plan is based on merit and objective criteria and is designed to promote diversity. The Board should comprise a majority of Non-Executive Directors who are independent of Unilever, free from any conflicts of interest and able to allocate sufficient time to carry out their responsibilities effectively. With respect to composition and capabilities, the Board should be in keeping with the size of Unilever, its strategy, portfolio, consumer base, culture, geographical spread and its status as a listed company and have sufficient understanding of the markets and business where Unilever is active in order to understand the key trends and developments relevant for Unilever. The Board believes that a diverse Board with a range of views enhances decisionmaking which is beneficial to the Company's long-term success and is in the interests of Unilever's stakeholders.\n\nThe Board seeks to promote its diversity by objectively considering candidates on the basis of their experience, skills, knowledge, expertise, gender, race, ethnicity, cultural and geographical background and age. As can be seen in the biographies on pages 84 and 85 and the tables on page 105, the Board meets this profile.\n\n## ULE\n\nIn conjunction with the Committee, the Board reviews the succession plan for the ULE. In line with the approach to the Board succession plan, the succession plan for the ULE is also based on merit and objective criteria and is designed to promote diversity. Developing an internal talent pipeline for leadership roles is critical for Unilever. The succession plan identifies potential successors who are considered able to fulfil the roles in the short term and those in the longer term. Development initiatives for senior executives are put in place and usually include executive mentoring and coaching. Senior managers and executives are encouraged to take on a non-executive directorship role as part of their personal development.",

The changes to the ULE effective on 1 January 2024 resulted in a 12 member ULE of which 3 (25%) are women.\n\nWe collect both gender and ethnicity data direct from Board and ULE members annually on a self-identifying basis in a questionnaire.

The Committee considered the questionnaires and the Board agreed with the Committee's proposal for the Board and Committee evaluation in 2023.\n\nThe Board and each of the Committees considered their respective feedback in November 2023.\n\nThe Committee concluded it was performing effectively. The evaluation confirmed that the Committee should continue to focus on the skills, experience and diversity of the Board in maintaining its overview of Board composition. In addition, continued clear communication on succession planning with the Board was essential. These areas would be considered in the Committee's workplan for 2024.\n\n## Ian Meakins\n\nChair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\n\nNils Andersen\n\nJudith Hartmann\n\nAndrea Jung",

Hein Schumacher was appointed as CEO of Unilever, Judith Hartmann moved to another committee, and we welcomed Ruby Lu. Her insights and experiences especially in evolving technology, are valuable additions to our Committee.\n\nThe Committee believes it has carried out its duties effectively throughout the year and to a high standard, providing independent oversight. It has had good support from management and the internal audit team.\n\nThe core of the work of the Committee has been to ensure the integrity of Unilever's financial and non-financial reporting, the adequacy of its internal control framework and to oversee how the company manages its principal and emerging risks. The committee also participated in the selection of Fernando Fernandez as Unilever's new Chief Financial Officer.\n\nIn the area of risk management, we continued to focus this year on cyber security, supply chain resilience, and data privacy. The Committee commissioned an independent assessment of our cyber security maturity to ensure adequacy of our capabilities and controls. The Committee engaged on the organisational changes the company is going through and their impact on reporting and the management of controls. We also met with management to discuss emerging developments in international taxation, pensions and sustainability reporting including pursuant to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the new European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRSs).\n\nIn addition to our reporting and control responsibilities, we focused this year on risks relating to cyber security, supply chain resilience and data privacy.\n\nWe dedicated time and resources to enhancing our understanding of the Group's continuously evolving regulatory and legal landscape, and how the Group is adapting to it. The Committee also reviewed all significant ethical and compliance matters.\n\nIn addition to the formal meetings, the Committee members have been engaging with the business through market visits and during the year visited USA, Brazil, Argentina and the Netherlands.\n\nIn 2024, our primary focus, beyond our core responsibilities, will remain on the evolving cyber security threat landscape and strengthening our supply chain resilience. We will also oversee the preparation for new compliance requirements, in particular enhanced sustainability reporting pursuant to CSRD and the ESRSs.\n\nAdrian Hennah\n\nChair of the Audit Committee",

The Audit Committee was chaired by Adrian Hennah. The other Committee members are Susan Kilsby, and Ruby Lu who was appointed in July 2023 replacing Judith Hartmann who transitioned to another committee. Hein Schumacher was appointed to become CEO of Unilever as of July 2023.\n\nThe Board is satisfied that the members of the Audit Committee are competent in financial matters and have recent and relevant experience. For the purposes of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Adrian Hennah is the Audit Committee's financial expert.\n\nOther attendees at Committee meetings included the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Auditor, Deputy CFO & Controller, Chief Legal Officer & Group Secretary, Deputy Group Secretary & Head of Corporate Legal, General Counsel Corporate Governance and Group Corporate Legal, Head of Secretariat, EVP Sustainable Business Performance and Reporting and the external auditors. Throughout the year, the Committee members met periodically without others present and also held separate private sessions with the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Auditor and the external auditors.\n\nThere were eight scheduled meetings of the Committee during the year. Attendance at the scheduled meetings is shown above. Given changes in the Committee membership this year, attendance is expressed as the number of meetings attended out of the number able to be attended during each director's respective tenure on the Committee during the year.\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set out in written terms of reference which are reviewed annually by the Committee, considering relevant legislation, and recommended good practices. The terms of reference are contained within the document entitled \"The Governance of Unilever\" which is available on our website.\n\nThe Committee's responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following matters:\n\n- \u25a0 oversight of the integrity of Unilever's financial statements;\n- \u25a0 review of Unilever's half-yearly and annual financial statements (including clarity and completeness of disclosure) and of the quarterly trading statements for quarter 1 and quarter 3;\n- \u25a0 oversight of risk management and internal control arrangements;\n- \u25a0 oversight of compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;\n- \u25a0 oversight of the external auditors' performance, objectivity, qualifications, and independence;\n- \u25a0 the approval process of non-audit services;\n- \u25a0 recommendation to the Board of the nomination of the external auditors for shareholder approval; and approval of their fees, refer to note 25 on page 225; and\n- \u25a0 performance of the internal audit function.\n\nAll relevant matters arising are brought to the attention of the Board.\n\n## Committee Reviews\n\nTo help the Committee meet its oversight responsibilities, focused knowledge sessions are organised for committee members throughout the year. In 2023, sessions were held to review the impact of cost inflation, a review of group litigation, sustainability reporting and M&A performance and plans.\n\nIn addition, Committee members visited the local businesses in the US, Argentina, Brazil, and the Netherlands providing them with an insight into local market challenges and local risk and control management. In Brazil special focus was given to existing tax liabilities, please refer to note 19 and 20 on page 219-220. In Argentina management's approach to the challenges arising from the hyperinflationary economic context was focused on, and in the Netherlands the Committee spent time to understand the capabilities of the new R&D center co-located within the local University campus in Wageningen.\n\nThe Committee also received presentations from management and held discussions on the business's risk management activities, the preparation of the financial statements, the overall control environment, and the operation of the financial reporting controls. Special focus has been given to critical IT systems and cyber security, data privacy, major transformation projects, management of manufacturing third parties as well as management of third-party service providers. In addition, the Committee has had engagements with management with regard to their assurance work on sustainability as well as the work done in the areas of tax, treasury and pension matters.\n\n## Reporting and Financial Statements\n\nThe Committee reviewed, prior to publication, the quarterly financial press releases together with the associated internal quarterly reports from the Chief Financial Officer and the Disclosure Committee and, with respect to the full-year results, the external auditor's report. It also reviewed the Annual Report and Accounts and the Form 20-F 2023. These reviews incorporated the accounting policies and significant judgements and estimates underpinning the financial statements as disclosed within note 1 on page 178.\n\nParticular attention was paid to the following significant matters in relation to the financial statements:\n\n- \u25a0 indirect tax provisions and contingent liabilities related to Brazil, refer to notes 19 and 20 on pages 219-220. The Committee agreed that the tax provisions and judgements around the likelihood as well as the disclosures are appropriate in the Annual Report and Accounts;\n- \u25a0 revenue recognition. The Committee reviewed the adequacy of the policy around the cut off and appropriateness of discounts accruals;\n- \u25a0 impairment risk in Russia. The committee reviewed the disclosure of the impairment risk related to Russia;\n- \u25a0 the presentation of non-underlying items. The Committee took account of management's responses to its review and of the reporting received from and observations made by the external Auditor.\n\nFor each of the above areas, the Committee considered the key facts and judgements outlined by management. Members of management attended the section of the meeting of the Committee where their item was discussed to answer any questions or challenges posed by the Committee. The Committee's feedback has been incorporated into the final approach. The matters were also discussed with the external auditors and further information can be found on pages 157 to 172.",

        "page_content": "## Report of the Audit Committee\n\nThe Committee specifically discussed with the external auditor how management's judgement and assertions were challenged and how professional scepticism was demonstrated during their audit of these areas; this included the disclosures for each matter noted above. The Committee is satisfied that there are relevant accounting policies in place in relation to these significant matters and management has correctly applied these policies.\n\nIn addition to the matters noted above our external auditors, as required by auditing standards, also consider the risk of management override of controls. Nothing has come to our attention or their attention to suggest any material misstatement with respect to suspected or actual fraud relating to management override of controls.\n\nAt the request of the Board, the Committee undertook to:\n\n- \u25a0 review the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual and half-yearly financial statements;\n- \u25a0 assess whether the business was viable in accordance with the requirement of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The assessment included a review of the principal and emerging risks facing Unilever, their potential impact, how they were being managed, together with a discussion as to the appropriate period for the assessment. The Committee recommended to the Board that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period (consistent with the period of the strategic plan) of the assessment; and\n- \u25a0 consider whether the Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2023 was fair, balanced, and understandable, and whether it provided the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Group's year-end position and performance, business model and strategy. To make this assessment, the Committee received copies of the Annual Report and financial statements to review during the drafting process to ensure that the key messages were aligned with the Company's position, performance, and strategy. The Committee also reviewed the processes and controls that are the basis for its preparation. The Committee was satisfied that, taken as a whole, the Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2023 is fair, balanced, and understandable.\n\n## Regulator Correspondence\n\nIn 2023, Unilever did not receive any formal notifications or communications from either the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the UK Financial Reporting Council (FRC).\n\n## Sustainability\n\nThe Committee continued to oversee the reporting of sustainability performance, keeping itself updated on the changing regulatory requirements in this area by having separate knowledge sessions with management and PwC during the year. This included updates on changes in sustainability reporting requirements and changes in sustainability assurance.\n\nHistorically, reporting on environmental and social matters has mostly been voluntary but this is rapidly changing and there is more and more mandatory reporting on these matters. The UK has required premium listed companies to disclose climate-related information based on the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework for the last couple of years. For the financial year beginning on 1 January 2024 we will also need to comply with the CSRD and disclose material sustainability information in accordance with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards. This is an extensive suite of disclosures on a range of environmental, social and governance matters which will be included in our 2024 Annual Report and Accounts. The Committee will be responsible together with the Corporate Responsibility Committee for overseeing compliance with these disclosure requirements. In future years there are also likely to be further mandatory non-financial reporting standards which will be applicable to the group as the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) has issued a number of sustainability reporting standards and is working on additional ones, and these are currently going through the endorsement process for use in the UK. During 2023, the Committee reviewed the limited assurance work performed by PwC on certain sustainability metrics and also reviewed the 2023 to 2026 sustainability assurance plan.\n\n## Risk Management & Internal Controls (Assurance)\n\nThe Committee reviewed Unilever's overall approach to risk management and control, and its processes, outcomes, and disclosure. The assessment was undertaken through a review of:\n\n- \u25a0 the yearly report detailing the risk identification and assessment process, together with any emerging risks identified by management;\n- \u25a0 reports from senior management on risk areas for which the Committee had oversight responsibility: treasury, tax and pensions, information security, data privacy, legal and regulatory compliance, supply chain and key suppliers and business transformation;\n- \u25a0 the proposed risk areas identified by the ULE;\n- \u25a0 the Quarterly Risk and Control Status Reports, including Code of Business Principles cases relating to frauds and financial crimes;\n- \u25a0 a summary of control deficiencies identified through controls testing activities together with action plans to address underlying causes;\n- \u25a0 management's improvements to reporting through further automation and centralisation; and\n- \u25a0 the annual financial plan and Unilever's dividend policy and dividend proposals.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the application of the requirements under Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 with respect to internal controls over financial reporting.\n\nIn fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in relation to risk management and internal control, the Committee met regularly with senior members of management and is satisfied with the key judgements taken.",

        "page_content": "## Report of the Audit Committee\n\nThe Committee has completed its review for 2023 on both risk management and internal control and was satisfied that the process had worked effectively and where specific areas for improvement were identified, there was adequate mitigation or alternative controls and that processes were under way to ensure sustainable improvements. An area of focus has been to ensure that the controls impacted by the transformation programmes are appropriately designed and are being implemented effectively. Through its review, the Committee also ensured that appropriate procedures are in place for the detection and prevention of fraud.\n\nThe Committee continued to prepare for legislative or regulatory changes. Whilst many of the proposed audit and corporate governance reforms in the UK are not going to proceed in the short-term, changes to the UK's Corporate Governance, principally in relation to internal controls requirements, were published in January 2024 (with strengthened requirements relating to material internal controls coming into effect for financial years starting on/after 1 January 2026). The Committee will continue to monitor any upcoming legislation and their impact to Unilever.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe Committee reviewed internal audit's plan which is focused on Unilever's risk areas including sustainability, cyber security, data privacy, financial control processes, product safety and supply chain resilience. The Committee ensured the necessary resources were in place to perform the audits effectively. Enhanced use of data and analytics has made the internal audits more efficient and effective, increasing the coverage.\n\nThe Committee reviewed quarterly and year-end summary reports which included the results of audit activities and completion status of agreed actions. During the year, the Chief Auditor and his team undertook business visits in person, in particular in a number of the Group's more strategic markets. Most audits have been conducted as hybrid (combination of virtual and physical).\n\nEvery five years, the Committee engages an independent third party to perform an effectiveness review of the function. This was last completed in 2022 and is planned for 2026. In 2023, the Committee evaluated the performance of the internal audit function through a questionnaire. The feedback was reviewed, and the Committee was satisfied with the effectiveness of the internal audit function. During the year, the Committee also met independently with the Chief Auditor and discussed the results of the audits performed and any additional insights obtained from the Chief Auditor.\n\n## Audit of the annual accounts\n\nKPMG, Unilever's external auditors and an independent registered public accounting firm, reported in depth to the Committee on the scope and outcome of the annual audit, including their audit of internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Their reports included audit and accounting matters, governance and control, and accounting developments.\n\nThe Committee held independent meetings with the external auditors during the year and reviewed, agreed, discussed, and challenged their audit plan, including the materiality applied, scope and assessment of the financial reporting risk profile of the Group.\n\nThe Committee discussed the views and conclusions of KPMG regarding management's treatment of significant transactions and areas of judgement during the year. The Committee considered these and is satisfied with the treatment in the financial statements.\n\n## External Auditors\n\nKPMG has been the Group's auditors since 2014 and shareholders approved their reappointment as the Group's external auditors at the 2023 AGM. On the recommendation of the Committee, the Directors will be proposing the reappointment of KPMG at the AGM in May 2024.\n\nThe Committee confirms that the Group is in compliance with The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, which requires Unilever to tender the audit every ten years.\n\nThe last tender for the audit of the Annual Report and Accounts was performed in 2022 where the decision to reappoint KPMG was unanimously recommended by the Committee and approved by the Board of Unilever. At present, we are satisfied with the effectiveness of our current auditors and hence have no plans to re-tender the external auditor appointment for an earlier period. This position is re-evaluated each year.\n\nBoth Unilever and KPMG have safeguards in place to avoid the possibility that the external auditors' objectivity and independence could be compromised, such as audit partner rotation and the restriction on non-audit services that the external auditors can perform as described below. KPMG has issued a formal letter to the Committee outlining the general procedures to safeguard independence and objectivity, disclosing the relationship with the Company, and confirming their audit independence.\n\nEach year, the Committee assesses the effectiveness of the external audit process which includes discussing feedback from the members of the Committee and stakeholders at all levels across Unilever. Interviews are also held with key senior management within both Unilever and KPMG.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the statutory audit, other audit and non-audit services provided by KPMG and compliance with Unilever's documented approach, which prescribes in detail the types of engagements, listed below, for which the external auditors can be used:\n\n- \u25a0 statutory audit services, including audit of subsidiaries;\n- \u25a0 other audit services - audits that are not required by law or regulation;\n- \u25a0 non-audit services - work that our external auditors are best placed to undertake, which may include:\n- \u25a0 services required by law or regulation to be performed by the audit firm; and\n- \u25a0 services where knowledge obtained during the audit is relevant to the service such as bond issue comfort letters.\n\nUnilever has for many years maintained a policy which prescribes in detail the types of engagements for which the external auditors can be used with all other engagements being prohibited. The policy is aligned with both UK and SEC regulations and is updated in line with these regulations.",

The Committee further review all engagements which have been authorised by the Deputy CFO & Controller. These authorities are reviewed regularly and, where necessary, updated in the light of internal and external developments. Since the appointment of KPMG in 2014, the level of non-audit fees has been below 8% of the annual statutory audit fee, this is also the case for 2023.\n\nThe level of other audit fees has been below 6% of the annual statutory audit fee except for 2017 (41%), 2018 (24%), 2020 (32%) and 2021 (21%) due to assurance work relating to the disposal of our Spreads business (2017 and 2018) and assurance work relating to the separation of our Tea business (2020 and 2021).\n\n## Evaluation of the Committee\n\nThe Committee carried out an assessment of its effectiveness and performance in the year. The process was overseen by the Chief Legal Officer & Group Secretary.\n\nThe Committee considered the output from that process at its meeting in November 2023. Feedback was also provided to the Board as part of its evaluation of the overall effectiveness of the Board. The Committee concluded that it is performing effectively.\n\n## Adrian Hennah\n\nChair of the Audit Committee\n\nSusan Kilsby\n\nRuby Lu",

To execute this duty, the Committee worked closely with Unilever and the Board on a range of topics including climate litigation, Human Rights, and Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (ED&I), and nonfinancial reporting, as well as Unilever's performance against the Sustainability Progress Index (SPI), one of the performance measures for our long-term incentive plans.\n\nThis year, external challenges reinforced the importance of the Committee's role in protecting and enhancing Unilever's reputation, a foundational element to the business's success. The Committee and management discussed at length geopolitical tensions and conflict as well as rising activism, and Unilever's position, ensuring the business had robust processes in place to respond to such risks, especially those that emerge quickly. From these discussions, the CRC made recommendations to the Board to ensure that Unilever maintains the highest level of oversight of material issues.\n\nThe Committee also focused on the Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) and specifically the Business Group emissions reduction roadmaps to 2030. With the external landscape a challenging mixture of activism, disclosure and physical climate risks, the Committee guided management ahead of the presentation of the CTAP to Unilever's stakeholders.\n\nAs a Committee, we guide Unilever's strategy on sustainability, from climate change and plastics, to living wage and human rights.\n\nThroughout the year, it was clear Unilever's leadership remains committed to delivering resilient, sustainable and superior performance. With the appointment of Hein Schumacher as CEO, and sustainability a key tenet of the Growth Action Plan, there is no doubt that the company remains committed to being a leader in sustainable business.\n\nIn 2024, with the sustainability focus areas defined, the business is well positioned to use its scale and expertise to make progress on its most material issues. The CRC will continue to support the business to do so, by reviewing the sustainability strategy and challenging management to remain focussed on long-term impact and resilience.\n\nLastly, on behalf of the Committee, thank you to Feike Sijbesma who retired from the CRC after eight years. I look forward to welcoming a new Corporate Responsibility Committee member in 2024. My thanks also go to Unilever's leadership and the whole organisation for the commitment and drive to deliver sustainable, responsible growth. I look forward to the year ahead and further honest and constructive engagements with my fellow Committee members.\n\n## Strive Masiyiwa\n\nChair of the Corporate Responsibility Committee",

If Directors are unable to attend a meeting, they have the opportunity to discuss any agenda items beforehand with the Committee Chair.\n\nThe Corporate Responsibility Committee comprises three Non-Executive Directors: Strive Masiyiwa (Chair), Youngme Moon and Feike Sijbesma. Feike Sijbesma retired from the Committee in October 2023.\n\nThe Chief Research & Development Officer, the Chief Sustainability Officer and the Chief Business Integrity Officer attend the Committee's meetings. The Chief Legal Officer & Group Secretary, and Head of Communications may also join the Committee's discussions.\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe Corporate Responsibility Committee oversees Unilever's conduct as a responsible global business. Core to this remit is its governance of progress on Unilever's sustainability agenda. Part of this responsibility is reviewing and managing sustainability-related risks, opportunities and trends material to Unilever. The Committee also provides reviews and recommendations to the Board about the CTAP which sets out the actions we intend to take to reduce emissions in our business and progress on our net zero goal by 2039.\n\nThe Committee is charged with ensuring that Unilever's reputation is protected and enhanced, so it must consider the Company's influence and impact on stakeholders. Central to this is the need to identify any external developments that are likely to impact Unilever's corporate reputation, and to ensure that appropriate and effective communication policies are in place to support this. The Committee also oversees employee safety, security and wellbeing alongside Unilever's Code of Business Principles and third-party compliance with our Responsible Partner Policy, ensuring that both Unilever's direct employees and those working within the Company's value chain comply with the expected standards of conduct.\n\nThe Committee's discussions are informed by the experience of the Unilever Leadership Executive which is accountable for driving responsible and sustainable growth through Unilever's operations, Business Groups, value chain and brands. Senior leaders are invited to the Committee to share their perspectives and insights on key issues, challenges and external developments.\n\nComplementing the Committee's role, the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the independent assurance programme of Unilever's sustainability commitments, and significant breaches of the Code of Business Principles.\n\nThe Committee's terms of reference are set out at:\n\nwww.unilever.com/corporategovernance\n\nDuring 2023, the Committee had detailed discussions on occupational health, non-financial reporting, climate litigation, the roadmap to net zero, CTAP 2.0, Human Rights, and Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (ED&I).\n\n## How the Committee has discharged its responsibilities\n\nIn 2023, the Committee's principal activities were as follows:\n\n## Navigating an uncertain and volatile world\n\nThe world is an increasingly turbulent place, facing unprecedented and mutually reinforcing environmental and social risks that impact our business, both directly and indirectly. Campaigners are leveraging technology and diverse strategic approaches - from shareholder activism to litigation - to amplify messages and mobilise people in support of their causes.\n\nCommittee members closely scrutinised the processes for managing issues that present material risks to the reputation of the business, urging the business to remain proactive and transparent. The Committee also reviewed the risks and mitigating actions relating to climate activism, litigation and regulatory pressure, including the accuracy and completeness of climate disclosure, and the adequacy of the business's climate strategy. Meanwhile, both new and on going geopolitical tensions and conflict created unique challenges for Unilever in 2023. The Committee discussed matters ranging from the war in Ukraine, safety on tea plantations, and activism by Ben & Jerry's. The Committee remained in close consultation with management on these matters, escalating their recommendations to the Board when necessary.\n\n## Overseeing Code of Business Principles compliance\n\nThe Code and associated Code Policies set out the standards of conduct expected of all Unilever employees in their business endeavours. Compliance with these standards is an essential element of ensuring Unilever's continued business success. Any breach is identified as an ethical, legal, and regulatory risk to the business (see pages 77 and 78).\n\nThe Corporate Responsibility Committee is responsible for oversight of the Code and Code Policies, ensuring that they remain fit for purpose and are appropriately applied. It maintains scrutiny of the mechanisms for implementing the Code and Code Policies. This is vital as compliance is essential to promote and protect Unilever's values and standards, and hence the good reputation of the business.\n\nAt each meeting, the Committee reviews an analysis of investigations into non-compliance with the Code and Code Policies and discusses any trends or learnings arising from these investigations.\n\nThe Committee also considers litigation and regulatory matters which may have a reputational impact and reviews a summary of any significant developments at each meeting. These matters include anti-bribery and corruption measures and competition law compliance. Human rights continued to be a focus of the Committee's Code oversight.",

        "page_content": "## Report of the Corporate Responsibility Committee\n\n## Responsible Partner Policy (RPP) compliance\n\nExtending Unilever's values to third parties is essential if Unilever is to generate responsible growth and a positive social impact on the industry and wider society. Breaches of third-party compliance can pose a risk to the business, so the Committee rigorously examines Unilever's compliance programmes to minimise risks.\n\nAt each meeting, the Committee tracks compliance with Unilever's RPP. This policy sets out Unilever's requirements that third parties conduct business with integrity and respect for human rights and core labour principles. In 2023, particular focus was given to compliance by some of our smaller businesses which are on stand-alone systems.\n\n## Promoting safety and security\n\nSafety, Health and Environment (SHE) are key priorities at Unilever.\n\nUnilever remains focused on promoting a safety-first culture, evidenced by our UniVoice Survey where the top-rated statement for the last several years is 'Unilever is committed to my safety'. Our employee-only TRFR was 0.58 accidents per million hours worked (1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023) versus 0.67 in 2022, which shows continued improvement. In 2023, we very sadly lost one contractor due to a steam exposure. The Committee oversaw Unilever's approach to safety with particular emphasis on road safety, process safety and contractor management risks. The Committee noted the implementation of appropriate programmes to further reduce these risks.\n\nThe Committee also examined Unilever's approach to security. As a global business, Unilever operates in many countries, some of which have a high degree of vulnerability given their diminished capacity to absorb external shocks or tackle domestic challenges. Accordingly, Unilever must remain agile to the increased market volatility created by geopolitics, conflict, inflation, and environmental and social crises.\n\n## Improving the health and wellbeing of employees\n\nThe Committee focused on the progress of the health and wellbeing status of Unilever employees and commended the actions taken by the business to support employees. The Committee oversaw Unilever's Healthier U programme which focuses on chronic conditions and has engaged over 13,000 frontline workers across different geographies. The programme showed significant improvements in biomedical parameters, nutrition, quality of life, sleep, mental health, and work productivity. The programme is moving from pilot to scale by expanding to office-based employees including those in Western Europe and North America.\n\nPsychological safety remains a foundation for the organisation. The business actively monitors perceptions of psychological safety among the workforce. Programmes focused on psychological safety include a Mental Health Champion programme and team energy assessments.\n\n## Equity, diversity and inclusion\n\nOur approach to equity, diversity and inclusion is focused on building a strong, inclusive culture with our own workforce; on diversifying our supply chain and increasing our procurement spend with diverse businesses; on ending harmful stereotypes through our brands with consumers; and on building stronger, more equitable communities through partnerships and advocacy.\n\nUnilever is working to remove barriers to opportunity based on factors that have been used to exclude people around the world: gender, race and ethnicity, disability, socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation. We are developing new initiatives across the business which impact a wide range of communities. The Committee encouraged continual consultation to ensure a range of views on this work and requested that they be kept up to date with the Equity Advancement Framework, an enterprise-wide tool to help uncover systemic inequities within our business, identify their root causes, and understand how they are impacting our employees' experiences, once this is finalised.\n\n## Overseeing the Climate Transition Action Plan\n\nThe impacts of climate change and nature loss are becoming ever more apparent, and the imperative to reduce emissions in our societies and protect and restore nature increasingly urgent.\n\nUnilever's first CTAP was approved by shareholders at the 2021 AGM. The CTAP set out Unilever's suite of climate targets, an analysis of our value chain emissions, and the actions we intended to take to address them. It also covered aspects such as portfolio evolution (e.g. plant-based foods), external advocacy and engagement, and governance. The Corporate Responsibility Committee is responsible for overseeing CTAP progress.\n\nThe Board committed to develop the CTAP in line with best practice, reflecting external guidance such as the recommendations of the UK Transition Plan Taskforce and considering the European Sustainability Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards. An updated CTAP will be presented to our shareholders at the 2024 AGM for an advisory vote.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed and approved the 2023 CTAP Progress Report which is set out in the Annual Report and Accounts, as well as our two new Scope 3 emissions reduction targets. As part of the Committee's oversight of the CTAP, members also reviewed the Business Groups' roadmaps that aim to achieve interim 2030 targets aligned to our net zero ambition.\n\n## Complying with mandatory sustainability reporting\n\nReporting on environmental and social matters is increasingly becoming mandatory.\n\nThe UK has required premium listed companies to make climate-related financial disclosures based on the TCFD framework since 2021. From January 2024, we will also need to comply with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and disclose material sustainability information in accordance with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). This is an extensive suite of disclosures on a range of environmental, social and governance matters which will be included in our 2024 Annual Report and Accounts. Together with the Audit Committee, the Committee will be responsible for overseeing compliance with these disclosure requirements.\n\nIn future years, there are likely to be further mandatory nonfinancial reporting standards which will apply to the Group. The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) has issued a number of sustainability reporting standards which are currently going through the endorsement process for use in the UK.",

        "page_content": "## Report of the Corporate Responsibility Committee\n\n## Sustainability Progress Index\n\nUnilever's Reward Framework includes a Performance Share Plan (PSP). This long-term incentive plan is linked to financial performance, as well as performance against sustainability goals (see page 65).\n\nTo come to a view on Unilever's performance on its sustainability goals for the purposes of reward, the Corporate Responsibility Committee and the Compensation Committee jointly evaluate performance against a Sustainability Progress Index (SPI).\n\n## 2023 SPI outcome\n\nIn 2023, as in years before, this included a selection of eight equally weighted KPIs and targets, with one 'anchor' KPI/target from each of the pillars which underpin Unilever's sustainability commitments. In making their rounded assessment, the Committees review both qualitative and quantitative progress across multiple elements of the pillar and delivery against the respective anchor KPI.\n\nThis year, the assessment of the SPI performance moved to inyear reporting for two KPIs to close the gap between delivery and assessment. As a result, the Committees assessed six SPI KPIs based on performance in 2022 and two SPI KPIs on performance in 2023. The nutrition KPI was updated to reflect the updated Compass commitment scope, and the health and wellbeing target was revised to ensure it remained stretching.\n\nFollowing an in-depth discussion on the SPI, the Corporate Responsibility Committee agreed on a performance rating which was endorsed by the Compensation Committee. This joint assessment forms part of the Compensation Committee's overall recommendation on the SPI outcome (see page 136).\n\n## 2024-2026 SPI KPIs and targets\n\nUnilever's historic approach to incorporating sustainability into employee long-term incentives has been at the forefront of market practice. The SPI has been an established feature of our Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), the Performance Share Plan, and previously the Management Co-Investment Plan (MCIP) scheme since it was introduced in 2017.\n\nIn 2023, as part of the Directors' Remuneration Policy review, the Sustainability Progress Index (SPI) was revised to ensure it remains a relevant performance measure, in line with investor and best practice expectations, and drives the right internal behaviours and decisions.\n\nThe Corporate Responsibility Committee, in collaboration with the Compensation Committee, reviewed the compensation plans of our peers, and conducted an investor consultation, to inform the new SPI scheme. As a result, the Committees selected four metrics that align with Unilever's four sustainability focus areas. The targets and ranges are all numeric and will drive the outcome; however, the Committee will retain the ability to make a rounded assessment.\n\nThe outcome of the PSP 2024-2026 will be assessed using 2026 actuals. In the meantime, for in-flight PSP schemes, the Corporate Responsibility Committee and Compensation Committee will determine the annual SPI outcome using interim KPIs and targets aligned to the 2024-2026 scorecard and in-year data.\n\n## Evaluation of the Corporate Responsibility Committee\n\nThe Committee carried out an assessment of its effectiveness and performance in the year. The process was administered by a questionnaire and overseen by the Chief Legal Officer & Group Secretary.\n\nThe Committee considered the output from that process in January 2023. The Committee concluded that it is performing effectively and highlighted the importance of retaining flexibility to discuss emerging topics. This was incorporated into the Committee's annual workplan for 2023.\n\nThe feedback was also provided to the Board as part of its evaluation of the overall performance and effectiveness of the Board.\n\n## Strive Masiyiwa\n\nChair of the Corporate Responsibility Committee\n\nYoungme Moon",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Andrea Jung\n\nVice Chair/Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Compensation Committee\n\nOn behalf of the Compensation Committee, I am pleased to present Unilever's Directors' Remuneration Report 2023. Unilever's Remuneration Policy is being presented for shareholder approval at the 2024 AGM and therefore the proposal is set out below. I have included the Committee's activities in 2023, a summary of Unilever's business performance in 2023 and how it links to key remuneration outcomes for the year.\n\n## Business performance and remuneration\n\nUnilever delivered an improving financial performance, with the return to volume growth and margins rebuilding. However, our competitiveness remains disappointing, which we are working at speed to address.\n\nWe achieved underlying sales growth (USG) of 7.0% in 2023, with positive volumes, up 0.2% for the financial year.\n\nUnderlying operating margin (UOM) increased by 60bps to 16.7%, significantly ahead of target of 16.3%.\n\nFree cash flow (FCF) increased \u20ac1.9bn to \u20ac7.1bn (\u20ac6.7bn excluding \u20ac0.4bn linked to a tax refund in India), driven by higher underlying operating profit (UOP) and significantly improved working capital. \u20ac6.7bn is the figure used for remuneration purposes.\n\nUnderlying earnings per share increased by 1.4% to \u20ac2.60, despite a (9.6%) adverse currency impact.\n\nUnderlying return on invested capital (ROIC) improved to 16.2%, compared to 16.0% in the prior year. This reflected the working capital improvement achieved over the year.\n\nCompetitiveness expressed as % business winning market share (% Business Winning) on a rolling 12-month basis was disappointing at 37%. % Business Winning measures the aggregate turnover of the portfolio components (country/ category cells) gaining value market share as a percentage of the total turnover measured by market data. As such, it assesses what percentage of turnover is being generated in areas where we are gaining market share. For more information on % Business Winning and how it is calculated, please see the remuneration section of our website.\n\nThe Committee agreed an outcome of 115% for the Sustainability Progress Index (SPI) for 2023 in conjunction with the Corporate Responsibility Committee. Please see page 136 to 137 for more information on the SPI outcome for 2023 and page 131 for the SPI targets for Performance Share Plan (PSP) 2024-2026.\n\nI would like to express my gratitude for the valuable feedback received during the shareholder consultation process.\n\nOur reported financial outcomes include a contribution from our business operations in Russia. For remuneration purposes, the Committee have excluded the impact of our Russia business from performance outcomes resulting in lower payouts for Management Co-Investment Plan (MCIP) and PSP for the Executive Directors, as outlined below.\n\n## Incentive outcomes and wider stakeholder considerations\n\n## 2023 annual bonus\n\nUnder the formulaic outcomes, a bonus outcome of 150% of target opportunity was determined for the Executive Directors, as detailed in the chart on page 135.\n\nHowever, after careful consideration, the Committee decided to exercise discretion to adjust the formulaic outcome downwards to 115% of target. Each year, the Committee carefully reviews performance in the round to determine whether the formulaic outcome fully reflects performance. Whilst the Committee believe that performance delivered in the year was strong, we believe there is scope to improve our competitiveness. The Committee considered numerous data points when assessing our competitiveness performance and concluded that we are not winning sufficient market share in a number of key markets. The Committee also concluded that our share price performance was below expectations. Taking both factors into account led to the reduction from 150% of target to 115% of target, which we believe is reasonable and aligns the experience of shareholders, stakeholders and the Executive Directors. The annual bonus pool for eligible managers within the wider workforce will also be 115%.\n\n## 2020-2023 MCIP\n\nThe formulaic outcome for the 2020-2023 MCIP was 88% of target, as detailed in the chart on page 135.\n\nAfter exercising discretion to adjust the formulaic outcome to remove the contribution of business operations in Russia, the outcome was lowered to 87% of target for the Executive Directors. The formulaic outcome of 88% will apply to eligible managers within the wider workforce.\n\nThe Committee considered whether any further discretion was needed to reflect any windfall gains and determined that no such reduction was warranted. This was on the basis that the share price used to determine the 2020 award was not materially below the equivalent share price used to determine the 2019 award.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report\n\n## 2021-2023 PSP\n\nThe PSP was introduced in 2021 to replace MCIP. The performance period for the PSP is three years, compared to four years for MCIP. Therefore, there is a vesting of both the 2020-2023 MCIP and the 2021-2023 PSP in 2024 based on performance period to the end of 2023.\n\nThe formulaic outcome for the 2021-2023 PSP was 65% of target, as detailed in the chart on page 136.\n\nSimilarly to MCIP, after adjusting the formulaic outcome to remove the contribution from our business operations in Russia, this was reduced from 65% to 63% of target for the Executive Directors. The formulaic outcome of 65% will apply to eligible managers within the wider workforce.\n\nThe Committee also considered whether any further discretion was needed to reflect any windfall gains and determined that no such reduction was warranted for the same reasons as for the 2020-2023 MCIP.\n\n## Wider stakeholder considerations\n\nWhen considering the annual bonus, MCIP and PSP outcomes, the Committee carefully took into account the experiences of our wider stakeholders in order to ensure that outcomes were aligned. These considerations directly led to the discretionary adjustments as outlined above.\n\n## Our new Directors' Remuneration Policy for 2024\n\nOur Remuneration Policy was last approved at the May 2021 AGM. Consequently, it reaches the end of its three-year approval period, and a new remuneration policy is being presented for shareholder approval at the May 2024 AGM (New Remuneration Policy).\n\nThe Committee carried out extensive consultation with shareholders and proxy advisers in June and September to discuss the 2023 AGM voting outcome on acceptance of the 2022 Directors' remuneration report and the proposed New Remuneration Policy. The feedback received during the consultation was valued by the Committee and taken into account in developing the proposed New Remuneration Policy.\n\nThe Committee also monitored the external environment on pay and sought feedback from all management level employees on the current remuneration structure of fixed pay, benefits, annual bonus and PSP. 82% of respondents stated that PSP is competitive, 76% for retirement benefits, 74% for health benefits and 73% for annual bonus.\n\nOur New Remuneration Policy was developed in light of this process and feedback and provides for continuity in policy, but refinement of implementation.\n\nThe key updates we are proposing to make to the implementation of our New Remuneration Policy are to:\n\n- \u25a0 freeze the CEO's fixed pay for 2024 and 2025;\n- \u25a0 refocus the remuneration benchmarking peer group; and\n- \u25a0 update performance measures and weightings for annual bonus and PSP, as follows:\n- \u25a0 Annual bonus: USG 40%, UOP growth (adjusted for restructuring costs for the Executive Directors) 30% and FCF 30%.\n- \u25a0 PSP: USG 25%, relative total shareholder return (TSR) 30%, average underlying ROIC 30% and SPI 15%.\n\nThe Committee is making these updates to:\n\n- \u25a0 retain the current remuneration structure of fixed pay, benefits, annual bonus and PSP, which is simple, previously approved by shareholders and reflects market norms of a European-listed company;\n- \u25a0 maintain incentive quantum, noting this results in overall pay for the Executive Directors at median level compared to peers;\n- \u25a0 narrow sector focus of remuneration benchmarking peer group to only include consumer goods companies and to reflect Unilever's talent pool;\n- \u25a0 support strong strategic alignment of incentive performance measures for 2024 and beyond;\n- \u25a0 simplify targets under the SPI performance measure; and\n- \u25a0 incorporate valued feedback received from shareholders during consultation.\n\nHaving undertaken an extensive consultation exercise before finalising the New Remuneration Policy, the Committee believes it can be fully supported by the great majority of our shareholders.\n\nAs with our previous reward framework, Unilever will cascade the same approach across our 15,000+ managers worldwide. However, to focus on individual performance for our managers at work levels 2 and 3, PSP will be replaced with restricted stock units and the size of the award linked to in-year performance.\n\n## Executive Director changes\n\nAs previously announced, Alan Jope stepped down as CEO and Executive Director on 30 June 2023 and retired from employment on 31 December 2023. Details of his remuneration are in line with the Remuneration Policy and were disclosed in last year's Directors' remuneration report. In particular, Alan remained eligible to receive a pro rata annual bonus from 1 January to 30 June 2023. As he was employed for the entirety of the performance periods, the Committee determined that his 2020-2023 MCIP and 2021-2023 awards would vest in full, subject to performance outcomes, as outlined above.\n\nGraeme Pitkethly stepped down as CFO and Executive Director with effect from 1 January 2024 and will retire from employment on 31 May 2024. He will continue to be paid in line with the Remuneration Policy until his retirement. Further details of Graeme's leaving arrangements are set out on page 145.\n\nAs announced on 26 October 2023, Fernando Fernandez was promoted to the role of CFO with effect from 1 January 2024. Fernando's fixed pay has been set at \u20ac1,175,000 with annual bonus and PSP opportunity in line with our Remuneration Policy. The Committee believes that the current positioning of the package represents an acceptable balance in view of various considerations, such as competitive external market pay rates across Unilever's peer group, Fernando's extensive skills and experience with Unilever and salary increases awarded to the wider workforce. We also took on board previous feedback from shareholders in relation to the fixed pay of the incoming CEO and positioned Fernando's fixed pay lower than Graeme's fixed pay as current CFO.\n\nFernando will receive a relocation allowance and the cost of temporary accommodation for a maximum of six months to support his move to the UK. Further details of Fernando's appointment are set out on page 144.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report\n\n## Executive Director fixed pay increases\n\nThe Committee considered investor feedback carefully and, as a result, the Board has decided to freeze the CEO's fixed pay for 2024 and 2025.\n\nGiven the announcement of Graeme to retire from employment at the end of May 2024, the Committee decided not to review his fixed pay for 2024. As outlined above, the Committee set the fixed pay for Fernando Fernandez as the incoming CFO, effective from 1 January 2024.\n\nThe average wider workforce pay increase in 2023 was 7.62%.\n\n## Non-Executive Director fees\n\nNon-Executive Director fees are in line with market rate and given the increase in fees in 2023, the Board decided not to further increase fees in 2024. We will keep Non-Executive Director fees under regular review.\n\n## Engaging with shareholders\n\nAs mentioned above, the Committee conducted comprehensive consultation with shareholders and proxy advisers in 2023 in respect of the 2022 Directors' remuneration report and the renewal of the Remuneration Policy. The Committee has taken into account their views, which have been invaluable in developing the final proposals.\n\nIn particular, we took into account feedback in relation to the fixed pay of the incoming CEO and CFO, simplification of the SPI performance measure for PSP, introduction of relative TSR as a performance measure for PSP, UOP adjusted for restructuring costs for Executive Directors for annual bonus, composition of the benchmarking peer group, and weightings of performance measures.\n\nThe Committee is committed to ensuring that remuneration performance measures for the Executive Directors align with the interests of shareholders. The Committee hopes that shareholders will be supportive of these changes and would very much welcome any further engagement on these proposals.\n\n## Engaging with employees\n\nThe Board shares the responsibility for workforce engagement among all the Non-Executive Directors to ensure that all Directors have a collective responsibility for bringing employee views into relevant Board discussion. We continued these engagements in 2023, see page 96 for a summary of the discussions that took place.\n\nIn November 2023, the proposed New Remuneration Policy was shared with the European Works Council, followed by discussions with local works councils and trade unions where applicable. We took on board feedback to ensure Unilever focuses on long-term goals like sustainability, remains competitive to attract and retain talent, and extends share ownership to employees below management level.\n\nAlong with another member of the Committee, I attended an engagement session with employees on the subject of reward and the proposed New Remuneration Policy in January 2024. Employees shared feedback on flexibility of variable remuneration, reward structures during high inflation, reward for work level 1 employees, communication of long-term incentives and culture of rewarding performance. Employees shared feedback that there has been an improvement in differentiation based on performance, which was a topic raised in the previous engagement session on reward.\n\nThe Committee is periodically updated on matters impacting the workforce, including operation of annual bonus schemes, the talent review process, pay review budgets, distribution of performance ratings, diversity, living wage, the new long-term incentive plan for work levels 2 and 3, and alignment of incentives and rewards with Unilever's culture.\n\nIn light of the above, the Committee believes the implementation of remuneration in 2023 is a fair reflection of employee experience.\n\n## Implementation report\n\nThe annual report on remuneration describes 2023 remuneration in detail as well as the planned implementation of the proposed New Remuneration Policy in 2024.\n\nOn behalf of the Committee and the entire Board, I thank all shareholders and their representatives for their constructive engagement in 2023 and I hope we can rely on your vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Andrea Jung\n\nChair of the Compensation Committee",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report\n\n## Directors' Remuneration Policy 2024\n\n## Policy report\n\nThe following sets out our New Directors' Remuneration Policy. It fundamentally continues our existing policy with some key proposed updates to how the policy is implemented, which are discussed below.\n\nThe New Remuneration Policy will be presented for approval by shareholders at the 2024 AGM and, if approved, will apply to payments made after that date and will replace the existing Remuneration Policy in its entirety. It is intended that the New Remuneration Policy will apply for three years, although the Committee may seek approval for a new policy at an earlier point if it is considered appropriate. The supporting information section provides the rationale for updates to the existing remuneration policy where appropriate as well as some information as to any changes to our approach to implementation.\n\nRemuneration payments and payments for loss of office to Directors can only be made if they are consistent with the approved Remuneration Policy or if an amendment to that remuneration policy authorising the payment has been approved by shareholders.\n\n## Fixed pay\n\n## Purpose and link to strategy\n\nSupports the recruitment and retention of Executive Directors of the calibre required to implement our strategy. Reflects the individual's skills, experience, performance and seniority within the Group and the size and complexity of the role.\n\n## Operation\n\nSet by the Board on the recommendation of the Committee and generally reviewed once a year, with any changes usually effective from 1 January (although changes may be made at any other time if the Committee considers that is appropriate).\n\nFixed pay is paid in cash and is generally paid monthly. Fixed pay is set at an appropriate level to attract and retain Executive Directors of the required calibre, taking into account:\n\n- \u25a0 our policy generally to pay total compensation at around the median of an appropriate peer group of other global consumer companies of a similar financial size and complexity to Unilever; (a)\n- \u25a0 the individual's skills, experience and performance;\n- \u25a0 the size and complexity of the role;\n- \u25a0 individual's time in role; and\n- \u25a0 pay and conditions across the wider organisation.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nn/a\n\n## Opportunity\n\nAny increases will normally be in line with or below the range of increases awarded to other employees within the Group.\n\nIncreases may be above this level or applied more frequently in certain circumstances, such as:\n\n- \u25a0 where there is, in the Committee's opinion, a significant change in an Executive Director's scope or role;\n- \u25a0 where a new Executive Director has been appointed to the Board at a rate lower than the typical market level for such a role and becomes established in the role; and\n- \u25a0 where it is considered necessary to reflect significant changes in market practice.\n\nThe maximum aggregate increase for the current Executive Directors during the time in which this policy applies will be no higher than 25% for each Director.\n\n## Supporting information\n\nThere are no material changes relative to the previous Remuneration Policy.\n\nThe peer group used to benchmark pay has been updated to better reflect the global footprint of the Group and to focus more narrowly on consumer companies.\n\nAs previously communicated, the Committee has decided to freeze the fixed pay of Hein Schumacher as the incoming CEO up to the end of 2025. The Committee will next review his fixed pay level in 2026.\n\n(a) The proposed remuneration peer group for 2024 includes Anheuser-Busch InBev, Beiersdorf, British American Tobacco, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Danone, Diageo, Haleon, Heineken, Henkel, Kimberly-Clark, Kraft Heinz, L'Or\u00e9al, LVMH, Mondel\u0113z, Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo, Pernod Ricard, Procter and Gamble, and Reckitt Benckiser. The peer group used for pay benchmarking purposes is reviewed regularly and companies are added and/or removed at the Committee's discretion to ensure that it remains appropriate.\n\n## Benefits\n\n## Purpose and link to strategy\n\nProvides certain benefits on a cost-effective basis to aid attraction and retention of Executive Directors.\n\n## Operation\n\nBenefits include provision of death, disability and medical insurance cover, Directors' liability insurance and actual tax return preparation costs. Other benefits may be provided in the future where it is considered necessary by the Committee and/or required by legislation.\n\nIn the event that Unilever were to require an existing or new Executive Director to relocate, Unilever may pay appropriate relocation allowances for a specified time period of no more than three years. This may cover costs such as (but not limited to) relocation, cost of living, housing benefit, home leave, tax and social security equalisation and education assistance.\n\nExecutive Directors are entitled to participate on the same terms as all UK employees in the Unilever PLC Sharebuy Plan.\n\n## Opportunity\n\nBased on the cost to Unilever of providing the benefit and dependent on individual circumstances.\n\nRelocation allowances - the level of such benefits would be set at an appropriate level by the Committee, taking into account the circumstances of the individual and typical market practice.\n\nAwards under the all-employee Unilever PLC Sharebuy Plan may be up to HMRC-approved limits. The only change in the value of the current benefits (for single figure purposes) will reflect changes in the costs of providing those benefits.\n\nThere is no separate benefit or allowance provided in respect of pension which is deemed to be included in fixed pay.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nn/a\n\n## Supporting information\n\nThere are no changes relative to the previous Remuneration Policy.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report\n\n## Annual bonus\n\n## Purpose and link to strategy\n\nIncentivises year-on-year delivery of rigorous short-term financial, strategic and operational objectives selected to support our annual business strategy and the ongoing enhancement of shareholder value.\n\nThe ability to recognise performance through annual bonus enables us to manage our cost base flexibly and react to events and market circumstances.\n\n## Operation\n\nEach year, the Executive Directors may have the opportunity to participate in the annual bonus plan. The Executive Directors are set a target opportunity that is assessed against the business performance multiplier of up to 150% of target opportunity at the end of the year.\n\nDirectors are required to defer 50% of their bonus into shares or share awards for three years. Deferred bonus awards can earn dividends or dividend equivalents during the vesting period and may be satisfied in cash and/or shares. Deferral may be effected under the Unilever Share Plan 2017, or by such other method as the Committee determines.\n\nRecovery, discretion, ultimate remedy, malus and claw-back provisions apply (see details on page 121).\n\n## Opportunity\n\nThe maximum annual bonus opportunity under this Policy is 225% of fixed pay.\n\nThe normal target bonus opportunity for the CEO is 150% of fixed pay, and for the CFO is 120% of fixed pay. This results in normal maximums of 225% and 180% respectively.\n\nAchievement of threshold performance results in a payout of 0% of the maximum opportunity.\n\n## Performance Share Plan (PSP)\n\n## Purpose and link to strategy\n\nIncentivises delivery of long-term financial, strategic and operational objectives of the Company and aligns the experience of shareholders and the Executive Directors. Rewards performance of the Executive Directors while controlling costs due to pre-determined performance measures and a maximum outcome. Also acts as a retention tool given PSP awards vest after three years.\n\n## Operation\n\nUnder the PSP, the Executive Directors are granted rights to receive free shares on vesting (awards) which normally vest after three years, to the extent performance conditions (see performance measures section on the right) are achieved. Upon vesting, the Executive Directors have an additional two-year retention period (during which shares cannot be sold) to ensure there is a five-year duration between the grant of the award and release of the shares.\n\nClaw-back, malus, recovery, ultimate remedy and discretion provisions apply (see details on page 121).\n\n## Opportunity\n\nThe maximum annual grant available under this Policy is 400% of fixed pay.\n\nThe normal maximum award for the CEO is 400% of fixed pay, and for the CFO is 320% of fixed pay. At target, 50% of maximum vests, equating to 200% and 160% of fixed pay respectively. 0% of the award will vest for below threshold performance. The amount payable for threshold performance will be disclosed for each metric in the relevant directors' remuneration report.\n\nDividend equivalents may be earned (in cash or additional shares) on the award when and to the extent that the award vests. Dividends or dividend equivalents will also be payable in respect of dividends paid during the retention period.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nThe business performance multiplier is based on a range of business metrics set by the Committee on an annual basis to ensure that they are appropriately stretching for the delivery of threshold, target and maximum performance. These performance measures may include underlying sales growth (USG), underlying operating profit (UOP) growth (adjusted for restructuring costs for the Executive Directors) and free cash flow (FCF), along with any other measures chosen by the Committee, as appropriate. The Committee also sets the weightings of the respective metrics on an annual basis.\n\nThe Committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic outcome of the business performance multiplier, if it believes this better reflects the underlying performance of Unilever. In any event, the overall business performance multiplier will not exceed 150%. The use of any discretion will be fully disclosed in the Directors' remuneration report for the year to which discretion relates.\n\nThe Committee may introduce non-financial measures in the future, subject to a minimum of 70% of targets being financial in nature.\n\nPerformance is normally measured over the financial year.\n\n## Supporting information\n\nThere are no changes relative to the previous Remuneration Policy.\n\nPerformance measures for 2024 have been updated to replace underlying operating margin (UOM) with UOP growth (adjusted for restructuring costs for the Executive Directors).\n\nThe proposed changes to measures are to ensure we use the most strategically aligned measures, see page 123.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nThe Committee sets performance measures for each PSP award. These will be tested over the three financial years starting with the financial year in which the award is granted.\n\nThe performance measures for the PSP grants in 2024 will be: USG (25%), relative total shareholder return (TSR) (30%), average underlying return on invested capital (ROIC) (30%), and Sustainability Progress Index (SPI) (15%). The Committee retains the discretion to change these measures and/or weighting for future grants, based on strategic priorities for Unilever at that time.\n\nThe Committee will ensure that the targets set are appropriately rigorous for the delivery of threshold, target and maximum performance.\n\nThe Committee retains the discretion to adjust the formulaic outcome of these performance measures to reflect its assessment of the underlying long-term performance. The use of any discretion will be fully disclosed and explained in the Directors' remuneration report for the year to which discretion relates.\n\n## Supporting information\n\nThere are no changes relative to the previous Remuneration Policy.\n\nPerformance measures for 2024 have been updated to replace % Business Winning with USG and cumulative FCF with relative TSR.\n\nThe proposed changes to measures are to ensure we use the most strategically aligned measures, see page 123.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report\n\n## Claw-back, malus, recovery, ultimate remedy and discretion\n\nClaw-back: Claw-back is the recovery of payments made under the annual bonus (including deferred bonus shares) or vested Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards. The Committee may decide to apply claw-back for up to three years from the payment of bonus awards, and up to two years from vesting or the start of any retention period (which ever is later) for the LTIP awards, in the event of:\n\n- \u25a0 a significant downward restatement of the financial results of Unilever;\n- \u25a0 error in calculation or misleading data; or\n- \u25a0 corporate failure.\n\nClaw-back may apply to all or part of a participant's payment or award and may be effected, among other means, by reducing outstanding awards, or requiring the return of the net value of vested awards to Unilever.\n\nMalus: Malus is the adjustment of bonus, unvested deferred bonus awards or unvested LTIP awards. The Committee may apply malus to reduce an award or determine that it will not vest or only vest in part. Malus applies to deferred bonus awards during the three-year deferral period and to unvested LTIP awards during the vesting period and retention period, in the event of:\n\n- \u25a0 a significant downward restatement of the financial results of Unilever;\n- \u25a0 gross misconduct or gross negligence;\n- \u25a0 material breach of Unilever's Code of Business Principles or any of the Unilever Code Policies;\n- \u25a0 breach of restrictive covenants by which the individual has agreed to be bound, or conduct by the individual which results in significant losses or serious reputation damage to Unilever; and\n- \u25a0 error in calculation or misleading data or corporate failure.\n\nThe annual bonus will also be subject to malus on the same grounds as apply for deferred bonus awards and unvested LTIP awards. This power is an addition to the normal discretion to adjust awards and the additional sustainability test outlined in the policy table.\n\nRecovery: Recovery applies to payments of variable remuneration which have been made in error as a result of a required accounting restatement.\n\nThe Committee may require repayment of any amount of erroneously awarded variable remuneration in the event Unilever is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material non-compliance with a financial reporting requirement under securities law in the United States. Any recovery will be in accordance with the Unilever Recovery Policy.\n\nUltimate remedy: LTIP awards are subject to ultimate remedy. Upon vesting of an award, the Committee shall have the discretionary power to adjust the value of the award if the award, in the Committee's opinion taking all circumstances into account, produces an unfair result. In exercising this discretion, the Committee may take into account Unilever's performance against non-financial measures.\n\nThese powers are in addition to the normal discretion to adjust awards.\n\nUltimate remedy/malus and claw-back will not apply to an award which has been exchanged following a change of control and claw-back will not apply where an award vests on a change of control.\n\nCommittee discretion to amend targets/measures: For LTIP awards and annual bonus, the Committee may change a performance measure or target (including replacing a measure) in accordance with the award's terms or if anything happens which causes the Committee reasonably to consider it appropriate to do so. The Committee may also adjust the number or class of shares subject to MCIP, PSP and deferred bonus awards if certain corporate events (e.g. rights issues) occur.\n\nThe Committee will continue to review targets on all unvested awards in the event of any material acquisitions or disposals that were not included in the financial plan, or were not anticipated at the time of target setting. The Committee may make adjustments if deemed appropriate to ensure that all targets remain relevant and equally stretching in light of any M&A activity, other corporate events, or any other event that the Committee considers to be material, that was not foreseen at the time of target setting.\n\n## Legacy arrangements\n\nFor the duration of this New Remuneration Policy, entitlements arising before the adoption of this New Remuneration Policy will continue to be honoured in line with the approved remuneration policy under which they were granted, or their contractual terms.\n\nAwards granted under a previous remuneration policy will continue to operate under the terms of that policy and the relevant plan rules. Further details of the terms of the awards made are included in the Directors' remuneration reports for their respective years. This provision will cease to apply once all of these awards have vested, been exercised or been forfeited as appropriate, as per the relevant policy and plan rules. Additional details are set out below.\n\nThe Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising any relevant discretions) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the New Remuneration Policy where the terms of the payment were agreed before the New Remuneration Policy came into effect or at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of Unilever and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of Unilever. For these purposes, 'payments' include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are 'agreed' at the time the award is granted.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report\n\n## Remuneration scenarios: our emphasis on performance-related pay\n\nIt is Unilever's policy that the total remuneration package for the Executive Directors should be competitive with other global companies and that a significant proportion should be performance related.\n\nFor the remuneration scenarios below, the maximum and target pay opportunities have been chosen to be consistent with the current levels for the Executive Directors. In reviewing the appropriate level of pay opportunity for the Executive Directors, the Committee considers internal and external comparators. Although pay is not driven by benchmarking, the Committee is aware that pay needs to be within a reasonable range of competitive practice. The Committee notes that total target pay is slightly below median for the CEO and incoming CFO for the 2024 benchmark group proposed by the Committee (a) .\n\nThe Committee typically reviews, on at least an annual basis, the impact of different performance scenarios on the potential reward opportunity and payouts to be received by the Executive Directors and the alignment of these with the returns that might be received by shareholders. The Committee believes that the level of remuneration that can be delivered in the various scenarios is appropriate for the level of performance delivered and the value that would be delivered to shareholders. The charts below show hypothetical values of the remuneration package for the Executive Directors in the first full year of the New Remuneration Policy under below threshold, target and maximum performance scenarios.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Details of fixed elements of remuneration for CEO and CFO and assumptions for scenario charts\n\n| Fixed remuneration    | Assumptions as follows (for actual Executive Director pay details, please see the Directors'  Remuneration Report below): \u25a0 Fixed pay for CEO effective from 1 January 2024 = \u20ac1,850,000. \u25a0 Fixed pay for CFO effective from 1 January 2024 = \u20ac1,175,000.   | Assumptions as follows (for actual Executive Director pay details, please see the Directors'  Remuneration Report below): \u25a0 Fixed pay for CEO effective from 1 January 2024 = \u20ac1,850,000. \u25a0 Fixed pay for CFO effective from 1 January 2024 = \u20ac1,175,000.   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Variable remuneration | Below threshold                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | No 2024 annual bonus payout and no vesting  under the PSP.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|                       | On target                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Target payout of the 2024 annual bonus (150% of  fixed pay for the CEO and 120% of fixed pay for the  CFO). 50% of the bonus would be deferred for  three years.                                                                                            |\n|                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Maximum payout of the 2024 annual bonus (225%  of fixed pay for the CEO and 180% of fixed pay for  the CFO). 50% of the bonus would be deferred for  three years.                                                                                           |\n|                       | Maximum                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|                       | Maximum with 50% share price increase                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | As per maximum above, and in addition shows the  impact of a share price increase of 50% from the  date of grant to the date of vesting of the PSP  award.                                                                                                  |\n|                       | Notes to variable remuneration                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Dividends, dividend equivalents and (except as  described above) share price movements are  ignored for the purposes of the illustrations  above.                                                                                                           |",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report\n\n## Approach to target setting\n\nPerformance measures are selected to align with Unilever's short-term performance targets and long-term business strategy objectives. Unilever's primary business objective is to create value in a sustainable way. Performance measures focus management on the delivery of a combination of top-line revenue growth and bottom-line profit growth that Unilever believes will build shareholder value over the longer term and that will benefit all of our stakeholders.\n\nThe measures chosen for the incentives will support the delivery of this objective, with distinct measures for each of the shortand longer-term incentive programmes.\n\nThe Committee sets performance targets for incentive plans, taking into account internal budgets, business priorities and external forecasts so that the targets are sufficiently stretching. Good performance results in target payout while maximum payout is only achieved for delivering exceptional performance.\n\nThe following sets out the performance measures for short- and long-term incentive plans to be awarded in 2024, as well as the business performance and the behaviours that they drive.\n\n## 2024 performance measures and the link to strategy\n\n| Incentive plan           | Performance measure                                                                                                                                  | Link to strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Short-term: Annual Bonus | Underlying sales growth (USG) at constant FX  rates (40%)                                                                                            | Clear, simple and well-understood measure supporting  the achievement of Unilever's growth ambition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                          | Underlying operating profit (UOP) growth at  current FX rates (30%) (adjusted for restructuring  costs for annual bonus for the Executive Directors) | Provides a focus on absolute profitability as an indicator of  driving shareholder value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|                          | Free cash flow (FCF) at current FX rates (30%)                                                                                                       | Provides clear focus on the achievement of Unilever's cash  generation ambition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Long-term: PSP           | Underlying sales growth (USG) at constant FX  rates (25%)                                                                                            | The primary driver of value creation in our multi-year  financial growth model.

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report\n\n## Application beyond the Board\n\nRemuneration arrangements are determined throughout the Group based on the same principle: that reward should support our business strategy and should be sufficient to attract and retain high-performing individuals without paying more than is necessary. Unilever is a global organisation with employees at a number of different levels of seniority and in a number of different countries and, while this principle underpins all reward arrangements, the way it is implemented varies by geography and level.\n\nStrategic Business Objectives (SBOs) form an additional performance measure for annual bonus for ULE members, resulting in weightings of 40% USG, 20% UOP growth, 20% FCF and 20% SBOs for 2024. Also, for Business Group (BG) Presidents on the ULE, annual bonus is assessed on 75% BG performance and 25% Unilever Group performance.\n\nIn principle, all our managers participate in the same Unilever annual bonus scheme with generally the same performance measures and structure. Senior managers participate in the long-term PSP plan with a restricted share plan being operated for lower levels of management. Wherever possible, all other employees have the opportunity to participate in the global share purchase plan called 'SHARES', which is offered in more than 100 countries.\n\nThrough these initiatives, we continue to encourage all our employees to adopt an owner's mindset with the goal of achieving our growth ambition, so they can share in the future long-term success of Unilever.\n\n## Stakeholders' considerations\n\nGuided by our purpose-led and future-fit business model, the Committee has applied a multi-stakeholder approach in reviewing the current reward framework in view of the 2024 policy renewal. The Committee has therefore engaged with various stakeholders, both internally and externally as set out below.\n\n## Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Group\n\nWhen determining the pay of the Executive Directors, the Committee considers the pay arrangements for other employees in the Group, including considering the average global pay review budget for the management population, to ensure that remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors remain reasonable. Unilever takes the views of its employees seriously and on an ongoing basis we conduct the 'Rate-My-Reward' survey to gauge the views of employees on the different parts of their reward package.\n\nIn establishing its reward framework, Unilever sought feedback from all management-level employees on the current remuneration structure of fixed pay, benefits, annual bonus and PSP. Where appropriate, we have also engaged with employee representative groups.\n\nFairness in the workplace is a core pillar of our sustainability goals and incorporates our Framework for Fair Compensation. As part of our Framework's living wage element, we are committed to pay a living wage to all our direct employees, which we achieved in 2020.\n\nThe Committee already upholds its obligation under Section 172 of the UK Companies Act 2006 (see pages 91 to 92) to consider the impact of what we do on our multiple stakeholders. These considerations shape the way the Committee looks at pay and sets pay rates for our Executive and Non-Executive Directors relative to our wider workforce. We will continue to advance these initiatives over the years ahead to enhance the livelihoods of all our employees. For more information visit: www.unilever.com/ planet-and-society\n\n## Consideration of shareholder views\n\nThe Committee takes the views of shareholders seriously. We maintain an open and regular dialogue with our shareholders on remuneration matters, including consulting with our largest investors and shareholder representative bodies, when we are considering making material changes to our remuneration policy. Accordingly, shareholders have been consulted extensively and their views have been influential in shaping this New Remuneration Policy. Their feedback informed our proposals in relation to the composition of our remuneration and TSR benchmarking peer groups and the performance measures and weightings for annual bonus and PSP, as well as our decision to leave the fundamental structure and quantum of our Remuneration Policy unchanged.\n\n## Minimum shareholding requirement\n\nThe remuneration arrangements applicable to our Executive Directors require them to build and retain a personal shareholding in Unilever (within five years from the date of appointment with extra time granted if requirements increase significantly) to align their interests with those of Unilever's long-term shareholders. The current requirement is 500% fixed pay for the CEO and 400% fixed pay for the CFO. All shares beneficially owned and any awards not subject to performance conditions (but, for example, subject to retention or deferral periods) count towards the shareholding requirement (on an estimated net of tax basis if tax is expected to be payable). Incoming Executive Directors will be required to retain all shares vesting from any share awards (net of any sales to cover tax) until their minimum shareholding requirements have been met in full.\n\nAny Executive Director who leaves employment is required to maintain 100% of their minimum shareholding requirement for two years after leaving. These shares will be held in the Company nominee vested accounts. If the leaver has not yet met their shareholding requirements on departure, they will be required to retain the shares they do own up to these limits. This requirement can be waived in certain exceptional personal circumstances (e.g. death, disability, ill health).",

The Board determine Non-Executive  Director fee levels, which are limited to the aggregate amount permitted by the Company's articles of  association, as approved by shareholders from time to time (which is currently \u20ac5 million per year). Unilever's policy is to set fees at a level which is sufficient to attract, motivate and retain high-class talent  of the calibre required to direct the strategy of the business without paying more than necessary. The fees  are set taking into account: \u25a0 the commitment and contribution expected by the Group; \u25a0 fee levels paid in other global companies; and \u25a0 that fees are paid in cash.                                                                                                                    |\n|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Operation                  | Unilever applies a modular fee structure for the Non-Executive Directors to ensure we fairly reflect the  roles and responsibilities of chair and committee membership. Our basic philosophy is to pay the Chair  an all- inclusive fee. Other Board members receive a basic fee and additional fees for being Senior  Independent Director and chairing or membership of various committees.

The Non-Executive Directors are currently appointed for a one-year term, subject to satisfactory performance, re-nomination at the discretion of the Board on the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and re-election at forthcoming annual shareholder meetings. It is Unilever's expectation that all Non-Executive Directors serve for a minimum of three years. The letters of appointment allow for Unilever to terminate a NonExecutive Director's appointment in cases of gross misconduct, failure to perform their duties competently, conduct bringing Unilever into disrepute, bankruptcy or where the Non-Executive Director is prevented from occupying such a position by law.\n\nThe letters do not contain provision for notice periods or compensation if the Non-Executive Directors' appointments are terminated by Unilever. The Non-Executive Directors may terminate their engagement upon three months' notice. Except in exceptional circumstances, the Board will not propose Non-Executive Directors for re-nomination when nine years have elapsed since the date of their appointment. Letters of appointment are available for inspection on request from the Group Secretary.\n\nIn considering appointments to the Board, the Directors and Unilever give due consideration to the time commitment required to fulfil the role appropriately.",

Attendance is expressed as the number of meetings attended out of the number eligible to attend.\n\nThe Committee is comprised of five Non-Executive Directors, including Andrea Jung as the Chair. Ruby Lu stepped down from the Committee at the AGM in May 2023 and was replaced by Judith Hartmann. Ian Meakins joined the Committee on 1 December 2023, although there were not any Committee meetings between then and 31 December 2023. Ian attended a Committee meeting in November 2023 to observe as part of his onboarding. Nils Andersen and Judith Hartmann will step down from the Committee when they retire from Unilever's Board at the AGM in May 2024.\n\nOther attendees at Committee meetings in 2023 included the CEO, Chief Legal Officer & Group Secretary, Chief Counsel Executive Compensation & Employment, Chief Employment Law Counsel, Chief People & Transformation Officer, Head of Expertise & Innovation, Chief R&D Officer, Chief Sustainability Officer, Global Head of Sustainable Business Performance & Reporting, Global Head of Sustainability Compass & Markets, Deputy Chief Financial Officer & Controller, and advisers to the Committee (see below).\n\nNo individual Executive Director was present when their own remuneration was being determined to ensure there was no conflict of interest. The Committee has separately sought and obtained Executive Directors' own views when determining the amount and structure of their remuneration before recommending individual packages to the Board for approval.\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe Committee reviews and makes a proposal to the Board on the remuneration of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors. It also has responsibility for the design and terms of Executive and all employee share-based incentive plans and the remuneration policy for the ULE and senior managers. The Committee is also involved in the performance evaluation and remuneration of the ULE.\n\nThe Committee's terms of reference are contained within 'The Governance of Unilever' which is available on our website.\n\nAs part of the Board evaluation carried out in 2023, the Board evaluated the performance of the Committee. The Committee also carried out an assessment of its own performance in 2023. Overall, the Committee members concluded that the Committee is performing effectively.\n\n## Activities of the Committee\n\nDuring 2023, the Committee met six times and its activities included:\n\n- \u25a0 determining the 2022 annual bonus outcome;\n- \u25a0 determining the vesting of the MCIP awards for the CEO, CFO and the ULE;\n- \u25a0 consultation with investors in respect of the directors' remuneration report vote at the 2023 AGM and renewal of the Directors' Remuneration Policy;\n- \u25a0 considering and approving the proposed New Remuneration Policy;\n- \u25a0 setting the 2023 annual bonus and Performance Share Plan (PSP) 2023-2025 performance measures and targets;\n- \u25a0 setting fixed pay for the CEO and CFO;\n- \u25a0 tracking external developments and assessing their impact on Unilever's Remuneration Policy and its implementation, in particular in the context of geopolitical tensions, inflation, and regulatory requirements;\n- \u25a0 retirement of CFO and CFO succession planning;\n- \u25a0 approving introduction of a Recovery Policy to comply with New York Stock Exchange listing requirements;\n- \u25a0 reviewing pay gap data;\n- \u25a0 considering progress on the living wage commitment that is now extended to the wider supply chain; and\n- \u25a0 assessing SPI performance outcomes and setting measures and targets along with the Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC).\n\n## Advisers\n\nWhile it is the Committee's responsibility to exercise independent judgement, the Committee requests advice from management and professional advisers, as appropriate, to ensure that its decisions are fully informed given the internal and external environment.\n\nFiona Camenzuli of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) was appointed by the Committee to provide independent advice on various matters it considered. During 2023, the wider PwC network firms have also provided other tax and consultancy services to Unilever including tax compliance and other taxrelated services, cyber security services, internal audit advice, secondees, third-party risk and compliance advice, and merger and acquisition support. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK, which is available online at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com (Code of Conduct: Executive Remuneration Consulting).\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that the advice of the PwC engagement partner and team, which provide remuneration advice to the Committee, was objective and independent. They do not have connections with Unilever that might impair their independence. The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts. The fees paid to PwC in relation to advice provided to the Committee in the year to 31 December 2023 were \u00a3277,557. This figure is calculated based on time spent and expenses incurred for the majority of advice provided, but on occasion, for specific projects, a fixed fee may be agreed.",

Changes to the implementation of the policy from 2024 are set out in the proposed New Remuneration Policy on pages 119 to 127 and will be implemented if it receives shareholder approval at the 2024 AGM.\n\nUnilever's remuneration arrangements are aligned to its culture of rewarding performance through annual bonus and long-term incentive performance measures and remuneration is determined throughout Unilever based on the same principle as for the Executive Directors, as set out in the Remuneration Policy. Remuneration is controlled with pay at risk determined according to pre-determined performance measures with a maximum outcome. This results in predictability in the management of risks and costs. Executive remuneration is proportionate given the financial size and complexity of Unilever as determined through benchmarking with our peers. Unilever's arrangements provide for clarity and simplicity by consisting of fixed pay, benefits, annual bonus and long-term incentives, which are transparently detailed in the Remuneration Policy and the relevant directors' remuneration report.\n\n## Implementation of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors\n\nIf approved by shareholders, Unilever's proposed New Remuneration Policy, as set out below, will be implemented with effect from the 2024 AGM. If the proposed New Remuneration Policy is not approved, Unilever's existing Remuneration Policy will continue to apply.\n\nAlan Jope is treated as CEO from 1 January to 30 June 2023 and Hein Schumacher is treated as CEO from 1 June to 31 December 2023, given he performed the role of CEO Designate from 1 June 2023 and became CEO on 1 July 2023.\n\nRemuneration for the CFO for 2023 refers to Graeme Pitkethly.

As such, the Committee believes that the target range of a threshold of 3% and a maximum of 6% to be appropriate. The Committee have set the payout for threshold at 50% of par for USG to reflect the level of stretch required, and that no payout is considered appropriate for performance below this level.\n\nRelative TSR aligns remuneration with shareholders' experience and allows us to measure relative performance. The proposed vesting schedule is in line with UK norms, with threshold vesting (50% of par) for median performance (Unilever ranked 10th), rising to maximum vesting (200% of par) for upper quartile performance (Unilever ranked 5th). The TSR peer group consists of: Beiersdorf, Church & Dwight, Coca-Cola, ColgatePalmolive, Danone, Est\u00e9e Lauder, General Mills, Haleon, Henkel, Kenvue, Kimberly-Clark, Kraft Heinz, L'Or\u00e9al, Mondel\u0113z, Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo, Procter and Gamble, and Reckitt Benckiser.\n\nUnderlying ROIC measures the return generated on capital invested by the Group and is calculated as underlying operating profit after tax divided by the annual average of: goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, net assets held for sale, inventories, trade and other current receivables, and trade payables and other current liabilities. Underlying ROIC will be calculated over a three-year average. The target range of a threshold of 15.5% and maximum of 17.5% expresses our commitment to deliver underlying ROIC at a level of mid to high teens, whilst continuing to reshape our portfolio through acquisitions and disposals.\n\nThe SPI is an assessment made jointly by the CRC and the Committee. The 2024-26 SPI will be evaluated on progress against four core metrics, rather than the eight metrics used for the previous PSP schemes. Targets will be set for a three-year period and disclosed prospectively. KPIs will be subject to external review, or internal review where this is not possible. Each KPI will be subject to formulaic assessment, whilst retaining the ability to make a rounded assessment of overall progress. The SPI KPIs for the 2024-2026 PSP will be as follows with a threshold of 0% and maximum of 200%:\n\n- (a) Climate: The percentage change in greenhouse gas emissions from energy and refrigerant use in our operations, in comparison to the same period in 2015. Target: 80% (threshold 79%, maximum 81%).\n- (b) Plastics: The percentage change in the total tonnes of virgin plastics used in the packaging for our products, in comparison to the same period in 2019. Target: 30% (threshold 28%, maximum 32%).\n- (c) Nature: The total hectares of land, forests, and oceans (as measured by ocean floor area) that Unilever programmes help protect and/or regenerate. Target: 1 million hectares (threshold 900,000 hectares, maximum 1.1 million hectares).\n- (d) Living wage: the percentage of our procurement spend which is with suppliers who have signed the Living Wage Promise. Target: 50% (threshold 45%, maximum 55%).\n\nFor in-flight PSP schemes (PSP 2022-2024 and PSP 2023-2025), there will continue to be annual SPI KPIs and targets with outcomes based on in-year results. The overall outcome will be an average of each annual score, and disclosed in the directors' remuneration reports for 2024 and 2025 as applicable.\n\nIn addition to the three elements mentioned above, our Executive Directors are provided with non-monetary benefits. These include medical insurance cover, actual tax return preparation costs and provision of death-in-service benefits and administration.",

Further detail on the SPI outcome is set out below.\n\n## Outcome of SPI for MCIP cycle 2020-2023 and PSP 2021-2023 (Unaudited):\n\nThe SPI is an assessment of the business's sustainability performance by the CRC and the Committee that captures quantitative and qualitative elements. The CRC and the Committee agree on an SPI achievement level against the SPI metrics, taking into account performance across all the targets in each of the eight sustainability pillars. Please note the changes to SPI for performance periods from 1 January 2024, as set out on page 131.\n\nThe 2023 SPI performance is set out on page 137. The SPI index for the MCIP and PSP performance period is calculated by taking a simple average and is set out at the bottom of the table for MCIP 2020-2023 and PSP 2021-2023. From 2022, the SPI indicators are based on progress made against Unilever's sustainability goals, as 2021 marked the final year of reporting against the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan (USLP). Therefore, the performance years 2020 and 2021 for MCIP 2020-2023 and performance year 2021 for PSP 2021-2023 is based on the USLP and the outcome for the remaining performance years is based on Unilever sustainability goals. For the first time, SPI 2023 includes two metrics (Positive Nutrition and Health & Wellbeing) that are evaluated on 'in-year' progress i.e. progress in 2023, rather than year-in-arrears.",

Incoming Executive Directors will be required to retain all shares vesting from any share awards made since their appointment (after deduction of tax) until their minimum shareholding requirements have been met in full. If Executive Directors fail to achieve 100% of the shareholding requirement by the relevant time, they are not permitted to sell any Unilever shares and Unilever retains the right to block the sale of their shares until the required level of shareholding has been obtained.\n\nThe table below shows the Executive Directors' share ownership against the minimum shareholding requirements as at 31 December 2023 and the interest in PLC ordinary shares of the Executive Directors and their connected persons as at 31 December 2023.\n\nWhen calculating an Executive Director's personal shareholding, the following methodology is used:\n\n- \u25a0 fixed pay at the date of measurement;\n- \u25a0 shares in PLC will qualify provided they are personally owned by the Executive Director, by a member of their immediate family or by certain corporate bodies, trusts or partnerships, as required by law from time to time (each a 'connected person');\n- \u25a0 shares purchased under the legacy MCIP, whether from the annual bonus or otherwise, will qualify as from the moment of purchase as these are held in the individual's name and are not subject to further restrictions;\n- \u25a0 shares or entitlements to shares that are subject only to the Executive Director remaining in employment will qualify on a net of tax basis (including deferred bonus awards);\n- \u25a0 shares awarded on a conditional basis will not qualify until the moment of vesting (i.e. once the precise number of shares is fixed after the vesting period has elapsed); and\n- \u25a0 the shares will be valued on the date of measurement or, if that outcome fails the personal shareholding test, on the date of acquisition.\n\nThe share price for the relevant measurement date will be based on the average closing share prices and the euro/sterling/US dollar exchange rates from the 60 calendar days prior to the measurement date.\n\nExecutive Directors are required to maintain at least 100% of their minimum shareholding requirement for two years after leaving (or if less, their actual shareholding on the date of leaving). ULE members are required to build a shareholding of 400% of fixed pay (500% for the CEO). This requirement is 250% of fixed pay for the management layer below ULE.\n\nExecutive Directors' shareholdings are ring-fenced to ensure they meet the minimum shareholding requirement, including for two years after leaving employment. This means that even if the shares are vested, they are blocked until the end of the minimum shareholding requirement period (excluding any shares above the minimum shareholding requirement).\n\n## Executive Directors' and their connected persons' interests in shares and share ownership (Audited)\n\n|                           | Share ownership  guideline as % of  fixed pay (as at  31 December   | Have guidelines  been met (as at   | Actual share  ownership as a %  of fixed pay (as  at 31 December  (a)   | Shares held as at 1 January 2023   | Shares held as at 1 January 2023   | Shares held as at 31 December 2023 (b)   | Shares held as at 31 December 2023 (b)   |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                           | 2023)                                                               | 31 December  2023)                 | 2023)                                                                   | PLC                                | PLC ADS                            | PLC                                      | PLC ADS                                  |\n| CEO: Alan Jope            | 500%                                                                | Yes                                | 901%                                                                    | 55,271                             | 237,881                            | 79,608                                   | 238,362                                  |\n| CEO: Hein  Schumacher (c) | 500%                                                                | No                                 | 13%                                                                     | -                                  | -                                  | 5,491                                    | -                                        |\n| CFO: Graeme Pitkethly     | 400%                                                                | Yes                                | 811%                                                                    | 206,108                            |                                    | 229,128                                  | -                                        |\n\nDuring the period between 1 January and 22 February 2024, the following changes in interests have occurred:\n\n- \u25a0 Graeme Pitkethly purchased 6 PLC shares under the Unilever PLC ShareBuy Plan: 3 on 9 January 2024 at a share price of \u00a338.34, and a further 3 on 8 February 2024 at a share price of \u00a340.14; and\n- \u25a0 as detailed on page 135 for Alan Jope and Graeme Pitkethly and page 140 for Hein Schumacher, on 15 February 2024:\n- \u25a0 Alan Jope acquired 20,924 PLC EUR shares following the vesting of his 2020 MCIP award;\n- \u25a0 Hein Schumacher acquired 2,621 PLC GBP shares following the vesting of his cash buy-out award; and\n- \u25a0 Graeme Pitkethly acquired 12,581 PLC GBP shares following the vesting of his 2020 MCIP award.\n\nEffective as of 1 January 2024, Fernando Fernandez was appointed as CFO replacing Graeme Pitkethly, who remained as CFO until 31 December 2023. As at 22 February 2024, Fernando Fernandez holds 84,496 PLC EUR shares and 190,072 PLC GBP shares.\n\nThe voting rights of the Directors (Executive and Non-Executive) and members of the ULE who hold interests in the share capital of PLC are the same as for other holders of the class of shares indicated. As at 22 February 2024, none of the Directors' (Executive and Non-Executive) or other ULE members' shareholdings amounted to more than 1% of the issued shares in that class of share (except Nelson Peltz who owns 1.5% of the PLC issued share capital including via Trian Fund Management as a connected person).

The Compensation Committee approved the remuneration package, as described in this section, which came into effect from 1 January 2024. His remuneration package is in accordance with the approved Remuneration Policy.\n\nFernando's fixed pay has been set at \u20ac1,175,000 per annum. Fernando is eligible to receive a discretionary annual bonus with target opportunity set at 120% of fixed pay (maximum 180% fixed pay). 50% of any net annual bonus will be deferred into Unilever shares for three years. Further details on the annual bonus (including performance measures) are set out on page 130. From 1 January 2024, Fernando is also eligible for an annual PSP award of 160% of fixed pay at target (320% fixed pay maximum) that will vest to the extent performance conditions are achieved, followed by an additional two-year holding period. Further details on the PSP 2024-2026, including performance conditions, are set out on page 131.\n\nFernando will receive benefits under the approved Remuneration Policy, including tax preparation fees, medical insurance cover and death-in-service benefits. He will also receive a relocation allowance in 2024 and 2025 to support his move to the UK (plus housing costs for up to six months).

Until the Retirement Date, Graeme will remain an employee of Unilever.\n\nOn this basis, and in accordance with his service agreement and our Remuneration Policy, Graeme:\n\n- \u25a0 will continue to receive fixed pay up to the Retirement Date;\n- \u25a0 remains eligible to receive a discretionary bonus of up to 180% fixed pay in respect of the 2023 financial year (as detailed on page 134) with 50% of the net annual bonus deferred into shares with a three-year holding period in accordance with the Remuneration Policy;\n- \u25a0 remains eligible for vesting of his 2020-2023 MCIP and 2021-2023 PSP awards, as outlined on pages 135 and 136;\n- \u25a0 will be treated as a good leaver on retirement under the PSP long-term share incentive plans, meaning that his outstanding awards will remain capable of vesting in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan on its vesting date, subject to Company performance. PSP awards will remain subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period and MCIP awards remain subject to a one-year post-vesting holding period;\n- \u25a0 will continue to be eligible for vesting and release of any annual bonus deferral shares in accordance with their terms; and\n- \u25a0 will continue to receive contractual benefits through to the Retirement Date, including annual leave, medical insurance cover, death-in-service benefits and tax return preparation services (in respect of all Unilever source income).\n\nDetails of all payments made to and received by Graeme will be disclosed on the Company's website and in the Directors' remuneration reports as required going forward.\n\n## Implementation of the Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors (Audited)\n\nAs explained in the Chair letter on page 118, the Committee reviewed Non-Executive Director fees in January 2024 and determined there would be no increase for 2024 given the fees are in line with market and the recent fee increase in 2023. The Committee will continue to keep Non-Executive Director fees under regular review.\n\nNon-Executive Director fees are set and paid in GBP.

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report\n\n## Other disclosures related to Directors' remuneration (Unaudited)\n\nUnilever regularly looks at pay ratios throughout the Group, and the pay ratio between each work level (WL in the table below), and we have disclosed this for a number of years. The table below provides a detailed breakdown of the fixed and variable pay elements for each of our UK work levels, showing how each work level compares to the CEO and CFO in 2023 (with equivalent figures from 2022 included for comparison purposes). For the purposes of the CEO, the data is the total of fixed pay and variable pay for Alan Jope and Hein Schumacher, as set out in the single figure table for Executive Directors on page 132. Figures for the CFO are calculated using the applicable data for Graeme Pitkethly from the single figure table.\n\n## CEO/CFO Pay Ratio Comparison (split by fixed pay and benefits)/variable pay)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe year-on-year comparison reflects an increase in fixed pay for the Executive Directors in 2023 following a pay increase for Graeme Pitkethly as CFO from 1 January 2023 and a higher fixed pay on the appointment of Hein Schumacher as CEO from 1 July 2023. Also, fixed pay for Alan Jope and Hein Schumacher are both counted for June 2023. Benefit costs increased for CEO due to the inclusion of Hein Schumacher's relocation and a slight increase for the CFO due to higher benefit costs and legal fees. The proportion of variable pay for CEO is lower in 2023 than 2022 because of the lower annual bonus outcome compared to 2022. Also, Hein Schumacher is not eligible for MCIP 2020-2023 and PSP 2021-2023 as he was appointed on 1 June 2023. Therefore, Hein's variable pay includes his buy-out share awards only and Alan Jope's MCIP and PSP awards are not included for the purposes of the single figure table (as they are set out in the payment on loss of office table on page 144). Executive Directors have a higher weighting on performance-related pay compared to other employees. The numbers are further impacted by fluctuation in the exchange rates used to convert pay elements denominated in pounds sterling to euros for reporting purposes. Where relevant, amounts for 2022 have been translated using the average exchange rate over 2022 (\u20ac1 = \u00a30.8510), and amounts for 2023 have been translated using the average exchange rate over 2023 (\u20ac1 = \u00a30.8700).\n\nAnnual bonus and LTI for the UK employees were not calculated following the statutory method for single figure pay. Instead, variable pay figures were calculated using:\n\n- \u25a0 target annual bonus values considered for the respective year;\n- \u25a0 MCIP values calculated at an appropriate average for the relevant work level of employees, i.e. an average 20% investment of bonus for WL2 employees; 45% for WL3 employees; 60% for WL4-5 employees; and 100% for WL6 employees; and\n- \u25a0 PSP values calculated at target for the relevant work level of employees, i.e. 50% of target bonus for WL2 employees; 100% of target bonus for WL3-6 employees.\n\nFixed pay figures reflect all elements of pay (including allowances) and benefits paid in cash. The data disclosed excludes employees who are not integrated into Unilever's global reward structure and human resources information system.",

Figures are calculated by reference to 31 December 2023 (full-time equivalent), and the respective salary and pay and benefits figures for each quartile are set out in the table above. Benefits for UK employees include any pension, but pension is excluded for Executive Directors as they are not entitled to pension benefits under the Remuneration Policy. The data disclosed excludes employees who are not integrated into Unilever's global reward structure and human resources information system.\n\nVariable pay figures for the UK employees are calculated on the basis set out in the paragraph for other work levels below the 'CEO/CFO pay ratio comparison' table on page 149. The reason for this is it would be unduly onerous to recalculate these figures when, based on a sample, the impact of such recalculation is expected to be minimal.\n\nThe mean pay ratio has slightly increased in 2023 due to a higher fixed pay on the appointment of Hein Schumacher as CEO from 1 July 2023. Also, fixed pay and annual bonus for Alan Jope and Hein Schumacher are both counted for June 2023. Benefit costs increased for CEO due to the inclusion of Hein Schumacher's relocation. The annual bonus outcome was higher in 2023 than 2022 and variable pay makes up a higher proportion of remuneration for the CEO compared to other employees. The pay, reward and progression policies within Unilever are consistent as the Remuneration Policy is applicable across our 15,000+ managers throughout the whole business worldwide.\n\nWe are also required to show additional disclosures on the rates of change in pay year-on-year. The pay ratios set out above are more meaningful as they compare to the pay of all of our UK employees. By contrast, the regulations require us to show the percentages below based on employees of our PLC top company only, which forms a relatively small and unrepresentative proportion of our total UK workforce. So, whilst operationally we may pay greater attention to our internal pay ratios (included above in the 'CEO/CFO pay ratio comparison' table on page 149), these required figures are set out on page 151.",

The Directors are also required by the UK Companies Act 2006 to prepare accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Unilever Group and PLC as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss and cash flows for that year.\n\nThe Directors consider that, in preparing the accounts, the Group and PLC have used the most appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and that all international financial reporting standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and UK-adopted international accounting standards, which they consider to be applicable have been followed. In accordance with Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule ('DTR') 4.1.16R, the financial statements will form part of the annual financial report prepared under Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule ('DTR') 4.1.17R and 4.1.18R. The auditor's report on these financial statements provides no assurance over whether the annual financial report has been prepared in accordance with those requirements. The Directors are also responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts including the consolidated financial statements in the European single electronic format in accordance with the requirements as set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 with regard to regulatory technical standards on the specification of a single electronic reporting format.\n\nThe Directors have responsibility for ensuring that PLC keep accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy their financial position and which enable the Directors to ensure that the accounts comply with all relevant legislation. They are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have a general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group, and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.\n\nThis statement, which should be read in conjunction with the Independent Auditor's Report, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the Directors and of the auditors in relation to the accounts.\n\nA copy of the financial statements of the Unilever Group is placed on our website at www.unilever.com/investorrelations. The maintenance and integrity of the website are the responsibility of the Directors, and the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters. Accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially placed on the website. Legislation in the UK and the Netherlands governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\n## Independent auditors and disclosure of information to auditors\n\nUK law sets out additional responsibilities for the Directors of PLC regarding disclosure of information to auditors. To the best of each of the Directors' knowledge and belief, and having made appropriate enquiries, all information relevant to enabling the auditors to provide their opinions on PLC's consolidated and parent company accounts has been provided. Each of the Directors has taken all reasonable steps to ensure their awareness of any relevant audit information and to establish that Unilever PLC's auditors are aware of any such information.\n\n## Directors' responsibility statement\n\nUnder company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and of the Group's profit or loss for that period.\n\nUnder applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors' Report, Directors' Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.\n\nEach of the Directors confirms that, to the best of his or her knowledge:\n\n- \u25a0 The Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2023, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's position and performance, business model and strategy;\n- \u25a0 The financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and UKadopted international accounting standards give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and\n- \u25a0 The Management Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of PLC and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nThe Directors and their roles are listed on pages 84 to 85.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe activities of the Group, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance, the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described on pages 1 to 64. In addition, we describe in notes 15 to 18 on pages 203 to 218 the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities, and its exposures to credit and liquidity risk. Although not assessed over the same period as going concern, the viability of the Group has been assessed on page 79.\n\nThe Group has considerable financial resources together with established business relationships with many customers and suppliers in countries throughout the world. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.\n\nAfter making enquiries, the Directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing this Annual Report and Accounts.\n\n## Internal and disclosure controls and procedures\n\nPlease refer to pages 71 to 78 for a discussion of Unilever's principal risk factors and to pages 70 to 79 for commentary on the Group's approach to risk management and control.",

Our opinion is unmodified\n\nIn our opinion the financial statements:\n\n- \u25a0 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the Parent Company's affairs as at 31 December 2023, and of the Group's and Parent Company's profit for the year then ended;\n- \u25a0 have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards; and\n- \u25a0 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nWhat our opinion covers\n\nWe have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements of Unilever PLC ('the Company') for the year ended 31 December 2023 (FY23) included in the Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2023, which comprise:\n\n## Group (Unilever PLC and its subsidiaries)\n\n## Parent Company (Unilever PLC)\n\n- \u25a0 Consolidated income statement\n- \u25a0 Consolidated statement of comprehensive income;\n- \u25a0 Consolidated statement of changes in equity;\n- \u25a0 Consolidated balance sheet;\n- \u25a0 Consolidated cash flow statement; and\n- \u25a0 Notes 1 to 27 to the consolidated financial statements, including the accounting information and policies in note 1.\n- \u25a0 Income statement,\n- \u25a0 Statement of comprehensive income;\n- \u25a0 Statement of changes in equity;\n- \u25a0 Balance sheet;\n- \u25a0 Statement of cash flows; and\n- \u25a0 Notes 1 to 15 to the Company Accounts, including the accounting information and policies.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) ('ISAs (UK)') and applicable law. Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion and matters included in this report are consistent with those discussed and included in our reporting to the Audit Committee ('AC').\n\nWe have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.\n\n## 2. Overview of our Audit\n\n## Factors Driving our view of risks\n\nFollowing the conclusion of our FY22 audit, and considering developments affecting the Group since then, we have performed a risk assessment for our FY23 audit.\n\nFY23 continued to be a year marked by high commodity and other input cost inflation affecting many countries the Group operates and sells in. Price increases and the impact on volumes sold, together with the broader impact on margin and operating profit were areas considered during this risk assessment. We continue to have a focus on revenue recognition and the recognition of discounts (which is netted against revenue) as a Key Audit Matter (see 4.1 below).\n\nWe have not observed a change in the risk associated with the Indirect tax contingent liabilities in Brazil, as further discussed in 4.2 below.\n\nThe carrying amount of Investment in subsidiaries held at cost in Unilever PLC's accounts continues to be a material proportion of its total company assets and hence continues to be a Key Audit Matter for Unilever PLC accounts only (see 4.3 below).\n\n| Key Audit Matters                                      | Vs FY22   |   Item |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|\n| Revenue Recognition - Rebates  (Group)                 | \u2194         |    4.1 |\n| Indirect tax contingent liabilities  in Brazil (Group) | \u2194         |    4.2 |\n| Investments in subsidiaries  (PLC only)                | \u2194         |    4.3 |",

(United States of America)) as individually financially significant and subject to full scope audits;\n- \u25a0 12 further components subject to full scope audits, but not individually financially significant;\n- \u25a0 23 components subject to 'audit of specific account balance' to obtain further audit coverage.\n\nCertain Group transactions originate in various countries and are processed in the Group's operating centres in China, India, Mexico, Philippines and Poland. We have established audit teams to perform centralised testing on behalf of our component teams in these locations. We tested the relevant key controls that operate in these operating centres. Other procedures that were performed centrally are set out in more detail in item 7 below.\n\nIn addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components.\n\nWe consider the scope of our audit, as communicated to the Audit Committee, to be an appropriate basis for our audit opinion.\n\n## Coverage of Group financial statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group has set out its targets under its Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) to reduce operational emissions by 100% by 2030; with an interim goal to achieve a 70% reduction by 2025 against a 2015 baseline, to halve the full value chain emissions of its products on a per consumer use basis by 2030 against a 2010 baseline and to achieve net zero emissions covering Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 2039. Detailed information is provided in the Strategic Report on pages 43 to 47 and in the CTAP and TCFD sections on pages 48 to 55.\n\nWhilst the Group has set these targets, in note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Directors have stated that they have considered the impact of climate change risks and identified goodwill and indefinite-life intangibles, property, plant and equipment and defined benefit plan assets as balance sheet line items that could potentially be significantly impacted. They have reviewed these line items in detail and concluded that the impact of climate related risk is immaterial due to mitigation actions taken against those risks. Therefore, they do not believe that there is a material impact on the financial reporting judgements and estimates and as a result the valuations of the Group's assets and liabilities have not been significantly impacted by these risks as at 31 December 2023.\n\nAs a part of our audit, we have performed a risk assessment to determine if the potential impacts of climate change may materially affect the financial statements and our audit. We did this by making inquiries of management and inspecting internal and external reports in order to independently assess the climate-related risks and their potential impact. We held discussions with our own climate change professionals to challenge our risk assessment.\n\nThe most likely potential impact of climate risk and plans on these financial statements would be on the forwardlooking assessments of long-term assets.\n\nWe have considered the sensitivity of the assumptions used in the impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. The outcome of the impairment tests are not considered to be sensitive. As a result of this, and the relative size of other long-term assets which could be impacted by climate change risks, we determined that climate related risks did not have a significant impact on our audit and there is no significant impact of these risks on our Key Audit Matters.\n\nWe have also read the Group's disclosures of climate related information in the Strategic Report and considered consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\n## 3. Going concern, viability and principal risks and uncertainties\n\nThe Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group's and the Parent Company's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\n## Going concern\n\nWe used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group's and Company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that we considered most likely to adversely affect the Group's and the Company's available financial resources over this period were:\n\n- \u25a0 Commodity inflation and pricing\n- \u25a0 Landing Pricing and Volume Sensitivity\n\nWe also considered realistic second order impacts, such as business transformation and portfolio management failure and the loss of all material litigation cases which could result in a rapid reduction of available financial resources. We considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity in the going concern period by assessing the degree of downside assumptions that, individually and collectively, could result in a liquidity issue, taking into account the Group's current and projected cash and facilities and the outcome of their reverse stress testing. We considered whether the going concern disclosure in note 1 to the financial statements gives a full and accurate description of the Directors' assessment of going concern.\n\n## Our conclusions\n\n- \u25a0 We consider that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate;.\n- \u25a0 We have not identified, and concur with the directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;.\n- \u25a0 We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement on page 156 on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Parent Company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure on page 177 and 230 to be acceptable; and\n- \u25a0 The same statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 156 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nHowever, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the Parent Company will continue in operation.",

Going concern, viability and principal risks and uncertainties (continued)\n\nDisclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the directors' disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- \u25a0 the directors' confirmation within the Viability Statement on page 79 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;\n- \u25a0 the Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and how emerging risks are identified and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and\n- \u25a0 the directors' explanation in the Viability Statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nWe are also required to review the Viability Statement set out on page 79 under the Listing Rules.\n\n## 4. Key Audit matters\n\nWhat we mean\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on:\n\n- \u25a0 the overall audit strategy;\n- \u25a0 the allocation of resources in the audit; and\n- \u25a0 directing the efforts of the engagement team.\n\nWe include below the Key Audit Matters in decreasing order of audit significance, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, for the purpose of our audit of the financial statements as a whole. We do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Our reporting\n\nWe have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to these disclosures.\n\nWe have concluded that these disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nOur work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the Group's and Parent Company's longer-term viability.",

The variable consideration represents the portion of discounts that are not directly deducted on the invoice and is complex as a result of diversity in the terms in contractual arrangements with customers. The unsettled portion of the variable consideration results in discounts due to customers at 31 December 2023 ('rebate accrual').\n\nTherefore, there is a risk of revenue being materially misstated as a result of incorrect calculation of the variable consideration.\n\nWithin revenue recognition we identified the off-invoice rebate accrual as a Key Audit Matter, as in a number of markets the off-invoice rebate accrual is significant and the terms in contractual arrangements with customers are not uniform.\n\nThis is considered to be an area which had a significant effect on our overall audit strategy and allocation of resources in planning and completing our audit as significant effort was required in evaluating the contractual arrangements and the related off-invoice rebate accrual.\n\nThere is a risk that revenue may be materially overstated due to fraud through manipulation of the off-invoice rebate accrual recognised resulting from the pressure management may feel to achieve performance targets.\n\n## Communications with the Unilever PLC's Audit Committee\n\nOur discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included:\n\n- \u25a0 Our approach to the audit of rebates including details of planned substantive procedures and the extent of our control reliance\n- \u25a0 A retrospective review on the prior year-end accruals in markets we considered contains higher risk\n- \u25a0 Our conclusions on the appropriateness of the methodology and value of the off-invoice rebate accrual as at year-end\n\n## Areas of particular auditor judgement\n\nWe did not identify any areas of particular auditor judgement.\n\n## Our results\n\nThe results of our testing were satisfactory (FY22: satisfactory) and we considered the rebate accrual disclosures to be acceptable (FY22: acceptable).\n\nFurther information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Report of the Audit Committee on page 107 for details on how the Audit Committee considered revenue recognition as an area of significant attention, page 180 for the accounting policy on revenue recognition, and note 2, 13 and 14 for the financial disclosures.\n\nOur procedures to address the risk included:\n\n- \u25a0 Risk Assessment: We assessed the accuracy of the Group's offinvoice accrual by comparing, for the Group's relevant markets, the prior year off-invoice accrual to actual spend incurred. Where we identified significant differences, we instructed our component audit teams to understand the business rationale. We analysed the results of our comparison in aggregate and over time to identify trends that could suggest management bias in their estimation.\n- \u25a0 Controls: We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the revenue process including controls over the rebate agreements, calculation of the off-invoice rebate accrual and controls over rebate claims. Where control deficiencies were identified, we identified and evaluated and, where relevant, relied upon the compensating controls.\n- \u25a0 Test of Detail: We tested a selection of recorded off-invoice rebate accruals after 31 December 2023 and assessed whether the accrual is recorded in the appropriate period.\n- \u25a0 Test of Detail: We tested a selection of payments made after 31 December 2023 and assessed whether the original accrual was recorded in the appropriate period.\n- \u25a0 Journals: We critically assessed manual journals recorded to revenue to identify unusual or irregular items and obtained underlying documentation for those identified as unusual or irregular.\n- \u25a0 Evaluating Transparency : We evaluated the adequacy of the Group's disclosures in respect of rebate accrual.",

The total amount of the tax assessments received in respect of this matter is \u20ac3,757 million as of 31 December 2023. There also remains the possibility of further material tax assessments related to the same matter for periods not yet assessed.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the indirect tax contingent liabilities in Brazil related to a 2001 corporate reorganisation as a key audit matter. In Brazil, there is a high degree of complexity involved in the local indirect tax regimes (both state and federal) and jurisprudence. Due to these complexities, there is a high degree of judgement applied by the Group with respect to the uncertainty of the outcome of this matter. Complex auditor judgement and specialised skills were required in evaluating the possible future outcomes of investigations by the authorities, for assessments received to ascertain if a liability exists and in evaluating if the exposure of possible material tax assessments related to the same matter for periods not yet assessed can be estimated.\n\n## Communications with the Unilever PLC's Audit Committee\n\nOur discussions with and reporting to the Audit Committee included::\n\n- \u25a0 Our approach to the audit of the indirect tax contingent liabilities in Brazil including details of planned substantive procedures and the extent of our control reliance\n- \u25a0 Our conclusions on the appropriateness of the in-year movements in the related contingent liabilities disclosures\n- \u25a0 The adequacy of the disclosure of the contingent liabilities disclosed related to the Brazil indirect tax dispute\n\n## Areas of particular auditor judgement\n\nWe identified the following as the areas of particular auditor judgement:\n\n- \u25a0 The assessment of the outcome of investigations by the authorities, if a liability exists and in making an estimate of any economic outflows.\n\n## Our results\n\nThe results of our testing were satisfactory (FY22: satisfactory) and we considered the Brazilian indirect tax contingent liability disclosures to be acceptable (FY22: acceptable).\n\nFurther information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See the Report of the Audit Committee on page 107 for details on how the Audit Committee considered indirect tax provisions and contingent liabilities as an area of significant attention, page 219 and 220 for the accounting policy on provisions and contingent liabilities respectively, and note 19 and 20 for the financial disclosures.\n\nOur procedures to address the risk included:\n\n- \u25a0 Controls: We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the indirect tax process including controls related to the assessment of the outcome of investigations if a liability exists and around evaluating exposure to possible material tax assessments for periods not yet assessed.\n- \u25a0 Our Tax Expertise: We involved local indirect tax professionals with specialised skills and knowledge who assisted in:\n- \u25a0 assessing the appropriateness of the classification as contingent liabilities compared to the nature of the exposures, applicable regulations and related correspondence with the tax authorities; and\n- \u25a0 assessing the confirmation received from the Group's external lawyers, considering any impact of legal precedent, case law and any historical and recent judgements passed by the court authorities which could impact likelihood of outflow of economic resources.\n- \u25a0 Retrospective review: We inspected assessments received from tax authorities and compared their consistency, occurrence and amounts retrospectively over time to previous management estimates made in the periods this matter was not yet assessed .\n- \u25a0 Evaluating Transparency : We evaluated the adequacy of the Group's disclosures in respect of indirect tax contingent liabilities in Brazil.",

For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and  regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently  limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. In addition, as with any audit, there remained a  higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,  misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material  misstatement.  We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect  non-compliance with all laws and regulations. |",

We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative considerations to help us determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our procedures, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in the aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## \u20ac450m\n\n(FY22: \u20ac380m) Materiality for the Group Financial Statements as a whole\n\n## \u20ac337m\n\n## (FY22: \u20ac285m) Performance materiality\n\n## \u20ac22m\n\n(FY22: \u20ac20m) Audit misstatement posting threshold\n\n## What we mean\n\nA quantitative reference for the purpose of planning and performing our audit.\n\n## Basis for determining materiality and judgements applied\n\nMateriality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at \u20ac450m (FY22: \u20ac380m). This was determined with reference to a benchmark of Group's normalised PBTCO.\n\nConsistent with FY22, we determined that Group's normalised PBTCO remains the main benchmark for the Group. We consider profit before tax, excluding certain identified items, as a key indicator of performance and the basis for earnings, and therefore the primary focus of a reasonable investor. We have inspected analyst consensus data and other investor commentary for signals of alternate significant influencers of economic decisions. No revisions to our calculation methodology resulted therefrom.\n\nTo reflect the Group's normalised PBTCO, we have normalised the profit before tax benchmark by excluding the one-off profit from the sale of the Suave brand and the one-off loss from the sale of Dollar Shave Club brand.\n\nOur Group materiality of \u20ac450m was determined by applying a percentage to the Group's normalised PBTCO. When using a benchmark of Group's normalised PBTCO to determine overall materiality, KPMG's approach for public interest entities considers a guideline range of up to 5% of the measure. In setting Group materiality at planning, we determined materiality using the forecast of Group's normalised PBTCO. This represents 5.06% (FY22: 4.8%) of the final Group's normalised PBTCO value. We considered the materiality amount for the financial statements as a whole and concluded that it remained appropriate.\n\nMateriality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a3295m (FY22: \u00a3296m), determined with reference to a benchmark of Parent Company total assets,of which it represents 0.4% (FY22: 0.4%).\n\n## What we mean\n\nOur procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## Basis for determining performance materiality and judgements applied\n\nWe have considered performance materiality at a level of 75% (FY22: 75%) of materiality for Group financial statements as a whole to be appropriate.\n\nThe Parent Company performance materiality was set at \u00a3221m (FY22: \u00a3222m), which equates to 75% (FY22: 75%) of materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality because we did not identify any factors indicating an elevated level of risk.\n\n## What we mean\n\nThis is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial from a quantitative point of view. We may become aware of misstatements below this threshold which could alter the nature, timing and scope of our audit procedures, for example if we identify smaller misstatements which are indicators of fraud.\n\nThis is also the amount above which all misstatements identified are communicated to Unilever PLC's Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for determining the audit misstatement posting threshold and judgements applied\n\nWe set our audit misstatement posting threshold at 5% (FY22: 5%) of our materiality for the Group financial statements. We also report to the Audit Committee any other identified misstatements that warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nThe overall materiality for the Group financial statements of \u20ac450m (FY22: \u20ac380m) compares as follows to the main financial statement caption amounts:\n\n|                                    |          |          | Group profit before tax (normalised)   | Group profit before tax (normalised)   | Total Group Assets   | Total Group Assets   |\n|------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                    | FY23     | FY22     | FY23                                   | FY22                                   | FY23                 | FY22                 |\n| Financial statement  Caption       | \u20ac59,604m | \u20ac60,073m | \u20ac8,897m                                | \u20ac8,034m                                | \u20ac75,266m             | \u20ac 77,821m            |\n| Group Materiality as %  of caption | 0.75%    | 0.63%    | 5.06%                                  | 4.73%                                  | 0.60%                | 0.49%                |",

The scope of our Audit\n\n## Group scope\n\n## What we mean\n\nHow the Group audit team determined the procedures to be performed across the Group.\n\nThe Group operates through a significant number of legal entities and these form reporting components for Group reporting purposes. These are primarily country based. In order to determine the work performed at the reporting component level, we identified those components which we considered to be of individual financial significance, those which were significant due to risk and those remaining components on which we required procedures to be performed to provide us with the evidence we required in order to conclude on the group financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe determined individually financially significant components as those contributing at least 10% (FY22: 10%) of revenue. We selected revenue because these are the most representative of the relative size of the components. We performed full scope audits on individually financially significant components, which contributed 27% (FY22: 26%) of total Group revenue.\n\nTo provide sufficient coverage over the Group's Key Audit Matters, we performed audits of 14 components (FY22: 14), which are included within 'Full scope audit' below, as well as audit of one or more account balances, including revenue, related accounts receivables and cash, at a further 23 components (FY22: 23), which are included within 'Audit of one or more account balances' below. The latter were not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for group reporting purposes but were included in the scope of our group reporting work in order to provide additional coverage.\n\n| Scope                                   | Number of  components   | Range of  materiality  applied   | Group revenue   | Total profits and  loses that made  up Group PBT   | Group total  assets   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Full scope audit                        | 14 (14)                 | \u20ac6m - \u20ac352m (\u20ac6m - \u20ac348m)        | 54% (53%)       | 32% (54%)                                          | 71% (70%)             |\n| Audit of one or  more account  balances | 23  (23)                | \u20ac2m - \u20ac200m (\u20ac4m - \u20ac150m)        | 23% (23%)       | 38% (17%)                                          | 10% (10%)             |\n| Total                                   | 37 (37)                 |                                  | 77% (76%)       | 70% (71%)                                          | 81% (80%)             |\n\nThe Group operates centralised operating centres that are relevant to our audit in India, Mexico, Poland, Philippines and China. These operating centres perform accounting and reporting activities alongside related controls. Together, these operating centres process a substantial portion of the Group's transactions. The outputs from the centralised operating centres are included in the financial information of the reporting components they service and therefore they are not separate reporting components. Each of the operating centres is subject to specified audit procedures. Further audit procedures are performed at each reporting component to cover matters not covered at the centralised operating centres and together this results in audits for group reporting purposes on those reporting components. We have also performed audit procedures centrally across the Group, in the following areas:\n\n- \u25a0 Consolidation of the financial information;\n- \u25a0 Testing of IT systems and configurations;\n- \u25a0 Journal entry analysis;\n- \u25a0 Using technology to perform a 4-way sales match over invoices (3-way invoice to order and delivery document, plus on-invoice rebate deductions) to verify the accuracy and timeliness of revenue recorded;\n- \u25a0 For some components, using technology to perform a line-by-line analysis of the unwind of prior year rebate accruals to retrospectively test accuracy and identify risks for some countries;\n- \u25a0 Indefinite life intangibles (trademarks) and goodwill impairment testing;\n- \u25a0 Items excluded from Group PBTCO;\n- \u25a0 Certain uncertain tax positions;\n- \u25a0 Actuarial assumptions to determine the Group's Defined Benefit Obligations;\n- \u25a0 Climate considerations and impact on the financial statements.\n\nThe Group team communicated, to the component teams, the results of certain audit procedures performed centrally but relevant to component teams.\n\nIn addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components.\n\nNone of the out-of-scope entities individually represented more than 2% total Group revenue or total Group assets, or more than 5% of total profits and losses making up Group profit before taxation.\n\n## Impact of controls on our Group audit\n\nUnilever relies on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting at the Group level, in various shared services centres ('operating centres') and at country level, and operates both automated and manual controls.\n\nWe identified a number of key finance IT systems relevant to our Group audit including the main ERP finance system, the consolidation system, and other specific IT systems that support automated controls across the Group. The majority of these finance IT systems are maintained centrally and are used by many of the 37 in scope components. Our central IT auditors assisted us in evaluating general IT controls for these systems, as well as automated controls and system generated reports relied upon by management in financial reporting. For finance IT systems, automated controls and system generated reports maintained at country level, our country IT auditors assisted component auditors in their evaluation.\n\nOur central testing audit teams evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of key manual process level controls in the Group's central operating centres. Component auditors further evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of key manual controls that operate at country level to address specific local financial reporting risks that could impact the group audit opinion. This controls testing covered the key transactional processes of the Group. Results from all testing were communicated to the group audit team and considered as part of our audit.\n\nAt the Group level, we evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of key controls in processes operated centrally at the Group.",

The scope of our Audit (continued)\n\n## Impact of the above on our audit:\n\n- \u25a0 In the majority of audit areas, we relied on general IT controls, automated controls and manual controls in determining our audit approach.\n- \u25a0 We identified some control deficiencies during the audit, however, for the majority of control deficiencies identified, compensating controls were identified and evaluated and, where relevant, relied upon.\n- \u25a0 The control deficiencies identified did not lead to significant changes to our planned audit approach.\n\n## Scope of Parent Company audit\n\nFor the audit of the Unilever PLC company financial statements, the scope of the audit work performed was mainly substantive due to its profile of being a holding company.\n\n## What we mean\n\nThe extent of the Group audit team's involvement in component audits.\n\nAs part of determining the scope and preparing our audit plan and strategy, the Group audit team held various meetings with our component auditors across the world to discuss key audit risks and obtain input from component teams.\n\n## Instructions\n\nThe Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back.\n\nThe Group audit team allocated component's materiality and approved the statutory materiality when components used it for reporting purposes, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the components.\n\nThe group audit team also releases audit notices on a regular basis (as needed) to component audit teams to provide continuous updates regarding the overall audit.\n\n## Virtual meetings and calls\n\nThe Group audit team held regular virtual meetings with the component auditors in key locations and majority of the other locations in scope for group reporting. These meetings were held to understand the business, any updates to the risk assessment and any issues and findings. The findings reported to the Group audit team were discussed in more detail with component auditors and any further work required by the Group audit team was then performed by the component auditors.\n\n## Global conferences\n\nThe Group team hosted two virtual conferences in May and September 2023. These conferences emphasised key areas of the group audit instructions and allowed for the sharing of risk assessment considerations and group updates, and allowed the group team to enhance our understanding of the component audits and two-way communication.\n\n- \u25a0 In May, the conference covered key group developments, the origins of risk and key messages regarding independence, data analytics, controls and group team's involvement with components.\n- \u25a0 In September, the Group audit team held a virtual conference to provide a further update on risk assessment, the Group's year-to-date results, reminders for controls reporting and an overview of data and analytics tools used in the Unilever audit.\n\n## Site visits\n\nThe Group audit team visited the following component teams during the year:\n\n- \u25a0 Operating Centres: India, Mexico, Poland\n- \u25a0 Other component auditors: China, Egypt, Germany, India, Mexico, Poland, United Kingdom, United States and Vietnam and conducted a virtual site visit to Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Indonesia, Netherlands, Nigeria, Philippines, South Africa and Thailand.\n\n## Review of work papers\n\nThe Group audit team also inspected selections of the component team's key work papers related to significant risks and assessed the appropriateness of conclusions and consistencies between reported findings and work performed.\n\nWe deem our oversight of component auditors was appropriate.\n\n## Group Audit team oversight",

Respective responsibilities\n\n## Directors' responsibilities\n\nAs explained more fully in their statement set out on page 156, the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In addition, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor's report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.\n\nThe Company is required to include these financial statements in an annual financial report prepared under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules ('DTR') 4.1.17R and 4.1.18R.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Unilever Group Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Unilever Group\n\n## 1. Accounting information and policies\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nGroup companies included in the consolidated financial statements for 2023 are PLC and all subsidiary undertakings, which are those entities controlled by PLC. Control exists when the Group has the power to direct the activities of an entity so as to affect the return on investment.\n\nThe net assets and results of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control.\n\nThe results of disposed businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements up to their date of disposal, being the date control ceases.\n\nIntra-group transactions and balances are eliminated.\n\n## Company legislation and accounting standards\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and UK-adopted international accounting standards. The consolidated financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThese financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Group has considerable financial resources together with established business relationships with many customers and suppliers in countries throughout the world. The Directors also consider the Group's overall financial position, exposure to principal risks and future business forecasts. We describe in notes 15 to 18 on pages 203 to 218 the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit and liquidity risk. As a consequence, the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully for at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies adopted are the same as those which were applied for the previous financial year except as set out below under the heading 'Recent accounting developments'.\n\nAccounting policies are included in the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements. These are presented as text highlighted in grey on pages 177 to 226. The accounting policies below are applied throughout the financial statements.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in euros. As at 31 December 2023, the functional currency of PLC was the pound sterling. Items included in the financial statements of individual group companies are recorded in their respective functional currency which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates.\n\nForeign currency transactions in individual group companies are translated into functional currency using exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses from settlement of these transactions, and from translation of monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates, are recognised in the income statement except when deferred in equity as qualifying hedges.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the balances in individual group companies are translated from their functional currency into euros. Apart from the financial statements of group companies in hyperinflationary economies (see below), the income statement, the cash flow statement and all other movements in assets and liabilities are translated at average rates of exchange as a proxy for the transaction rate, or at the transaction rate itself if more appropriate. Assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates.\n\nThe financial statements of group companies whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are adjusted for inflation and then translated into euros using the balance sheet exchange rate. Amounts shown for prior years for comparative purposes are not modified. To determine the existence of hyperinflation, the Group assesses the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the economic environment of the country, such as the cumulative inflation rate over the previous three years.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the ordinary share capital of PLC was translated to euro using the historical rate at the date the shares were issued (see note 15B on page 204).\n\nThe effect of exchange rate changes during the year on net assets of foreign operations is recorded in equity. For this purpose, net assets include loans between group companies and any related foreign exchange contracts where settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Group applies hedge accounting to certain exchange differences arising between the functional currencies of a foreign operation and the functional currency of the parent entity, regardless of whether the net investment is held directly or through an intermediate parent. Differences arising on retranslation of a financial liability designated as a foreign currency net investment hedge are recorded in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. These differences are reported within profit or loss to the extent that the hedge is ineffective.\n\nCumulative exchange differences arising since the date of transition to IFRS of 1 January 2004 are reported as a separate component of other reserves. In the event of disposal or part disposal of an interest in a group company either through sale or as a result of a repayment of capital, the cumulative exchange difference is recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal of group companies.\n\n## Hyperinflationary economies\n\nThe Argentinian economy was designated as hyperinflationary from 1 July 2018 and the Turkish economy was designated as hyperinflationary from 1 July 2022. As a result, application of IAS 29 'Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies' has been applied to all Unilever entities whose functional currency is the Argentinian peso or the Turkish lira. The application of IAS 29 includes:\n\n- \u25a0 adjustment of historical cost non-monetary assets and liabilities for the change in purchasing power caused by inflation from the date of initial recognition to the balance sheet date;\n- \u25a0 adjustment of the income statement for inflation during the reporting period;\n- \u25a0 translation of income statement at the period-end foreign exchange rate instead of an average rate; and\n- \u25a0 adjustment of the income statement to reflect the impact of inflation and exchange rate movement on holding monetary assets and liabilities in local currency.\n\nThe main effects on the Group consolidated financial statements for 2023 are:\n\n| \u20ac million                             | Argentina Turkey  Total   |               |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|\n| Total assets increase/(reduction)     | (205)                     | 8    (197)    |\n| Turnover increase/(reduction)         | (440)                     | 12    (428)   |\n| Operating profit increase/(reduction) | (112)                     | (12)    (124) |\n| Net monetary gain/(loss)              | (203)                     | 61    (142)   |",

        "page_content": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Unilever Group\n\n## Climate change\n\nIn preparing these consolidated financial statements we have considered the impact of both physical and transition climate change risks as well as our plans to mitigate against those risks on the current valuation of our assets and liabilities. As detailed in the TCFD disclosures on pages 48 to 55 of this report, we have identified 11 risks and opportunities that could in the future be material to our business, for example carbon tax or land use regulations. Where possible we have performed quantitative assessments of these risks and opportunities based on various scenarios for the years 2030, 2039 and 2050. These potential financial impacts are based on high-level quantitative assessments and do not include any assumptions on the impact of actions that we would undertake to mitigate against these climate-related risks. Therefore, these quantifications do not represent any type of financial forecast and thus are not directly incorporated into any projections of long-term cash flows.\n\nTo determine if there is a material impact on the financial reporting judgements and estimates as of the reporting period, we have reviewed each balance sheet line item and identified those line items that have the potential to be significantly impacted by climate-related risks and our plans to mitigate against these risks. Those line items that have the potential to be significantly impacted have then been reviewed in detail to confirm:\n\n- \u25a0 that the growth rates and projected cash flows, used in assessing whether our goodwill and indefinite-life intangibles are impaired, are consistent with our climate-related risk assumptions and the actions we are taking to mitigate against those risks and\n- \u25a0 that the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment are appropriate given the potential physical and obsolescence risks associated with climate change and the actions we are taking to mitigate against those risks.\n\nIn addition it should be noted that climate-related risks could affect the financial position of our defined benefit pension plan assets. The Trustees operate diversified investment strategies and are continuously assessing investment risks. The Trustees consider climate risk as one of the key investment risks and are continually evolving their investments to lower the overall climate risk.\n\nBased on these reviews, we do not believe that there is a material impact on the financial reporting judgements and estimates arising from our considerations and as a result the valuations of our assets or liabilities have not been significantly impacted by these risks as at 31 December 2023. We have not identified any significant impact from climate-related risks on the Group's going concern assessment nor the viability of the Group over the next three years.\n\nFor many years Unilever has placed sustainability at the centre of its strategy and has been working on becoming a more sustainable business. This has included implementing hundreds of actions to help mitigate and adapt against climate-related risks. The costs and benefits of such actions are embedded into the cost structures of the business and are not separately identifiable. None of these actions have significantly impacted the value of the Group's assets or their useful lives and whilst there is still much to do, our aim is to continue to reduce our exposure to climate-related risks without impacting the value of the Group's assets. However we recognise that the climate emergency is deepening and government policies are likely to evolve as a result of commitments to limit global warning to 1.5\u00b0C and thus we will continue to carefully monitor potential implications on the valuations of our assets and liabilities that could arise in future years.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements in the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future period affected.\n\nThe following estimates are those that management believe have the most significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year:\n\n- \u25a0 Measurement of defined benefit obligations - the valuations of the Group's defined benefit pension plan obligations are dependent on a number of assumptions. These include discount rates, inflation, and life expectancy of scheme members. Details of these assumptions and sensitivities are in note 4B.\n- \u25a0 Impairment risk in Russia - in 2023 the Russian business contributed approximately 1% of the Group's turnover and net profit, and as at 31 December 2023 had approximately \u20ac600 million of net assets. While the potential impacts of the war remain uncertain, there is a risk that the operations in Russia are unable to continue, leading to a loss of turnover, profit and a write-down of assets.\n\nThe following judgements are those that management believe have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Group's financial statements:\n\n- \u25a0 Utilisation of tax losses and recognition of other deferred tax assets - the Group operates in many countries and is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Management uses judgement to assess the recoverability of tax assets such as whether there will be sufficient future taxable profits to utilise losses - see note 6B.\n- \u25a0 Likelihood of occurrence of provisions and contingent liabilities events can occur where there is uncertainty over future obligations. Judgement is required to determine if an outflow of economic resources is probable, or possible but not probable. Where it is probable, a liability is recognised and further judgement is used to determine the level of the provision. Where it is possible but not probable, further judgement is used to determine if the likelihood is remote, in which case no disclosures are provided; if the likelihood is not remote then judgement is used to determine the contingent liability disclosed. Unilever does not have provisions and contingent liabilities for the same matters. External advice is obtained for any material cases. See notes 6A, 19 and 20.\n- \u25a0 Recognition of pension surplus - where there is an accounting surplus on a defined benefit plan, management uses judgement to determine whether the Group can realise the surplus through refunds, reductions in future contributions or a combination of both.",

        "page_content": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Unilever Group\n\n## 2. Segment information\n\n## Segmental reporting\n\nThe Group's operating and reportable segments are the five Business Groups of Beauty & Wellbeing, Personal Care, Home Care, Nutrition and Ice Cream. Prior to 2022, segmental reporting was done on the basis of three Divisions: Beauty & Personal Care, Home Care and Foods & Refreshment. The comparative information has been reclassified to reflect the new reporting segments.\n\nBeauty & Wellbeing\n\nPersonal Care\n\nHome Care\n\n- \u25a0 primarily sales of fabric care (washing powders and liquids, rinse conditioners) and a wide range of cleaning products.\n\nNutrition\n\nIce Cream\n\n- \u25a0 primarily ice cream products.\n\n## Revenue\n\nTurnover comprises sales of goods after the deduction of discounts, sales taxes and estimated returns. It does not include sales between group companies. Discounts given by Unilever include rebates, price reductions and incentives given to customers, promotional couponing and trade communication costs and are based on the contractual arrangements with each customer. Discounts can either be immediately deducted from the sales value on the invoice or off-invoice and settled later through credit notes when the precise amounts are known. Rebates are generally off-invoice. Amounts provided for discounts at the end of a period require estimation; historical data and accumulated experience is used to estimate the provision using the most likely amount method and in most instances, the discount can be estimated using known facts with a high level of accuracy. Any differences between actual amounts settled and the amounts provided are not material and recognised in the subsequent reporting period.\n\nCustomer contracts generally contain a single performance obligation and turnover is recognised when control of the products being sold has transferred to our customer as there are no longer any unfulfilled obligations to the customer. This is generally on delivery to the customer but depending on individual customer terms, this can be at the time of dispatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance. This is considered the appropriate point where the performance obligations in our contracts are satisfied as Unilever no longer has control over the inventory.\n\nOur customers have the contractual right to return goods only when authorised by Unilever. At 31 December 2023, an estimate has been made of goods that will be returned and a liability has been recognised for this amount. An asset has also been recorded for the corresponding inventory that is estimated to return to Unilever using a best estimate based on accumulated experience.\n\nSome of our customers are distributors who may be able to return unsold goods in consignment arrangements.\n\n## Underlying operating profit\n\nUnderlying operating profit means operating profit before the impact of non-underlying items within operating profit. Underlying operating profit represents our measure of segment profit or loss as it is the primary measure used for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of segments. Items are classified as non-underlying due to their nature and/or frequency of occurrence.\n\nOur segments are comprised of similar product categories. 8 categories (2022: 8; 2021: 10) individually accounted for 5% or more of our revenue in one or more of the last three years. The following table shows the relevant contribution of these categories to Group revenue for the periods shown:\n\n| Category             | Segment            | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Fabric               | Home Care          | 15%    | 15%    | 14%    |\n| Ice Cream            | Ice Cream          | 13%    | 13%    | 13%    |\n| Hair Care            | Beauty & Wellbeing | 10%    | 11%    | 11%    |\n| Scratch Cooking Aids | Nutrition          | 10%    | 10%    | 10%    |\n| Skin Cleansing       | Personal Care      | 10%    | 10%    | 11%    |\n| Deodorant            | Personal Care      | 9%     | 8%     | 7%     |\n| Skin Care            | Beauty & Wellbeing | 7%     | 7%     | 7%     |\n| Dressings            | Nutrition          | 7%     | 6%     | 6%     |\n| Home & Hygiene       | Home Care          | 4%     | 4%     | 5%     |\n| Tea*                 | Nutrition          | 2%     | 3%     | 5%     |\n| Other                |                    | 13%    | 13%    | 11%    |\n\n- * 2023 includes retained tea business. 2021 and 2022 includes ekaterra tea business as well as retained business.\n\n- \u25a0 primarily sales of scratch cooking aids (soups, bouillons, seasonings), dressings (mayonnaise, ketchup) and tea products.\n- \u25a0 primarily sales of hair care (shampoo, conditioner, styling), skin care (face, hand and body moisturisers) and includes Prestige Beauty and Health & Wellbeing.\n- \u25a0 primarily sales of skin cleansing (soap, shower), deodorant and oral care (toothpaste, toothbrush, mouthwash) products.",

        "page_content": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Unilever Group\n\n## 4B. Pensions and similar obligations\n\nFor defined benefit plans, operating and finance costs are recognised separately in the income statement. The amount charged to operating cost in the income statement is the cost of accruing pension benefits promised to employees over the year, administration costs (other than costs of managing plan assets), plus the costs of individual events such as past service benefit changes, settlements and curtailments (such events are recognised immediately in the income statement). The amount charged or credited to finance costs is a net interest expense calculated by applying the liability discount rate to the surplus or deficit. Any differences between the expected interest on assets and the return actually achieved, and any changes in the liabilities over the year due to changes in assumptions or experience within the plans, are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\nThe defined benefit plan surplus or deficit on the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit liabilities (using a discount rate based on high-quality corporate bonds, or a suitable alternative where there is no active corporate bond market) adjusted for irrecoverable surpluses.\n\nAll defined benefit plans are subject to regular actuarial review using the projected unit method by external consultants. The Group policy is that the most material plans, representing approximately 82% of the defined benefit liabilities, are formally valued every year. Other material plans, accounting for a further 14% of the liabilities, have their liabilities updated each year. Group policy for the remaining plans requires a full actuarial valuation at least every three years. Asset values for all plans are updated every year.\n\nFor defined contribution plans, the charges to the income statement are the company contributions payable, as the company's obligation is limited to the contributions paid into the plans. The assets and liabilities of such plans are not included in the balance sheet of the Group.\n\n## Description of plans\n\nThe Group increasingly operates a number of defined contribution plans, the assets of which are held in external funds. In certain countries, the Group operates defined benefit pension plans based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service. The majority of defined benefit plans are either career average, final salary or hybrid plans and operate on a funded basis with assets held in external funds. Benefits are determined by the plan rules and are linked to inflation in some countries. Our largest plans are in the UK and the Netherlands. In the UK, we operate a career average defined benefit plan (with a salary limit for benefit accrual) which is closed to new entrants from October 2021, and a defined contribution plan. In the Netherlands, we operate a collective defined contribution plan for all new benefit accrual and a closed career average defined benefit plan for benefits built up to April 2015.\n\nThe Group also provides other post-employment benefits, mainly post-employment healthcare plans in the US, closed to new entrants from January 2014. These plans are predominantly unfunded.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe majority of the Group's externally funded plans are established as trusts, foundations or similar entities. The operation of these entities is governed by local regulations and practice in each country, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the Trustees (or equivalent) and their composition. Where Trustees (or equivalent) are in place to operate plans, they are generally required to act on behalf of the plan's stakeholders. They are tasked with periodic reviews of the solvency of the plan in accordance with local legislation and play a role in the longterm investment and funding strategy. The Group also has an internal body, the Pensions and Equity Committee, that is responsible for setting the company's policies and decision-making on plan matters, including but not limited to design, funding, investments, risk management and governance.\n\n## Investment strategy\n\nThe Group's investment strategy in respect of its funded plans is implemented within the framework of the various statutory requirements of the territories where the plans are based. The Group has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the Group of the benefits provided. To achieve this, investments are diversified, such that the failure of any single investment should not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. The plans expose the Group to a number of actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and, in certain countries, inflation risk. There are no unusual entity or plan-specific risks to the Group. The plans invest a reducing proportion of assets in equities and, for risk control, an increasing proportion in liability matching assets (bonds). There are also investments in property and other alternative assets; additionally, the Group uses derivatives to further mitigate the impact of the risks outlined above. However, the portfolio leverage is relatively low. The majority of assets are managed by a number of external fund managers with a small proportion managed in-house. Unilever has a pooled investment vehicle (Univest) which it believes offers its pension plans around the world a simplified externally managed investment vehicle to implement their strategic asset allocation models, currently for bonds, equities and alternative assets. The aim is to provide high-quality, well diversified, cost-effective, risk-controlled vehicles. The pension plans' investments are overseen by Unilever's internal investment company, the Univest Company.\n\n## Assumptions\n\nWith the objective of presenting the assets and liabilities of the pensions and other post-employment benefit plans at their fair value on the balance sheet, assumptions under IAS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date. The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities vary according to the country in which the plan is situated. The following table shows the assumptions, weighted by liabilities, used to value the principal defined benefit plans (representing approximately 96% of total pension liabilities and other post-employment benefit liabilities).\n\n|                                                             | 31 December 2023              | 31 December 2023                      | 31 December 2022              | 31 December 2022                      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                                             | Defined benefit pension plans | Other post-  employment benefit plans | Defined benefit pension plans | Other post-  employment benefit plans |\n| Discount rate                                               | 4.4 %                         | 5.9 %                                 | 4.6 %                         | 5.9 %                                 |\n| Inflation                                                   | 2.8 %                         | n/a                                   | 2.8 %                         | n/a                                   |\n| Rate of increase in salaries                                | 3.4 %                         | 2.9 %                                 | 3.3 %                         | 3.0 %                                 |\n| Rate of increase for pensions in payment (where provided)   | 2.6 %                         | n/a                                   | 2.4 %                         | n/a                                   |\n| Rate of increase for pensions in deferment (where provided) | 2.8 %                         | n/a                                   | 2.6 %                         | n/a                                   |\n| Long-term medical cost inflation                            | n/a                           | 5.5 %                                 | n/a                           | 5.1 %                                 |\n\nFor the most material other post-employment benefit plan in the US a higher initial level of medical cost inflation is assumed which falls from the initial rate of 7% to the long-term rate of 5% after 8 years.

These assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension plans. The years of life expectancy for 2023 above have been translated from the following tables:\n\nUK : Standard life expectancy tables Series S3, adjusted to reflect the experience of our plan members analysed as part of the 2022 actuarial valuation. Future improvements in longevity have been allowed for in line with the core CMI 2022 Mortality Projections Model with a 1% p.a. longterm improvement rate.\n\nNetherlands: The Dutch Actuarial Society's AG Prognosetafel 2022 table is used with correction factors (2020) to allow for the typically longer life expectancy for fund members relative to the general population. This table has an in-built allowance for future improvements in longevity.\n\nThe impact from changes to the assumptions of the remaining defined benefit plans are considered immaterial. Their assumptions vary due to a number of factors including the currency and long-term economic conditions of the countries where they are situated.\n\n## Income statement\n\nThe charge to the income statement comprises:\n\n|                                                            | Notes   | \u20ac million 2023   | \u20ac million 2022   | \u20ac million 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Charged to operating profit:                               |         |                  |                  |                  |\n| Defined benefit pension and other benefit plans:           |         |                  |                  |                  |\n| Gross service cost                                         |         | (128)            | (186)            | (228)            |\n| Employee contributions                                     |         | 11               | 12               | 13               |\n| Special termination benefits                               |         | (14)             | (11)             | (15)             |\n| Past service cost including (losses)/gains on curtailments |         | 3                | -                | 18               |\n| Settlements                                                |         | 2                | 1                | 1                |\n| Defined contribution plans                                 |         | (222)            | (212)            | (190)            |\n| Total operating cost                                       | 4A      | (348)            | (396)            | (401)            |\n| Finance income/(cost) (a)                                  | 5       | 110              | 44               | (10)             |\n| Net impact on the income statement (before tax)            |         | (238)            | (352)            | (411)            |\n\n## Statement of comprehensive income\n\nAmounts recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on the remeasurement of the surplus/(deficit).\n\n|                                                                                      | \u20ac million 2023   | \u20ac million 2022   | \u20ac million 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net finance income/(cost)        | 131              | (6,483)          | 1,958            |\n| Change in asset ceiling excluding amounts included in finance cost                   | (6)              | (184)            | (17)             |\n| Actuarial gains/(losses) arising from changes in demographic assumptions             | 98               | (24)             | (4)              |\n| Actuarial gains/(losses) arising from changes in financial assumptions               | (552)            | 6,914            | 342              |\n| Experience gains/(losses) arising on pension plan and other benefit plan liabilities | (416)            | (760)            | 126              |\n| Total of defined benefit costs recognised in other comprehensive income              | (745)            | (537)            | 2,405            |",

The fair value of private equity, properties, derivatives and hedge funds are not based on quoted market prices in active markets. Properties are primarily valued by a professional third party valuer on an open market basis, as defined by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. The Group uses derivatives and other instruments to hedge some of its exposure to inflation and interest rate risk - the degree of this hedging of liabilities was over 100% for both interest rate and inflation for the UK plan and approximately 90% for interest rate and 20% for inflation for the Netherlands plan at year end. Foreign currency exposures, in part, are also hedged by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.

Share-based compensation plans\n\nThe fair value of awards at grant date is calculated using observable market price. This value is expensed over their vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity. The expense is reviewed and adjusted to reflect changes to the level of awards expected to vest, except where this arises from a failure to meet a market condition. Any cancellations are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group had share-based compensation plans in the form of performance shares and other share awards.\n\nThe numbers in this note include those for Executive Directors shown in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 116 to 153 and those for key management shown in note 4A on page 184. Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the share-based compensation plans.\n\nThe charge to income statement related to equity-settled share-based compensation plan is \u20ac212 million (2022: \u20ac177 million; 2021: \u20ac161 million).\n\n## Performance share plans\n\nPerformance share awards are made in respect of the Performance Share Plan (PSP). Awards for the Global Share Incentive Plan (GSIP) were last made in February 2018 and vested in February 2021. Awards for MCIP were last made in 2020 and will vest in 2024. No further MCIP or GSIP awards will be made. The awards of each plan will vest between 0% and 200% of grant level, subject to the level of satisfaction of performance measures (limits for Executive Directors may vary and are detailed in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 116 to 153).\n\nThe MCIP allowed Unilever's managers to invest up to 100% of their annual bonus (a minimum of 33% and maximum of 67% for Executive Directors) in shares in Unilever, and to receive a corresponding award of performance-related shares. From 2021, under the PSP, Unilever's managers receive annual awards of PLC shares. The performance measures for MCIP are underlying sales growth, underlying EPS growth, underlying return on invested capital, sustainability progress index and for PSP are percentage business winning, free cash flow, underlying return on invested capital and sustainability progress index. MCIP awards made will vest after 4 years, while PSP awards vest after 3 years.\n\nA summary of the status of the Performance Share Plans as at 31 December 2023, 2022 and 2021 and changes during the years ended on these dates is presented below:\n\n|                                            | 2023 Number of shares   | 2022 Number of shares   | 2021 Number of shares   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Outstanding at 1 January                   | 17,923,890              | 14,318,564              | 11,371,436              |\n| Awarded                                    | 7,479,544               | 10,032,321              | 7,667,929               |\n| Vested                                     | (2,021,439)             | (3,101,598)             | (3,425,232)             |\n| Forfeited                                  | (2,052,057)             | (3,325,397)             | (1,295,569)             |\n| Outstanding at 31 December                 | 21,329,938              | 17,923,890              | 14,318,564              |\n|                                            | 2023                    | 2022                    | 2021                    |\n|                                            | \u20ac45.71                  | \u20ac41.56                  | \u20ac47.64                  |\n| Fair value per share award during the year |                         |                         |                         |",

Income tax\n\nIncome tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nCurrent tax in the consolidated income statement will differ from the income tax paid in the consolidated cash flow statement primarily because of deferred tax arising on temporary differences and payment dates for income tax occurring after the balance sheet date.\n\nUnilever is subject to taxation in the many countries in which it operates. The tax legislation of these countries differs, is often complex and is subject to interpretation by management and the government authorities. These matters of judgement give rise to the need to create provisions for tax payments that may arise in future years with respect to transactions already undertaken. Provisions are made against individual exposures and take into account the specific circumstances of each case, including the strength of technical arguments, recent case law decisions or rulings on similar issues and relevant external advice. The provision is estimated based on one of two methods, the expected value method (the sum of the probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes) or the single most likely amount method, depending on which is expected to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty.\n\n| Tax charge in income statement                                | \u20ac million 2023   | \u20ac million 2022   | \u20ac million 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Current tax                                                   |                  |                  |                  |\n| Current year                                                  | (2,261)          | (2,206)          | (2,399)          |\n| Over/(under) provided in prior years                          | 9                | (61)             | 245              |\n|                                                               | (2,252)          | (2,267)          | (2,154)          |\n| Deferred tax                                                  |                  |                  |                  |\n| Origination and reversal of temporary differences             | 22               | 153              | 189              |\n| Changes in tax rates                                          | 7                | 28               | 15               |\n| Recognition of previously unrecognised losses brought forward | 24               | 18               | 15               |\n|                                                               | 53               | 199              | 219              |\n|                                                               | (2,199)          | (2,068)          | (1,935)          |\n\nThe reconciliation between the computed weighted average rate of income tax expense, which is generally applicable to Unilever companies, and the actual rate of taxation charged is as follows:\n\n| Reconciliation of effective tax rate                                    | % 2023   | % 2022   | % 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Computed rate of tax (a)                                                | 25       | 25       | 23       |\n| Differences between computed rate of tax and effective tax rate due to: |          |          |          |\n| Incentive tax credits                                                   | (2)      | (2)      | (2)      |\n| Withholding tax on dividends                                            | 2        | 2        | 2        |\n| Expenses not deductible for tax purposes                                | 1        | 1        | 1        |\n| Irrecoverable withholding tax                                           | 1        | 1        | 1        |\n| Income tax reserve adjustments - current and prior year                 | (1)      | -        | (1)      |\n| Impact of disposals                                                     | (2)      | (6)      | -        |\n| Others                                                                  | -        | (1)      | (1)      |\n| Effective tax rate                                                      | 24       | 20       | 23       |\n\nOur tax rate is reduced by incentive tax credits, the benefit from preferential tax regimes that have been legislated by the countries and provinces concerned in order to promote economic development and investment. The tax rate is increased by business expenses which are not deductible for tax, such as entertainment costs and some interest expense and by irrecoverable withholding taxes on dividends paid by subsidiary companies and on other cross-border payments such as royalties and service fees, which cannot be offset against other taxes due. Uncertain tax provisions excluding the related interest amounted to \u20ac820 million (2022: \u20ac822 million). This includes \u20ac434 million (2022: \u20ac374 million) related to the Horlicks intangible amortisation in India.\n\nThe Group's future tax charge and effective tax rate could be affected by several factors, including changes in tax laws and their interpretation, the implementation of the OECD Pillars 1 and 2, EU and US tax changes, as well as the impact of acquisitions, disposals and restructuring of our business.\n\nPillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions in which the Group operates and the legislation will be effective for the Group's financial year beginning 1 January 2024. We have performed an assessment of the Group's potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes based on the most recent financial information available regarding the constituent entities in the Group. Based on the assessment, the Pillar Two effective tax rates in most of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates are above 15%. However, there are a limited number of jurisdictions where the transitional safe harbour relief is unlikely to apply and the Pillar Two effective tax rate is expected to be below 15%. We estimate that the combined impact of the implementation by countries of qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes and the income inclusion rule in the UK will be in the range of 0-0.2% increase to the Group ETR for 2024.",

Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognised using the liability method on taxable temporary differences between the tax base and the accounting base of items included in the balance sheet of the Group. Certain temporary differences are not provided for as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 goodwill not deductible for tax purposes;\n- \u25a0 the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit; and\n- \u25a0 differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the year end.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\n| Movements in 2023 and 2022       | \u20ac million As at 1  January  2023   | \u20ac million Income  statement   | \u20ac million Other   | \u20ac million As at 31  December  2023   | \u20ac million As at 1  January 2022   | \u20ac million Income  Statement   | \u20ac million Other   | \u20ac million As at 31  December  2022   |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Pensions and similar obligations | (613)                              | (90)                          | 189               | (514)                                | (654)                             | (44)                          | 85                | (613)                                |\n| Provisions and accruals          | 741                                | 103                           | (39)              | 805                                  | 726                               | 12                            | 3                 | 741                                  |\n| Goodwill and intangible assets   | (3,848)                            | (10)                          | 161               | (3,697)                              | (3,448)                           | 135                           | (535)             | (3,848)                              |\n| Accelerated tax depreciation     | (700)                              | 47                            | 81                | (572)                                | (600)                             | (60)                          | (40)              | (700)                                |\n| Tax losses                       | 231                                | (3)                           | 6                 | 234                                  | 172                               | 100                           | (41)              | 231                                  |\n| Fair value gains                 | (42)                               | 0                             | 2                 | (40)                                 | (60)                              | (11)                          | 29                | (42)                                 |\n| Fair value losses                | 36                                 | (2)                           | (11)              | 23                                   | 2                                 | 6                             | 28                | 36                                   |\n| Share-based payments             | 194                                | 30                            | 22                | 246                                  | 166                               | 18                            | 10                | 194                                  |\n| Lease liability                  | 237                                | (34)                          | (14)              | 189                                  | 295                               | (55)                          | (3)               | 237                                  |\n| Right of use asset               | (201)                              | 30                            | 5                 | (166)                                | (244)                             | 42                            | 1                 | (201)                                |\n| Other (a)                        | 639                                | (18)                          | (11)              | 610                                  | 580                               | 56                            | 3                 | 639                                  |\n|                                  | (3,326)                            | 53                            | 391               | (2,882)                              | (3,065)                           | 199                           | (460)             | (3,326)                              |\n\nAt the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of \u20ac1,313 million (2022: \u20ac1,352 million) and tax credits amounting to \u20ac832 million (2022: \u20ac893 million) available for offset against future taxable profits. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unused tax losses of \u20ac602 million (2022: \u20ac668 million) and tax credits of \u20ac418 million (2022: \u20ac448 million), as it is not probable that there will be future taxable profits within the entities against which the losses and credits can be utilised. Of these losses, \u20ac168 million (2022: \u20ac196 million) have expiry dates, being corporate income tax losses in the US, Korea and China which expire between now and 2042.\n\nWhere deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of losses, the evidence considered includes the reason for the loss, potential planning strategies to utilise the loss, including where permitted merger with other profitable entities and the availability of future taxable profits against which the losses can be utilised. Profit forecasts used are consistent with those used in other areas of the business.\n\nDeferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of other deductible temporary differences of \u20ac515 million (2022: \u20ac269 million) as it is not expected they will be utilised. Of these differences, \u20ac409 million (2022: \u20ac199 million) relates to limitation on the deduction of interest expenses. There is no expiry date for these differences.\n\nAt the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was \u20ac2,610 million (2022: \u20ac2,420 million). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority. The following amounts, determined after appropriate offsetting, are shown in the consolidated balance sheet:\n\n| Deferred tax assets and liabilities                                       | \u20ac million Assets  2023   | \u20ac million Assets  2022   | \u20ac million Liabilities   2023   | \u20ac million Liabilities   2022   | \u20ac million Total 2023   | \u20ac million Total 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Pensions and similar obligations                                          | 199                      | 195                      | (713)                          | (808)                          | (514)                  | (613)                  |\n| Provisions and accruals                                                   | 503                      | 489                      | 302                            | 252                            | 805                    | 741                    |\n| Goodwill and intangible assets                                            | 51                       | 105                      | (3,748)                        | (3,953)                        | (3,697)                | (3,848)                |\n| Accelerated tax depreciation                                              | (18)                     | (93)                     | (554)                          | (607)                          | (572)                  | (700)                  |\n| Tax losses                                                                | 201                      | 188                      | 33                             | 43                             | 234                    | 231                    |\n| Fair value gains                                                          | (1)                      | 1                        | (39)                           | (43)                           | (40)                   | (42)                   |\n| Fair value losses                                                         | -                        | -                        | 23                             | 36                             | 23                     | 36                     |\n| Share-based payments                                                      | 84                       | 51                       | 162                            | 143                            | 246                    | 194                    |\n| Lease liability                                                           | 94                       | 102                      | 95                             | 135                            | 189                    | 237                    |\n| Right of use asset                                                        | (92)                     | (92)                     | (74)                           | (109)                          | (166)                  | (201)                  |\n| Other                                                                     | 92                       | 103                      | 518                            | 536                            | 610                    | 639                    |\n|                                                                           | 1,113                    | 1,049                    | (3,995)                        | (4,375)                        | (2,882)                | (3,326)                |\n| Of which deferred tax to be recovered/(settled) after more than 12 months | 756                      | 700                      | (4,199)                        | (4,492)                        | (3,443)                | (3,792)                |",

Goodwill and intangible assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is initially recognised based on the accounting policy for business combinations (see note 21). Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less amounts provided for impairment. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is assessed to determine whether new cash generating units (CGUs) are created, and if not, is allocated to the Group's CGUs, or groups of CGUs (GCGUs) in line with the structure detailed below. These might not always be the same as the CGUs or GCGUs that include the assets and liabilities of the acquired business.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nSeparately purchased intangible assets are initially measured at cost, being the purchase price as at the date of acquisition. On acquisition of new interests in group companies, Unilever recognises any specifically identifiable intangible assets separately from goodwill. These intangible assets are initially measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition.\n\nExpenditure to support development of internally produced intangible assets is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nIndefinite-life intangibles mainly comprise trademarks and brands, for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash inflows. These are considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of our brands and the level of marketing support. These assets are not amortised but are subject to a review for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate this is necessary.\n\nFinite-life intangible assets mainly comprise software, patented and non-patented technology, know-how and customer lists. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in the income statement over the period of their expected useful lives, or the period of legal rights if shorter. None of the amortisation periods exceeds ten years.\n\n## Cash generating units\n\nThe Group's assets are grouped into cash generating units (CGUs) which are the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates largely independent cash inflows. The Group's CGUs are aligned with our organisation structure of Business Units and Global Business Units.\n\nFor impairment testing purposes, goodwill is allocated to groups of CGUs (GCGUs) which are based on the five Business Groups since the synergies acquired through a business combination benefit a Business Group as a whole rather than a specific Business Unit or Global Business Unit. Cash inflows relating to indefinite-life intangible assets are identifiable at Business Unit or Global Business Unit level and are therefore allocated to individual CGUs.\n\n## Impairment review\n\nThe impairment test is performed by comparing the carrying value of the CGUs or GCGUs with their recoverable value. The recoverable value is primarily based on value in use but also considers fair value less costs of disposal where relevant. Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises.\n\n| \u20ac million                                   |          | Indefinite-life   | Finite-life intangible assets   | Finite-life intangible assets   |         |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------|\n| Movements during 2023                       | Goodwill | intangible assets | Software                        | Other                           | Total   |\n| Cost                                        |          |                   |                                 |                                 |         |\n| 1 January 2023                              | 22,766   | 18,516            | 3,317                           | 1,137                           | 45,736  |\n| Additions through business combinations (a) | 326      | 430               | -                               | -                               | 756     |\n| Disposal of businesses                      | (56)     | -                 | -                               | (7)                             | (63)    |\n| Reclassification to held for sale           | (65)     | (467)             | -                               | -                               | (532)   |\n| Additions                                   | -        | 2                 | 239                             | 2                               | 243     |\n| Disposals and other movements               | -        | (2)               | (71)                            | 7                               | (66)    |\n| Hyperinflationary adjustment                | (173)    | (12)              | (5)                             | -                               | (190)   |\n| Currency retranslation                      | (532)    | (500)             | 3                               | (15)                            | (1,044) |\n| 31 December 2023                            | 22,266   | 17,967            | 3,483                           | 1,124                           | 44,840  |\n| Accumulated amortisation and impairment     |          |                   |                                 |                                 |         |\n| 1 January 2023                              | (1,157)  | (350)             | (2,730)                         | (1,010)                         | (5,247) |\n| Amortisation/impairment for the year        | -        | -                 | (187)                           | (41)                            | (228)   |\n| Disposals and other movements               | (1)      | -                 | 72                              | 7                               | 78      |\n| Currency retranslation                      | 1        | 5                 | 4                               | 13                              | 23      |\n| 31 December 2023                            | (1,157)  | (345)             | (2,841)                         | (1,031)                         | (5,374) |\n| Net book value 31 December 2023 (b)         | 21,109   | 17,622            | 642                             | 93                              | 39,466  |",

Goodwill and intangible assets continued\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nIn performing our annual impairment testing, the recoverable amount of each CGU has been calculated based on its value in use, estimated as the present value of projected future cash flows. Each GCGU's value in use is based on the aggregated value in use of the CGUs grouped under the respective GCGU.\n\nProjected cash flows include specific estimates for a period of five years. The growth rates and operating margins used to estimate cash flows for the five years are based on past performance and on the Group's three-year strategic plan, de-risked to ensure reasonability and extended to years four and five. The Group's three-year strategic plan factors in initiatives we are undertaking to reduce carbon emissions in line with our CTAP and impacts of climate change on our operational costs. The growth rates used in this exercise for GCGUs and significant CGUs are set out below:\n\n## For the year 2023\n\nBeauty &\n\n| Group of CGUs                          | Wellbeing   | Personal Care   | Home Care   | Nutrition   | Ice Cream   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Longer-term sustainable growth rates   | 3%          | 2%              | 3%          | 2%          | 2%          |\n| Average near-term nominal growth rates | 6%          | 4%              | 3%          | 3%          | 6%          |\n\n| Significant CGUs                       | Nutrition South Asia   | Nutrition Europe, ANZ &  METU   | Nutrition North America   | Prestige   | Beauty &  Wellbeing North Asia   | Health &  Wellness   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Longer-term sustainable growth rates   | 5%                     | 1%                              | 1%                        | 2%         | 2%                               | 1%                   |\n| Average near-term nominal growth rates | 5%                     | 1%                              | 4%                        | 11%        | 2%                               | 12%                  |\n\n## For the year 2022\n\n| Group of CGUs                          | Beauty &  Wellbeing   | Personal Care   | Home Care   | Nutrition   | Ice Cream   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Longer-term sustainable growth rates   | 3%                    | 3%              | 4%          | 3%          | 3%          |\n| Average near-term nominal growth rates | 6%                    | 3%              | 4%          | 5%          | 6%          |\n\n| Significant CGUs                       | Nutrition South Asia   | Nutrition Europe, ANZ &  METU   | Nutrition North America   | Prestige   | Beauty &  Wellbeing North Asia   | Health & Wellness   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Longer-term sustainable growth rates   | 7%                     | 2%                              | 2%                        | 2%         | 4%                               | 2%                  |\n| Average near-term nominal growth rates | 7%                     | 2%                              | 4%                        | 11%        | 3%                               | 17%                 |\n\nThe estimated cash flows after year five are extrapolated using a longer-term sustainable growth rate, which is determined as the lower of our own three-year average growth projection and external forecasts for the relevant market.\n\nIn 2023, the projected cash flows are discounted using pre-tax discount rates. The discount rates are specific to each CGU and are determined based on the weighted average cost of capital, including a market and country risk premium. Given the higher number of CGUs spread across different markets, the CGU discount rates are in the range 8.4%-20.0% (2022: 7.4%-11.8%).\n\nThere are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would cause the carrying amount of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.\n\n## 10. Property, plant and equipment\n\nThe Group's property, plant and equipment is comprised of owned assets (note 10A) and leased assets (note 10B). Property, plant and equipment\n\nis measured at cost including eligible borrowing costs less depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Property, plant and equipment is subject to review for impairment if triggering events or circumstances indicate that this is necessary. If an indication of impairment exists, the asset's or cash generating unit's recoverable amount is estimated and any impairment loss is charged to the income statement as it arises.\n\n## Owned assets\n\nOwned assets are initially measured at historical cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the expected average useful lives of the assets. Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least annually. The review of residual values and useful lives have taken into consideration the impacts of climate change and the actions we undertake to mitigate and adapt against these climate-related risks and there is no material impact on the income statement for this year. Estimated useful lives by major class of assets are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 freehold buildings (no depreciation on freehold land)\n\n40 years\n\n- \u25a0 leasehold land and buildings\n\n40 years (or life of lease if less)\n\n- \u25a0 plant and equipment\n\n2-20 years\n\n## Leased assets\n\nThe cost of a leased asset is measured as the lease liability at inception of the lease contract and other direct costs less any incentives granted by the lessor. The Group has not capitalised leases which are less than 12 months or leases of low-value assets. These mainly relate to IT equipment, office equipment, furniture and fitting and other peripheral items. When a lease liability is remeasured, the related lease asset is adjusted by the same amount.\n\nDepreciation is provided on a straight-line basis from the commencement date of the lease to the end of the lease term.",

Other non-current assets\n\nJoint ventures are undertakings in which the Group has an interest and which are jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other parties. Associates are undertakings where the Group has an investment in which it does not have control or joint control but can exercise significant influence.\n\nInterests in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method and are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at cost, adjusted for the movement in the Group's share of their net assets and liabilities. The Group's share of the profit or loss after tax of joint ventures and associates is included in the Group's consolidated profit before taxation.\n\nWhere the Group's share of losses exceeds its interest in the equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of the investment is reduced to zero and the recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has an obligation to make payments on behalf of the investee.\n\n|                                           |   \u20ac million 2023 |   \u20ac million 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Interest in net assets of joint ventures  |               70 |               65 |\n| Interest in net assets of associates      |               24 |               19 |\n| Long-term trade and other receivables (a) |              394 |              520 |\n| Other non-current assets (b)              |              423 |              338 |\n|                                           |              911 |              942 |\n\n| Movements during 2023 and 2022   | \u20ac million 2023   | \u20ac million 2022   |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Joint ventures (a)               |                  |                  |\n| 1 January                        | 65               | 37               |\n| Additions                        | 10               | 3                |\n| Dividends received/reductions    | (241)            | (189)            |\n| Share of net profit/(loss)       | 235              | 213              |\n| Currency retranslation           | 1                | 1                |\n| 31 December                      | 70               | 65               |\n| Associates                       |                  |                  |\n| 1 January                        | 19               | 23               |\n| Additions                        | 8                | 6                |\n| Dividend received/reductions     | (5)              | (4)              |\n| Share of net profit/(loss)       | (4)              | (5)              |\n| Currency retranslation           | 6                | (1)              |\n| 31 December                      | 24               | 19               |\n\nThe joint ventures and associates have no contingent liabilities to which the Group is exposed, and the Group has no contingent liabilities in relation to its interests in the joint ventures and associates.\n\nThe Group has no outstanding capital commitments to joint ventures.\n\nOutstanding balances with joint ventures and associates are shown in note 23 on page 224.\n\n## 12. Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct costs and, where appropriate, a proportion of attributable production overheads. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n| Inventories                         | \u20ac million 2023   | \u20ac million 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Raw materials and consumables       | 1,815            | 2,062            |\n| Finished goods and goods for resale | 3,662            | 4,248            |\n| Total inventories                   | 5,477            | 6,310            |\n| Provision for inventories           | (358)            | (379)            |\n|                                     | 5,119            | 5,931            |",

Trade and other current receivables\n\nTrade and other current receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, except for derivatives (see note 16 on page 208), these assets are held at amortised cost, using the effective interest method and net of any impairment losses. Discounts payable to customers are shown as a reduction in trade receivables when there is a legal right and intent to settle them on a net basis.\n\nWe do not consider the fair values of trade and other current receivables to be significantly different from their carrying values. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited, due to the Group's customer base being large and diverse. Our historical experience of collecting receivables, supported by the level of default, is that credit risk is low across territories and so trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets. Impairment for trade receivables are calculated for specific receivables with known or anticipated issues affecting the likelihood of recovery and for balances past due with a probability of default based on historical data as well as relevant forward-looking information.\n\n| Trade and other current receivables   | \u20ac million 2023   | \u20ac million 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Due within one year                   |                  |                  |\n| Trade receivables                     | 4,023            | 4,544            |\n| Prepayments and accrued income        | 516              | 969              |\n| Other receivables                     | 1,236            | 1,543            |\n|                                       | 5,775            | 7,056            |\n\nIncluded within trade receivables are discounts due to our customers of \u20ac2,528 million (2022: \u20ac2,436 million). Other receivables comprise financial assets of \u20ac256 million (2022: \u20ac317 million) and non-financial assets of \u20ac979 million (2022: \u20ac1,226 million).

Trade payables and other liabilities\n\n## Trade payables\n\nTrade payables are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Trade payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.\n\n## Other liabilities\n\nOther liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent measurement depends on the type of liability:\n\n- \u25a0 accruals are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method;\n- \u25a0 social security and sundry taxes are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method;\n- \u25a0 deferred consideration is subsequently measured at fair value with changes in the income statement as explained below; and\n- \u25a0 others are subsequently measured either at amortised cost, using the effective interest method or at fair value, with changes being recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Deferred consideration\n\nDeferred consideration represents any payments to the sellers of a business that occur after the acquisition date. These typically comprise contingent consideration and fixed deferred consideration:\n\n- \u25a0 fixed deferred consideration is a payment with a due date after acquisition that is not dependent on future conditions; and\n- \u25a0 contingent consideration is a payment which is dependent on certain conditions being met in the future and is often variable.\n\nAll deferred consideration is initially recognised at fair value as at the acquisition date, which includes a present value discount. Subsequently, deferred consideration is measured to reflect the unwinding of discount on the liability, with changes recognised in finance cost within the income statement. In the balance sheet, it is remeasured to reflect the latest estimate of the achievement of the conditions on which the consideration is based; changes in value other than the discount unwind are recognised as acquisition and disposal-related costs in the income statement.\n\nWe do not consider the fair values of trade payables and other liabilities to be significantly different from their carrying values.\n\n| Trade payables and other liabilities       | \u20ac million 2023   | \u20ac million 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Current: due within one year               |                  |                  |\n| Trade payables                             | 10,355           | 11,100           |\n| Accruals                                   | 5,057            | 5,232            |\n| Social security and sundry taxes           | 512              | 626              |\n| Deferred consideration                     | 167              | 78               |\n| Others                                     | 766              | 987              |\n|                                            | 16,857           | 18,023           |\n| Non-current: due after more than one year  |                  |                  |\n| Accruals                                   | 105              | 141              |\n| Deferred consideration                     | 5                | 102              |\n| Others                                     | 28               | 27               |\n|                                            | 138              | 270              |\n| Total trade payables and other liabilities | 16,995           | 18,293           |\n\nIncluded within trade payables and other liabilities are discounts due to our customers of \u20ac2,294 million (2022: \u20ac2,121 million).\n\nIncluded within others are IT and consulting services.\n\n## Deferred consideration\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the total balance of deferred consideration for acquisitions is \u20ac172 million (2022: \u20ac180 million), which includes contingent consideration of \u20ac157 million (2022: \u20ac164 million). These contingent consideration payments are dependent on acquired businesses achieving contractually agreed financial targets (mainly relates to cumulative increases in turnover and profit before tax) until 2025, with a maximum contractual amount of \u20ac681 million.\n\n## Supplier financing arrangements for trade payables\n\nSome of our suppliers elect to factor some of their receivables from the Group with financial institutions. In some instances, we provide suppliers and/or banks with visibility of invoices approved for payment, which helps them receive cash from the bank before the invoice due date, if they choose to do so. Payment dates and terms for Unilever do not vary based on whether the supplier chooses to factor their receivable. If a receivable is purchased by a third-party bank, that third-party bank does not benefit from additional security when compared to the security originally enjoyed by the supplier. The Group evaluates these arrangements to assess if the payable holds the characteristics of a trade payable or should be classified as a financial liability. At 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, all such liabilities were classified as trade payables.\n\nIn May 2023, the IASB issued the final amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 which address the disclosure requirements to enhance the transparency of supplier finance arrangements and their effects on a company's liabilities, cash flows and exposure to liquidity risk. We will first make these disclosures in the 2024 Annual Report and Accounts.",

        "page_content": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Unilever Group\n\n## 15. Capital and funding\n\n## Ordinary shares\n\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.\n\n## Share-based compensation\n\nThe Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans involving awards of ordinary shares. Full details of these plans are given in note 4C on pages 190 and 191.\n\n## Unification reserve\n\nThe Group recognised a separate Unification Reserve within Equity as a result of PLC Share Premium that arose from Unification.\n\n## Other reserves\n\nOther reserves include the fair value reserve, the foreign currency translation reserve, the capital redemption reserve and treasury shares.\n\n## Shares held by employee share trusts and group companies\n\nAn employee share trust and group companies purchase and hold shares to satisfy performance shares granted and other share awards (see note 4C). The assets and liabilities of the trust and shares held by the trust and group companies are included in the consolidated financial statements. The book value of shares held is deducted from other reserves, and the trust's borrowings are included in the Group's liabilities. The costs of the trust are included in the results of the Group. The shares held by the trust and group companies are excluded from the calculation of earnings per share.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, less any directly related transaction costs. When bonds are designated as being part of a fair value hedge relationship, in those cases bonds are carried at amortised cost, adjusted for the fair value of the risk being hedged, with changes in value shown in the income statement. Put options are initially recognised at the present value of the expected gross obligation, with changes in value being recognised in the income statement. Other financial liabilities, which includes put options, are subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the exception of:\n\n- \u25a0 financial liabilities which the Group has elected to measure at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \u25a0 derivative financial liabilities - see note 16 on page 208; and\n- \u25a0 contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which IFRS 3 applies. Such contingent consideration is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not yet paid at the start of the lease term. This is discounted using an appropriate borrowing rate determined by the Group, where none is readily available in the lease contract. The lease liability is subsequently reduced by cash payments and increased by interest costs. The lease liability is remeasured when the Group assesses that there will be a change in the amount expected to be paid during the lease term.\n\nThe Group's Treasury activities are designed to:\n\n- \u25a0 maintain a competitive balance sheet in line with at least A/A2 rating (see below);\n- \u25a0 secure funding at lowest costs for the Group's operations, M&A activity and external dividend payments (see below);\n- \u25a0 protect the Group's financial results and position from financial risks (see note 16);\n- \u25a0 maintain market risks within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns (see note 16); and\n- \u25a0 protect the Group's financial investments, while maximising returns (see note 17).\n\nThe Treasury department provides central deposit-taking, funding and foreign exchange management services for the Group's operations. The department is governed by standards and processes which are approved by Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE). In addition to guidelines and exposure limits, a system of authorities and extensive independent reporting covers all major areas of activity. Performance is monitored closely by senior management. Reviews are undertaken periodically by corporate audit.\n\nKey instruments used by the Treasury department are:\n\n- \u25a0 short-term and long-term borrowings;\n- \u25a0 cash and cash equivalents; and\n- \u25a0 plain vanilla derivatives, including interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.\n\nThe Treasury department maintains a list of approved financial instruments. The use of any new instrument must be approved by the Chief Financial Officer. The use of leveraged instruments is not permitted.\n\nUnilever considers the following components of its balance sheet to be managed capital:\n\n- \u25a0 total equity - retained profit, other reserves, share capital, share premium, non-controlling interests (notes 15A and 15B);\n- \u25a0 short-term debt - current financial liabilities (note 15C); and\n- \u25a0 long-term debt - non-current financial liabilities (note 15C).\n\nThe Group manages its capital so as to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to optimise returns to our shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity. The capital structure of the Group is based on management's judgement of the appropriate balance of key elements in order to meet its strategic and day-to-day needs. We consider the amount of capital in proportion to risk and manage the capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.\n\nOur current long-term credit rating is A+/A1 and our short-term credit rating is A1/P1. We aim to maintain a competitive balance sheet which we consider to be the equivalent of a credit rating of at least A/A2 in the long term. This provides us with:\n\n- \u25a0 appropriate access to the debt and equity markets;\n- \u25a0 sufficient flexibility for acquisitions;\n- \u25a0 sufficient resilience against economic and financial uncertainty while ensuring ample liquidity; and\n- \u25a0 optimal weighted average cost of capital, given the above constraints.\n\nUnilever monitors the qualitative and quantitative factors utilised by the rating agencies. This information is publicly available and is updated by the credit rating agencies on a regular basis.",

Treasury risk management\n\n## Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nDerivatives are measured at fair value with any related transaction costs expensed as incurred. The treatment of changes in the value of derivatives depends on their use as explained below.\n\n## (i) Fair value hedges (a)\n\nCertain derivatives are held to hedge the risk of changes in value of a specific bond or other loan. In these situations, the Group designates the liability and related derivative to be part of a fair value hedge relationship. The carrying value of the bond is adjusted by the fair value of the risk being hedged, with changes going to the income statement. Gains and losses on the corresponding derivative are also recognised in the income statement. The amounts recognised are offset in the income statement to the extent that the hedge is effective. Ineffectiveness may occur if the critical terms do not exactly match, or if there is a value adjustment resulting from a change in credit risk (in either the Group or the counter-party to the derivative) that is not matched by the hedged item. When the relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value hedge adjustment made to the bond is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method.\n\n## (ii) Cash flow hedges (a)\n\nDerivatives are also held to hedge the uncertainty in timing or amount of future forecast cash flows. Such derivatives are classified as being part of cash flow hedge relationships. For an effective hedge, gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in equity. Cost of hedging, where material and opted for, is recorded in a separate account within equity. Any ineffective elements of the hedge are recognised in the income statement. Ineffectiveness may occur if there are changes to the expected timing of the hedged transaction. If the hedged cash flow relates to a non-financial asset, the amount accumulated in equity is subsequently included within the carrying value of that asset. For other cash flow hedges, amounts deferred in equity are taken to the income statement at the same time as the related cash flow.\n\nWhen a derivative no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss remains in equity until the related cash flow occurs. When the cash flow takes place, the cumulative gain or loss is taken to the income statement. If the hedged cash flow is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss is taken to the income statement immediately.\n\n## (iii) Net investment hedges (a)\n\nCertain derivatives are designated as hedges of the currency risk on the Group's investment in foreign subsidiaries. The accounting policy for these arrangements is set out in note 1.\n\n## (iv) Derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied\n\nDerivatives not classified as hedges are held in order to hedge certain balance sheet items and commodity exposures. No hedge accounting is applied to these derivatives, which are carried at fair value with changes being recognised in the income statement.\n\n- (a) Applying hedge accounting has not led to material ineffectiveness being recognised in the income statement for both 2023 and 2022. Fair value changes on basis spread is recorded in a separate account within equity.\n\nThe Group is exposed to the following risks that arise from its use of financial instruments, the management of which is described in the following sections:\n\n- \u25a0 liquidity risk (see note 16A);\n- \u25a0 market risk (see note 16B); and\n- \u25a0 credit risk (see note 17B).\n\nThe Group's risk management framework is established to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to maintain adherence to these limits.\n\n## 16A. Management of liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will face in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due without incurring unacceptable losses. In doing this, management considers both normal and stressed conditions. A material and sustained shortfall in our cash flow could undermine the Group's credit rating, impair investor confidence and also restrict the Group's ability to raise funds.\n\nThe Group's funding strategy was supported by cash delivery from the business, coupled with the proceeds from bond issuances. Surplus cash balances have been invested conservatively with low-risk counter-parties at maturities of primarily less than six months. In its liquidity assessment, the Group does not consider any supplier financing arrangements as these arrangements are non-recourse to Unilever and supplier payment dates and terms for Unilever do not vary based on whether the supplier chooses to use such financing arrangements.\n\nCash flow from operating activities provides the funds to service the financing of financial liabilities on a day-to-day basis. The Group seeks to manage its liquidity requirements by maintaining access to global debt markets through short-term and long-term debt programmes. In addition, Unilever has committed credit facilities for general corporate use.\n\nOn 31 December 2023, Unilever had undrawn revolving 364-day bilateral credit facilities in aggregate of $5,200 million and \u20ac2,600 million (2022: $5,200 million and \u20ac2,550 million ) with a 364-day term out. As part of the regular annual process, the intention is that these facilities will again be renewed in 2024.",

Management of market risk\n\nUnilever's size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise from its use of financial instruments:\n\n- \u25a0 commodity price risk;\n- \u25a0 currency risk; and\n- \u25a0 interest rate risk.\n\nThe above risks may affect the Group's income and expenses, or the value of its financial instruments. The objective of the Group's management of market risk is to maintain this risk within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns. Generally, the Group applies hedge accounting to manage the volatility in income statement arising from market risk.\n\nWhere the Group uses hedge accounting to mitigate the above risks, it is normally implemented centrally by either the Treasury or Commodity Risk Management teams, in line with their respective frameworks and strategies. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship continues to exist between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The Group generally enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match exactly with the hedged item, meaning that the economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument is evident, so only a qualitative assessment is performed. When a qualitative assessment is not considered sufficient, for example when the critical terms of the hedging instrument do not match exactly with the hedged item, a quantitative assessment of hedge effectiveness will also be performed. The hedge ratio is set on inception for all hedge relationships and is dependent on the alignment of the critical terms of the hedging instrument to the hedged item (in most instances these are matched, so the hedge ratio is 1:1).",

Management of market risk continued\n\nPotential impact of risk\n\nManagement policy and\n\n## Currency risk on the Group's net investments\n\nThe Group is also subject to currency risk in relation to the translation of the net investments of its foreign operations into euros for inclusion in its consolidated financial statements.\n\nThese net investments include Group financial loans, which are monetary items that form part of our net investment in foreign operations, of \u20ac13.0 billion (2022: \u20ac13.0 billion), of which \u20ac9.0 billion (2022: \u20ac8.8 billion) is denominated in GBP. In accordance with IAS 21, the exchange differences on these financial loans are booked through reserves.\n\nPart of the currency exposure on the Group's investments is also managed using USD net investment hedges with a nominal value of \u20ac2.6 billion (2022: \u20ac2.8 billion) for USD.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the net exposure of the net investments in foreign currencies amounts to \u20ac26.2 billion (2022: \u20ac23.7 billion).\n\n(a)\n\n## (iii) Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to market interest rate fluctuations on its floating-rate debt. Increases in benchmark interest rates could increase the interest cost of our floating-rate debt and increase the cost of future borrowings. The Group's ability to manage interest costs also has an impact on reported results.\n\nThe Group does not have any material floating interest-bearing financial assets or any significant long-term fixed interest-bearing financial assets. Consequently, the Group's interest rate risk arises mainly from financial liabilities other than lease liabilities.\n\nTaking into account the impact of interest rate swaps, at 31 December 2023, interest rates were fixed on approximately 70% of the expected financial liabilities (excluding lease liabilities) for 2024, and 59% for 2025 (68% for 2023 and 59% for 2024 at 31 December 2022).\n\nAs at year end, the Group had the below notional amount of interest rate derivatives outstanding on which hedge accounting is applied:\n\n| Cash flow hedge   | \u20ac million 2023   | \u20ac million 2022   |\n|-------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Currency          | 2,605            | 1,923            |\n| EUR               | 1,250            | -                |\n| USD               | 1,355            | 1,923            |\n| Fair value hedge  |                  |                  |\n| Currency          | 3,566            | 3,606            |\n| EUR               | 2,000            | 2,000            |\n| USD               | 1,220            | 1,267            |\n| GBP               | 346              | 339              |\n\nFor interest management purposes, transactions with a maturity shorter than six months from inception date are not included as fixed interest transactions.\n\nThe average interest rate on short-term borrowings in 2023 was 5.9% (2022: 1.2%).\n\nhedging strategy\n\nUnilever aims to minimise this currency risk on the Group's net investment exposure by borrowing in local currency in the operating companies themselves. In some locations, however, the Group's ability to do this is inhibited by local regulations, lack of local liquidity or by local market conditions.\n\nTreasury may decide on a case-by-case basis to actively hedge the currency exposure from net investment in foreign operations. This is done either through additional borrowings in the related currency, or through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.\n\nWhere local currency borrowings, or forward contracts, are used to hedge the currency risk in relation to the Group's net investment in foreign subsidiaries, these relationships are designated as net investment hedges for accounting purposes.\n\nExchange risk related to the principal amount of the USD denominated debt either forms part of hedging relationship itself, or is hedged through forward contracts.\n\nUnilever's interest rate management approach aims for an optimal balance between fixedand floating-rate interest rate exposures on expected financial liabilities. The objective of this approach is to minimise annual interest costs.\n\nThis is achieved either by issuing fixed- or floating-rate long-term debt, or by modifying interest rate exposure through the use of interest rate swaps.\n\nThe majority of the Group's existing interest rate derivatives are designated as fair value hedges and are expected to be effective. The fair value movement of these derivatives is recognised in the income statement, along with any changes in the relevant fair value of the underlying hedged asset or liability.\n\n## Sensitivity to the risk\n\n## Impact on equity - net investment hedges\n\nA 10% strengthening of the euro against other currencies would have led to \u20ac260 million (2022: \u20ac280 million) loss in the equity on the net investment hedges used to manage the currency exposure on the Group's investments.\n\nA 10% weakening of the euro against other currencies would have led to an equal but opposite effect.\n\n## Impact on equity - net investments in group companies\n\nA 10% strengthening of the euro against all other currencies would have led to \u20ac2,620 million negative retranslation effect (2022: \u20ac2,370 million negative retranslation effect).\n\nA 10% weakening of the euro against all other currencies would have led to an equal but opposite effect.\n\nIn line with accepted hedge accounting treatment and our accounting policy for financial loans, the retranslation differences would be recognised in equity.\n\n## Impact on income statement\n\nAssuming that all other variables remain constant, a 1.0 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on a full-year basis as at 31 December 2023 would have led to an additional \u20ac77 million of additional finance cost (2022: \u20ac85 million additional finance costs).\n\nA 1.0 percentage point decrease in floating interest rates on a full-year basis would have led to an equal but opposite effect.\n\n## Impact on equity - cash flow hedges\n\nAssuming that all other variables remain constant, a 1.0 percentage point increase in interest rates on a full-year basis as at 31 December 2023 would have led to an additional \u20ac7 million debit in equity from derivatives in cash flow hedge relationships (2022: \u20ac1 million credit).\n\nA 1.0 percentage point decrease in interest rates on a full-year basis would have led to an additional \u20ac8 million credit in equity from derivatives in cash flow hedge relationships (2022: \u20ac1 million debit).",

Derivatives and hedging continued\n\n## Master netting or similar agreements\n\nA number of legal entities within the Group enter into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements. In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counter-party on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. In certain circumstances, such as when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions.\n\nThe ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting the positive and negative values in the consolidated balance sheet. This is because the Group does not have a legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts against counterparties, as the right to offset is enforceable only upon the occurrence of credit events such as a default.\n\nThe column 'Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet - Financial instruments' shows the netting impact of our ISDA agreements, assuming the agreements are respected in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\n## (i) Financial assets\n\nThe following financial assets are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements.\n\n|                             |                                                         |                                                                                       |                                                                             | Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet   | Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet   |                      |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2023      | \u20ac million Gross amounts of  recognised financial assets | \u20ac million Gross amounts  of recognised financial assets  set off in the balance sheet | \u20ac million Net amounts of  financial assets  presented in the  balance sheet | \u20ac million Financial  instruments                   | \u20ac million Cash  collateral received                | \u20ac million Net amount |\n| Derivative financial assets | 191                                                     | (42)                                                                                  | 149                                                                         | (122)                                              | (6)                                                | 21                   |\n| As at 31 December 2022      |                                                         |                                                                                       |                                                                             |                                                    |                                                    |                      |\n| Derivative financial assets | 449                                                     | (71)                                                                                  | 378                                                                         | (272)                                              | (81)                                               | 25                   |\n\n## (ii) Financial liabilities\n\nThe following financial liabilities are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements.\n\n|                                  |                                                               |                                                                                             |                                                                                   | Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet   | Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet   |                      |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2023           | \u20ac million Gross amounts  of recognised financial  liabilities | \u20ac million Gross amounts  of recognised financial  liabilities  set off in the balance sheet | \u20ac million Net amounts  of financial  liabilities  presented in the  balance sheet | \u20ac million Financial  instruments                   | \u20ac million Cash  collateral received                | \u20ac million Net amount |\n| Derivative financial liabilities | (601)                                                         | 42                                                                                          | (559)                                                                             | 122                                                | -

        "page_content": "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Unilever Group\n\n## 17. Investment and return\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet include deposits, investments in money market funds and highly liquid investments. To be classified as cash and cash equivalents, an asset must:\n\n- \u25a0 be readily convertible into cash;\n- \u25a0 have an insignificant risk of changes in value; and\n- \u25a0 have a maturity period of typically three months or less at acquisition.\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement also include bank overdrafts and are recorded at amortised cost.\n\n## Other financial assets\n\nThe Group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories:\n\n- \u25a0 those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss), and\n- \u25a0 those to be measured at amortised cost.\n\nThis classification depends on our business model for managing the financial asset and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\n\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in the income statement.\n\nAll financial assets are either debt instruments or equity instruments. Debt instruments are those that provide the Group with a contractual right to receive cash or another asset. Equity instruments are those where the Group has no contractual right to receive cash or another asset.\n\n## Debt instruments\n\nThe subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories that debt instruments are classified as:\n\n- \u25a0 financial assets at amortised cost;\n- \u25a0 financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income; or\n- \u25a0 financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## (i) Amortised cost\n\nAssets measured at amortised cost are those which are held to collect contractual cash flows on the repayment of principal or interest (SPPI). A gain or loss on a debt investment recognised at amortised cost on derecognition or impairment is recognised in the income statement. Interest income is recognised within finance income using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## (ii) Fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nAssets that are held at fair value through other comprehensive income are those that are held to collect contractual cash flows on the repayment of principal and interest and which are held to recognise a capital gain through the sale of the asset. Movements in the carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income except for the recognition of impairment, interest income and foreign exchange gains or losses which are recognised in the income statement. On derecognition, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the income statement. Interest income is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## (iii) Fair value through profit or loss\n\nAssets that do not meet the criteria for either amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income are measured as fair value through profit or loss. Related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Unless they form part of a hedging relationship, these assets are held at fair value, with changes being recognised in the income statement. Interest income from these assets is included within finance income.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nThe Group subsequently measures all equity instruments at fair value. Where the Group has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains or losses to profit or loss. Dividends from these investments continue to be recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nFinancial instruments classified as amortised cost and debt instruments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income are assessed for impairment. The Group assesses the probability of default of an asset at initial recognition and then whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis.\n\nTo assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. It considers available reasonable and supportive forwarding-looking information. Macroeconomic information (such as market interest rates or growth rates) is also considered.\n\nFinancial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a repayment plan with the company. Impairment losses on assets classified as amortised cost are recognised in the income statement. When a later event causes the impairment losses to decrease, the reduction in impairment loss is also recognised in the income statement. Permanent impairment losses on debt instruments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement.",

The Group's cash resources and other financial assets are shown below.\n\n| Financial assets (a)                                                   | \u20ac million Current 2023   | \u20ac million Non-current 2023   | \u20ac million Total 2023   | \u20ac million Current 2022   | \u20ac million Non-current 2022   | \u20ac million Total 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                              |                          |                              |                        |                          |                              |                        |\n| Cash at bank and in hand                                               | 2,862                    | -

These companies provide loans to our subsidiaries that are also funded through retained earnings and third-party borrowings. The Group maintain access to global debt markets through an infrastructure of short-and long-term debt programmes. The Group make use of plain vanilla derivatives, such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, to help mitigate risks. More detail is provided in notes 16, 16A, 16B and 16C on pages 208 to 214.\n\nThe remaining \u20ac3.3 billion (or 79%) of the Group's cash and cash equivalents are held in foreign subsidiaries which repatriate distributable reserves on a regular basis. For most countries, this is done through dividends which are in some cases subject to withholding or distribution tax. This balance includes \u20ac98 million (2022: \u20ac449 million) of cash that is held in a few countries where we face cross-border foreign exchange controls and/ or other legal restrictions that inhibit our ability to make these balances available for general use by the wider business. The cash will generally be invested or held in the relevant country and, given the other capital resources available to the Group, does not significantly affect the ability of the Group to meet its cash obligations.",

Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations. Additional information in relation to credit risk on trade receivables is given in note 13. These risks are generally managed by local controllers. Credit risk related to the use of treasury instruments, including those held at amortised cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income, is managed on a Group basis. This risk arises from transactions with financial institutions involving cash and cash equivalents, deposits and derivative financial instruments. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets. To reduce this risk, Unilever has concentrated its main activities with a limited number of counter-parties which have secure credit ratings. Individual risk limits are set for each counter-party based on financial position, credit rating and past experience. Credit limits and concentration of exposures are actively monitored by the Group's Treasury department. Netting agreements are also put in place with Unilever's principal counter-parties. In the case of a default, these arrangements would allow Unilever to net assets and liabilities across transactions with that counter-party. To further reduce the Group's credit exposures on derivative financial instruments, Unilever has collateral agreements with Unilever's principal counter-parties in relation to derivative financial instruments. Under these arrangements, counter-parties are required to deposit securities and/or cash as a collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative financial instruments. At 31 December 2023, the collateral held by Unilever under such arrangements amounted to \u20ac6 million (2022: \u20ac97 million), of which \u20ac6 million (2022: \u20ac81 million) was in cash, and nil in 2023 (2022: \u20ac16 million) was in the form of bond securities. The non-cash collateral has not been recognised as an asset in the Group's balance sheet.\n\nFurther details in relation to the Group's exposure to credit risk are shown in note 13 and note 16A.\n\n## 18.

The fair value of trade receivables and payables is considered to be equal to the carrying amount of these items due to their short-term nature.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe fair values shown in notes 15C and 17A have been classified into three categories depending on the inputs used in the valuation technique. The categories used are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Level 1: quoted prices for identical instruments;\n- \u25a0 Level 2: directly or indirectly observable market inputs, other than Level 1 inputs; and\n- \u25a0 Level 3: inputs which are not based on observable market data.",

There were also no significant movements between the fair value levels since 31 December 2022.\n\nThe impact in 2023 income statement due to Level 3 instruments is a loss of \u20ac(68) million (2022: gain of \u20ac11 million).\n\nReconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities is given below:\n\n| Reconciliation of movements in Level 3 valuations       | \u20ac million 2023   | \u20ac million 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 1 January                                               | 696              | 748              |\n| Gains/(losses) recognised in income statement           | (68)             | 11               |\n| Gains/(losses) recognised in other comprehensive income | (8)              | 55               |\n| Purchases and new issues                                | 71               | 94               |\n| Sales and settlements*                                  | (7)              | (212)            |\n| 31 December                                             | 684              | 696              |\n\n## Significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair values\n\nAssets valued using Level 3 techniques include \u20ac584 million (2022: \u20ac623 million) relating to a number of unlisted investments within Unilever Ventures companies, none of which are individually material; \u20ac161 million (2022: \u20ac122 million) of long-term cash receivables under life insurance policies and \u20ac31 million (2022: \u20ac41 million) for option to acquire non-controlling interest. Valuation techniques used are specific to each asset and liability, a change in one or more of the inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change the value significantly for all assets and liabilities.\n\n## Calculation of fair values\n\nThe fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values are consistent with those used in the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\n## Assets and liabilities carried at fair value\n\n- \u25a0 The fair values of quoted investments falling into Level 1 are based on current bid prices.\n- \u25a0 The fair values of unquoted financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and at fair value through profit or loss are based on recent trades in liquid markets, observable market rates, discounted cash flow analysis and statistical modelling techniques such as the Monte Carlo simulation. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.\n- \u25a0 Derivatives are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counter-parties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodities.\n- \u25a0 For listed securities where the market is not liquid, and for unlisted securities, valuation techniques are used. These include the use of recent arm's length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same and discounted cash flow calculations.\n\n## Other financial assets and liabilities (fair values for disclosure purposes only)\n\n- \u25a0 Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other current receivables, bank loans and overdrafts, trade payables and other current liabilities have fair values that approximate to their carrying amounts due to their short-term nature.\n- \u25a0 The fair values of listed bonds are based on their market value.\n- \u25a0 Non-listed bonds, other loans, bank loans and non-current receivables and payables are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash flows associated with these instruments using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.\n\n## Policies and processes used in relation to the calculation of Level 3 fair values\n\nAssets valued using Level 3 valuation techniques are primarily made up of long-term cash receivables and unlisted investments. Valuation techniques used are specific to the circumstances involved. Unlisted investments include \u20ac584 million (2022: \u20ac623 million) of investments within Unilever Ventures companies.",

The Group expects these provisions to be substantially utilised within the next few years.\n\nThe Group is involved from time to time in legal and arbitration proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. As previously disclosed, along with other consumer product companies and retail customers, Unilever is involved in a number of ongoing investigations by national competition authorities. These proceedings and investigations are at various stages and concern a variety of product markets. Where specific issues arise, provisions are made to the extent appropriate. Due to the nature of the legal cases, the timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain.\n\nProvisions for Brazil indirect taxes are separate from the matters listed as contingent liabilities in note 20. Unilever does not have provisions and contingent liabilities for the same matters. Due to the nature of disputed indirect taxes, the timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain.\n\nOther includes provisions for indirect taxes in countries other than Brazil, interest on tax provisions and provisions for various other matters. The timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain.\n\n## 20. Commitments and contingent liabilities\n\n## Commitments\n\nLease commitments are the future cash outflows from the lease contracts which are not recorded in the measurement of lease liabilities. These include potential future payments related to leases of low-value assets, leases which are less than twelve months, variable leases, extension and termination options and leases not yet commenced but which we have committed to.\n\nOther commitments principally comprise commitments under contract to purchase materials and services. They do not include commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment, which are reported in note 10 on pages 197 to 199.\n\n| Lease commitments and other commitments fall due as follows:   |   \u20ac million Leases 2023 |   \u20ac million Leases 2022 | \u20ac million Other  Commitments 2023   | \u20ac million Other  Commitments 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Within 1 year                                                  |                      64 |                      64 | 1,510                               | 1,806                               |\n| Later than 1 year but not later than 5 years                   |                      79 |                      91 | 2,595                               | 2,020                               |\n| Later than 5 years                                             |                     148 |                     164 | 265                                 | 231                                 |\n|                                                                |                     291 |                     319 | 4,370                               | 4,057                               |",

Commitments and contingent liabilities continued\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nContingent liabilities are either possible obligations that will probably not require a transfer of economic benefits, or present obligations that may, but probably will not, require a transfer of economic benefits. It is not appropriate to make provisions for contingent liabilities, but there is a chance that they will result in an obligation in the future. Assessing the amount of liabilities that are not probable is highly judgemental, so contingent liabilities are disclosed on the basis of the known maximum exposure.\n\nContingent liabilities arise in respect of litigations against group companies, investigations by competition, regulatory and fiscal authorities and obligations arising under environmental legislation. In many markets, there is a high degree of complexity involved in the local tax regimes. The majority of contingent liabilities are in respect of fiscal matters in Brazil, with no other contingent liability being individually material.\n\nIn the case of fiscal matters, the known maximum exposure is the amount included in a tax assessment.\n\n| Summary of contingent liabilities                                  | \u20ac million 2023   | \u20ac million 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Corporate reorganisation - IPI, PIS and COFINS taxes and penalties | 3,757            | 3,292            |\n| Inputs for PIS and COFINS taxes                                    | 40               | 40               |\n| Goodwill amortisation                                              | 174              | 154              |\n| Other tax assessments - approximately 700 cases                    | 983              | 876              |\n| Total Brazil Tax                                                   | 4,954            | 4,362            |\n| Other contingent liabilities                                       | 575              | 609              |\n| Total contingent liabilities                                       | 5,529            | 4,971            |\n\n## Brazil tax\n\nDuring 2004, and in common with many other businesses operating in Brazil, one of our Brazilian subsidiaries received a notice of infringement from the Federal Revenue Service in respect of indirect taxes regarding corporate reorganisation. The notice alleges that a 2001 reorganisation of our local corporate structure was undertaken without a valid business purpose. The 2001 reorganisation was comparable with restructuring done by many companies in Brazil. The original dispute was resolved in the courts in the Group's favour. However, in 2013 a new assessment was raised in respect of a similar matter. Additionally, during the course of 2014 and between 2017 and 2023, other notices of infringement were issued based on the same grounds argued in the previous assessments. The total amount of the tax assessments in respect of this matter is \u20ac3,757 million (2022: \u20ac3,292 million).\n\nThe Group believes that the likelihood that the Brazilian tax authorities will ultimately prevail is low, however there can be no guarantee of success in court. In each case we believe our position is strong, so they have not been provided for and are considered to be contingent liabilities. Due to the fiscal environment in Brazil, there remains the possibility of material tax assessments related to the same matters for periods not yet assessed. We expect that tax litigation cases related to this matter may move from the Administrative to the Judicial Courts, although the exact timing is uncertain. In such case, we will be required to make a judicial deposit or provide a guarantee in respect of the disputed tax, interest and penalties. The judicial process in Brazil is likely to take a number of years to conclude.\n\nThe contingent liabilities reported for indirect taxes relating to disputes with the Brazilian authorities are separate from the provisions listed in note 19. Unilever does not hold provisions and contingent liabilities for the same matters.\n\n## 21. Acquisitions and disposals\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method as at the acquisition date, which is the date at which control is transferred to the Group.\n\nGoodwill is measured at the acquisition date as the fair value of consideration transferred, plus non-controlling interests and the fair value of any previously held equity interests less the net recognised amount (which is generally fair value) of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is subject to an annual review for impairment (or more frequently if necessary) in accordance with our accounting policies. Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises. Detailed information relating to goodwill is provided in note 9 on pages 195 to 197.\n\nNon-controlling interests are valued based on the proportion of net assets of the acquired company at the date of acquisition.\n\nTransaction costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nChanges in ownership that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions and therefore do not have any impact on goodwill. The difference between consideration and the non-controlling share of net assets acquired is recognised within equity.",

The acquisition complements Unilever's existing  Health & Wellbeing portfolio, bringing to market a science-led approach to hair wellness. Further details are  provided below. |\n\n## Nutrafol Acquisition\n\nOn 7 July 2022, Unilever acquired a further 67% of the shares of Nutrafol, a US-based hair wellness company in which Unilever Ventures previously held a minority stake (13%), to bring Unilever's total equity interest to 80%. The fair value of Unilever Ventures' equity interest in Nutrafol before the business combination amounted to \u20ac157 million, with a gain of \u20ac149 million recognised as Other Comprehensive Income prior to derecognition of the investment. Strategically, Nutrafol expands our Health & Wellbeing portfolio, bringing to market a science-led approach to hair wellness supported by digital-first capabilities. We believe Unilever's capabilities and sustainability principles will allow us to protect the legacy of the brand while strengthening it.\n\nThe total consideration paid for the 67% share of Nutrafol was \u20ac811 million, all of which was settled in cash on completion.\n\nThe fair value of net assets recognised on the balance sheet was \u20ac487 million. The main asset acquired was the brand intangible valued using an income approach model by estimating future cash flows generated by the brand and discounting them to present value using rates in line with a market participant expectation. The key assumptions in the brand valuation were revenue growth and discount rates. A deferred tax liability primarily related to the brand intangibles estimated at \u20ac153 million was also recognised. As part of the acquisition, goodwill of \u20ac580 million was recognised and was not deductible for tax purposes.\n\n## Effect on consolidated income statement\n\nThe acquisition deals completed in 2023 have contributed \u20ac82 million to the Group turnover and \u20ac18 million to the Group operating profit since the date of acquisition. If the acquisition deals completed in 2023 had all taken place at the beginning of the year, Group turnover would have been \u20ac59,709 million, and Group operating profit would have been \u20ac9,780 million. In 2022, the impact of acquisitions completed in the year was \u20ac174 million to Group turnover and \u20ac31 million to Group operating profit since the date of acquisition. If all of the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of 2022, Group turnover for 2022 would have been \u20ac60,206 million and Group operating profit would have been \u20ac10,772 million.",

Assets and liabilities held for sale\n\nNon-current assets and groups of assets and liabilities which comprise disposal groups are classified as 'held for sale' when all of the following criteria are met: a decision has been made to sell; the assets are available for sale immediately; the assets are being actively marketed; and a sale has been agreed or is expected to be concluded within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\nImmediately prior to classification as held for sale, the non-current assets or groups of assets are remeasured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Subsequently, non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are valued at the lower of book value or fair value less disposal costs. Assets held for sale are neither depreciated nor amortised.\n\nNon-current assets and liabilities held for sale are recognised as current on the balance sheet.\n\nOn 18 December 2023, Unilever announced that it has received a binding offer from Yellow Wood Partners LLC to acquire Elida Beauty.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Company Accounts Unilever PLC\n\n## Accounting information and policies\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe Company Accounts of PLC are prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and UK-adopted international accounting standards. The Company accounts comply with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of financial assets classified as 'fair value through other comprehensive income' or 'fair value through profit or loss', as well as derivative financial instruments, which are reported in accordance with the accounting policies set out below.\n\nUnilever PLC is included within the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with IFRS. As PLC does not have cash and cash equivalents, we are no longer presenting a separate statement of cash flows.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies of PLC Company Accounts are the same as the Unilever Group, refer to pages 177 to 179, except for the accounting policies included below.\n\n## Foreign currency\n\nThe Company's functional and presentational currency is pound sterling. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the Company's functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the date the fair value was determined. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Turnover\n\nTurnover excludes value added tax and includes royalties and service fees received from group companies. Royalty income from brand and technology licence arrangements is recognised at the time sales are made by group companies. Revenue from services is recognised over time based on the usage of these services by group companies.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nThe operating profit is stated after deducting the costs that are mainly related to the royalties and delivered services. Expenses are allocated to the period in which they relate.\n\nThe operating profit includes residual central group costs charged to PLC from another group company, Unilever Europe Business Centre B.V. (UEBC). These residual costs arise because central group costs are incurred and charged out to group entities by UEBC, but some of these are not able to be recovered by UEBC. These costs are recharged to PLC as the ultimate parent entity of the Group.\n\n## Investment in subsidiaries\n\nShares in group companies are stated at cost less any amounts written off to reflect an impairment.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nWhere PLC enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, they consider these to be insurance arrangements and account for them as such. IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' has been released and is mandatory for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The standard provides that wherein the issuer has explicitly asserted that it regards financial guarantees as insurance contracts and has used accounting applicable to insurance contracts, the issuer may choose to apply either IFRS 17 or IAS 32, IFRS 7 and IFRS 9 to account for such guarantees. Unilever has made an election to apply IAS 32, IFRS 7 and IFRS 9 and it will be treated as a change in accounting policy, with restatement of comparatives for the previous reporting period.\n\n## Capital Redemption Reserve\n\nThe nominal value of shares cancelled is transferred from share capital to the capital redemption reserve.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements and estimates in the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and judgements are periodically evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future period affected.\n\nThere are no judgements and estimates which management believe have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the PLC Company Accounts.\n\n## 1.

On 10 June 2021, the Finance Act 2021 received Royal Assent, confirming that the UK rate of corporation tax increased from 19% to 25% from 1 April 2023. This has a consequential impact on the company's tax charge. Deferred tax balances are measured at the tax rate to be applied when temporary differences are expected to reverse in the future.",

The shares of HUL are listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange and have a market value of \u00a327,980 million (2022: \u00a328,588 million) as at 31 December 2023. Information on the non-controlling interest in HUL is given in note 15B of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries comprise equity shares of group companies. These investments only generate cash inflows in combination with other\n\nassets within the Group. Accordingly, cash inflows are not independent at any level below the cash generating units (CGUs) used for group impairment testing purposes. Additionally, some investments benefit from the synergies of multiple CGUs together. Management evaluates on a case-to-case basis whether any impairment booked for the Group impacts the carrying value of the investments. Based on the evaluation for the current year, management has not determined any indicators of impairment for investments.\n\n## 5.

As these are amounts due from other entities within the Group, PLC has estimated the expected credit losses to be immaterial. Our historical experience of collecting these balances supported by the level of default confirms that the credit risk is low.\n\n## 6.

Treasury risk management\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risks from its use of financial instruments, the management of which is described in note 16B on pages 210 to 213 in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Market risks\n\nCurrency risk\n\nThe Company's functional and presentational currency is pound sterling, however the Company is exposed to loans and amounts due from or owed to the group companies, and bonds that are denominated in other currencies. The Company's exposure for holding monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than its functional currency is \u00a313 million (2022: \u00a336 million). The Company entered into derivatives to mitigate the foreign currency risk but does not apply hedge accounting.\n\nCurrency sensitivity analysis\n\nThe sensitivity analysis below details the Company's sensitivity to a 10% change in the foreign currencies against the pound sterling. These percentages represent management's assessment of the possible changes in the foreign exchange rates at the respective year-ends. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period-end for the above percentage change in foreign currency rates.\n\nA 10% strengthening of the foreign currencies against the pound sterling would have led to approximately an additional \u00a31 million gain in the income statement (2022: \u00a34 million gain).\n\nA 10% weakening of the foreign currencies against the pound sterling would have led to an equal but opposite effect.\n\nInterest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risks on its interest-bearing loans and amounts due from or owed to the group companies, commercial papers and bonds issued which are swapped to floating rate. Increases in benchmark interest rates would increase the interest income and interest cost.\n\nInterest rate sensitivity analysis\n\nThe sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the statement of financial position date.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Company had \u00a3300 million (2022: \u00a3300 million) of outstanding fixed-to-float interest rate swaps on which fair value hedge accounting is applied.\n\nThe following changes in the interest rates represent management's assessment of the possible change in interest rates at the respective year-ends:\n\nAssuming that all variables remain constant, a 1.0 percentage point increase in floating interest rates on a full-year basis as at 31 December 2023 would have led to an additional \u00a387 million of finance cost (2022: \u00a379 million additional finance cost).\n\nA 1.0 percentage point decrease in floating interest rate on a full-year basis would have an equal but opposite effect.\n\n## 11. Transactions with related parties\n\nA related party is a person or entity that is related to PLC. These include both people and entities that have, or are subject to, the influence or control of PLC. Information on key management personnel has been given in note 23 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe following related party balances existed with group companies at 31 December.\n\n|                                                        | \u00a3 million 31 Dec 2023   | \u00a3 million 31 Dec 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Trading and other balances due from/(to)  subsidiaries | (6,298)                 | (5,665)                 |\n| Loans due from/(to) subsidiaries                       | (1,442)                 | (1,433)                 |\n\nRefer to notes 5, 6 and 7 for an explanation of these balances.\n\nThe following related party transactions took place during the year with subsidiaries:\n\n|                                   | \u00a3 million 2023   | \u00a3 million 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Turnover                          |                  |                  |\n| Royalties                         | 6                | 104              |\n| Services                          | 76               | 107              |\n| Others                            |                  |                  |\n| Dividends received                | 5,598            | 3,237            |\n| Loans and related interest        | (380)            | (79)             |\n| Incurred costs and royalties paid | (904)            | (248)            |\n\nInformation on guarantees given by PLC to group companies is given in note 12 of the Company Accounts.\n\n## 12. Contingent liabilities and financial commitments\n\nPost the implementation of IFRS 17, there are no amounts to disclose. Please see note 8 for further details for these liabilities, commitments and guarantees.\n\nThere are also certain financial commitments which are not included in the total amount of financial guarantees because they do not currently relate to existing liabilities or cannot be quantified:\n\n- \u25a0 PLC and Unilever United States, Inc. have guaranteed the standby facilities of $5,200 million and \u20ac2,600 million (2022: $5,200 million and \u20ac2,550 million) for the group companies which remain undrawn as at 31 December 2023 and 2022;\n- \u25a0 The joint and several liability undertakings issued by NV in accordance with Article 2:403 of the Dutch Civil Code for almost all of its Dutch group companies were withdrawn by means of filings with the Dutch Trade Register on 27 November 2020, being the last practicable date prior to the effective date of the cross-border merger between NV and PLC. With effect from the date of the cross-border merger, PLC issued a guarantee confirming PLC's liability for any residual liability (referred to in Article 2:404 (2) of the Dutch Civil Code) of NV remaining after the withdrawal of such undertakings, to the extent that such liability did not transfer in the cross-border merger; and\n- \u25a0 PLC has guaranteed some contingent consideration of group companies relating to past business acquisitions and financial commitments including (indemnities arising from past business disposals) as well as certain global and regional contracts.\n\n## 13. Remuneration of auditors\n\nThe parent company accounts of Unilever PLC are required to comply with the Companies (Disclosure of Auditor Remuneration and Liability Limitation Agreements) Regulations 2008. For details of the remuneration of the auditors, please refer to note 25 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 14. Remuneration of Directors\n\nInformation about the remuneration of Directors is given in the tables noted as audited in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 116 to 153. Information on key management compensation is provided in note 4A to the consolidated financial statements on page 184.\n\n## 15. Post-balance sheet events\n\n## Dividend\n\nOn 8 February 2024, the Directors announced a dividend of \u00a30.3647 per PLC ordinary share. Dividends will be paid out of retained profit. The dividend is payable on 22 March 2024 to shareholders registered at the close of business on 23 February 2024.\n\n## Functional currency\n\nEffective from 1 January 2024, the functional currency of Unilever PLC ('PLC'), the Group's ultimate parent company, has changed from sterling to euro. This follows a review and subsequent change of the internal debt of PLC, from sterling to euro, which triggered a formal evaluation of PLC's functional currency in line with relevant accounting standards. The change is applied prospectively.",

The average number of employees during 2023 included 129 seasonal workers. We believe our relationship with our employees and any labour unions of which they may be part is satisfactory in all material respects.\n\n## Global employee share plans (SHARES)\n\nIn November 2014, Unilever's global employee plan 'SHARES' was launched in 17 countries. SHARES gives eligible Unilever employees below management level the opportunity to invest between \u20ac10 and \u20ac200 per month from their net salary in Unilever shares. For every three shares our employees buy (Investment Shares), Unilever will give them one free Matching Share, which will vest if employees hold their Investment Shares for at least three years. The Matching Shares are not subject to any performance conditions. In 2015, SHARES was rolled out globally and is now offered in more than 100 countries. Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in SHARES. As of 22 February 2024 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report), awards for 331,195 PLC shares were outstanding under SHARES.\n\n## North American share plans\n\nUnilever also maintains share plans for its North American employees that are governed by an umbrella plan referred to as the Unilever North America Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, which was amended and restated as of 29 November 2022 to authorise the issue of newly issued Unilever Ordinary Shares under the Plan. These plans are the North American equivalents of the Unilever Share Plan 2017 and SHARES plans, as amended from time to time. The rules governing these share plans are materially the same as the rules governing the Unilever Share Plan 2017 and SHARES plans, respectively. However, the plans contain non-competition and non-solicitation covenants and they are subject to US and Canadian employment and tax laws. The plans are administered by the North America Compensation Committee of Unilever United States, Inc. and they are governed by New York law.\n\nThe foregoing description of the Unilever North America Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Unilever North America Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, including all amendments thereto, filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form S-8 (File No. 333-185299) filed with the SEC on 12 December 2022.\n\n## Compensation Committee\n\nThe Committee is concerned with the remuneration of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors and the tier of management directly below the Board. The Committee also has responsibility for the cash and executive and all-employee share-based incentive plans, the Remuneration Policy and performance evaluation of the Unilever Leadership Executive and the periodic review of the remuneration and related policies of the wider workforce to assess alignment to PLC's purpose, value and strategy.\n\n## Directors and senior management\n\n## Family relationship\n\nThere are no family relationships between any of our Executive Directors, members of the ULE or Non-Executive Directors.\n\n## Other arrangements\n\nNone of our Non-Executive Directors, Executive Directors or other key management personnel are elected or appointed under any arrangement or understanding with any major shareholder, customer, supplier or others. As mentioned on page 141, Nelson Peltz, a Non-Executive Director, is the Chief Executive and founding partner of Trian Fund Management, LP, which held interests in approximately 1.5% of Unilever's issued share capital as at 22 February 2024.",

The Company's ordinary shares are also listed and traded on Euronext Amsterdam.\n\nIn the United States, Unilever PLC American Depositary Receipts are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (Deutsche Bank) acts for PLC as depositary.\n\nAt 22 February 2024 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report), there were 1,878 registered holders of Unilever PLC American Depositary Receipts in the United States.

Similarly, other than certain economic sanctions which may be in force from time to time, there are no limitations relating only to non-residents of the UK under English law or the PLC's Articles of Association on the right to be a holder of, and to vote in respect of, the company's shares.\n\n## Unilever Annual Report on Form 20-F 2023\n\nFiled with the SEC on the SEC's website. Printed copies are available, free of charge, upon request to Unilever PLC, Investor Relations department, 100 Victoria Embankment, London, EC4Y 0DY United Kingdom.\n\n## Documents on display in the United States\n\nUnilever files and furnishes reports and information with the United States SEC. Certain of our reports and other information that we file or furnish to the SEC are also available to the public over the internet on the SEC's website.\n\n## 2022 compared to 2021 Financial Performance\n\nWe have not included a discussion of year-over-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 in this Annual Report on Form 20-F. This discussion can be found in 'Group Financial Review', 'Business Group Review', Planet & Society', 'Financial Performance' and 'Financial Statements' in our annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2022 filed with the SEC on 13 March 2023.\n\n## Other information on the Company\n\n## Innovation, Research and Development\n\nWe have over 20,000 patents protecting the discoveries and breakthroughs that our global team of 5,000 world-leading experts produce. We have invested around \u20ac900m in R&D in each of the last three years.\n\nWe strive to create superior products, consumer-relevant innovation and help ensure efficiency and resilience in supply. Technology and consumers sit at the heart of our approach to innovation. We are building digital and automated technology into our innovation centres. For example, our UK Materials Innovation Factory has the highest concentration of robots doing material chemistry in the world. It delivers more accurate data many times faster than traditional methods. We run virtual tests and scenarios to optimise products before the lab and scale up stage, bringing efficiency and cutting time to market. Our new Agile Innovation hubs, including in Shanghai, China, use real time consumer data to develop new insights, then rapidly develop prototypes to test via eCommerce in a matter of days. This provides rapid and efficient, on-trend innovation.\n\nWe are investing in real science behind our focus areas. For example, our world-leading research and partnerships on the microbiome, where we have more than 100 patents. This is unlocking significant benefits and is leading to new scientific insights and product innovations, such as biome-friendly skin care products and superior, probiotic cleaning products for the home.\n\nR&D also underpins our sustainability goals, helping to power our move away from petrochemicals, stop plastic pollution and ensuring we source ingredients in a sustainable way. Science, technology and innovation are required behind these goals, from renewable materials, to new bio-based ingredients, to next generation packaging materials.\n\nEvery Unilever product is based on an innovation crafted by our experts in collaboration with our network of partners. We translate our scientific discoveries into everyday products that improve people's health, confidence, and wellbeing, while taking care to reduce our impact on the planet. We are constantly evolving alongside our consumers' everchanging lives and tastes, and to remain at the cutting-edge of science and technology.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nOur products use a wide variety of raw and packaging materials which we source locally and internationally, and which may be subject to price volatility either directly or as a result of movements in foreign exchange rates.\n\nIn 2023, economic volatility and inflationary and cost of living pressures continued. We experienced net material inflation of around \u20ac1.8bn with lower net material inflation in the second half of the year. We more than mitigated the effect of such net material inflation through increased productivity, price and mix of our products.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nCertain of our businesses, such as ice cream, are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations in sales. However, Unilever operates globally in many different markets and product categories, and no individual element of seasonality is likely to be material to the results of the Group as a whole.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nWe have a large portfolio of patents and trademarks, and we conduct some of our operations under licences that are based on patents or trademarks owned or controlled by others. We are not dependent on any one patent or group of patents. We use all appropriate efforts to protect our brands and technology.\n\n## Competition\n\nAs a fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company, we are competing with a diverse set of competitors. Some of these operate on an international scale like ourselves, while others have a more regional or local focus. Our business model centres on building brands which consumers know, trust, like and buy in conscious preference to those of our competitors. Our brands command loyalty and affinity and deliver superior performance.\n\n## Information on market share\n\nUnless otherwise stated, market share refers to value share as opposed to volume share. The market data and competitive position classifications are taken from independent industry sources in the markets in which Unilever operates.\n\n## Iran-related required disclosure\n\nUnilever operates in Iran through a non-US subsidiary. In 2023, sales in Iran were significantly less than 0.5 per cent of Unilever's worldwide turnover. During the year, this non-US subsidiary had approximately \u20ac3,273,897 in gross revenues and less than \u20ac1,442,981 in net profits attributable to the sale of personal care and home care products to entities affiliated with the Government of Iran. The entities were the Shahrvand Group and the Najm Khavarmianeh shopping mall. Income, payroll and other taxes, duties and fees (including for utilities) were payable to the Government of Iran and affiliated entities and significantly less than 0.5 per cent of our total raw material purchases were indirectly related to the Government of Iran in connection with our operations. These two suppliers were Jovein Agriculture Industry J.S.C and Amlah Madani Iran, which supplied raw materials used in personal care and home care products, including soap, shampoo and laundry products. Our non-US subsidiary maintains bank accounts in Iran with various banks to facilitate our business in the country and make any required payments to the Government of Iran and affiliated entities. While we currently continue our activities in Iran, we are continuously evaluating such activities in light of the evolving regulatory environment.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nThe Group has interests in properties in most of the countries where there are Unilever operations. None of these interests are individually material in the context of the Group as a whole. The properties are used predominantly to house production and distribution activities and as offices. There is a mixture of leased and owned property throughout the Group. We are not aware of any environmental issues affecting the properties which would have a material impact upon the Group, and there are no material encumbrances on our properties. Any difference between the market value of properties held by the Group and the amount at which they are included in the balance sheet is not significant. We believe our existing facilities are satisfactory for our current business and we currently have no plans to construct new facilities or expand or improve our current facilities in a manner that is material to the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Additional information for US listings purpose\n\n## Cyber Security risk management and strategy\n\n## Risk management and strategy\n\nUnilever recognises the importance of cybersecurity and takes a risk-based approach to the defence and resiliency of critical assets, business operations, technology and data:\n\n- \u25a0 Unilever has an established Cyber Security Risk Management Framework aligned to industry-standard methodologies and control frameworks. We promote a company-wide culture of cybersecurity awareness and vigilance and provide regular reporting on the cybersecurity risk posture of the organisation to operational and business leaders, leadership executives and key non-executives, in order to influence and promote continuous improvement of our risk posture. The Cyber Security Risk Management approach is aligned to Unilever's risk management framework, with cybersecurity risk forming a central part of the principal risk \"Systems and Information\" on page 75;\n- \u25a0 Unilever has an established framework of Cyber Security Policies and Standards which are in alignment to cybersecurity industry frameworks. These apply to employees, third parties, contractors, data and technology across Unilever. Unilever Cyber Security Policies and Standards are subject to periodic review and modifications based on any changes in risk;\n- \u25a0 A Cyber Security team dedicated to risk assurance, and the Internal Audit team conducting independent enterprise-wide risk reassurance, assess and report on the risk posture of our key systems, services, data, and operations. The scope and frequency of the evaluations are risk-based, with output used to influence and promote continuous improvement of Unilever's resilience posture, as well as provide insights to the governance of cyber risk by the Audit Committee. The Cyber Security Assurance team is composed of internal and external expertise, including penetration testing services and a bug bounty program;\n- \u25a0 Unilever's Cyber Security function drives continuous improvement initiatives, leveraging people, processes and technology, to address emerging risks.  We also conduct resilience planning and recovery testing, aiming to bolster preparedness for cybersecurity incidents; and\n- \u25a0 Whilst Unilever's cyber risk management activities are aimed at reducing the likelihood of a material cybersecurity incident happening, they cannot guarantee a material event will not occur. Should a material event occur, Unilever has a set of established and rehearsed incident response procedures. These set out a structured, phased, tiered response for the full incident lifecycle, including coordination with other corporate functions and relevant senior leaders (see below). Our procedures are designed to detect and respond in a timely manner to abnormal cyber activity in order to minimise business impact - for example by supporting rapid recovery of services and/or operations, enabling legal and regulatory obligations, or reducing reputational impact.\n\nOur internal Cyber Security function is a global team of experienced professionals, with a multi-channeled talent pipeline, who carry various and multiple industry credentials, led by a seasoned, multi-industry experienced Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Our internal team is complemented by the expertise and specialised knowledge of a range of external partners and providers. These external providers add support across select capabilities, all in alignment with cybersecurity industry good practice frameworks.\n\nWhile we have and regularly continue to experience cyber-attacks, no known cybersecurity incidents have occurred that have, or are reasonably expected to, materially affect Unilever.\n\n## Governance\n\nCybersecurity risk is a component of Unilever's \"Systems and Information\" principal risk, reflecting the importance and priority given by the Board of Directors to this risk. The Audit Committee is central to the Board's oversight of cybersecurity risk at Unilever. Cybersecurity has continued to be an area of regular focus for the Audit Committee in 2023.\n\nManagement provides cybersecurity briefings to the Audit Committee on a regular (typically quarterly) basis, covering a range of topics including:\n\n- \u25a0 Status of ongoing cybersecurity controls and risk posture, and continuous improvement initiatives\n- \u25a0 Operational metrics, and reports and learnings, as applicable, from any cybersecurity events\n- \u25a0 Education on our cybersecurity risk management frameworks, and regulatory trends and requirements\n- \u25a0 Ongoing awareness of external threat landscape and trends.\n\nThe Audit Committee's role in cybersecurity risk oversight is further supported by our Internal Audit function which provides independent re-assurance of the effectiveness of Management's cybersecurity risk handling including internal controls systems.\n\nOwnership of cybersecurity risk at Unilever sits with the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the Chief Business Operations Officer (CBOO), who are members of Unilever's executive leadership team. They receive regular, routine cybersecurity briefings as well as ad hoc updates, as needed. The broader executive leadership team members are informed of the cybersecurity risk posture of Unilever and participate in periodic education and awareness sessions.\n\nThe Chief Enterprise Technology Officer (CETO) and the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) support the CFO and CBOO by monitoring and advising on Unilever's cybersecurity risk. Outputs from the cybersecurity risk management process, threat detection capability, vulnerability lifecycle management, and assurance and re-assurance activities drive enterprise-wide visibility and reporting of company performance on cybersecurity risk posture, influencing and prioritising continuous risk mitigation activities across the enterprise.\n\nTo make transparent and track the continuous risk mitigation activities across the enterprise, a council of senior individuals and executives meet regularly and are the membership of the Information Protection Council (IPC). This Council has expertise in cybersecurity, information technology, enterprise risk, privacy, legal, physical security, and internal audit. The IPC actively reviews enterprise-wide cybersecurity risk management prioritisation, progress and initiatives, providing key operational unlocks and risk prioritisation decisions. These senior individuals have significant experience and expertise across multiple industries, with specialty expertise in developing and executing cybersecurity strategy, driving digital transformation, managing information technology, overseeing and embedding data protection and data privacy good practices, embedment and oversight of financial controls, and operating within complex regulatory and compliance environments. The members of the IPC then drive, as appropriate to their role and responsibilities, first and second line of defence risk reduction activities, providing a whole-of-Unilever approach to the governance of cybersecurity risk, embedment of cybersecurity controls, assurance of those controls and risk posture, and independent reassurance of our cybersecurity risk posture.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe comments below in relation to United Kingdom and United States taxation are based on current United Kingdom and United States federal income tax law as applied in England and Wales and the United States respectively, and HM Revenue & Customs ('HMRC') and Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') practice (which may not be binding on HMRC or the IRS) respectively, in each case as at the latest practicable date before the date of this document.\n\n## Taxation for US persons holding shares or American Depositary Shares in PLC\n\nThe following notes are provided for guidance. US persons should consult their local tax advisers, particularly in connection with potential liability to pay US taxes on disposal, lifetime gift or bequest of their shares or American Depositary Shares ('ADSs'). A US person is a US individual citizen or resident, a corporation organised under the laws of the United States, any state or the District of Columbia, or any other legal person subject to US Federal Income Tax on its worldwide income.\n\n## United Kingdom taxation on dividends\n\nUnder United Kingdom law, income tax is not withheld from dividends paid by most United Kingdom companies, including PLC. Shareholders of PLC, whether resident in the United Kingdom or not, receive the full amount of the dividend actually declared.\n\nA non-UK resident shareholder or ADS holder holding their shares or ADSs otherwise than in connection with any trade, profession or vocation carried on through a branch, agency or permanent establishment in the UK will not generally be subject to UK tax in respect of dividends paid by PLC.\n\n## United States taxation on dividends\n\nIf you are a US person, the distribution up to the amount of PLC's earnings and profits for US Federal Income Tax purposes will be ordinary dividend income.\n\nAny portion of the distribution that exceeds PLC's earnings and profits is subject to different rules. This portion is a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in PLC's shares or ADSs, and thereafter is treated as a gain on a disposition of the shares or ADSs. PLC does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits in accordance with US Federal Income Tax accounting principles. You should therefore assume that any distribution by PLC with respect to the shares will be reported as ordinary dividend income. You should consult your own tax advisers",

        "page_content": "## Additional information for US listings purpose\n\nwith respect to the appropriate US Federal Income Tax treatment of any distribution received from us.\n\nDividends received by an individual will be taxed at a maximum rate of 15% or 20%, depending on the income level of the individual, provided the individual has held the shares or ADSs for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date, that PLC is a qualified foreign corporation and certain other conditions are satisfied. PLC is a qualified foreign corporation for this purpose. In addition, an additional tax of 3.8% will apply to dividends and other investment income received by individuals with incomes exceeding certain thresholds. The dividend is not eligible for the dividends received deduction allowable to corporations. The dividend is foreign source income for US foreign tax credit purposes.\n\nFor US Federal Income Tax purposes, the amount of any dividend paid in a non-US currency will be included in income in a US dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date the dividends are received by you or the depositary (in the case of ADSs), regardless of whether they are converted into US dollars at that time. If the non-US currency is converted into US dollars on the day they are received, you generally will not be required to recognise foreign currency gain or loss in respect of this dividend income.\n\n## UK taxation on capital gains\n\nUnder United Kingdom law, when you dispose of shares or ADSs you may be liable to pay United Kingdom tax in respect of any gain accruing on the disposal.\n\nHowever, if you are either:\n\n- \u25a0 an individual who is not resident in the United Kingdom for the year in question; or\n- \u25a0 a company which is not resident in the United Kingdom when the gain accrues\n\nyou will generally not be liable to United Kingdom tax on any gains made on disposal of your shares or ADSs.\n\nThere are exceptions to this general rule, two of which are: if the shares or ADSs are held in connection with a trade or business which is conducted in the United Kingdom through a branch, agency or permanent establishment; or if the shares or ADSs are held by an individual who becomes resident in the UK having left the UK for a period of non-residence of five years or less and who was resident for at least four of the seven tax years prior to leaving the UK. In such cases, you may be liable to United Kingdom tax in respect of the disposal of shares or ADSs.\n\n## United States taxation on capital gains\n\nIf you are a US person generally you will recognise capital gain or loss for US Federal Income Tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realised on the sale and your adjusted tax basis in the shares or ADSs, in each case as determined in US dollars. You should consult your own tax advisers about how to determine the US dollar value of any foreign currency received as proceeds on the sale of shares or ADSs and the treatment of any foreign currency gain or loss upon conversion of the foreign currency into US dollars. The capital gain or loss recognised on the sale will be long-term capital gain or loss if your holding period in the shares or ADSs exceeds one year. Non-corporate US persons are subject to tax on long-term capital gain at reduced rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n\n## UK inheritance tax\n\nUnder the current estate and gift tax convention between the United States and the United Kingdom, shares or ADSs (regardless of whether they are situated in the United Kingdom for inheritance tax purposes) held by an individual shareholder who is:\n\n- \u25a0 domiciled for the purposes of the convention in the United States; and\n- \u25a0 not for the purposes of the convention a national of the United Kingdom\n\nwill generally not be subject to United Kingdom inheritance tax:\n\n- \u25a0 on the individual's death; or\n- \u25a0 on a gift of the shares during the individual's lifetime.\n\nWhere shares or ADSs are held on trust, they will generally not be subject to United Kingdom inheritance tax where the settlor at the time of the settlement:\n\n- \u25a0 was domiciled for the purposes of the convention in the United States; and\n- \u25a0 was not for the purposes of the convention a national of the United Kingdom.\n\nAn exception is if the shares or ADSs are part of the business property of a permanent establishment of the shareholder in the United Kingdom\n\nor, in the case of a shareholder who performs independent personal services, pertain to a fixed base situated in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhere shares or ADSs are subject to United Kingdom inheritance tax and United States federal gift or federal estate tax, the amount of the tax paid in one jurisdiction can generally be credited against the tax due in the other jurisdiction.\n\nWhere a United Kingdom inheritance tax liability is prima facie not payable by virtue of the convention, that tax can become payable if any applicable federal gift or federal estate tax on the shares or ADSs in the United States is not paid.\n\nWhere shares are dealt with through a clearing system or in the form of ADSs, the situs of the shares may not be determinative of the situs of the interests held by holders through such system or of such ADSs for United Kingdom inheritance tax purposes. Where shares are dealt with through Euroclear Nederland, there are arguments that the interests of participants in Euroclear Nederland will be situated outside the United Kingdom for the purposes of United Kingdom inheritance tax so long as Euroclear Nederland maintains the book-entry register of such participants' interests outside the United Kingdom, although HMRC may not accept this analysis. Similarly, there are arguments that ADSs registered on a register outside the United Kingdom will be situated outside the United Kingdom for the purposes of United Kingdom inheritance tax, although again HMRC may not accept this analysis. Shareholders to whom this may be relevant should consult an appropriate professional adviser.\n\nIf the ADSs or the shares dealt with through Euroclear Nederland or both are not situated in the United Kingdom, a gift of such ADSs or such shares by, or the death of, an individual holder of such assets who is neither domiciled nor deemed to be domiciled (under certain rules relating to long residence or previous domicile) in the United Kingdom will not generally give rise to a liability to United Kingdom inheritance tax regardless of whether the estate and gift tax convention between the United States and the United Kingdom applies. Special rules may also apply to such ADSs or such shares dealt with through Euroclear Nederland which are held on trust.\n\n## UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax\n\nThe statements in this section are intended as a general guide to the current United Kingdom stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax ('SDRT') position. Special rules apply to certain transactions such as transfers of the shares to a company connected with the transferor and those rules are not described below. Investors should also note that certain categories of person are not liable to stamp duty or SDRT and others may be liable at a higher rate or may, although not primarily liable for tax, be required to notify and account for SDRT under the Stamp Duty Reserve Tax Regulations 1986.\n\n## Issue of shares\n\nSubject to the points noted below in respect of shares issued to clearance services (such as Euroclear Nederland) or which are issued into a depositary receipt system where the shares are to be held in ADS form, no stamp duty or SDRT will arise on the issue of shares in registered form by PLC.\n\n## Transfer of shares\n\nExcept in relation to clearance services and depositary receipt systems (to which special rules outlined below apply), stamp duty at the rate of 0.5 per cent (rounded up to the next multiple of \u00a35) of the amount or value of the consideration given will generally be payable on an instrument transferring PLC shares. A charge to SDRT will also generally arise on an unconditional agreement to transfer PLC shares (at the rate of 0.5 per cent of the amount or value of the consideration payable). However, if within six years of the date of the agreement becoming unconditional, an instrument of transfer is executed pursuant to the agreement, and stamp duty is paid on that instrument, any SDRT already paid will be refunded (generally, but not necessarily, with interest) provided that a claim for repayment is made, and any outstanding liability to SDRT will be cancelled. The liability to pay stamp duty or SDRT is generally satisfied by the purchaser or transferee.\n\n## Shares held through clearance services including Euroclear Nederland\n\nSpecial rules apply where shares are issued or transferred to, or to a nominee or agent for, a person providing a clearance service. In such circumstances, SDRT or stamp duty may be charged at a rate of 1.5 per cent, with subsequent transfers within the clearance service then being free from SDRT and stamp duty (except in relation to clearance service",

This EU case law will continue to be recognised and followed pursuant to the provisions of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the 'EUWA').\n\nHMRC's published view is that the 1.5 per cent. SDRT or stamp duty charge continues to apply to other transfers of shares into a clearance service, although this has been disputed. In view of the continuing uncertainty, specific professional advice should be sought before incurring a 1.5 per cent stamp duty or SDRT charge in any circumstances. Any liability for stamp duty or SDRT in respect of a transfer of shares into a clearance service, or in respect of a transfer of shares within such a service, which does arise will strictly be accountable by the clearance service or its nominee but may, in practice, be payable by the relevant participant in the clearance service.\n\n## Shares held in ADS form\n\nOn the basis of EU case law referred to above and the EUWA, there should be no stamp duty or SDRT on an issuance of shares into a depositary receipt system where such transfer is an integral part of the raising of capital by the company concerned. A transfer of shares into a depositary receipt system may be subject to SDRT or stamp duty may be charged at a rate of 1.5 per cent, with subsequent transfers of depositary receipts then being free from SDRT.\n\nAny liability for stamp duty or SDRT in respect of a transfer of shares into a depositary receipt system which does arise will strictly be accountable by the depositary receipt system operator or its nominee but may, in practice, be payable by the relevant holder of the depositary receipts.\n\nAn issue of ADSs by Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas as depositary in respect of the ADSs will not be subject to stamp duty or SDRT. An agreement for the transfer of ADSs will not be subject to SDRT but a charge to stamp duty will technically arise on the transfer of ADSs if it is executed in the UK or relates to any property situated, or to any matter or thing done or to be done, in the UK. However, the only sanction for failing to pay such stamp duty is that the instrument of transfer cannot be produced as evidence in a UK court. Therefore, no UK stamp duty should in practice be payable on the acquisition or transfer of existing ADSs or transfer of beneficial ownership of ADSs.\n\n## US backup withholding and information reporting\n\nPayments of dividends and other proceeds with respect to ordinary shares or ADSs by a US (or US connected) paying agent or a US (or US connected) intermediary will be reported to you and to the IRS as may be required under applicable regulations. Backup withholding may apply to these payments if you fail to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or fail to comply with applicable certification requirements. Some holders are not subject to backup withholding. You should consult your tax adviser as to your qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption.\n\n## Disclosure requirements for US individual holders\n\nUS individuals that hold certain specified non-US financial assets, including stock in a non-US corporation, with values in excess of certain thresholds are required to file Form 8938 with their US Federal Income Tax return. Such Form requires disclosure of information concerning such non-US assets, including the value of the assets. Failure to file the Form when required may subject you to penalties. An exemption from reporting applies to non-US assets held through a US financial institution generally including a non-US branch or subsidiary of a US institution and a US branch of a non-US institution. Investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisers regarding the possible application of this disclosure requirement to their investment in the shares or ADSs.\n\n## Description of securities other than equity securities\n\nDeutsche Bank serves as the depositary (Depositary) for PLC's American Depositary Receipt Programme.\n\n## Depositary fees and charges for PLC\n\nUnder the terms of the Deposit Agreement for the PLC American Depositary Shares (ADSs), an ADS holder may have to pay the following service fees to the depositary bank:\n\n- \u25a0 Issuance of ADSs: up to US 5\u00a2 per ADS issued.\n- \u25a0 Cancellation of ADSs: up to US 5\u00a2 per ADS cancelled.\n- \u25a0 Processing of dividend and other cash distributions not made pursuant to a cancellation or withdrawal: up to US 5\u00a2 per ADS held.\n\nAn ADS holder will also be responsible for paying certain fees and expenses incurred by the depositary bank and certain taxes and governmental charges such as:\n\n- \u25a0 fees for the transfer and registration of shares charged by the registrar and transfer agent for the shares in the United Kingdom (i.e. upon deposit and withdrawal of shares);\n- \u25a0 expenses incurred for converting foreign currency into US dollars;\n- \u25a0 expenses for cable, telex and fax transmissions and for delivery of securities;\n- \u25a0 taxes and duties upon the transfer of securities (i.e. when shares are deposited or withdrawn from deposit);\n- \u25a0 fees and expenses incurred in connection with the delivery or servicing of shares on deposit; and\n- \u25a0 fees incurred in connection with the distribution of dividends.\n\nDepositary fees payable upon the issuance and cancellation of ADSs are typically paid to the depositary bank by the brokers (on behalf of their clients) receiving the newly issued ADSs from the depositary bank and by the brokers (on behalf of their clients) delivering the ADSs to the depositary bank for cancellation. The brokers in turn charge these transaction fees to their clients.\n\nNote that the fees and charges an investor may be required to pay may vary over time and may be changed by us and by the depositary bank. Notice of any changes will be given to investors.\n\n## Depositary payments - fiscal year 2023\n\nDeutsche Bank has been the depositary bank for its American Depositary Receipt Programme since 1 July 2014. Under the terms of the Deposit Agreement, PLC is entitled to certain reimbursements, including processing of cash distributions, reimbursement of listing fees (NYSE), reimbursement of settlement infrastructure fees (including DTC feeds), reimbursement of proxy process expenses (printing, postage and distribution), dividend fees and program-related expenses (that include expenses incurred from the requirements of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002). In relation to 2023, PLC received $5,274,810 from Deutsche Bank.\n\n## Defaults, dividend arrearages and delinquencies\n\n## Defaults Programme\n\nThere has been no material default in the payment of principal, interest, a sinking or purchase fund instalment or any other material default relating to indebtedness of the Group.\n\n## Dividend arrearages and delinquencies\n\nThere have been no arrears in payment of dividends on, and material delinquency with respect to, any class of preferred stock of any significant subsidiary of the Group.\n\n## Articles of association\n\n## Lapse of distributions\n\nAny PLC dividend unclaimed after 12 years from the date of the declaration of the dividend by PLC reverts to PLC. Any unclaimed dividends may be invested or otherwise applied for the benefit of PLC while they are claimed. PLC may also cease to send any cheque for any dividend on any shares normally paid in that manner if the cheques in respect of at least two consecutive dividends have been returned to PLC or remain uncashed.\n\nUnilever N.V., the former parent company of the Unilever Group alongside PLC, was merged in to PLC and dissolved in November 2020 (Unification). The time periods for the right to claim cash dividends or the proceeds of share distributions declared by Unilever N.V. before Unification will remain at 5 and 20 years, respectively, after the first day the dividend or share distribution was obtainable from Unilever N.V. Any such unclaimed amounts will revert to Unilever PLC after the expiry of these time periods.\n\n## Redemption provisions and capital call\n\nOutstanding PLC ordinary shares cannot be redeemed. PLC may make capital calls on money unpaid on shares and not payable on a fixed date. PLC has only fully paid shares in issue.",

Management believes that the COSO framework (2013) is a suitable framework for its evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting because it is free from bias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative measurements of internal controls, is sufficiently complete so that those relevant factors that would alter a conclusion about the effectiveness of internal controls are not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting;\n- \u25a0 Management has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2023, and has concluded that such internal control over financial reporting is effective. Management's assessment and conclusion excludes Zywie Ventures Private Limited ('OZiva') and Yasso Holdings, Inc., as they were acquired on 10 January 2023 and 1 August 2023, respectively. These entities are included in our 2023 consolidated financial statements, and together they constituted 1.09% of our total assets as at 31 December 2023 (of which 92% represented goodwill and intangible assets acquired) and 0.14% of total turnover for the year ended 31 December 2023; and\n- \u25a0 KPMG LLP, who have audited the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2023, have also audited the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2023 and have issued an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Required majorities\n\nResolutions are usually adopted at the Company's General Meetings by an absolute majority of votes cast, unless there are other requirements under the applicable laws or the Company's Articles. For example, there are special requirements for resolutions relating to the alteration of the Articles of Association and the liquidation of the Company. A proposal to alter the Articles of the Company can be made either by the Company's Board or by requisition of shareholders in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006. Unless expressly specified to the contrary in the Company's Articles, the Company's Articles may be amended by a special resolution. The Company's Articles can be found on our website.",

(UNUS).\n\nIn relation to the US Shelf registration, US$11.2 billion of Notes were outstanding at 31 December 2023 (2022: US$10.75 billion; 2021: US$12.1 billion) with coupons ranging from 0.626% to 5.900%. These Notes are repayable between 7 March 2024 and 12 August 2051.\n\nAll debt securities issued by UCC are senior, unsecured, and unsubordinated and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by PLC and UNUS.\n\nUCC and UNUS are 100% subsidiaries of Unilever PLC and are consolidated in the financial statements of the Unilever Group. In addition, there are no material assets in the guarantor entities apart from intercompany investments and balances. Therefore, as allowed under Rule 13-01 of regulation S-X, we have excluded the summarised information for each issuer and guarantor.\n\nThe guarantees provide that, in case of the failure of the relevant issuer to punctually make payment of any principal, premium or interest, each guarantor agrees to ensure such payment is made when due whether at the stated maturity or by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise. The guarantees also provide that the Trustee shall be paid any and all amounts due to it under the guarantee upon which the debt securities are endorsed.",

All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Words such as 'will', 'aim', 'expects', 'anticipates', 'intends', 'looks', 'believes', 'vision', 'ambition', 'target', 'goal', 'plan', 'potential', 'work towards', 'may', 'milestone', 'objectives', 'outlook', 'probably', 'project', 'risk', 'seek', 'continue', 'projected', 'estimate', 'achieve' or the negative of these terms, and other similar expressions of future performance or results and their negatives, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements also include, but are not limited to, statements and information regarding the Group's emissions reduction targets and other climate change related matters (including actions, potential impacts and risks associated therewith). Forward-looking statements can be made in writing but also may be made verbally by directors, officers and employees of the Group (including during management presentations) in connection with this document. These forward-looking statements are based upon current expectations and assumptions regarding anticipated developments and other factors affecting the Group. They are not historical facts, nor are they guarantees of future performance or outcomes. All forward-looking statements contained in this document are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\n\nBecause these forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, a number of which may be beyond the Group's control, there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Among other risks and uncertainties, the material or principal factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this document are: Unilever's global brands not meeting consumer preferences; Unilever's ability to innovate and remain competitive; Unilever's investment choices in its portfolio management; the effect of climate change on Unilever's business; Unilever's ability to find sustainable solutions to its plastic packaging; significant changes or deterioration in customer relationships; the recruitment and retention of talented employees; disruptions in Unilever's supply chain and distribution; increases or volatility in the cost of raw materials and commodities; the production of safe and high quality products; secure and reliable IT infrastructure; execution of acquisitions, divestitures and business transformation projects; economic, social and political risks and natural disasters; financial risks; failure to meet high and ethical standards; and managing regulatory, tax and legal matters. Also see \"Our Principal Risks\" on pages 70-78 for additional risks and further discussion.\n\nThe forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future performance, taking into account all information currently available to us. Forward-looking statements are not predictions of future events. These beliefs, assumptions, and expectations can change as a result of many possible events or factors, not all of which are known to us. If a change occurs, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may vary materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements.\n\nThe forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this document. Except as required by any applicable law or regulation, the Group expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in the Group's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. New risks and uncertainties arise over time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\n\nThis document also contains data on the Group's Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Some of this data is based on estimates, assumptions and uncertainties. Scope 1 and 2 emissions data relates to emissions from the Group's own activities and supplied heat, power and cooling and is generally easier for the Group to gather than Scope 3 emissions data. Scope 3 emissions relate to other organisations' emissions and is therefore subject to a range of additional uncertainties, including that: data used to model lifecycle footprints is typically industry-standard data or estimates rather than relating to individual suppliers; and lifecycle models such as the Group's cover many but not all products and markets. In addition, international standards and protocols relating to Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions calculations and categorisations also continue to evolve, as do accepted norms regarding terminology such as carbon neutral and net zero which may affect the emissions data the Group reports. As Scope 3 emissions data improves, shifting over time from generic modelled data to more specific data, the data reported in this document is likely to evolve.\n\nThroughout this report, we include non-GAAP financial measures to explain the performance of our business, including underlying sales growth, underlying volume growth, underlying price growth, not-underlying items, underlying operating profit, underlying operating margin, underlying earnings per share, underlying effective tax rate, constant underlying earnings per share, free cash flow, cash conversion, underlying return on assets, net debt and underlying return on invested capital.  Such non-GAAP financial measures are defined in \"Additional financial disclosures\" and a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included within \"Additional financial disclosures.\"  See pages 59-64.\n\nFurther details of potential risks and uncertainties affecting the Group are described in the Group's filings with the London Stock Exchange, Euronext Amsterdam and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Annual Report on Form 20-F 2023.\n\nThis document is not prepared in accordance with US GAAP and should not therefore be relied upon by readers as such.
